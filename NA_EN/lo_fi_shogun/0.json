That's against the rules. It doesn't matter if you've seen worse, it's still against the rules. If you see people being worse, report them and most of the time they should get punished.\nRiot doesn't permaban for chat unless you've had multiple warnings in the past. They'll tell you that any toxicity will lead to a perma, and you chose to be toxic. \n\nI'm sorry your money is gone, and you can try to send in a ticket, but I wouldn't get my hopes up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-05-15T23:42:49.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I have seen people type way worse things and not get banned. \n\nA: you cant tell if they got a chat restriction\n\nB: Getting banned requires repeated restrictions\n\nC: Your idea of \"worse\" is entirely arbitrary\n\nD: You ignored previous warnings that you would be banned permanently on the next infraction\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[]}]}
