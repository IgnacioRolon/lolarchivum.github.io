First of all, thanks for reading.\n\nI was wondering, are the in-game chat logs saved to your computer anywhere, like in a temp folder? Or, if not, are there are settings I can change, manually or otherwise, or legal third-party programs I could use? My reasoning behind this: I want to learn Spanish. Basically, after reading some tips online, I thought a good first goal would be, \"Become conversational in the games I play\". I thought League might be a good choice, since I live in the same state that the server for Latin America North is hosted. My plan of attack was, play on LAN, try to learn from context. Being able to access the chat logs from in-game would make it easier to \"study\" how to use the language more casually than what a textbook would teach you.\n\nIf there is absolutely no way for me, a casual player (and not a Riot team member), to access the logs: that sucks, but oh well.\n\nThanks for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-27T18:30:01.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our [privacy page ](http://privacy.riotgames.com/en_US/stage2)offers account info including the last 3 months of chat logs, but requires a small fee for processing.
