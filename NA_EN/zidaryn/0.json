As a long time {{champion:13}} player I was particularly interested in seeing what the update would do to him. At first reading the patch notes I was skeptical due to some of the power changes and changes on some abilities (ie: the decrease in his mana ratios and increase in ap ratios). \r\n    After playing a bot game and a pvp game with him here are some of my thoughts on what I liked, noticed, and what could be better.\r\n\r\n* I like the range and skill shot of Q. Gives him poke and a lot more range.\r\n* His passive feels like {{champion:1}}&#039;s passive in the way that it goes off how many times you&#039;ve cast your spells. \r\n* Shooting off Q&#039;s when not in combat will become a thing so as to get stacks on your passive and also to build your tear.\r\n* Definitely feeling Riots &quot;Windows of opportunity&quot; on {{champion:13}}. Especially since the old &quot;cast spells to lower cd on spells&quot; thing is now only on when his passive is active. As well as that mini {{item:3040}} active on his passive. Also feel it in his ult.\r\n* The new E can be just as underwhelming as old E. Though late game if you catch your enemy in a creep wave it can chunk for some surprising damage.\r\n* Would like an increased range on E. Would make using it to punish opponents for hiding in their minions a lot more of a thing. In the games I&#039;ve had, the short range of the ability means that it mostly becomes a non thing due to opponents either running away or attacking you for almost free, since you&#039;re so close.\r\n\r\nWell thanks for reading, if you did read all of it ;), and let me know what you think of new {{champion:13}} and if you agree with my comments.","replies":[{"poster":"Leaf of the lake","date":"2015-04-30T10:21:12.102+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Range on E is definitely a pain point. Range on Q, too, for that matter. For a colliding linear skillshot with that much delay before the cast, I expect a bit more range (maybe like... 100 more). I don't feel like the dichotomy of punishing foes hiding in minions with E verses hitting them with Q when they're away from minions is really relevant, since you can only level one ability at a time, and whichever you don't level is going to be incredibly weak (or you level both and they're both weak). I feel you get more mileage out of trying to just poke with E when they go to last hit, because his Q is just so underwhelming even *with* points in it. \n\nI think probably the most painful thing for new ryze is having to stack the passive before the engage, which basically says \"Oh, did you just spawn and they're in your base? Good luck doing anything.\" If you're traveling to a fight in the jungle or something, it's easy to get up a couple stacks of his passive before going in, but the on-spawn situation just sucks so much, knowing that you have to do something fast, but the fastest you'll be able to do anything in is... about 6 seconds. I think if his ult acted as a mini-reset (always applies his reset passive on use - once), it would go a long way to making ryze feel like ryze again, possibly accompanied with an increase in ult CD. That would bring back the fast combos without having the huge setup time (as long as ryze is willing to burn his ult), but still with clear windows of vulnerability. Having your \"window of vulnerability\" be \"right when you spawn\" feels really bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TigerBoiii","date":"2015-04-30T15:30:41.224+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"New Ryze makes me cringe. Hard.\n\nI was under the impression that this was going to be a nerf to his ez mode \"click and win\" gameplay but an overall buff if you're good with the champion..sorely mistaken. Ryze is in a far worse place than prior to the nerf, and IMHO ya'll fucked up when you messed with his ratios. Now he has both subpar AP ratios AND almost unnoticable mana ratios.\n\nI get the concept of \"windows of opportunity\" and I generally agree with that philosophy, it was just very poorly executed with this change. After building tear and a Catalyst, I was awarded with about 45 extra damage. I also decided to run mana regen in my masteries given the nerf to his regen rate, and even around level 14-15 it would cost me about half my mana before I could pop my passive and actually be able to trade effectively. And the \"5\" number seems a bit random. Generally, in teamfights, by the time I had my passive up all my skills were on cooldown and I ended up getting maybe 2 spells off before it wore.\n\nYou can do better riot. Stop half assing things like these. IF you're gonna rework a champ, REWORK him. This is weaksauce and in current state, wipes Ryze out of consideration as a viable caster.\n\nHighlight of the update for the champion was the changes to his missile speed. Looks nice.","replies":[{"poster":"IForgot2buyBoots","date":"2015-04-30T20:08:01.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His strongest weapon- Q- is now a skill shot, meaning it's useless to hit an enemy standing exactly where' they're supposed to be: behind lane minions.

There's just too many situational factors contributing to it's damage.\n\nI also feel that his passive duration and ult duration are really bad. Upping the duration of both at 7-8seconds at max ult rank would make them a lot easier to use, since currently, especially early on, due to the short duration and need for tight positioning, you really don't have a lot of time to excecute your combo when you go in for it.\n\nSo yeah, those are my two complaints, \n\ntl;dr: his E still feels weak unless you drop all his other power to go for it (I could see myself maxing E first if Q didn't need to be leveled first for the scaling), because of weak scaling and short ranges (especially the bounce range). And his passive&Ult last so short they're hard to utilize properly.","replies":[{"poster":"TigerBoiii","date":"2015-04-30T15:56:01.196+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you hit the nail on the head. His window of opportunity is very small and makes it hard to work with in most realistic situations, especially teamfights. Now you not only have to wait for a decent opportunity to enter the fight due to range constraints, if your passive doesn't happen to be up by the time fighting starts your contribution is severely limited and is often negligible as many teamfights will be over by the time you have your passive ready. \n\nAlso, I really do think the CDR should remain in his Q. And they should either scrap the idea of mana scalings and boost his AP ratio or actually make his mana scalings worth noting because as of now, it's more of a tease than an actual damage boost.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jjookkeerr","date":"2015-04-30T11:48:59.880+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"new ryze sucks","replies":[]},{"poster":"BoootyButtCheeks","date":"2015-04-30T12:21:21.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think ryze is in a pretty good spot right now, not to overwhelming and not to useless.

He has bad matchups vs long-ranged mid laners, as always, but that should be the case. He is no longer as effective as a top laner- Yay. However, he has a stronger potential for damage and survivability in teamfights than before, which is exactly what I would have hoped for in his rework.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TigerBoiii","date":"2015-04-30T21:46:25.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After giving him another try and getting waaaaay too fed, I got to really test out his new kit and I'm starting to see the issue.\n\nThe changes to Q took away his main form of damage. What's that mean?  His laning phase is even worse than it was ( although easier to farm) and in teamfights he has 0 ways of attacking an ADC until the rest of the team is dead. I was 11/2 at about 13 minutes and was still unable to harm their bottom lane due to blitz running in front of all my Q's.  Not that that's inherently terrible for the game, it provides a nice room for counterplay, but I mainly just find it difficult to finish any target off, even while running move speed quints/masteries. He can chunk well but that targetted Q right on the edge of the range was often the difference between a secured kill and simply forcing someone out of lane. That huge part of his kit is gona, and I really don't think he was compensated well for it.\n\nIn terms of literal power, he has the potential to be stronger than he was, but he just doesn't seem as useful. Still a strong champion and I think a few tweaks will push him right into the competitive scene.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThunderChicken5","date":"2015-04-30T18:08:06.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm starting to think that Ryze jungle could be a thing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tmoose","date":"2015-04-30T14:54:02.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My view is, I was mystery skinned pirate ryze ages ago so I'm excited to play him again :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-04-30T15:06:11.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"New Ryze feels really smooth and fun.
