To unlock it, you just need the 2 mastery tokens and then one of the following:\n\n* Champ Shard\n* Champ Permanent\n* 500 Blue Essence\n\nHowever, the Champ Permanent is an actual piece of content in your Hextech Loot.

There is no such thing as \"Champ permanent\" Remove that from unlocks because it makes 0 sense. Should only be with essence or the shard. There is no such thing as champ permanent anywhere, once you unlock using a shard it's called \"Unlocking it permanently\" So if you have the champion, that's the requirement, but that is not the case.

Champion mastery was supposed to be a way to show off your mastery with a champion- instead it's being awarded to those who are willing to buy blue essence AND master a champion.

I have loads of s ratings since i only main 3 champs. \n\n( When I say \"this info wasn't in the patch notes\", I mean the fact that you have to have a permanent champion shard and you cant buy them yet- that its statistically absurd to happen to own a permanent champion shard for a champion you happen to have mastery with\n\nI mean, what's next?
