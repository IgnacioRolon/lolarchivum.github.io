This is just one way we're experimenting with new ways of serving up content in the client.  We're really interested to see how players interact with the in-client Worlds Hub, since it's the first time we've done something like this, and we're hoping to learn some things that will inform ways of serving up content in the future (be it for esports or other types of experiences).","replies":[]}]}]}
