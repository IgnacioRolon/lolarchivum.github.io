He doesn't run cdr runes, leaving him at 25% whenever he doesn't have blue. He builds Morellos every game regardless of matchup even when Athenes would give him much needed extra mana regen and MR. He builds Zhonyas every game, even when there's no real use for one. He tends to leave Liandries until after Deathcap which is highly inefficient given how high Vel's base damages are. He runs AP quints instead of MS quints even though that 15 AP makes almost no difference and the extra 4.5% MS makes an enormous difference. His full build doesn't even include a void staff which is the most bizarre choice of all. He's a very good Vel'koz player; his gameplay is clear evidence of that. But his item/rune/mastery setups are nowhere near optimal and he would experience even more success if he tuned those up.","replies":[{"poster":"Beacon 0F Light","date":"2015-09-16T16:38:16.137+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think stuff like the Zhonyas and \"Pen and Teller\" is for the sake of making his videos and streams entertaining.
