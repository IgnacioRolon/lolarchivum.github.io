Her tanky build creates more problems- how do you tweak her so she doesnt become useless in the jungle, without allowing her to go crazy in teamfights?\n\nIt's actually the other way around, she has low utillity, low aoe and low scaleing damage, so the problem is to get her relevant in teamfights without makeing her early jungle crazy.\nRight now, her early jungle is good, her teamfights utterly suck.\nBefor, her early was insane and teamfights were ok.\n\nI think that she has one huge design flaw right now: Alot of her power is focused on the spiderform AAs+spiderlings, but she has very little tools to make use of it. Her spider-Q places her to far from the target and has a to long animation. If the target moves away from you, you can't even land a single AA after Q, same with E.\nShe has no slow and no MS-buff either, so it's nearly imppossible to stay in AA range and use the potential dps.\nAt the same time, her only tool for tankiness is tied to melee AAs aswell, which means she is way to squishy in most fights as she simply does not have acces to her potential selfheal.\n\nAnother thing i find quite od is her Q.\nWhy does the flat damage scale with rank, but the %stays the same from rank 1 on If her main problem was that her single target burst with maxed Q was way to powerfull in the early?\nIf instead the %damage would get increased with rank, her early damage wouldn't escalate as quickly since her targets early on don't have a big HP pool, and her damage would scale better into the late.","replies":[{"poster":"Hard4Hamsters","date":"2015-07-06T15:58:27.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like this idea. Her Q's power is really strong, but the rest of her kit doesn't help her past the early game. Shifting some power away from Q and into other aspects of her kit is likely to make her a better champion who doesn't solely rely on dominating the early game. \n\nI've also really noticed the lackluster effect of her Spider E as a gapcloser. The long animation and the time it takes for you to land completely before you can move/attack, makes it very weak. You usually can't get an attack off besides maybe your Q if it is off CD, but odds are that you cannot get meaningful damage off after you E onto an enemy (sorta making the boost to your spider autos they added a little useless).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-07-06T10:21:57.641+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"her main problem though is that she has incrdible strong melee-dps, but no way to actually consistently cling to a target...making most of her power void and her skillset feeling lackluster at best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-07-06T10:53:02.440+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shame he built her as tank.\nI'm not sure if you could build her with more damage yet still being as usefull for the team.\n\nThat kinda saddens me.","replies":[{"poster":"The Loveless","date":"2015-07-06T16:54:50.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed.

Now you can go on to say that winrates do not mean much, but I think this is at least significant as every Challenger/Master player I have seen play Elise maxes E 2nd and there is evidence that this is the better way to go on Elise overall. It kind of shows that most people don't know how to play Elise right now down to a core aspect of building her up (part of this is probably due to her unpopularity right now). When you max W second you are weakening your teamfighting ability even more as the only CC that you have is now a 1 second linear skill shot stun, which is less than Taric's stun I might add. Your E's duration doubles if you level it, making it much more potent during the mid-game teamfights, being able to catch a mispositioned target much more effectively or peel for your carries. \n\nI do agree with what Stonewall says (even though he does max W second). She can only set her team up to win, which was of much greater importance in Season 3 and 4, when she was strong. Her ability to do that now is mitigated as Junglers have a much larger role in the game and are more core to the team in the mid and lategame. I do agree that her full combo is clunky and very long, which is why I think E should reset her R CD so she can jump on an opponent immediately in her spiderform after she stuns the enemy, because sometimes your stun is all you want from your human form to keep an opponent from escaping, but then you are forced to sit there and Q W auto them and hope you do enough damage to execute them before the stun expires as you wait the 4 seconds for your R to reset. \n\nHaving her E reset her R is very nice as it would probably prevent her from being as much of a stun bot because you could E, R immediately to attack the enemy in spiderform, run away or give chase a little bit, use R to get to human form, Launch E and repeat the process, instead of having to Q W and auto them in human form while you wait for R again. The problem now is that this can take a really long time in a team fight considering you have to wait for your R CD's in both forms which means you can and should only switch to spiderform in a teamfight if you think you can get a kill off of it, as otherwise you are hindering your ability to launch another E in human form and possibly follow up on that one if there is a better chance of getting that kill. \n\nThat's some things that I've thought about. I find it incredibly odd that Elise is the only champion with a linear skill shot CC that does not do damage. If this is to continue, I think there should be more utility added to E to make it a better skill. Right now, it is better than W in my opinion, especially after the buff to the Spider E, but it is still an ability with absolutely no damage or extra utility aspect to it, so her Q and spider autos are really overloaded to compensate, and I think this is a big problem of Elise right now. She has 1 REALLY strong skill (technically 2) and then everything else is just kinda meh by comparison. I feel like there needs to be a shift in her skills' strengths to make Q less powerful early, and her other skills more powerful later. Peace.","replies":[{"poster":"The Loveless","date":"2015-07-06T16:52:02.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why not max w first? It does more damage in human form, has great ap scaling, and is an effective poke for when you play Elise in lane. Also the mana cost doesn't sky rocket. Q will always do the same amount of %hp damage, and the base damage is not that great when ranking up. \n\nI've dropped w on enemy heroes perfectly amongst their minions, and w is also great for clearing waves.","replies":[{"poster":"Hard4Hamsters","date":"2015-07-06T17:57:06.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I was mostly referring to Jungle Elise and the maxing of Q first is quite universal in the jungle as it increases the base damages of effectively 2 skills on half the CD of W. The maxing of W second really doesn't help Elise if she isn't going for a full AP build as the scaling is pretty good in human form, but the base damage is lackluster if you have no AP behind it when hitting more durable targets; in addition, it does not lower the CD of the skill if you level it so it is an unreliable harass that can easily be absorbed by a tank on the enemy team on a 12 second CD versus leveling E in which the CD is lowered AND the duration is increased on the stun AND Rappel gives increasing bonus damage now on your spider autos. If you are going for a high AP build on Elise, maxing W might have some merit, but otherwise E will be a better choice, and Elise's Tankier build is more effective in most situations. \n\nHowever, I will say that lane Elise may have better reason to max W immediately and then choose between Q and E to max second, as the AP scaling on the skill is better and it can help her waveclear very effectively; Q's %HP damage is constant as well so it will be somewhat effective even if you don't level it. However, lane Elise is still not that effective and has an abysmally low winrate. In addition, W is not a guaranteed harass as Q would be as it is targeted. W max would help you in lane as it would give you much better waveclear and due to the AS buff, better sustain in lane, but as stated, lane Elise is exceptionally weak right now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shrek Luigi","date":"2015-07-06T21:50:29.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I stopped watching at 'Elise is a Jungle Irelia'\n\nIrelia is a perfectly good jungler >_>;\n\nElise's flaws should definitely be addressed but these comparisons are super pointless and speak to a larger issue of champs having to amalgamate to another one's kit in order to be relevant.
