We were winning. Then Janna decided to stop trying to win. Same with her premade friends. They started doing stupid things. 50 minutes later, we lost because they didn't feel like winning or trying. Janna builds trinity, takes minions and roams around enemy jungle doing nothing, Le Blanc purposely dying to TF, our lee being toxic and doing nothing contibutive, just afk farming while talking shit. Me and GP tried to win, but couldn't.\n\nI think I'm only going to play with a 5 premade from now on. I'm tired of running into crap like this in solo que... God damn it I'm so unmotivated to keep playing if every game I gotta run into shit like this.","replies":[]}
