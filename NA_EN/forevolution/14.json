You're gonna downvote anyways.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"I&#039;ve played all 5 roles and the least enjoyable is top lane. Jesus fuck it&#039;s so boring. Farm fest and sometimes wet noodle slap fight. God forbid you gotta fight someone that 100-0 you then zone you out for all your minions the entire time while spamming laugh. You&#039;re better off ganking mid or tp&#039;ing bot, or stealing their jungle because you won&#039;t be able to cs anymore without getting killed. Also, it sucks you gotta play Shen every game or else you suck. Atleast that&#039;s what it feels like with the utmost importance of teleport. That being said if you take a top laner with no CC, you&#039;re gonna get shit on by your team since you couldn&#039;t stop the enemies teleport. This isn&#039;t much of a top lane problem anymore cause mid laners are now taking teleport but most mid laners have CC.","replies":[]}
