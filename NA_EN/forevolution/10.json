Because I&#039;m just thinking of plans to go about this and from what I come up with, the best solution would be to cut 1000 calories a day through eating only 1500 calories (possibly less) and exercising to burn 500 calories so that I end up reducing my calories to around 1000 per day. If I lose the 1000 everyday for 7 days in a row, I will lose 2.5 lbs a week (1 lbs = 3500 calories) and if I do that for a month straight, I could lose 10 lbs a month, reaching my goal in 6 months for 60 lbs.\r\n\r\nI want to take this a step further though. What if I reduce the amount I eat by 1000 calories and burn 1000 calories in my exercise so that I lose 2000 calories per day? I can lose 4 lbs per week making it possible to lose at least 16 lbs per month, reaching my goal in 4 months for 64 lbs. Should I do that? \r\n\r\n######I probably have no idea what I&#039;m talking about. I&#039;m sorry.","replies":[]}
