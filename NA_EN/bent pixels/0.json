But for some reason (idk if its a glitch or im missing something or what) it is still saying that i dont have twenty champs yet, but im fairly confident that i do (akali, amumu, annie, ashe, cho'gath, garen, kayle, master yi, mordekaiser, morgana, nasus, nanu, poppy, ryze, shyvana, singed, sivir, soraka, tryndamere, and warwick... thats 20 right?) Can someone tell me whats going on or, better yet, everything that i need in order to play ranked? I must be missing something.

I'm not sure if this number is inclusive of free champion rotation or exclusive. Amumu seems to be the only champion that you listed that is also on the [current free rotation](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/free-rotation), so are you sure that you own him?","replies":[{"poster":"Bent Pixels","date":"2018-01-14T08:46:00.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup that would be it.

Free week champions you *own* will be included, but free week champions you do not own will not.","replies":[]}]}]}
