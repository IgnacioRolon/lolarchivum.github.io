As a Kassadin main, and as someone who is obsessed with space, believe me when I say that I wanted to do VO processing on this guy REALLY FREAKIN BADLY.  However, skins doesn't operate like champion, where you have 6+ months to go balls to the wall on every sound effect and VO line.  Skins has multiple products that they work on simultaneously, and time management is extremely important.  The sound designer will usually make audio related decisions, but there is heavy influence from product owners, your discipline, your pod, etc.  For example, on Arclight Vel'koz, originally no one wanted VO processing!  My PO didn't think it was a good use of my time, and a bunch of people on my audio team thought it was weird to have a character from the void processed in a heavenly way.  In a bullheaded manner, I ignored everyone and did it anyway.  \n\nSometimes, you just gotta go with your gut, and other times you have to listen to your team.  My PO did not want me to focus my effort on Kassadin VO.  I decided to listen, and instead went on to do all of the SFX and VO for Omega Squad Teemo and Forsaken Jayce.\n\nThere are a bunch of skins that are 1350 that \"could\" have VO processing, and don't.  Battle Boss Blitzcrank could have a doubler similar to Veigar so that he sounds more retro, Star Guardian Lux could have a bunch of reverb on her voice like they have in some anime shows, Risen Fiddlesticks could have awesome processing with reversed reverb and dark tonal elements in it, etc.  Why don't they?   Could be that Localization is swamped, could be that the sound designer is needed on a different skin, could even be that no one on your pod wants new VO.  Endless reasons.\n\nHAVING SAID ALL OF THIS.  I still want Kasssadin VO processing as much as you all do.  I'm not on the skins team anymore (on R&D) which makes this more difficult, but if the skins PO and localization are cool with it, then I'll get you guys some processing as soon as I can!

It makes no sense for the skin concept to not to have it. Literally hes this cosmic ethereally god like skin and his voice sounds like hes some evil guy shouting crap. \n\nHe looks like his voice would be echo-y and ethereal the fact that yall noticed that and didnt change it is a problem. id rather spend money on a 20 dollar skin that really delivers in terms of quality. I dont even play Kass(because I hate his base and I hate his skins(il love his kit)) this skin will get me to play kass but without a voice process it is very underwhelming. \n\nI look forward to see if he gets a voice processing like this skin f*cking deserves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-10-11T12:07:45.228+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've been told repeatedly, or at least we interpret it this way, that first you add a bunch of bells and whistles, then you decide on a tier price.
