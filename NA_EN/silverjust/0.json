This gives it two balance levers, one for each categories.  % healing to allow poke to wear them down without being overly oppressive and changing that % allows the item to be balanced around poke.  The flat cap (Whether level based or based on a % of the champion's max HP) means that it allows tanks to do a hefty recover after fights without being a full heal, and by changing the amount allows the item to be simultaneously balanced around tanks recovering after big fights.\n\nIn other words it does what Warmogs does, yes, but it has 2 distinct and powerful limiters/balance levers on the things Warmogs is overtuned in.\n\nWithout Warmogs tanks struggle, with Warmogs most other comps struggle vs tanks.  Warmogs does what it is supposed to do, but in the context of ARAM it goes too far.  ARAM suffers both with and without it due to opposite reasons, so thus it stands to reason that we need an item like Warmogs, but with limiters on it.\n\nThe concept of being fully healed after every fight is bad in ARAM yes, but this item doesn't fully heal you.  It heals a % of the damage you take out of combat, and even then only up to a cap.

Lower regen than Warmogs, maybe about 1/2 as fast, and only up to 75% of max hp (better yet, make it based on max hp; 5k tanks regen less. Regen scaling negatively with max HP).\n\nAlso, make mana regen MUCH LOWER so that champs like Ziggs and Lux can't spam out the other team while sitting safely behind everyone else. Warmogs isn't why people hate playing ARAM.\n\nMinions aren't a reliable source of sustain. On top of the fact that you're not getting much more than 20% lifesteal (unless you're Warwick or Aatrox), in addition to competing with 4 other teammates both for sustain and gold, along with putting yourself out in the open for being hit by poke.\n\nIn conclusion, Warmogs was a very safe item that gave a huge advantage to tanks and bruisers who didn't need it.
