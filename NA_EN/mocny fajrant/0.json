Can't confirm the Classic, but Eternum and Pool Party recalls are both bugged.\nEDIT: So because the classic skin doesn't have a unique recall while burrowed, it isn't affected. Unburrowed it works fine. \n\nEDIT 2: The bug only shows itself if you have already burrowed, and then unburrowed. If you cancel the recal after the bug shows, she is still unburrowed, so her actual status doesn't change, only the graphical part.
