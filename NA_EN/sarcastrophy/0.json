Of course I found this out in a ranked game, Loss Forgiven Rito?\r\nThis is mostly just a heads up that it isn't league client related.\r\nHopefully it's fixed soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-27T20:37:04.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow, that sucks to hear.  Hopefully everything will smooth out in no time.
