However, I found that I couldn't move my character at all. I tried moving the map, and that wouldn't happen either. After that, I started to frantically click the store button, my mouse, or even to try and type to chat with my team, saying I couldn't move, and nothing was happening. However, that was all for naught. Nothing moved, nothing was working. After about a minute, periodically, something would go off, like our support pinging the enemy had glacial augment, or some messages. The timer kept going. \n\nBy this point, I was frantically trying to pull up my Task manager, or just escaping so I could perhaps exit out of league then log back in, and try to salvage the game. However, when I clicked ctrl+alt+delete, and try to pull up task manager, the game actually froze further, in the sense that the timer wouldn't keep going, and I couldn't see what my team was pinging or typing. \n\nI tried to ctrl+alt+escape, but that didn't work out either. Finally, I just signed out and logged back in, but at this point, I know the game was most likely ruined. This was a ranked promotion game, so I feel super bad for my team, because now they think I just did this to throw the game on purpose, when in reality, something went wrong with the game for me in game, and also this makes me most likely automatically lose a promo game.\n\nMay I please have some assistance on understanding this? I fear to log back in and try a game again, for this to happen, then I'll be throwing another game without trying to. Bullheaded as I am though, I definitely still will...\n\nThank you so much for your help!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-19T04:36:42.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see two possible things going wrong here.
