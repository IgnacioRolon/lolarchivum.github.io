Here's a few more details I can give you from my experience:\n\n1. Summoner's Rift, Normal Draft (Only Skarner in the game)\n2. Happened for movement, attacking, and ability VO (Q, R) seemingly at random\n3. Sometimes I had two VO play at the same time, sometimes it chose just one (either original or Battlecast)\n4. Seems to me very similar (if not the same?) to a bug in the last few patches (that just got fixed this patch) with Cho'Gath and the VO with his two legendary skins. I would hazard to guess, with the Omega Teemo report in the above comment, that it probably affects other skins with changed VO as well (maybe just legendary skins? Not sure if something like Battlecast Vel'Koz or Kog'Maw with just a filter is affected).\n\nHope this helps, will add that as annoying as this bug is, there was a moment where I heard \"I miss my kind\" followed up by \"abandon your kind\" a few seconds later and it was pretty eerie.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alpha Skarner","date":"2016-04-21T19:28:20.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I should also mention the same thing happened when I played Teemo using the Omega skin. Apparently, just whenever Teemo was walking around, I would hear Teemo's normal VO; then, after a couple seconds, I would then hear the Omega Teemo's VO.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-21T16:42:47.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey EndOsiris - \n\nThanks for the report!
