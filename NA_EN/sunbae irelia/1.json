Minions lose health on their health bar, but when they are supposed to die, they are still in the fighting animation with no health bar above them. My shots as an adc don't appear, but minions lose health like they are supposed to and there is no indication that I earn gold when I last hit. Enemy champions that I'm not supposed to be able to see appear in fog of war because they were there when my screen \"froze\".\r\n\r\nThen my screen unfreezes and my champion quickly fires off all the shots that didn't appear (purely visual, doesn't affect my attack speed or whatever), the gold icon appears for all the minions I killed during the lagging period, and the damage I take doesn't sync with the visuals on the screen (ex: My health bar goes down 50% before draven autos me). When I take damage my health bar goes down in chunks, and when I die, I still move around with no health bar.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, my ping and fps are fine. This doesn't happen all the time, but it happens enough times in a game to fuck with me and I have no idea what is causing this. I have restarted my computer, reinstalled league, and tried to change the settings. Respond ASAP. I will try to provide screenshots or something if needed, but I don't want to play another fucked up game to get them.","replies":[{"poster":"Soraka Rules","date":"2017-09-15T12:30:38.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds like Packet Loss!\nI had it a few days ago but a rioter confirmed that it was my ISP through a tracert.

I agree with Chermorg that this sounds like a possible network issue.  More specifically, it seems like there might be some packet loss happening.  Run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for these impacted games to give us an overview of what's going on.

You can definitely run into issues like this on wi-fi, is there any way to try an ethernet?  This can help rule out that possibility.  Otherwise, run through the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help beef up your connection to the game server.

Running on wifi can cause a lot of packet loss issues, so this could be the big resolution for you.  Keep in mind, though, that changing your network has a small chance of requiring some tuning up configuration to make sure it's optimal.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-15T14:53:35.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, a caveat, I’m not Riot support and am not equipped to diagnose your specific issue.\n\nThat being said, this type of thing is usually due to either short term disconnects (of a couple seconds, not long enough for “trying to reconnect” to appear) and/or packet loss causing the information from the server to be discarded as not verified.\n\nMore than likely your bandwidth is either not high enough to support League, and/or your ISP is throttling you or having issues with the “pipeline” to your house.","replies":[]}]}
