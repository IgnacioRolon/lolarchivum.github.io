However, for the past couple games, I have been getting a black screen that gives me an option to retry or cancel after a few moments. I don't remember what the pop up exactly says because I got penalized with leaver buster and can't check what it said. Please help!\r\nBtw I am on windows.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-22T00:25:25.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Black screens are most often due to connection issues that can't download assets.  It's a bummer that you got a leaverbuster for that, and it's really important to get this fixed up to prevent anymore.  I suggest going over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot your network and get it fixed.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
