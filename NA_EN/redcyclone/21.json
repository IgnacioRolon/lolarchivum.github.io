The shield is nice in theory but the low range of your aura plus the small uptime of the shield make it very hard to land at the right time to mitigate damage.  I think either a buff to the duration of the shield (like +1 second), and/or an increase in the area of the aura (say to 500 base range) would do enough that Sona doesn't both have to risk her neck to help her ally while also landing her utility in a very very tight window of usefulness.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hayaishi2","date":"2015-11-26T05:29:07.084+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":42,"body":"A Riot hates Sona and a Yasuo is broken easy mode OP in a single thread!","replies":[{"poster":"RedCyclone","date":"2015-11-26T05:32:28.582+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":4,"body":"This thread has very little to do with Sona, it's the quote of that champions should not be a binary instant win in certain matchups\nYasuo gets away with this\n\nI could not care less that Sona was nerfed then, she is good now","replies":[{"poster":"I Miss Cannon","date":"2015-11-26T07:09:03.909+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":31,"body":"If you quote something give a fucking source or you're making yourself look stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"RedCyclone","date":"2015-11-26T07:29:32.317+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":1,"body":"It was far back, I'll try find it though but finding archived things on boards is a massive pain in the ass\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/3NL0vjdZ-the-pbe-has-been-down-for-2-and-a-half-weeks-first-update-is-a-nerf-to-sona\n\nFirst riot comment mentions they wanted to broaden her counterplay as she was deemed too strong against champions she was strong against (no sustain squishies like Lulu)\nI don't see why you are riled up about this, the thread isn't about Sona","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-11-27T01:23:55.616+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Should probably put that reference in the opener, now that you've found it.\nAdds credence to your topic.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Marthian","date":"2015-11-26T05:33:46.723+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":11,"body":"> Riot hates Sona\n\nThis is such a load for various reasons.

Nami's kit is also not that of an aura/sustain support as much as it is a skirmishing support - she DOES have a heal but healing is definitely not the brunt of her kit.

I really, really wish that Sona had a permutation of a Karma ultimate, either where you entered a state where your auras were empowered and your spells worked differently for -x- amount of seconds, preserving her aura/sustain feel while giving her a clear increase in power for those clutch teamfight plays - or they gave her an evolving ability mechanic with her ult instead of the current flat buff to everything for each rank in ult.

She is not a good siege champion, her abilities other then her passive have no effect buildings.  Her heal is really lack luster, lacking the base numbers to really do much of anything to help your team mate until you are rolling in the late game with 200-400 AP.\n\nAlso Sona has moved so far away from the old aura sustain build that it's more or less pointless to even mention it now.  Her current kit is not aura's it's a thrown together chimera of one time bonuses, many of which don't last long enough to see full effect.\n\nIt always amuses me that people complain about Sona, she is actually super easy to play against if you can even remotely pick up your opponents pattern.  So much of Sona's damage is based off your opponents letting you get in free hits.  It is very rare that the creep wave is going to be in a place where Sona can land her Q into AA without being open to counter poke or getting caught by an ability.  Late game a ton of her power simply comes from building a ton of inflated damage.  One doesn't complain when the Ziggs with {{item:3100}} and 300-600 AP is auto attacking for metric tons of damage, so why is it an issue when Sona does it?\n\nWhile we are talking about her ultimate though, what do you think would be a good replacement?  Because as Sona stands it's basically 40-70% of her reason for existing in the late game.  Remember that without a damage ability for an ultimate she has 1 offensive based skill, while still being one of the most fragile champions in the game.  Also remember that without the stun part of her ultimate, she is the only support without a built in form of CC.  Hell even Soraka has a built in root AND slow in her basic kit.  Sona has to use her passive to even get a slow.","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2015-11-27T09:05:40.665+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sona is good for sieging because she has a short CD ability that gives everyone on her team a shield and heals herself and a target. If you can't understand why that's useful when you're trying to take a tower then I can't help you. And I'm not complaining about Sona - I'm a Sona main that's sad that she's so incredibly binary when her kit could be much more interesting than it is, so I think you're coming at me from the wrong angle here. I also don't feel like you read my post as I gave two examples of abilities to replace her ultimate with. Sona also has a slow, basically a mini-exhaust (Diminuendo is SUPER good) and additional utility with her E and W.

All that while also being within auto attack range, no i would not call that a good built in form of Crowd Control.\n\nAs for the damage reduction modifier, it's ok but it's hardly an exhaust.  You can't surprise opponents with it most times and the auto attack range on it makes it hard to use while running away from a target.  Add that the effect is not super visual and often it's not clear if/why a character is doing less damage.\n\nAs for your poke concept that implies a minimum level of 2 to have both the movement speed and damage abilities, or likely level 4 since basically no on goes damage into movement speed.  It also is a huge mana sink, costing about 100-125 per poke, requires you to wait between each poke till your movement speed buff is active again (12 second base cooldown), and still usually requires your opponents to not learn your attack pattern and/or catch you out of position when you go in to poke.","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2015-11-27T23:05:24.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"40% movement reduction is stronger than Rylai's, and the base CD may be high but you can easily (and efficiently) hit max CDR.

She still functions very badly as a typical utility support.  Her base numbers are horrible if you take a typical team buff item patch with minimal AP, even at max CDR you aren't going to be doing next to anything if you have under 200 AP, unless you count your ultimate.\n\nOn the flip side she is a joke of a mage character.  1 offensive ability that is heavily front loaded with needing to be in auto attack range to function, a very small heal / shield, and a short term movement speed buff to try and compansate for her horrible base movement speed.  No hard or lasting CC to make trades.  And most fun a horrible ability to clear waves.\n\n\nYou comment about how strong her W power cord is at about 300 AP, but at that same level of AP aren't most mage supports also doing very powerful things and/or massive damage when they hit with any ability.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2015-11-27T22:54:05.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Vitriolic Cat,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ab1sfOlt,comment-id=000000010001000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-27T09:05:40.665+0000)\n>\n> Sona is good for sieging because she has a short CD ability that gives everyone on her team a shield and heals herself and a target.

Superior poke combo in basically all situations is E powerchord Q AA as you retain the MS buff for long enough to easily weave back out.\n\nYour suggestion on how to replace Sona's ult would put her in the same spot as either Karma or Kayle: Either no hard cc at all, or not enough hard cc fast enough to stand as a good support. EVERY good support has aoe cc in some fashion that's quick to use to make plays with, save Soraka who only spams W and wins since win starts with W.\n\nOne really can't change Sona's R without uprooting the whole kit, especially if changing R meant not having an aoe stun. It's literally that important to Sona's overall kit.\n\nAlso, if anything, Sona's good for sieging when she combines Lich with her passive. THAT'S why she helps sieging more than other supports (combined with the shield, anyway). Nothing's more helpful when taking down a turret in the mid/late game than a free 400-500 damage shot out of nowhere. You're not wrong, but her synergy with Lich is a better point to make.","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2015-11-27T23:03:30.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're imaging the change in a vacuum.

She's too squishy to only be able to cc one person.\n\n- If it's an aoe cc, why bother changing it to begin with?\n\nAlso, yes, she would need hard cc to be an effective support. Look at all effective supports right now. ALL of them have hard CC. Where's Kayle support, even though she's secondarily designed as a support? No hard cc, no go. How about Nunu? Same problem.\n\nAlso, Karma isn't strong right now, nor was she ever. She always has negative win rates coupled with low play rates as far as champion.gg goes, and out of HUNDREDS of games that I've played, I can safely say Karma's a champion I almost NEVER see. Karma's only hard cc is a delayed root. That alone makes her so much less worth the pick than so many other supports.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Aeolian Melodies","date":"2015-11-26T20:47:08.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Vitriolic Cat,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ab1sfOlt,comment-id=000000010001,timestamp=2015-11-26T19:26:56.838+0000)\n>\n> it's actually not\n> \n> Morello has stated multiple times that if they were to make Sona again she wouldn't have the ultimate she has right now as it hogs a huge portion of her power budget and doesn't fit on an aura/sustain support, but they don't want to change it due to community backlash so they just keep nerfing her instead.
