NOT THE BEST. But Decent. Next Patch she will get mana reduced on her Q to make up for those Summon Aery nerfs as you stated. However, here is the part you don't get. She's a support and NOT A MAGE OR ADC. Let's get that out of the way. Sona is an unfortunate champion who is basically like Anubis from SMITE. If they can buff her up a lot then that's great! But the underlying issue is Sona's kit isn't healthy for a bot lane support. She is pure point and click! The purest form of it, and unfortunately she scales pretty well with AP and her Q makes it even harder because its such a reliable, hard hitting ability for such a low cooldown/cost. Summon Aery is still good as well unless you run Comet on Sona. Comet is good, but it doesn't make up for the utility Aery brings for her W and Q. I am an avid Sona main. She was my very first champion I bought with the 400 free RP Riot used to give out, she was on sale 395 RP and I bought her. I dedicate my time into fitting her in my Ranked games somewhere. Hell, maybe one day if I can make it to plat or diamond, I will probably still use her. She's decent, but obviously {{champion:40}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:267}} are going to remain supreme over her when it comes to CC. I like Sona and honeslty I think she's fine right now, if they decide to buff her, they need to be very careful or else she can break the bot lane again. (Don't forgot {{item:3504}} is still a decent buy even after all it's nerfs.) Have a good day and just know they are trying with her, its just a balance they need to find for her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2018-01-19T17:53:27.606+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sona's not a hypercarry, was never meant to be a hypercarry, and never should be a hypercarry.\n\nI agree that her scale up time is a bit slow, but she should never be comparable to a hypercarry.","replies":[{"poster":"RedCyclone","date":"2018-01-19T17:59:49.966+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"-Compare Sona's shitty scaling to the scaling of hypercarries-\n\nEveryone - \"OMG SONA ISNT A HYPERCARRY!\"\n\nWhere did I say she was?\nReading comprehension motherfuckers","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2018-01-19T18:01:27.644+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":">  she should never be comparable to a hypercarry.\n\nDid you miss this part?

No one wants to hear about her anymore. Riot isn't going to make major changes to her since she has a legendary skin, and that'd be hard to fumble with. Play Janna. Play Nami. Play Lulu. Sona isn't worth the time. Even if she's good in solo queue, she's garbage in coordinated play *all the time,* so even if you're good at her in solo queue, when Clash comes out, you'll be at a massive disadvantage in that space.\n\n2) Hyper carries taking 10 minutes to scale is a massive overstatement. Hyper carries kick in at about 3 items (if you feed them, obviously they're oppressive sooner, but not the point). You don't get 3 items in 10 minutes.\n\n3) I get the point of the thread.

Just...generally, Sona's design is straight fucked. No one cares, so I'm personally not gonna bother. I'll play her for fun once in a while, but I'm moving on. If Riot ever decides to really do something about it, maybe I'll look into her again. She's ultimately a casual player's champion and it's honestly my fault for expecting anything else.\n> \n> 2) I would say a 1v5 carry at 10 mins is a overstatement, these champions who are claimed to be hyper have a very small window of them being weak, most can fend for themselves at 10 mins without needing to be strides ahead\n\nThis is blatantly untrue...ish. Depends on the game state. Generally speaking, hyper carry champs *are* really weak in comparison to others in their class early on. You **can not** sell me the notion that someone like Vayne is as strong as MF or Lucian or Draven in the early laning phase. Much of what goes down is a product of the supports these guys lane with, as well as the game state in terms of itemization and pre-game setups. That's a fact you have to be mindful of.\n \n> 3) Yeah, pretty fucking stupid to make a thread talking about Sona here, however not really much else to use, I could put it in /r/Sonamains if I wanted to be in a echochamber...\n\nHonestly, just find something else to talk about. Sonamains is an echo chamber, Riot stays hush on the topic, and the boards either has straight up obnoxious Sona players making insane hyperbolic statements about the champ or a bunch of people that couldn't care less, even when you're talking about bigger picture concepts than just \"Pls buff my champ\". There's no point. I can make a thread 8 ways to Sunday about what I think are the underlying issues behind peoples' dissatisfaction with Sona in the game. No one gives a fuck, but everyone's panties twist up real tight when Sona gets nerfed, or when the same few Sona players start going \"Sona's Q does 10 damage level 1 fucking buff her\", or whatever stupid shit happens every time she comes up. Instead of having real conversation about the issue, it's only the whiny, circle jerk threads that get attention on these boards.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-01-19T19:33:28.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You want sona to be broken so bad you'd make the most illogical thread about her.","replies":[{"poster":"Redcadaver","date":"2018-01-19T21:17:09.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YaRossy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oW1m3FbJ,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-01-19T19:33:28.596+0000)\n>\n> You want sona to be broken so bad you&#x27;d make the most illogical thread about her.\n\nI mean as long as she stays weak your happy so I dont really see the diffrence here.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-01-19T22:12:05.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"idc if she's weak or strong, what i care about is a logical argument on why she should be nerfed/buffed/left alone.\n\n\nComparing a sup scaling to a lategame hypercarry adc scaling is just dumb. \n\nIf you want to compare scaling, compare her with  other supports, not a completely different role with completely different uses.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
