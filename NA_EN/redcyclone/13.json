But now she scales off of AP in absolutely everything and her base values are frankly quite poor. Her poke in particular is pretty much balanced around her picking up a Sheen at this point, which quite simply isn't going to happen in competitive play.\n\nAlso, as another guy said, people are just terrible at playing against her in solo q. People call Sona easy but against a good opponent she's really not, which is the problem with competitive. Playing aggressively with a champion who's made out of paper has a ton of risks associated with it, especially against tanky supports who can genuinely 100-0 her if they land their engage in the early levels. But she's balanced around people not retaliating because solo q players are a lot more likely to run away from Sona's poke than they are to fight her back, even though after she's used her damage is the best possible time to attack her.","replies":[{"poster":"Profirix","date":"2015-08-14T17:40:14.321+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This post pretty much sums up Sona's problem.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2015-08-14T16:35:23.496+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":5,"body":"She has no more auras, she has no more identity.

All the support/mage picks or the mage/support picks are either better off mid lane or better off not being played competitively.\n\n2) She IS too nerfed. She doesn't do insane amounts of damage unless she goes mid and builds it, but anyone else can emulate that damage anyway. There's no reason why her Q shouldn't be able to out-damage the sustain of a Doran's Blade at level 1 (I thought A Wild AP Sona was just using hyperbole on this point, but not only did I start winning more after changing my mindset after reading his rage post, he was fking right...). Even then, her utility components are relatively weak in comparison to nearly any other support simply because they're aoe. The problem is that they're too weak. You're not giving enough incentive to prefer shielding 5 people with a short, crappy shield over shielding one person with a shield so damn massive it takes an ult or a crit to shred it off while it lasts for a good 2-3 or so seconds while giving other benefits like movement or damage. The cost on the shield+heal is too high for how weak it is as well.\n\nSo part of it is a meta problem that hasn't been addressed for a long time (tank supports are way too valuable and do too much while mage supports can't really excel at damage-dealing because they'll just go mid, but they can't lock people down because they're squishy and easy to punish), and part of it is the fact that you guys over-nerfed Sona in the long run.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Wild AP Sona","date":"2015-08-14T18:49:34.738+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=l4fPAZ8v,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-08-14T15:58:34.113+0000)\n>\n> Why do you think teams occasionally picked her before, but no longer do?

CC matters less because CC largely stays the same throughout the game.   You lock someone down for 2 seconds early, but your teammate doesn't have the damage to kill them in 2 seconds.  You do that later on in the game, and that person gets deleted by your teammate.  \n\nHigh damage in the early game zones out opponents and forces them to be more aggressive, specifically more predictably aggressive.  When Leona and her ADC come back to lane from base, having been poked out by Sona previously, you KNOW they are going to want to engage quickly if they can, while they have full health and Sona has less mana.

Causes her dominance to be unusable against engage supports or poke supports or adcs unless you coordinate perfectly with your own adc, and even then only certain match-ups work.\n3) With all the power given to junglers, ganks are almost inevitably going to be frequent and sona does poorly against any jungler with the ability to engage or any jungler taking advantage of a supports engage.\n4) With the popularity of mobility, Sona's e just doesn't make the cut against gap-closing engages or even just running away in general.

Is it strictly that she's been too nerfed? That she's not standing out as far as what she brings to the table? That she's being crowded out by other supports? Or something else?\n\nI think the meta is partly to blame here. Since tanky supports are favored right now, sona isn't a very desirable pick. She's easily all-in'd, and doesn't bring the same utility as other mage supports. When it comes to mage supports, they're all picked for very specific reasons. Karma is picked for her teamwide speed buff. Morg for her black shield. Lulu for her incredible peel and speed boost (even though she's usually put in a solo lane anyway). Janna for the best disengage in the game. Before her nerfs, raka was picked for her unparalleled sustain. Why should a team pick sona, though? She does a little bit of everything, but nothing as well as any of these champions. If a team wants a squishy generalist, they'll probably pick nami, since she has strengths that align more with what teams want (like having hard CC on a basic ability). \n\nHere's what sona brings to the table:\n- Very strong poke\n- Some sustain\n- Some speed\n- An aoe stun ult\n-  Every three ability casts: A slow, a damage reduction debuff, or just extra damage\n\nThat's her kit in a nutshell. From this profile, her damage seems to be the main reason you should pick her, when damage is one of the last things pros look for in a support. In low elo, kills happen more often, making a support's damage more important; in high elo, utility reigns supreme. Since her strength is damage, that means she is very strong when ahead, capable of bullying enemies out of lane repeatedly, but she doesn't have as much to fall back on when the enemy laners present a significant threat to her. As long as sona follows the profile I outlined above, I don't think it's possible to bring her into a state where she is picked competitively without becoming overbearing for soloqueue. Her identity is simply too at odds with what pros want, meaning she has to be overpowered to be worth picking. \n\nIn light of that, I think these would be the healthiest places to add gameplay:\n1) Her E\n2) Her powerchord\n\nSimply making her Q more powerful would just make her stronger for soloqueue without really changing anything for the pro scene, and making her sustain better would just promote an uninteractive lane, so making her Q or W stronger is off the table. However, her E is a form of utility that can enable interesting gameplay, giving pros a reason to pick her in the form of a teamwide speed buff, making this probably the healthiest ability to funnel power into. Finding ways to increase the utility on her powerchord (that don't just involve making it do more damage) would be another good direction to take.","replies":[{"poster":"LoquaciousKumqat","date":"2015-08-15T00:09:50.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her E should remove slows or something.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RedCyclone","date":"2015-08-14T20:11:14.669+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"VS players who dont know how to handle her, she is overbearing (between bronze and gold)\nVS players who do know how to handle her, she is the easiest lane to play against\n\nCan we please do something about her E what gains next to 0 benefit when you rank it up","replies":[]},{"poster":"desertoflame","date":"2015-08-14T20:09:45.653+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think in general Soraka sustain > Sona","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xela Syab","date":"2015-08-14T19:28:14.516+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=l4fPAZ8v,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-08-14T15:58:34.113+0000)\n>\n> Why do you think teams occasionally picked her before, but no longer do?

She doesn't have any early cc, it's just her ult and her E auto combo slow.\n2. She doesn't have escape so she's easy to pick off early game.\n3. She's really really really mana dependant, she's not relevant unless she has clarity or chalice + mana.\n4.

Squishy poke/sustain - based champions kinda have to win lane in order to be relevant, else they will be outscaled by higher CC supports ({{champion:12}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:412}} ) that can offer more peel.\n\nSona still has her ult, but she kinda needs to dominate lane to be viable. And since she's a support I don't really see how she could get enough AP to make her damages/heal relevant. Unless you put higher scaling values / %health heal/shield?\n\nAlso, I've seen threads about how unrewarding it feels to put points in E. Sure, you max it last, but still, 1% per rank which is all what leveling this spell does, is really low.","replies":[]},{"poster":"only zhule","date":"2015-08-15T04:41:41.088+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=l4fPAZ8v,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-08-14T15:58:34.113+0000)\n>\n> Why do you think teams occasionally picked her before, but no longer do? Is it strictly that she's been too nerfed? That she's not standing out as far as what she brings to the table? That she's being crowded out by other supports? Or something else?\n\n\nIt's a little bit of all of what you said.  The nerf she got not only handicapped her damage in a lot of ways, a base bonus to your allies AD/AP tends to go a lot further in most cases then a one time per cast buff of some magic damage.  This shows up super clearly in how she use to be great for tower pushes with giving herself and her allies a bonus 8-20 AD/AP.  Her current bonus only triggers off units, meaning that even if you are spamming skill the only bonus damage you will be adding is off your passive.  Where before her rework a sheen did a lot to help her damage output, but it wasn't a 100% core item if you wanted to do damage.  Her current style does not just suggest her building a sheen it outright requires before you can start doing even remotely reasonable damage.  However even with a spellblade effect she still suffers from having all her spells base cooldowns raised by a couple seconds each.\n\nWith her rework she lost a metric ton of what she brought to the table for a team.  The ability to chain together bonus damage and bonus resistances, made her a huge assist to your team and her value didn't sharply drop off after she used her ultimate.  However the thing the she brought most to a team was her ability to stay out of combat and still effect the flow of it.  You could stand 800-1000 range back and your presence was still felt.  To compensate for that she was made very physically weak so that if you did catch her she went down pretty fast.  Now she has to be much more aggressive and in the middle of combat to have any effect on the flow of combat.  She however was not given anything in the rework to make that easier.  So basically you have the same basic play style but now you have to be within about 300 range of your allies to be useful.\n\n\nShe is also getting crowded out by many of the other supports.  You have champions like Nami who are very similar to Sona but with better numbers, or having passives that function the same as Sona's abilities.  You also have champions like Annie or Morgana  who are powerful mid lane choices, but can also easily fill a support role without sacrificing all that much utility.  Add to this you champions like Naut who have great engages, decent damage, and are tanks allowing them to shrug off most damage you can throw at them.  However i would say the biggest offender is {{champion:223}}, here we have a champion who is not only built to be tanky and thus hard to push out of lane.  But also affords some reasonable utility in his slow and ability to gobble up allies to save them.  The cherry on top though is that even with all that power he is also afforded very good damage on his offensive skills.  \n\n\nHow is Sona support to compete when there are champions who are in most regards just better versions of her?  Champions who can go from their intended role to being support without sacrificing much to do so?  And with a meta that strongly favors tanky supports over damage/utility ones?\n\nI would also like it remembered that most champions who are currently picked for support are more then capable of filling out more then just the support role.  However with the rework Sona lost her ability to be viable in the mid lane, and got relegated to being JUST a support.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Count Buffon","date":"2015-08-14T10:30:36.057+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"I remember QQ threads from 2-3 years ago about her getting nerfs every patch because Rito no like invisible power or sustain bots.

Okay then, thanks a lot for the free poke, I'll come back when it's available\". In competitive play, however, bot lanes and teams can easily coordinate to feed off her which is a lot easier than to feed off other supports. \n\nSupports in a casual environment also tend to have more gold than in pro games because there are typically more kills (ergo more assists for them) in casual games than in pro games, how many games do we see with sub 10 kills on each teams? That's not a lot of assists money for a support - meaning the AP support builds are rare in pro games, and Sona's rework has made her a lot better as AP-focused support than full support with only Crucible, Locket etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RedCyclone","date":"2015-08-14T10:43:39.053+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's a good champion to play up till plat\nthings get much more difficult after that and to play her, it requires the enemy to pick their botlane first, and that botlane not be a clean cut counter against Sona (and there isn't many champions that are played who don't destroy Sona)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DJ Di0","date":"2015-08-14T20:18:20.535+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Carry,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=l4fPAZ8v,comment-id=0012,timestamp=2015-08-14T17:19:43.361+0000)\n>\n> It's not going to work.
