Not to ward the bushes (usually), but to ward the River. This makes it extremely safe to sit on the river side of the lane, on the far side of your minions, and it hurts Blitz's ability to catch you out.\n- Really? How inept.\n- Are you making sure to hide behind minions? Are you making sure you're using the abilities with the shortest cast times in your kit? Are you poking him because he's out of position and you're not in any actual risk even if he does land a hook, or are you poking him just to poke him, even when he's standing next to his ADC and has insane kill pressure? There's a lot of context here necessary to understand whether or not poking is the smart move or not, and whether you should be punished for poking at a bad time.\n- He's a support (in this case). It's literally in his job description to be effective in a team despite a low gold value. What, do you want to also make sure we don't have double standards and make all supports totally useless for falling behind early? The fact of the matter is that if you make a mistake and he catches you on it, then the burden is on you.\n- He should not have the budget to do too significant damage this way, or otherwise he will scale extremely slowly. This is only an argument to be made if he's already fed beforehand which, again, means the burden is on you.\n- If you or your lane partner *really* doesn't have the peel to stop someone from *running* at you, somebody has failed terribly in picking their champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2015-03-16T21:14:59.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blitzcrank is broken only because he is so passive aggressive, even if blitz can't land a hook, the simple fact of having a long range 100% pull skill shot forces you to play as if he will land it. \n\nIs he OP?
