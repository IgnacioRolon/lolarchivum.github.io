I'm not sure the AP from Frost Queen is worth it either.  It seems like it's better to just start building some other AP item.  Usually when I check my gold earned from Spellthief I have more than the opposing support (maybe I'm just better at poking?).  One key is to make sure to get those three hits on the enemy tower.  Spell thief line definitely requires you to be more active in lane and you absolutely need to take advantage of every opportunity to poke to see your value from this item.\n\nBut in the end, utility is valued on supports and I don't see that part of the meta shifting.  And that means speed and health are probably more valuable to a support than AP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2015-10-05T23:18:07.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Support GG,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kciuPZET,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-05T22:58:50.926+0000)\n>\n> The problem is Spellthief's, and the lack of good itemization for them. \n> \n> Frost Queen's Claim is not good compared to Face of the Mountain and Talisman of Ascension.

(like a support can't build Ludens for the MS, AP, and extra poke damage.) \n\nand secondly, the AP disparity is the only reason why AP champions like Annie and Morgana, can even be balanced both as a support and as an APC. \n\nlastly, any poke support who can't also solo lane, pretty much has lame AP ratio's on their damaging abilities. Sona for example only has .5 ratio on her Q and R, (and not even that on her power chord.) And her utility scaling is even worse so their is very little reason to scale large amounts of AP. In sona's case, the only way to significantly increase her Damage output is with either Lichbane or Ludens. Poke supports really need more damage that isn't reliant on scaling.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DJ Di0","date":"2015-10-05T23:14:01.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Support GG,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kciuPZET,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-05T22:58:50.926+0000)\n>\n> The problem is Spellthief's, and the lack of good itemization for them. \n> \n> Frost Queen's Claim is not good compared to Face of the Mountain and Talisman of Ascension.
