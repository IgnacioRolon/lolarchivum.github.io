There's nothing wrong with that, it happens. What this causes is, especially with a Morgana ahead, she pushes hard and easy with the pool.\nConsequence: constantly being pushed makes you unable to roam. Because of this: you roam when being pushed = giving up cs you desperately need to get back, while you might roam and get nothing out of it and thus remain as useless as before the roam + losing tower damage.\n\nI 'once' had a game in botlane. I was either {{champion:222}} or {{champion:81}} (I don't remember), but what I do remember is my friend was playing {{champion:99}} vs {{champion:238}}. At some point {{champion:238}} backed, then {{champion:99}} did the same after another wave. When {{champion:238}} came back he pushed and roamed bot. We warded (probably the support, but anyway) so we saw him coming, we played safe and right as he was about to leave, my friend {{champion:99}} thought it was necessary to help.\nIT DIDN'T! {{champion:238}} stayed, {{champion:99}} stayed. I think for about 2 minutes. If she had just taken midlane, Zed would've left and botlane would have been fun again.\n\nHonestly, when I play LeBlanc and I'm ahead, this is basic stuff: Get blue, push lane, fake a roam (make it so they absolutely see the direction you leave lane), sit in bush, wait and assassinate. That's why midgame I always carry a pink on me.\n\nOr to give a example where I played {{champion:238}} , which I almost never do. I roamed bot, they didn't know or react to pings, I got an easy double, and right then the midlaner arrived. I was happy to take the triple. AND I came back in a lane that was still not pushed towards my turret, so I don't remember, but I probably took the tower too.\n\nSo, to sum up: roaming just because your opponent roams, imho, a bad idea. You just warn, make him lose cs and hope my botlane reponds to my pings. And sometimes you don't have a choice but to stay in lane.\nIt MIGHT be good to roam too.

They don't. Pressure does. Taking objs does. This is why assassins roam bot often. Not for kills or to catch up to the enemy lamer. It's done to apply pressure to a portion of the map that contains the most objectives with a tower, a buff, and drake all close. An assassin that applies more pressure than a passive lamer who won't leave his lane at the times he should be is an assassin that's likely to win the game because of the lack of game understanding displayed by his opponent.","replies":[{"poster":"A Liberal","date":"2016-01-02T19:09:49.817+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean I totally understand where you are coming from, and I agree that you probably should follow or at least try and keep eyes on the roaming assassin, but the very basis of your statement was flawed.
