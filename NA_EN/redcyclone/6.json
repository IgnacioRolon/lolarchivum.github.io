In this time, concepts are developed and tested. If these concepts don't work out, they have to be scrapped. If you end up scrapping all your concepts because they aren't good enough or don't do the champion justice then you are back to square one.\n\nAt this point it might be fair to say \"Okay. We have exhausted all of our ideas for now. Let's re-examine priorities and come back to this champion at a later date\".\n\nI guess this happened. \nThis sucks. I bought Yorick for his awesome theme. Later, before I knew the value of a refund, I got rid of him because he wasn't as I thought he would be. Ah well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-04-29T18:38:01.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's been worked on right now.....","replies":[]},{"poster":"1st HanarSpectre","date":"2015-04-29T18:10:41.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They don't know what to do with him, same reason Eve's changes are also tossed onto the empire state build sized to do list.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2015-04-29T18:08:21.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's on the list.
