For years it was Lee sin or X, only for them to be nerfed a couple patches later. A while ago Jarvan was a demi-god. Currently just about every tank jungler is more or less viable, even if they're not quite as good as Gragas or Sej. Shaco and some other junglers are still strong enough, easily capable of cheesing and shutting out tank junglers for a while, and snowballing the game. Cinderhulk and red smite has prompted the return of Shyvana and Mundo to the meta(its actually common enough to see them top with smite). Garen, Shen, and Renekton also make good use of it top lane as well(although not competitively speaking)... top lane has legitimately never been more diverse or balanced(Hecarims still a bit crazy however). Rumble is still an extremely good top lane pick, and Vlad is a strong pick in the current meta as well. There where matches at MSI where we had six bans against top lane and they still found relatively good picks on both teams(This would NEVER have been possible before). Evelynn was picked at MSI as a jungler... AND WON. ADC diversity is NOT ruined by Cinderhulk its ruined by Kalista and Lucian as they're both \"Swiss army knife champions\" that are always a good pick. Then you have support... big surprise Thresh still getting picked over EVERYONE else(Cinderhulk didn't change this at all). Mid is barely affected as well. You could argue people pick Cass to much because she has enough damage late game to kill tanks... however her laning phase even scares Zed its so bonkers these days.

I'd like to side with you, but your definition of balance is impossible to acheive for more than 30-40ish champion in League. Here's my take on it, so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nThere really is only 1 way to play league, Riot keeps their game under tight control and it's hard to innove or play outside their meta. The few times a team comes up with something new, it is nerfed. There are only very few exceptions. Even in champion design, notice how outdated kits get reworked and now they fit in the meta? \n\nThat's because everychampion comes with a silent guaranty that he can do all the basic stuff : harass, farm, nuke, CC, mibility, little mana problem. Champions that are out of this are \"outdated\" and reworked or underplayed (I'm thinking of anivia right now).  Every champion in Riot's ideal game has a clear role, an harass game, a minigame-based  CC  to fish for engages, some waveclear and kill potential. \n\nEvery champion is a jack'of'all'trade compared to other games and that's why they all boil down to the same thing. And that's why only a few of them will be above the curve and be played. 20-30 champion in each roles can't all be unique enough without being seen as too far outside the norm.\n\nThere are more pushy teams, more mid-game teams, more lategame team. But ultimately, they all play pretty similar. And they all have pretty much identical game dynamics.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"XxxLumberJackxxX","date":"2015-05-12T23:47:00.999+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last year that number is like 1/5.
