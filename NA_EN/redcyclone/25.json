Not only would this make her more skillful, but it would also give her moments where she is stronger and moments where she is weaker. Right now, Sona's kit is pretty one dimensional and Riot has been forced to nerf her numbers super hard, because if she had good numbers, then opponents have no opportunity to fight her. And with low numbers, she is totally worthless.

Which is why Sona has the weakest heal in the entire game both in base and scaling, combined with the most expensive mana cost.  Sona's heal is so bad, Relic Shield heals 33% more than her and the 2nd-lowest champion heal(Nidalee) heals just as much as Sona potentially could if her target was at 0% HP, but Nid has higher AP scaling.","replies":[{"poster":"Rozzeta","date":"2015-10-12T17:28:57.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't get me wrong, but I think that buffing Sona in damage alone would be a bad idea, since it's the very first thing Riot guts whenever they feel like nerfing her.

That is not a healthy ability under any circumstances and Riot is not going to be terribly interested on buffing it.\n\nLet's not forget that  targetting is subject to special circumstances. Q only has champion priority in a 550-600 radio around Sona. If no champion is in that radio, Q will hit whichever enemy unit is closer, so standing behind minions is actually a valid counter. If Sona gets close to you in order to get you in the priority area, then you have one of the squishiest champions on the game in attack range.\n\nThis, and the fact that a target can only receive damage from 1 attack, even if the animation shows both going towards the same target (when only 1 target present) is actually a very important information which Riot has never added to the client.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2015-10-12T21:03:36.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Don't get me wrong, but I think that buffing Sona in damage alone would be a bad idea, since it's the very first thing Riot guts whenever they feel like nerfing her.

They CAN buff her damage.  They CAN buff Aria's base, CD and cost.  Even if they reverted her completely, she'd still be an inferior pick to Nami and even Bard now as well.  Sona is a lot worse off than what you're attempting to imply.","replies":[{"poster":"Rozzeta","date":"2015-10-12T22:36:06.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting.
