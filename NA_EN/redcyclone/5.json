That is like comparing Leona to Braum\n\nSona's only problem (Other than inherent kit weaknesses that are necessary for balance)  how stupid squishy she is for no good reason. It would make more sense for Janna to have the starting stats Sona has, considering her kit. But Nah, lets give the NO HARD CC/MOBILITY PRE 6 SUPPORT some of the lowest starting stats in the game.\n\nHer kit is not the problem, her shit tier stats are. If her stats weren't garbage, she would have a reason to be picked over Nami. \n\nEdit: I also feel the need to mention that a champion not being played in lcs =/= weak. EX: RIven, Fiora, Shaco\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Simplicate","date":"2015-04-21T18:17:32.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So when you say \"make her work in higher elos\" I'm finding it hard to understand what you mean.
