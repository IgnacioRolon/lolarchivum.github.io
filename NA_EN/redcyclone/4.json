He is just not very great against a team with communication (he capitalize on mistake, which is not many on daily basis in competitive play). However, even though he is not \"good\" in competitive, the high win rate that he have wouldn't make the casters start dissing him like how the casters consistently shit talking about Sona having \"no skill\" (which is kind of true, but I still love Sona for her design regardless)","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2016-05-15T07:29:39.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats your point?

The only people that play Sona are the people that stick with her for so long that they naturally better at playing her. Just because Lee Sin have low win rate, doesn't mean that he is terribly design, it's just that he's so popular that some random guy who hardly play him be like \"They ban/pick my main... Let's go Lee Sin because he seems useful to the team :D\" According to LOLking, the lowest 10 currently consist of: Nidalee, Poppy, Lee Sin, Ryze and Kalista, all of which are very great in competitive game; why don't they have high winrate? Because the FOTM players who never play these champs expect themselves to get a freelo ticket but lost due to lack of knowledge. Nobody is going to pick up Sona as their second of choice champion, leaving only the people that really pick her up to play her, resulting in better general win rate. Also to make this even more clear, there was a moment (like 2 weeks ago) when Galio have the highest winrate... he isn't op, he isn't broken, nobody has found the hidden built; it was simply just because the few Galio main were having a good hair day... that's all.\n\nAmumu have a decent popularity, 51st at the moment. While also having high winrate.\nMy point wasn't really about win rate (not my original comment). I was just trying to say that Amumu is not a joke champion like Sona because he have a clear purpose with his kit and bring potential. Sona... have you watch the game? I was really hurt by the casters words about Sona kit, I understand she doesn't have the most skillful kit, but right out insult her was extremely unprofessional of them. But it's not like they were wrong, as someone who plays Sona since season 3 and only play Sona, I know exactly what they were saying. The truth just hurt I guess.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2016-05-15T08:30:25.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're arguing against yourself. The **first** point you mentioned was winrate. **FIRST**.\n\n> Amumu has always have one of the highest win rate in solo dynamic qeue.\n\nAs far as getting upset about a shout caster talking about Sona, you need to get over it. Getting upset someone said something you dont like on the internet is kind of cringe. The fact of the matter is that Sona has an extremely low skill cap\n\nEDIT: also, youre argument of way more people play Amumu than Sona isnt even correct. Sona has a 7% pick rate, Amumu's is 9%","replies":[{"poster":"Roar of Legend","date":"2016-05-15T08:34:28.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would you argue that Amumu is a joke though?\nI'm trying to focus on Amumu as the main point, Sona is just thrown in there just to keep this related to the threat. Amumu is very strong, you don't see people dislike the way Amumu function as much as Sona. He is versatile and isn't quiet \"off meta\" compare to some of these champs that hardly ever see any sunlight.\nSorry about the pick rate, I didn't realize I have on Diamond+, which Sona is way lower on popularity.\n\nEDIT: I didn't say the shout casters comment were unjustified, I just say I didn't enjoy it as far as they try to make it funny. I absolutely know why Sona is never pick, I know exactly why many of my ADC told me \"Can you play something else that is not Sona?\". But unlike some random people on the internet, these casters are the face of their company, and yet they present their own creation as a failure isn't something that is good to do. I would assume that they would speak about the off meta pick the same as the meta pick, but they do not. Remember that time when someone pick Urgot against Zed, exact same thing happen here, they show they recognize that there is something wrong, but refuse to fix it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2016-05-14T20:51:34.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And Krepo was wrong.
