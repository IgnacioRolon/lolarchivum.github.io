The fact that people think Zed can be an AoE burst, without  be feed obviously, it's kinda hilarious. \nHis Basic abilities are AoE, but what?\nHis Q lose damage after hit the first enemy and doesn't make so much damage at all after hit the first enemy. His E it's AoE, but look at his range ... and it doesn't even double the damage if you use your E at the same time with your W (I'm not saying it should).

You can flassh to a teammate, flash as soon as he comes out, Zhonya's,Trollpole w/e you have\n\n2. the large part of his burst is on a delay. If the deathmark does not pop you generally wont die. If you can find someway to rapidly heal yourself or shield yourself then you will most likely survive Zeds encounter.\n\n3. Zeds early-mid game is strong but late game he must play more carefully. Much like Riven careless play will lead to a throw. in order to keep himself relevant he usually has to supplement himself with health or a Guardian Angel.\n\n4.no stealth= easier to read. If a zed uses his shadow to make a straight B-line for your Ashe then you KNOW whats about to go down. this allows supports to react accordingly and the ADC to start backing up. having no stealth also means a Zed must rely on trickier positioning and use of brush.\n\nThats why Riot loves Zed.
