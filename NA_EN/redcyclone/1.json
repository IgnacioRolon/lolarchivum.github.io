This sort of conversation can get a little bit murky though since 'support' is used to describe both a class (champion whose power amplifies others, has high base utility/low scaling, isn't damage focused etc) and a position (non farming champion, most often found in a duo lane bot). The support class is most often played in the support position, there are some exceptions though, and Nunu's one I'd call out as a support who generally works best in the jungle. We also see a larger range of champions in the support position than just those from the support class. Lot of mages are strong picks as non CSing duo laners (Annie, Zyra, Fiddlesticks etc), as are a number of tanks (Braum, Alistar etc) and occasionally champions from other classes (the odd Le Blanc or Yorick support for example).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-07-17T19:18:36.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But Nunu was made as a jungler right?
