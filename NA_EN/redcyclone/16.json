Oh wait.\n\n0.7 is \"massive scaling\" on a support, who will most likely end the game with ~100-200 ap. Meanwhile thresh has a somewhat lower scaling, but it comes with a huge range dash and shields two people (which reliably happens!). So, in terms of total damage mitigation, thresh has a 0.8 ratio + 200 more base than janna.\n\nJanna's shield has to give ad because otherwise janna contributes nothing offensively while her closest counterpart lulu exists(whose bonus damage persists after the shield breaks) and janna essentially makes the lane 1.5v2 in terms of damage and pressure. Heck, soraka will deal more damage than janna will.\n\nJanna has literally 25 more range than thresh + no random bonus chunking on aas, so i have no idea what this is about.\n\nHer 500 ms is temporary, not to mention grabbing mobis gives anyone 450.\n\nEven if thresh is behind, he can still make incredible plays with his stun, aoe knockback, 2 aoe slows and mobility for ANYONE. Janna can make defensive plays too, but can't make offensive ones behind at all.\n\nIn addtion, janna's ratios have been recently nerfed, but thresh hasn't.","replies":[{"poster":"DokiDokiTodoroki","date":"2015-09-18T01:58:03.134+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's good that Janna can't make offensive plays because she's the poster child for niche support roles, but also has the kit to basically make her adc untouchable. Granted they should probably know basic kiting/positioning and she shouldn't fuck up her skills but that goes for anyone. \n\nThresh's shield exists less as her shield and more for the lantern and the utility it provides. Sure it can make some pretty close plays and may provide a nice (see: tiny) shield for a 2v2 all in, but Janna's shield is leagues better. You're conveniently ignoring that Janna's basic AD is a free BF sword at max rank not even counting AP, and also shields for 270 damage plus ratios. Whereas Thresh's shields for 220 at max rank, which is not going to be until late game because you're an idiot if you max w first, and gives zero offensive stats. Janna's cooldown is 10 seconds all ranks. Thresh's cooldown goes from 22 seconds down to 16. I don't know where you get the plus 200+ base than Janna, unless you're saying that it shields two people so you count both values. In that case, it's more like total 160 in shielding for both people, which incidentally Janna matches with rank 2 of her shield. \n\nJanna's entire identity is the disengage/peel queen. Her counterpart isn't Lulu, they fill different roles. Lulu is an aggressive poke support; Janna can spend the entire laning phase standing behind her adc and still fulfill her role completely. If a Janna and a Thresh have a random aa trade in the middle of a vacuum, Janna wins hands down. At level 3 (a point in each skill) with basic runes and masteries, Janna shields the entirety of Thresh's auto and her shield still persists. Her first aa breaks through Thresh's shield if he chooses to use lantern (which again, very few cases when you use it as a shield), and then suddenly she's left with 14 bonus AD and he's used up his damage boost. In a vacuum she wins. Also her disengage matches Thresh's cc , so it's very possible to force small aa trades without dying for your sins (Sona, anyone?). And we're not even talking about how it's a better idea for a Janna to put the shield on her ADC, who is likely running either attack speed or even more ad, and now you instantly win trades by pressing a button on an ally. Amazing, isn't it?  \n\nOn to Thresh and the totally comprehensive not exaggerated list you brought up.\n-\"Stun\" which is a grab that stuns, not a point and click, which also happens to immobilize him for the entire duration. Following up with the rest of his kit involves him flying into melee range of his target and hoping that his team follows up. \n-Aoe knock back flay, which is a point blank line area of effect. You know what else is line area of affect knockup but can be cast from up to 1700 range? Oh right, Janna. \n-2 Aoe slows which are flay and ultimate. One of them is an ult, and it's impossible to deny the disengage of The Box because that slow is brutal. Flay has a one second slow. Both require Thresh to be in near melee range that he's not necessarily getting out of himself. Maybe it would be easier if he could ignore unit collision in lane, like a certain champion... \n-Mobility for anyone. But again, not a shield. And while it's essentially a get out of jail free card, it can also get you into some deep shit if used improperly or too early. Also 22 second cooldown. The utility is high but the price isn't cheap. \n\nJanna's nerfed ratio was her ultimate by .3's healing. It has nothing to do with the essential components of her kit (disengage/peel), but prevented her from also being the kind of support that resets an entire team during the middle of a team fight. We don't need to be giving a free Ekko ultimate for picking a disengage support. \n\nJanna can always play from behind because literally as long as she doesn't suck, she exists to keep her carries alive far better than Thresh can. You can say that Thresh can make more offensive plays, but chances are that if he's behind, he's going to die for it without much else getting done. Janna doesn't make offensive plays in general. She just makes her carries basically untouchable while they go full gosu. Thresh is a generalist, Janna is fully specialized and should stay that way because of the disgusting amount of power in her role. Thresh will not do Janna's job better than her, but he exists to do everyone's job all at once. He's designed as a generalist.","replies":[{"poster":"DokiDokiTodoroki","date":"2015-09-18T01:59:21.281+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just realized that maybe I went a tad overboard with the analysis and response, but I'm also sitting here with 4 tabs open- 3 wiki pages and 1 patch notes.

Does that make her OP? \nWhen she FIRST came out, she had the highest pick rate and one of the highest win rates in the game at the same time.\n\nEdit: I guess you could argue that thresh is \"hard to play,\" which would lower his win rate... But I would disagree.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Madlife","date":"2015-09-18T04:57:29.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, I agree with you, and i'm not just saying this because I don't want thresh to be nerfed. I'm a diamond thresh main, and I have come to realize that thresh can be beat by a lot of supports, but what most people don't realize is how to do so. Here's a couple tips:\n\n1) If he starts hook, then harass him level 1, he wont have much damage to auto you back, plus his range is quite small compared to adc's.\n2) If he starts flay, and reaches level 2, try to stay with minions and use them to your advantage. Kite him around while he tries to find a spot to hook you, and by the time he does, he's be chunked.\n3) Once his hook is on cooldown, GO IN on him, like hard. He will only have his flay up, which yea, is still pretty strong, but you should be able to give him quite a bit of damage if he continues to play aggressive without hook.\n4) A common tip, and it says on his \"counters\". Thresh players like to go for souls, and they don't get punished enough for it.. so do so!\n5) Most thresh players (at higher elo) will try to predict your sidestep.

All work if you know what you're doing. As well as a pretty good sona. She's a pain for me in lane xD\n\nThere's more, but if you really want a detailed list I guess just msg me, but all in all, thresh isn't that amazing and super op as people make him out to be. It's usually just players that don't get how to lane against him, and don't want to take the time to learn, which is just plain stupid if you hate him.","replies":[{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-09-18T11:56:23.731+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=l am Madlife,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=T9HdgJN5,comment-id=00200000,timestamp=2015-09-18T04:57:29.875+0000)\n>\n> Yea, I agree with you, and i'm not just saying this because I don't want thresh to be nerfed. I'm a diamond thresh main, and I have come to realize that thresh can be beat by a lot of supports, but what most people don't realize is how to do so. Here's a couple tips:\n\nLet's face it,everything can be beaten,the question is: is the matchup fair,or is it in favor of thresh? Because if it's the latter(and it generally is) then thresh should be nerfed.\n \n> 1) If he starts hook, then harass him level 1, he wont have much damage to auto you back, plus his range is quite small compared to adc's.\n\nHe generally will start with flay unless he sees kill potential.\n\n> 2) If he starts flay, and reaches level 2, try to stay with minions and use them to your advantage. Kite him around while he tries to find a spot to hook you, and by the time he does, he's be chunked.\n\nI'm guessing you are talking about this from a ranged matchup point,here's the thing,flay+aa+follow up from both adcs and he outtrades the vast majority of ranged supports,it's the worst part about him,he doesn't need his hook to trade favorably.\n\n> 3) Once his hook is on cooldown, GO IN on him, like hard. He will only have his flay up, which yea, is still pretty strong, but you should be able to give him quite a bit of damage if he continues to play aggressive without hook.\n\nThis works for certain tanks supports,specifically naut/braum(and don't get me started on how braum is retarded sack of moronic garbage,he is only allowed to exist to offset thresh),unfortunately for ranged support...flay+empowered aas will outtrade them.\n\n> 4) A common tip, and it says on his \"counters\". Thresh players like to go for souls, and they don't get punished enough for it.. so do so!\n\nAgain,you need to realize this: thresh is a scary motherfucker(the same holds for all tank supports),getting near him as a ranged support is very risky,hence why janna is so good against him,she has no intention to get near him in most cases.\n\n> 5) Most thresh players (at higher elo) will try to predict your sidestep. Depending on how good the thresh is, or what elo, after a couple hook's you'll see how he throws them, and then try to either stand still, go a way you dont normally go, or just go in, they usually don't expect that.\n\nThis is the standard skillshot mind game,he can also expect you to do that and aim for that,his hook can be dodge,but you will eventually get hit.\n\n> 6) For champions to beat him with, you can go Blitzcrank, Janna, Braum, Alistar. All work if you know what you're doing. As well as a pretty good sona. She's a pain for me in lane xD\n\nYes,but here's the thing: all of these can be beaten by thresh as well,and for most of them,the matchup is in thresh's favor if he is good at thresh(unless it's braum,fuck braum).\n\nAs to sona,people who don't play her don't notice it,but yes,she can lane vs thresh...sort of,it's pretty even,maybe a bit in her favor...and then junglers get involved,you may think \"oh look I threw lantern to jungler,me so gud\",but the sona player just gets nauseated from this bullshit,her pickrate is low for a reason.\n\n> There's more, but if you really want a detailed list I guess just msg me, but all in all, thresh isn't that amazing and super op as people make him out to be. It's usually just players that don't get how to lane against him, and don't want to take the time to learn, which is just plain stupid if you hate him.\n\nExcept that he is:\nPretty fucking strong in all matchups,most of them are in his favor.\nExcellent roam(that's how you easily beat janna).\nExcellent synergy with jungers(a VERY big strength).\nExcellent safety from ganks,due to tankiness+insane peel+lantern for carry,which is honestly critical in this meta,as bot lane gets a lot of focus.\n\nThresh is amazing at many things,and weak at nothing,yes,he's op.\nAnd fuck braum.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ADepressedLeona","date":"2015-09-18T00:32:51.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing about Thresh is I just find his kit so disgustingly overloaded..\n\nAs a Leona main, it infuriates me.
