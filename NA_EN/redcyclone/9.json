I always get ganked like 10 times during the laning phase since I bully the enemies so much they always cry for tons and tons of ganks whenever they're losing and having trouble csing.  Lower movespeed means she can't get away from the ganks as well so you have to be super passive.  As in, you basically can't snowball at all in lane thus making her a garbage support early game.

All these Sona nerfs? They should be going to her. (And this is from a Soraka main!)\n\nThe issue is probably that you're just not playing her right; I'd guess you still have an old-raka mindset. Get your coin/spellthief, then sightstone, upgrade support item to T2. Buy boots. Start stacking AP. Have all the heals. Have all the damage.\n\nShe's an absolutely amazing harass support because of Starcall's low cooldown. If you get an Athene's or Morello's, mana becomes very little of an issue. (I like to buy an early Chalice for this.) Just start throwing stars at people any time you get a chance. Either they move (and probably miss CS) or they take a fairly sizable low-CD nuke. Once you hit level 2, it even heals you on top of that. (And for a LOT, once you get some AP up.) It's worth noting that she has at *least* a 0.4AP ratio on her self-heal. It's not too hard to get ~150HP per champion hit.\n\nEquinox is used primarily as a gank-stopper, in my experience. Throw it down a little bit in front of whoever's coming at you (so they don't get hit right when it appears) and they'll probably have to either walk around or dash. This will either give you time to back off or use up one of their abilities.\n\nI honestly can't see why people complain about new-raka.

Using your heal to constantly heal your adc will cause you to go oom and be useless. 3 w's will restore only 200 hp at the most at rank 1 (If your adc is at 1% hp for each heal). That is 240 mana for a 200 hp (Going to be way lower in normal circumstances) heal. That is garbage.\n\nThe only reason to play Sona is to have a secondary AP carry who can provide utility in the form of buffs to her allies. She cannot go mid due to awful sustain and even worse waveclear.\n\nSo before you go spouting off nonsense about how \"Good Sona's built utility. Sona does not need AP\", you should do some research. Know what you are talking about before making yourself look like an uneducated \"Bronzie\".","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2015-01-18T23:19:23.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess 99% of competitive players are worthless Sonas, then. [Did you even click that link?](http://www.probuilds.net/champions/Sona)\n\nYou build her utility because she is a support with crap AP ratios for everything but her damage output, and more often than not won't be getting that much gold if you're in a decent Elo thanks to a lack of deaths.\n\nSona's speed boost has the superior scaling (For every 100 AP, Sona is guaranteed 11.375≤ MS bonus over Nami's 10) and will begin to outweigh Nami's by at least level 6 with the minimum MS and a combination of T2 boots. By the time you've leveled it out completely, there's at least a 34 MS difference before AP values.\nIt also applies to every teammate with ease, while Nami has to spend important spells to accomplish even one person getting the bonus.\n\nActually, her pick rate rides along 7-9% in Master tier, which is a respectable pick rate considering that it has been super-consistent and still better than Lulu's, Zyra's, Soraka's, Karma's, Alistar's, and Taric's. Her win rate is also noticeably higher than Nami's - who doesn't win more than half of her games at that level and is merely picked out of habit - but lets set that aside.\n\nSona's heal is incredibly reliable. Press [W], both you and your carry get health and even a shield to block people trying to counteract it. Namie's not even guaranteed to get health to both players, let alone one if she tries to poke at the same time. Soraka has to use another spell just to keep her own health up. Only Alistar and Taric then have heals, but they're picked for different reasons.\n\nDo your research, mate, and actually read what I'm saying instead of putting words in my mouth that aren't mine.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"futuresight23","date":"2015-01-17T03:52:24.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think any explanation would have been good enough for people on here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EverTokki","date":"2015-01-16T19:43:10.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, so just to clarify here, the thing they nerfed is the hit right after the Q, right?

She isn't a poke or sustain pick, she is a utility pick, and seems to be overshadowed by {{champion:117}} and {{champion:267}}. The problem is that these two do what she does more reliably. Nami heals better, lulu pokes more consistently and overall has better utility. If it wasn't for her having a heal and her awesome ult then she would indeed be crap. At least she fits better in wombo combo teams, imo.","replies":[]}]}
