Most long range abilities are skill shots which he easily dashes out of. Most targeted and AoE skills are close to Yas' engagement range. Same applies to AA's. Heaven forbid you're *near* your minions, which increases Yas' engagement range significantly. It makes Harassing him incredibly difficult.\n***Bait his wind wall.*** \nIt's hard to bait a good Yas. The wind wall acts as an \"oh shit\" button. And he most likely won't use it unless you've already shown commitment.\n***Don't go in if he has his tornado up. ***\nAt lvl 1, steel tempest has a 4 second cooldown. It holds stacks for 10 seconds. That means he can effectively zone you for 10 seconds just by existing, with a 12 second CD. **At level 1.** Tempest gets 1.86% CDR per level from Yas's innate atk spd per level. That means the innate CD is 3.628 at level 6; a 10.884 second CD between zoning periods. Almost half your time spent in lane is effectively zoned by your recommendation. And I haven't even counted items yet!\n\n***You know who has a kit that is perfect against Yasuo? Akali. ***\nCounter-*picks*, while a valid matrix for balance, do not make up for counter-*play*. And Riot has stated multiple times they don't want to see match-ups decided by champ select.\n\n***The challenge there is not being so far behind in farm by 6 that he does not have to fear you.***\nSo you beat him by [almost] matching his farm? Ok, that's fair. We're going with the assassin mentality.\n***He farms better and can zone you,***\n. . . *{face palm}* \n***so you have to freeze the lane just outside your tower and play passive.***\nOk. So I just have to freeze lane and play passively against an assassin that farms better than me and has good zoning (and is also resistant to harass). [sarcasm]Nothing wrong with this picture.[/sarcasm]\n*** If you stay within 70-75% of his farm you will win lane (ignoring jungle interference).***\nBeing behind in CS isn't \"winning\" lane. At best, it's \"holding\" lane. This works fine for champs like Shen, Xerath, and Diana who can alter their play to compensate for reduced gold going into the mid game. But for others like Veriger, Viktor, Vel'koz, that gimped income can create a huge deficit. \n\nAnd let's not forget, Yasuo (a \"hyper carry\" according to Riot) has early power spikes. His first one coming at 2500 gold (static Shiv), and the second at 6300 (Infinity Edge). That means he's getting his first major power spike while most mages are just solving their mana problems (Morello-2300, Rod of Ages-2700, Archangel's-3000) or finishing their defense items (Iceborn Gauntlet-2850, Zhonya's-3000, Rod of Ages-2700, Rylai's-3000).\n\n-----------------------------\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not calling him OP. I'm also not saying he has *no* counter-play. But Yas' kit allows him to bypass his own weaknesses. He's squishy but has a low CD shield and his windall. He's short ranged but his high mobility. He's melee but with a long range hard CC zoning tool and [ult] initiation. He has to multi-hit minions with his Q, but has a long grace period and low CD to bypass mistakes. His ult requires a ~~knock-up~~ displacement, which he has on a 12 second minimal cooldown.\nHe has tons of safety nets built into his kt in case he makes a mistake. But he punishes enemies incomparably hard for making *any*.","replies":[{"poster":"1800HookMyLane","date":"2015-10-21T17:19:00.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is not even a valid suggestion.

Or at all, which makes your grasp of his state of balance particularly fascinating. You sound exactly like one of those people that complains endlessly about a champ that you never play and never have played. You wanna know how to learn how to beat a champion? Play them a few times and get your ass kicked. No champion seems as annoying or OP to play against after you've played them a bit yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Ratbert","date":"2015-10-23T03:12:35.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps, but everyone i've ever griped about that I had the misfortune of playing turned out to be just as bs as I thought except for quicktime event champs. I'd imagine if you had the nerve to survive those it would be super duper easy. You don't need to play a champ that's horrid on paper to know if it's horrid in game. Oh and as annoying doesn't mean still isn't horrible to play against or any less OP.\n\nOther than my last comment, I merely reasoned about your posts or used stats, not personal opinions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
