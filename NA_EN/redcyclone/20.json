I think the major issue is that so much of her damage is frontloaded onto her (E) Twin Fangs that it makes her others spells just an accessory to enable you to spam out more Twin Fangs which is a pretty bad feeling. \n\nHer new passive is also pretty bad, it definitely has the feast or famine feel to it. If you're doing extremely well or extremely poorly in lane chances are you won't be getting as many stacks as if you were trading evenly. If you are completely shutting down the opponent, they're probably hiding under tower and you won't be able to poison them for more stacks. On the other hand if you're getting completely shit on, you won't be able to get many stacks either. I just don't really like a champion that has a ramp up time of at least 30+ minutes. It's almost impossible to get to 500 stacks before the 30 minute mark regardless of how well you're doing which is a pretty shitty feeling. Besides that, with the nerfs to her mana cost, it requires her to build a mana item, so you're pretty restricted to RoA or Tear, which in a lot of cases is fine, but it does limit her gameplay.\n\nI just want them to reward you for winning lane; if I'm crushing someone in lane, I should be ramping up with Aspect of the Serpent stacks much more quickly.
