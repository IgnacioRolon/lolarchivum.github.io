Sword for only 1250 now compared to any amount of substantial armor or health a support can actually build on their crap income. Not to mention Utility supports can get assists for just throwing out a shield, but as a tank you can literally TANK the crap out of some damage, or an ult etc and if your ADC gets a kill and you never touched the Enemy = no assist = no gold.\n\n Mana regen and the removal of blue pots was a nail in the coffin for a lot of supports as well who are extremely mana heavy until they are able to get their first regen item... but ofc Sightstone comes first.  As a support Main i have to say my time in the bot lane feels pretty crappy, I'm basically a ward bot who gets no gold income or compenstation, Even assist gold can feel crappy especially when the Jungler or the ever roaming mid is involved= less gold for me.

The gw nerf made ignite bot moronic,as you kinda want to ignite the adc to mitigate heal,which imo is a completely moronic interaction,but I digress) ignite on them:\n1) lower elos: \"I deal damage might as well get more of it\",not much logic here,but whatever.\n2) higher elos: See all of these guys are more vulnerable than most supports,and are pretty much forced to fight and lack disengage,ignite is stronger in 2v2 fights,so they take it to help their chances if one of them starts.\n3) support mains will often opt for ignite to try and force an advantage out of getting a role they are comfortable in.(this has little to do with it being a tank support/utility support/mage support),you'd even see good janna players go ignite,but that was before the moronic gw nerf,not sure what goes on now.\n\n**So my point is**: it's not cause it's a kill lane,it's because it's rather easy to force them into a fight they can't back out of,so they take ignite to help with their chances if that happens,or to discourage their opponents from forcing such a scenario in the first place.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kubox","date":"2016-02-20T16:10:09.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thresh is not supposed to build Relic though.

I make literally no attempt to stop a kill. If the ADC can obviously get it I will pull back, but if they aren't already on top of things, I will take every single one.\n\nI can see why support must be boring though since I play champ that can carry a game if she gets fed. My ADC can become useless but if Morg gets fed, she can make picks if she lands a good Q, or ult Zhonyas in the dead middle of the enemy. I have won games due to that actually. Stopped supporting the ADC but made myself the threat, in turn feeding the ADC from assist, kills if they actually can do it, or just free farm. Sure the ADC may get pissy and nonsense, but when they free farm a good 100 CS, get a few assist and catch back up and actually can contribute again, they are thankful, even if a lot don't actually say it.\n\nThe big problem I see with support is truthfully not the support role. Its the community. They always complain about things instead of actually being smart and learning to counter it so they get nerfed into the ground and I see the community as the reason Support got destroyed. People cried for Sona nerfs, Janna nerfs, repeat nerfs on Soraka. Then they cry when Thresh and Janna are in every game. The community is at fault here and until they stop crying, it won't get better. In the past I used to see Raka, Sona, Janna, Naut, Blitz, Thresh, Leona, Braum, Lulu, Morg just to name a few ALL THE TIME. Who do you see now? Morg, Janna and Thresh.

Even if I play like a god, it still doesn't matter. It's 100% reliant on if my teammates _want_ to get the kills I'm handing to them. I can lead them to water, but I cant make them drink. My role is basically try to peel, and set up kills, but my individual play isn't rewarded at all. This might just be part of the _Plat Experience (tm)_ but it fucking sucks. I feel so useless. I feel like I have to fucking be madlife every game and snowball every single lane to even stand a chance of winning. This is so wrong. Every role should have an equal chance to carry, and support shouldn't be the exception. Why should I have to give up the role I like playing and learn something completely new in order to climb ranks? This could also be due to the meta shift, how adcs aren't as strong as they used to be, but I still feel like the support role needs more latent carry potential. Even taking a page out of DotA's book and having supports actually do (dare I say) DAMAGE would be a step in the right direction.

Trinkets now fill that position. They are doubling up on their function, and there isn't any real reason, in my opinion, we can't balance the game around no sightstone.\n\nAfter all, Riot already nerfed yellow trink because they thought it granted too much vision in the game. I have always wondered why they didn't just remove sightstone to solve that problem. The only reason supports buy it is because they basically HAVE to. None of them want to, for the same reason that other lanes don't.\n\nFact is, supports, especially non-peel or engage supports, are going to be weak the way they are balanced now. That is because they are balanced around low gold income, but ALSO have to be balanced around the possibility of taking them into a solo lane. The reason that matters is because they can buy items in a solo lane, and can't as support.\n\nIf that paradigm changes, support options open up. They don't have to be so weak with items if they are allowed to have them in solo and duo lanes. That's always been the problem, and it's the only long-term solution possible to save the role and make it more desirable. I long for the day that people actually enjoy support. \n\nIt can be done right in many other genres. Take TF2 for instance. Nothing scarier than a good medic. But with the way League works, it's not nearly as simple as the FPS medic. We need to recognize that and start thinking about the underlying causes, instead of defending the status quo which clearly isn't working.\n\nEDIT: Read your comment again after I wrote my rant. I think my point to specifically address you is this; you act like it's the supports sole job to ward, but that shouldn't the case anymore. Everyone has access to a sightstone like item. It isn't as much about balancing support around it, it's about balancing VISION around 5 trinket slots. That can be done. \n\nSo I am not swayed by any arguments about the support being unable to do ALL the vision upkeep. They shouldn't have to. That's my whole point, and it's why people don't like support. That isn't a fun job. It should be the whole team's job. That's more fun and more healthy. As long as the support is the \"keeper of wards and sweepers\" no one will like playing them. That's not a fun status quo to defend. It's one of the more negative parts of LoL that has stuck around as a artifact, in my opinion, and it's time for it to go.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SnazzyTheMister","date":"2016-02-20T17:33:15.349+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i think one of the biggest problem with supports is the communitys view of them. they've changed alot is the past seasons and until the mentality around supports changes its going to be hard to make good changes to the role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NichtHurz","date":"2016-02-20T07:24:57.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, I think it might be justified to have a look at the support role and even though supports seem to be quite hard to balance in terms of what fits the meta and compositions, support actually feels like a role with some of the most diverse champs in terms of gameplay.
