The only way that would work is if the support in question had a completely abysmal kit for laning. Only a hand full of champion could do that. (maybe Sona and Soraka.) But if a support had any wave clear at all. They could take the solo lane, get solo lane gold, Build AP, and have more utility than their support Counterpart. Prior to the Zillian Rework the different between support ult and mid ult, was Barely saving your life, and 0-100. \n\nThe real problem is that Supports can't afford much.

Unless your talking about Baring supports from the mid lane, but that's kind of a lazy way to approach that.\n\nIf Any champ started showing up in a different position. Sometimes becoming OP or Oppressive. When that happens, Riot obviously has to look at the WHY. And Decide whether it's something worth supporting. If it's OP, but worth supporting, Riot will try to balance them around the new position. (and try to retain strengths of their former position) But we still have to accept the fact that Mid lane Lulu will have stronger utility than Support Lulu. If it's not worth supporting, then they gut the champion.\n\nRiot does not want to have too much say about where champions should go. (thou does have opinion on where some champs shouldn't go) They still have to balance around the most OP build. Yet some of the best Flex picks that can do well in more lanes, do so by taking on a different role, which may involve different build paths. (Ekko had like 3 different build paths in the LCS. One for each position he was used) The best flex champions can fill multiple roles, regardless of which one he's balanced for.","replies":[{"poster":"AutoreactiveCD4","date":"2015-08-04T18:32:03.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately in the case of Lulu, the changes they made to Lulu to balance her around solo lanes made her a much weaker support. \n\nI still think diminishing returns may be a useful way to help certain AP supports considering their low budget.

Which means for a combination cost of 500, you get one fairy charm, and a Quarter of an amplifying tome. Which isn't even 300 gold worth of stats. So for this to be even worth on paper, the tribute passive, which increase from 10 to 15 bonus damage and 5-10 gold on proc, would have to be worth at least 200 gold. And yet at best, that is a max of 15 extra damage and gold, every 30 seconds. \n\nin comparison, Medialion gets, a fairy charm, half a rejuvenation bead. 2GP10, +10 MS speed (2/5ths of a boot), and it's passive is entirely doubled. when upgraded from coin.\n\nTargons has, upgraded from relic shield, 2/3rds of a ruby crystal, a Rejuvination bead, And it's passive gains 10 extra health with a stronger execute, all at double the frequency.\n\nSo Frost Fang is literally the worst investment of 500 gold. If you wanted to make that better, increase the on hit damage from 15 to 20 damage. Maybe increase the AP to 15. And for Frost queen's, do the same but give a slight damage ratio on the tribute passive. \n\nThe problem with Frost queen's is that it was originally balanced to be the high risk high reward item. But people with less than perfect CS complained about supports having Mid level gold. considering that riot has also buffed the GP10 on the \"low risk item\" it is becoming clear that differences in gold gen, wasn't a good way to differentiate between them.

They aren't good at all stages of the game, some are rather bad at winning games early but do fine later, then there are some that are far more effective early and loses effectiveness as the game goes on. Just look at Braum who doesn't win much early but starts winning more often later, then Blitz/Leona who has an opposite trend. Mean while champions like Sona and Janna both remain highly effective at all points in the game. You have coin with a nonexistent cool down that can be used both offensively or defensively, mean while the tank version is on a much longer cool down and is only usable in an offensive situation then there's a cleanse, free stats/damage for a carry etc.\n\nSaying supports \"get no ap\" is pointless when they are -supports-, you are supporting your allies, and all their items reflect that.

But on the flip side, supports can't actually afford AP items. And this is my point actually with Lulu, If theses support have scaling, they do better in lane.\n\nBut the problem with Tank support is that they don't actually need tank items. If they get tank items, that's a bonus, but they get so much mileage out of just their kit. And that's ultimately what should happen with AP Supports.

Then Riot removed Zeke's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"R3ginaGeorg3","date":"2015-08-04T13:35:25.352+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I play support  most of the time (Mostly because I hate the waiting time for a supp in queue), and I agree with you on the FACT that support items suck for the most part; and that the dependency on your ADC usually makes you fall off the second you are by yourself. However, I also have to agree with adding more AP to those items not being the solution.\n\nI think that the support role needs to be diversified and strengthened, and since we can't directly change champion's stats because it might have terrible effects on  other lanes, items would have to be the way to go. \n\nTo begin with, it sucks that as the support you are ALWAYS behind in gold and XP... always! Of course, if your AD is doing great, you will both be ahead of the enemy team... but you are always still behind your ADC (And just because you are the support and your job is to help/protect the adc, it shouldn't mean you always have to be sacrificing something for it... HELL you are already sacrificing EVERYTHING for it [it = ADC].\n\nI think the gold income from support items needs to be increased, either by giving more gold, or giving the same gold but in shorter spurs of time. I have a support rue page where i run gold quints and all that, but at the cost of always being slightly weaker early levels and that SUCKS and it's unfair!\n\nMaybe make a support specific summoner spell (i know exhaust is the go-to, but listen here....) that when chosen, just like smite, makes a certain item at the shop available for the champ running that summoner. Then, with that particular item, we could give supports better stats so they can be AT LEAST at the same level as their ADC. \n\nAnother problem with supports always falling behind, is also being left behind. While LoL is supposed to be a \"Team Game\" we all know that it is VERY rare when a team actually plays/behaves like one (unless you are a premade 5 person team ). So in my experience as support, unless I have a good friend being my ADC, as soon as i am able to get 3-4 kills under my ADC's wing, they tend to start getting cocky and doing more solo things around the map. Once they have 3 good items or so, they could not care less about what happens to the support, and as the support, since your items are all utility and suck, you spend a good deal of time running behind allies in order to get some fun out of late game.. else, you might be able to clear the weaker jungle camps while the damage dealers of your team eat up the enemy base at their own pace.\n\nAnd it would have to be through Items, if they try to change the champ stats to try and help out, they will probably end up damaging great champs like they did with Zyra. She started as a mid mage, but because her stats (and CC and range) were really great, and her ability kit is extremely powerful) people started running her as support, so she got super nerfed... now she is hardly ever seen mid, and even as support... \nI love her and main her, and play her as Mid/Supp/JG, and when I ask my friend why they don't play her they all say the same... \" She is way too squishy/base health is awful, her plants are TOO EASY to destroy (always compared to Heimer turrets, not only the turret do more damage, and take longer to kill, they are also easier to place in terms of CDR and Mana spent), and that she has no mobility... her base movement speed is awful, and unless you land a good root, or slowing plant near the enemy... you'll be deforested.  SO for the sake of those mid lane mages who are still decent supports, do NOT suggest that rito fix their stats.\n\nI don't honestly know if I made any sense now that I read all I wrote, I am just ranting, I know.... but yeah. I agree that in order to be a useful team player, and also have fun playing late game as support, you have to be selfish and \"Sacrifice\" a couple of item slots and get whatever items you want because you deserve it! (Sorry not sorry I didn't get a mikael's and got a morello instead!)\n\nRant over\n\n-RG","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nekusen","date":"2015-08-05T06:31:05.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a new item idea i got \n- **Mysterious Trinket**: 365 G\n\nGenerates 1 Gold every 10 seconds.\nGenerates 1 Gold every time you cast a spell.
