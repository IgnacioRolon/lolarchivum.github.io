As long as his Lantern both saves allies from a distance and brings them in for a gank, his Flay can interrupt channeling and dashes, his hook serves as both a stun and mobility (even for his ally when combined with lantern), and his Ult provides reasonable disengage through slowing, Thresh will be the same Thresh.\n\nIn other words, I think you need to gut a mechanic or two from his kit before anything changes.

That this 2.21% are all Madelife Wannabes? I mean, you've got to be completely and utterly delusional. \n\nThresh has a huge pick rate in higher play because he's got so much more utility in his kit compared to others. It's not a bunch of pro wannabes... it's his kit being so damn overloaded. Q is the only ability that doesn't have dual usage. His W is used to bring allies to him to save them or help initiate AND if he's behind, he can actually use it to collect souls from a distance. His E passively affects his AA's, enhancing them for a LOT of damage while the active does a decent amount while also pulling enemies OR pushing them. His R is a slow that acts practically as a Veigar E since people don't want to hit the walls, but they sure as heck can't stay inside.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RedCyclone","date":"2015-10-24T18:49:21.114+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"http://lol.gamepedia.com/2015_World_Championship/Champion_Statistics\n\nhttp://www.lolking.net/charts?region=all&type=bottom-synergy&range=daily&map=sr&queue=normal","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Beddlam","date":"2015-10-25T16:14:52.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:12}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:223}}  Thresh is fine.

Probably he is too much a jack of all trades but he is not overbearing and leaves a lot of form of tactical and strategical counterplay. Since he is powerful he can bring value to the team, so he is picked consistently.\n\nProbably he is among one of the best support champions ever designed for this reason, paired to Braum in my opinion.
