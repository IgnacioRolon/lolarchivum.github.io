On paper, it was a good idea: Support champs have their utility scale. Stuns become longer, slows become more powerful, movement speed boosts have a longer duration, heals get stronger, etc.\n\nThe problem came from two issues:\n\n1) Utility scaled with AP, which is something support itemization even today can have a lot of trouble with. Getting 200 AP on a support can be a challenge sometimes.\n\n2) Riot was afraid to let utility be powerful. The scaling started out very weak and wasn't able to scale up to anything impressive even with massive amounts of AP. We imagined {{champion:117}} turning allies into the Flash, {{champion:26}} basically slowing people into a snare for an ungodly duration, {{champion:44}} auras giving entire teams thousands of gold worth of stats, etc. Instead, what we got was underwhelming and not much more powerful utility than before the scaling was introduced.\n\n\"Hey guys, you know how you have a 40% slow on your support champ? Well now with utility scaling you can have a 45% slow! If you build 250 AP. And the slow starts off at 15% and only increases with AP. And you'll most likely only reach this AP total right before the game ends. Doesn't that sound like a buff to you?\" - Riot Games circa Post-Season 3, Pre-Season 4.","replies":[{"poster":"Mandang0","date":"2015-08-04T18:04:56.258+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the problem with utility ratios is far more general than that.  Traditional supports are a class meant to operate on low gold - this is why they're focused around buffs and peels that remain relevant because the person you cast them for is able to scale with items.  For these champions to have fair powercurves, this also requires their spells to otherwise scale less than others' spells.  This is why Riot was nerfing solo lane supports for a long time - because they don't want those champions to have the best of both worlds, and that's fair.\n\nThe issue becomes when Riot tries to achieve a support \"fantasy\" by pushing more gold into the role.  Now this low-gold niche of traditional supports is gone, and you see champions who scale better with gold become more competitive options.  Utility ratios were Riot's answer to this, but forcing supports to build AP to access these makes them build like a mage support, someone who will still use that AP better than the support unless the support has amazing ratios, which brings us back to the problem in the first paragraph.  \n\nThere's any number of alternate solutions Riot could've pursued, but the core problem is that they tried to push gold onto a class that was intended to operate with low gold.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-08-04T04:32:37.807+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, Janna is the highest win rate support and has one of the highest pick rates.\n\nBut yes, there is a definite bias towards tankier champions (and Morgana) in the support role.

This was the problem in S3, and I imagine it'll still be a problem if Thresh/Leona/Morgana are ever dislodged from atop the support class (for an appreciable amount of time).","replies":[]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-08-04T03:39:30.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really hate playing as Soraka and not knowing what the hell to build after my essentials because there's nothing helpful and I have no idea what I am.

ADC itemization is actually probably the most versatile of all itemization builds, it's the rest of the meta that determines which items have the highest kill potential for an adc so most of the time it's a moot point.\n\nCompared to Support ADC is fine. When you literally only see 2 to three champs every game for support because there is absolutely no one better for that role, you know you have a huge issue. the Tanky meta and it's two major counters is a horrible position to be in. when you have to play support you should be able to be flexible with your picks to make better team comps but since tanky supports have just as much (if not more in so many cases) utility as a utility support you know something is wrong. The best example I can see is Sona vs braum/leona where they have more utility than the actual utility support, AND they both literally outscale the crap out of her. Usually when I play sona support I go \"fuck it I'll grab luden's/lich/archangel's and one shot the adc. that way even if I have less impact on a teamfight than the leona or braum I did get that bitch down.\" (pardon my language) it points to really poor balancing when one champion can have more impact than another with a kit that does virtually the same thing.","replies":[{"poster":"KatCraft","date":"2015-08-05T12:22:02.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only 3 supports?

There's someone that can do what they can do but better. Nami is one that I personally love but realized very quickly that her kit is simply too lackluster.

If your adc can capitalize better with attack speed, you rush BORK, Bloodthirster isn't what it used to be, but if you need the extra health (and heavy assassin meta's basically necessitate this kind of build) it's a good damage alternative. Any AD caster type benefits from blue build for poking down champs. It really comes down to how your ADC is doing it's job in the current game. synergy only goes so far when building a champ, and sometimes you need to bite the bullet and just build BORK to shred tanks or build IE to two-three shot squishies because that's how the game is going.\n\nI will admit that Crit RNG is awful, though I think that ashe provides some great insight to how Crit could work. make it simply a reliable damage multiplier that can only be obtained through glass cannon items, and voila RNG removed, and damage gets equalized across the board. Though this is only a theory and could radically change the meta across the board in unintended ways. Biggest issue is that everything is balanced around the ADC and while itemization is fairly stale it's mostly because they have the least dynamic role. They only have one job, deal damage. How they accomplish it is mostly up to their kit and not really items.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rallen320","date":"2015-08-04T02:48:25.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think someone pointed this out, but supports have (kinda) gotten 2 updates already, one with the \"utility scaling\", the other being Shurelya's attempt to help them out way back when.  the utility scaling never really went any where, as for Shurelya's update, while it might not have much of an impact on the game any more, i think it proved that many people really have no idea how to balance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Loveless","date":"2015-08-04T11:04:46.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Supports got lots of items over the last two seasons.

Your right supports have gotten a few cool new items while ADC's haven't really gotten anything for a while.  But the roles are a different story, imagine if only 2 ADC's were viable for the last two seasons.  Or better yet, imagine if they started putting out ADC's with either passive movement speed buffs, {{champion:429}} (imagine 3 characters like her)  or passive on hit tricks like Vayne (again imagine if there were 3 more characters like her)  or even more fun combine the two.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Syvenon","date":"2015-08-04T05:44:37.176+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh gosh.

So you have dropped 2200 gold and filled an item slot, with an item that gives very low AP; small amount of CR; a small movement speed bonus, and standard tier 3 mana regen.  The upsides of the item are that it's cheaper then the other mana regen support items and that it gives that small boost.  Down sides it's weakest of all of them, and it's bonuses really only shine on 1-2 characters.  Keep in mind that while you probably want to keep eye of the storm up as much as possible most other supports don't want to throw out a heal or shield on to an ally that's pretty much already topped off just so they can activate an item's passive buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Wakamune","date":"2015-08-04T17:56:18.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> most other supports don't want to throw out a heal or shield on to an ally that's pretty much already topped off just so they can activate an item's passive buff.\n\nDisagree. Even without ardent, the AP mid, for example, isn't going to benefit much from the AD bonus and the shield is likely to break before they even auto. At least with 40% cooldowns Janna can pick between offensive and defensive use with her shield.\n\nAnd if the fight is obviously won or you are taking down a tower, why would you not heal/shield as a top off for damage buff? It's like saying Nidalee's AS boost has no purpose with her team. .","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
