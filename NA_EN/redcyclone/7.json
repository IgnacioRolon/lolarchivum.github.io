Other supports can give 1 or 2 teammates a buff at a time, Sona can have a team of 5 people with up to 3 different buffs.\n\nI don't think she's forced to build AP, in fact I find these nerfs are to discourage her from doing so.

Sona does poorly in a solo lane since you just need to shove the wave to her turret constantly and then proceed to poke her down while he tries to uselessly cs under the turret and fail. Not sure against what type of players you have been paired up with that you can get away by playing solo lane Sona but i wouldn't want to be in their team since even beginner bots would do better than them.\n\nSona as it is right now has quite a few issues, her bases are stupidly low, her bases are stupidly low and if you need to be anything but a walking ult you need to built some amount of AP but at the same time you need to build some amount of resistances otherwise you will just blow up the instant anyone even notices you. Her shield duration is too short for it to be of any use outside of big teamfights with massive AoE all over the place since you know you will block some damage. Her E is pretty bad at actually buffing her team, most of the time you will end up a lot farther ahead from your team than intended and quite sometimes you will need to stop just to let your team catch up to you. Then there's Q which pretty much acts as the go to \"let's nerf this instead of buffing the other skills so they are actually good\" skill\n\nAnother issue Sona has is that for some reason every time Riot deems her early game is too strong they hurt her mid to late game as well so now you have a Sona that not only has a weaker laning phase but also a weaker mid and late game just because \"herp derp\" nerfs instead of actually well throughout ones.\n\nI main Sona and i'm not afraid to pick her against any comp, she is useful and unless they completely destroy her skills she will always be but Riot for some reason want her to do little to no damage at all when that is one of her main defining aspects, she is the support champion that does more damage than your average support","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-01-27T16:50:01.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good news.
