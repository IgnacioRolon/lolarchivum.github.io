Resolution to my ticket after changing every possible setting on my pc:\n\nThank you for the logs you have provided.\n\nWish I had better news, but it looks like your connection to our servers is passing through a bad node that's outside of your ISP's network, there's nothing we can do from your side, but we're going to use the info you've provided to investigate further and resolve the issue.\n\nI can't provide an estimate for how long this will take but it's our top priority at this point in time.
