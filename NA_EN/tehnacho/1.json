I ignore Thresh for obvious reasons). In some bizarre cases, it&#039;s even exceedingly efficient on Assassin like champions or more gold efficient than most other options as early as the 2nd or 3rd items to rush.\n\nRiot, you mention last whisper once in the surrender@20 article about the preseason:\n&gt;Last Whisper is now a component item. It builds into new things.\n\nand I hope this means what I think it means, but can you guys please tell us clearly if this item still operates on total armor instead of, for example, bonus armor, or if some mathematician of yours briefly went over it and made sure it&#039;s not ridiculously overtuned for fighting squishies or for Assassins to use?\n\nOn a related note, a more detailed statement on how the AD itemization changes are expected to affect AD Assassins would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAnd I guess it&#039;d be nice to end this thread on a high note. Thank you guys for the whole &quot;who/how do I want to fight&quot; ideal that the marksman changes are striving for. It really does get most of my grievances with marksmen and their play style out of the way, and helps solve another part of the &quot;League of stat checking&quot; problem I&#039;ve noticed in some games.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-10-28T22:23:22.107+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Last Whisper's now cheaper, can upgrade into a couple of different options, and works against bonus Armor instead of total Armor.","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2015-10-28T22:29:55.925+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">works against bonus Armor instead of total Armor.\n\nTHANK YOU.\n\nOh, I think I should be more specific with the second to last part.

Last whisper will only affect bonus armor... So... Imagine how this baby will now stack with Yasuo's passive... Like, 50% bonus armor pen from yasuo's ult passive and 35% bonus armor pen from lw... it will give you 67% bonus armor pen... That is kind of good news... i suppose... Nah, not really, given the fact that most tanks have high BASE ARMOR... So... What about other assassins then??? Zed or talon, Reangar or Kha'Zix that do not have  a passive similar to yasuo? Since the last whisper will have upgrades, i take it that those upgrades will also only work on bonus armor... So... You will be an assassin that cannot assassinate...

Assassinate a squishy using flat pen items instead. \n\nWhile I pretty much only play AP champs and it will hurt, I hope they give void staff the same treatment for consistency.","replies":[{"poster":"VasilisGreen","date":"2015-10-29T14:34:50.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look... ADCs like draven, graves and the sort have a high base armor value. 81 for Draven and 78 for Graves... If they buy one armor item and have a scaling armor set of seals in their rune setup, they will have 27 armor at lvl18... So, by only ignoring 40% of their bonus armor, if they have, let's say a GA, and the scaling armor runes, Draven will have 158 armor and graves 185 armor with his passive stacked up fully... So, with the last whisper items, Draven will have 127 effective armor and graves will have142 effective armor. So, even if you go full armor pen runes and a youmus for a total of 39 flat armor pen, Draven will still have 88 effective armor and Graves will have 113 effective armor... Still enough to make quick assassinations impossible while in a teamfight and add that GA effect and/or the heals coming from teammates... \n\nDoing so with Magic pen will nor have that big of an impact because you have both more flat pen options and everyone has less base mr than armor. An exception to that is thresh that doesn't get any armor per level. So, with Magic pen in runes, liandrys and sorc boots you get 38 flat magic pen and everyone has 20-30 less base mr than armor. Some don't even get mr per level... Caitlyn and yasuo are the first that come to my mind, both have 30 base mr and don't scale by level. Zed has 86 armor at lvl 18 and 53 mr... Actualy, everyone i have checked has either 30 mr at all levels or 53.4 at level 18... So, with magic pen in runes, sorc boots and liandry's you either deal true damage or they have 15 effective mr... definitely not the same impact...","replies":[]},{"poster":"KMS Bismarck","date":"2015-10-29T14:36:42.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But we dont have enough armor pen with only ghost blade. :(","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cloud Potato","date":"2015-10-29T05:56:34.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might be cost efficient, but not necessarily slot efficient.
