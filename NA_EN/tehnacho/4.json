TSM took Kog'maw and drafted Lulu, Braum, Poppy, and someone else just to keep that Kogmaw alive and they still couldn't because bruiser damage was too strong, but to me when you have to pick an immobile marksman and then draft 3 other champions just to keep that champion alive and still can't that says there's probably some kind of issue.  \n\nI mean the top ADCs are Lucian, Ezreal, Corki, Graves, Quinn who all have mobility.  Kogmaw was picked just because his damage is insane.  That definitely says there's an issue right now and I think anyone pretending there isn't just doesn't understand the game.\n\nDamage and burst damage is just through the roof in this game right now and it makes not having extra movement too much of a liability.","replies":[{"poster":"Dan Abnormal","date":"2016-02-29T06:54:26.034+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"it was the gp damage, and gp with 2 IE is hardly a bruiser lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-02-29T01:02:59.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yup, that's actually the point of a bruiser. take a few hits, and still have relevant damage. relevant damage means that squishies should respect that character, which generally in turn means that the character needs to be able to hurt the squish a lot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maikal","date":"2016-02-29T00:24:18.518+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Because my op adcs should be able to kill melee champions before they reach me, and then if they DO somehow reach me I better have a knockback and stealth{{champion:67}} or infinite dashes/blinks {{champion:429}} {{champion:81}} to get away again and then kill them.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2016-02-28T20:13:30.796+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"People seem to be rather ignorant of this.

I mean, if you think about it, what's the point in squishies at all? You could just have a team of five bruisers and do fine other than the lack of ranged harass (which is really the biggest weakness of bruisers). If squishies didn't exist, we wouldn't need other squishies to counter those squishies.
