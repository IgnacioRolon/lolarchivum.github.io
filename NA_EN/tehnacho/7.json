Temporarily untargetable, percent health damage, 2 second stun without a longass delay, -restate the exact same statement three times in a row -, heals on hit, dropping down on enemies - restate the exact same thing a fourth time -, extra magic damage spiderlings, transformation ult for 7 abilities in total, a fifth rephrasing of the exact same thing, and 2 passives. \n\n[In reply to a certain Ekko thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/MA8EfNm8-ekko-are-you-serious). Is it really so necessary to complain about champions by only listing their strengths and not citing their weaknesses? I mean really, how easy do you honestly think it is that you can perfectly coordinate around his Parallel Convergence? That&#039;s like half of his kit being \"overloaded\" right there.","replies":[{"poster":"Extreme Troller","date":"2015-05-28T16:47:37.406+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"liberty of expression, but the thing that upset me, is the ekko thread is massively upvoted by noobs :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlytherinUmbreon","date":"2015-05-28T17:25:36.119+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My biggest problem with Ekko is that despite being a \"utility Assassin\" his kit doesn't function the way a Utility Mage's should. Because His shield Scale's for so much, and his Stun doesn't scale with levels, Ekko can basically put one point in that ability and get basically all of the strength out of it. So he can max everything else, Have high damage, and still get a 2.25 second stun + a huge shield at rank 1. Comparatively, most of Orianna's strength's are gated by her rank. She has to max q in order to get her full Zoning potential, she has to max her W in order to do damage, and if she doesn't max her shield it remains extremely weak. She can't just max one ability and get all of her damage and utility at once.\nI'd feel a lot better about Ekko if his stun just scaled with rank, and if he didn't have the second strongest shield in the game. (first if you decide to not count Karma's, since her shield is only stronger when she augments it with her ult.)\n\nEDIT: I get that his shield is stronger because he's Melee, and probably because he also can't cast it on other players, but it still feels wrong to have an assassin that kills just as well as all the other Assassins while also outscaling almost every utility mage","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-28T16:55:58.086+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"A kit that huge always spell out trouble, doesn't matter if he has actual weaknesses or not, it just shouldn't happen in a roster based tatical/strategy-ish game.","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2015-05-28T16:57:35.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you not read the part where Elise has 7 abilities.\n\n/satire","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-28T17:01:46.215+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TehNACHO,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nzBoEh0s,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-05-28T16:57:35.040+0000)\n>\n> Did you not read the part where Elise has 7 abilities.\n> \n> /satire\n\nAnd also the part where she has been trouble for quite some time which Riot simply decided to Eve her instead of actually trying to balance her due to the kit simply not being the balance-able kind.\n\nYet Riot just keeps shatting out overloaded kits for whatever reason anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-05-28T23:22:02.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Elise would be fine her her cocoon reset her ult cooldown tbh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SexyTaylorSwift","date":"2015-05-28T22:52:02.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because they sell the champs with overloaded kits to make money.

Elise has plenty of downsides these days.\n\nThe reason no one is listing any of Ekko's weaknesses is because he doesn't have any.  \"He's squishy\" is not a weakness.  Not with that kind of utility and mobility.  When you can take flash, have access to so many stuns and slows, and can also jump over walls and blink around, being squishy is nothing.  Those are some INCREDIBLY forgiving positioning tools he has.  \n\nI started playing this game in open beta and back then champions did like, ONE thing.  Not seven.  They also traded some things to be strong in other things and mobility and utility came at a huge cost.  Look at Ashe's old kit.

Kappa.\n\nEdit: What is he giving up? **Reliability.** Everything in his kit aside from his E and auto attacks are avoidable with proper positioning and counterplay, Ekko at his best is extremely dominant but at his worst he's useless.
