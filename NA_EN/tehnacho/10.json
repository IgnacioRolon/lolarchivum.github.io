I just don&#039;t see good justification for this.\n\n1) Crit carries are primarily DPS by nature, so their primary defense should be being Bursted down by raw damage. Defensive stats negates this as a fundamental weakness, which makes no sense. Maybe this could be justified if, for its defensive steroid, ADCs are also doing significantly less possible DPS by building this item, except\n\n2) Phantom Dancer grants the highest Attack Speed of the Zeal items, and therefore is the best DPS option as well (sans triple hitting off of Runaan&#039;s). This seemingly turning into the best ADC item doesn&#039;t even make sense when you consider that\n\n3) Phantom Dancer doesn&#039;t even represent an ADC play style or gimmick. ADCs poke from range {{item:3094}}, they are responsible for wave clear {{item:3087}}, they need to flexibly team fight and DPS {{item:3085}}, but they don&#039;t Tank through damage {{item:3046}}. _Maybe_ you can make a case that the Melee Crit carries do need that sort of tool, but that would at best turn the argument into &quot;Make Phantom Dancer a Melee only item&quot;. \n\nI&#039;ve put a few thoughts together \n\n1) Make Lament a stacking passive: This is the smallest change you can make to Phantom Dancer that could still make it do its current job, but also make it make more mechanical sense. If, instead of instantly applying a 12% Damage reduction, but instead a 3% Damage Reduction that stacks to 15% as you keep auto attacking a target, you are still playing by DPS champion rules. It still irks me that a Crit carry could potentially get free defensive steroids, but at the very least, you would still have the weakness of a normal ADC by having time commitments and being blasted before your damage can ramp.\n\n2) Nerf Phantom Dancer a lot: The least creative answer, and in my opinion the least fun.\n\n3) Rework Lament: You know what the Zeal item archetype doesn&#039;t have? Emphasis on ADCs kiting. Maybe, _dancing_ around their enemies? Give Phantom Dancer a passive similar to Furor, where every time you hit somebody, you get a move speed bonus. Maybe it&#039;s only active if your target is within a certain range of you, maybe it stacks, maybe it&#039;s a _massive_ move speed bonus that rapidly decays until you attack again. Just something that emphasizes proper orb walking and kiting.\n\nWhat do you guys think about Phantom Dancer?\n\nEDIT: Well apparently you guys _really_ like thinking you're a lone carry as ADCs. I'll keep that in mind.

A longstanding goal of ADC itemization was giving carries a way of opting into defensive options without completely gimping their offensive potential. We've seen a lot of changes in the ADC update and in the year preceding it aimed specifically at that goal. BT was given a shield, Death's Dance and its damage mitigation was introduced, and PD had damage mitigation attached. It's why we added Merc Scemitar as a QSS upgrade option a long time ago. That was specifically the goal. You may not like it, but it was absolutely the direction that Riot intended to go with ADC itemization.\n\n> so their primary defense should be being Bursted down by raw damage. Defensive stats negates this as a fundamental weakness, \n\n\"Negates\" is far too strong a word. \"Slightly mitigates\" is a more accurate description, particularly given how at any given time at least 4 members of the enemy team will be unaffected and free to apply all the burst they want.\n\n>Phantom Dancer grants the highest Attack Speed of the Zeal items, and therefore is the best DPS option as well\n\nIf you discount how all of the other items give some form of damage boost, I suppose. Even in the late game situations where it starts to be true, I'd cite this more as an example of the mediocrity of RFC.\n\n> Phantom Dancer doesn't even represent an ADC play style or gimmick. \n\nNone of the items do. They don't represent \"playstyles\", and the playstyles you cited are contrived ways of trying to make this fit your argument. Each just gives a specific benefit that carries can make use of, and at least 3 of them offer a strength that carries could normally lack. Runaan's gives multitarget DPS (something that is very explicitly NOT a normal ADC characteristic), Shiv gives waveclear with some AoE burst (and again, it's normally not the ADC who is responsible for waveclear), PD gives protection against whoever you're autoing (safer dueling and assassin protection), and RFC gives a bit of poke/burst. None of these are playstyles. They're just smaller strengths.\n\nHell, if you really need a \"playstyle\" excuse, here you go: A large number of AD carries fight 1 on 1. The item supports that playstyle. Boom. There you go.\n\n>I've put a few thoughts together \n\nYour first two suggestions are predicated on the idea that PD is strong enough to need nerfs. I strongly disagree with that notion. It's purchased less often than hurricane, isn't more successful, and fulfills a useful niche. Your personal distaste for defensive options for ranged carries doesn't persuade me. I see nothing to indicate that the item is in any way out of line.\n\n>You know what the Zeal item archetype doesn't have? Emphasis on ADCs kiting.\n\nYes, they do. They all give movement speed, enough to help you kite easily. This is important to keep in mind, because it means that if you're going to distinguish this item from the movement speed the zeal line already offers through a furor effect without leaving it terribly weak, you'd need to make it strong enough to easily keep them away from immobile champions. The potential for AD carries to do that is already a sticking point for a large number of players. If your goal is to make itemization less annoying, you're not going to do a great job.\n\n>What do you guys think about Phantom Dancer?\n\nI think it's a very normal item that isn't worth this much consideration.","replies":[{"poster":"Gregor Gysi","date":"2016-11-03T22:55:51.784+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why isn't your post at the top?

When Tank Yasuo was at its strongest, the predominant build did not purchase the item within the first two items, and often did not buy the item throughout the game. Until the ult's armor penetration was tied to crit, it wasn't a necessary item. Even now, I'd argue that its importance to the build is overshadowed by the items that actually make him tanky (Frozen Mallet).\n\nIt helps, but the build would continue to function without it, just as it did before.\n\n>Honestly on a large amount of champions, even non-adc champions I have been selling my boots and buying PD on them when games go into extreme lategame\n\nOf course. That's fairly expected. Selling boots for a slot efficient movement speed item has been standard practice since at least Season 1. The main reason PD is the item of choice for this is because it's the only real option. Shiv and RFC don't scale well into the late game, particularly on melee champions (which pretty much incorporates all non-ADC champions who would consider this an option). Hurricane of course doesn't work at all.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-11-03T19:25:23.792+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Phantom dancer is intended to be an item for ADCs who want to duel.
