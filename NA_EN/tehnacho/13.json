If this is the case, why is it so effective against enemies with low health?\n\nLet's just say, as an example, you rush the Blade of the Ruined King as your first item. If you are primarily an auto attack based champion, the % health shred on hit might as well be AD in this specific example. [The wiki page](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Blade_of_the_Ruined_King) states that for the Blade of the Ruined King to be 100% gold efficient is if the ~~active and~~ passive effects have a gold value of 550 gold. % Shred might as well be AD for this example, AD has a gold value, let's figure this out. Basic math tells us that 550 gold worth of AD is about ~15 AD. Okay, how much health must your target have in order for the % shred to do 15 damage? Once again, basic math brings us to the answer: about ~191 Health. \n\nI'd just like to point out at this point that the on hit % health shred calculates on *current* health. In other words, if you are to 100 to 0 somebody by auto attacking them over and over, on average the % current health shred would be calculating 50% of the enemy's total health. What this means is that the ~191 health thing is almost entirely inaccurate; we need to double that value to find out how much *total* health the opponent has for the Blade of the Ruined King to be gold efficient. In other words, we're actually looking at ~382 health. What this means is, if we treat the Blade of the Ruined King's passive as AD for auto attack based champions, your opponent only needs to have 382 health in order for the item to be 100% gold efficient.\n\n...wait what. **382** health? *Anivia* doesn't even have that little health ***at level 1***. Why is the health threshold to make the Blade of the Ruined King gold efficient so low?!\n\nIt's really dumb to be frank. If we're looking at the Blade of the Ruined King's combat stats all alone and remove the Life Steal from its gold value, the target only needs 764 health to make the Blade of the Ruined King gold efficient *disregarding the Life Steal*. That's right folks, the Blade of the Ruined King pays for itself as a combat item, *and* gives you Life Steal to top yourself off.\n\nNow anybody who has a basic understanding how Auto Attack DPS *really* works will know something's totally off with these calculations: Critical Chance. The Blade of the Ruined King's passive does not interact with Critical Chance the same way that *actual* AD works. \"Well looks like these calculations are pointless then, I'm an AD Carry, I'm going to be investing in a buttload of Crit Chance anyway\". Well, let's stop to think about it for a moment. Let's just say, even though it's kind of unlikely to achieve this without the most skewed Crit Chance builds, you have 100% Critical Chance. What this means is that the value of AD essentially doubles. Remember how it took the target having ~382 health to make the passive worth 550 gold's worth of AD? Doubling this means that in order for the Blade of the Ruined King's passive to be gold efficient (based off AD) even when you're at 100% critical chance is that your target needs at least 764 health. Now, let's say you also have the Infinity Edge. Multiply ~382 by 2.5 to find out how much health the target needs to have to make the passive gold efficient, and you get a grand total of...~955 health. \n\nWhat.\n\nIf you have 100% Crit Chance with the Infinity Edge's extra 50% modifier, your target only needs to have about 955 health in order for the Blade of the Ruined King to remain cost efficient. Dumbly enough, your opponent only needs 1910 health to make the item cost efficient *if we disregard the lifesteal*. That's right folks, by the late game, not only is your Blade of the Ruined King going to be cost efficient as fuck even if you have 100% Crit Chance *and* an Infinity Edge, but because many champions go well above 1910 health by level 18 without buying a single Health item, you also get 10% Life Steal *essentially for free*.\n\nUgh. Look, I understand the point of having an anti health item in general. It tones down the fabled League of Warmogs scenario I've been told about, it gives AD Carries something decisive to build in order to combat tanks, and in theory, it creates a niche pick item that invites strategic building. In execution though, this anti health item is gold efficient against targets who do not build health. No, wait, that's putting it too lightly. This anti health item is gold efficient against targets who aren't even anywhere near their maximum potential health, in some situations being super gold efficient even when champions aren't even level 1. All this does is phenomenally screw Tanks over the moment they do decide to invest into building health even harder than usual, and make a generic item with virtually no weaknesses and thus no reason not to buy it because it's still decidedly powerful even when it is at its weakest.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2015-01-20T19:20:58.654+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll bite! :D \n\nAn approximate level you might start to see BotrKs: 9 (usually)\nAn approximate amount of HP you might generally see at this level: 1400\n\nDamage on hit: 114.56 physical damage\n\n(These are using the tables we use internally, I don't know what other people use)\nValue of 1 AD = 36 gold\nValue of 1% ASPD = 33\nValue of 1% Lifesteal = 54\n\nProperties of 1 AD versus 1 Physical on Hit:\nCan be crit (50% down)\nCan be applied to spells (50% down)\n\n36 x 0.5 x 0.5 = 9\n9 x 114.56 = 1031.04 gold value from the on hit at level 9 against approximately median health, no items.\n(AD) 36 x 25 = 900\n(ASPD) = 1320\n(Lifesteal) = 540\n\n= 3791.04 total gold value (not counting active, those are hard to evaluate)\n\nceiling(3791.04) = 3792 gold\nVersus cost of 3200 = +18.50% efficient\n\nSo Blade of the Ruined King at level 9 against most champions who have not bought health has a +18.50% efficiency if you don't use its active.\n\nAverage efficiency percent for 2800+ gold items, using our stat values (approximate)** 34.26%**\n\nWhich means in order to reach value Blade of the Ruined King's active (at level 9, against champions who have not bought health) would need to be 504 gold.\n\nWhich it is not.

I'm just really curious though, what would the standard be for champions who do stack health?\n\nGetting a realistic value approximately equivalent to or exceeding the abstract value of 504 gold is an easy feat to achieve, from what past calculations of AD Carries I made way back when suggest. While I don't think this is bad - it's actually contextually correct that the tank busting item busts tanks - I really would like to know where the line is drawn when comparing the Blade of the Ruined King against tanks and that dichotomy with squishies. It's a pressing matter in my mind as if the bar is set far too low, all it does is hurt the super tanks who function at 4+ dedicated tank items. In fact, it's a large thing I was trying to aim for in the last paragraph of the original post. This item's apparent gold value seems to revolve pretty well (too well) around squishies...so what does it mean for tanks?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2015-01-20T21:46:52.741+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"I chose the level 9, median health values because they were predictable.\nOverall, it also shows that **compared to the other choices at that point in the game** blade of the ruined king is probably stat inefficient.\n\nOutput is different from value though.

Thanks. \n\nFor anyone that doesn't feel like reading a relatively uncoordinated novel by a rather opinionated author, below is a convenient TL;DR.\n\nTL;DR: I ended up ranting about how AD stats are overpowered compared to AP stats, thus making BoRK seem like a Billy Mays 'but wait there's more' kind of item. I make the argument that Riot undervalues AD and overvalues AP by comparing each stat and its related synergistic stats. I compare BoRK to its AP counterpart, Liandry's, where BoRK is stronger. Overall, the point is that the AD item tree doesn't need BoRK, it needs an overhaul as a collective group of stats. The '3/4 AD 2/1 AP' meta that's been going on just reinforces this idea, as AD items and champions tend to be more powerful/reliable than AP items and champions, ignoring the issues regarding resources and defensive items entirely.\n\nFor those of you that feel like spending a few minutes reading, here ya go:\n\nI would argue that AD stats are the most overpowered set of stats in the game. In fact, I would argue that Riot's internal values, generously provided by you, are very low.\n\nAP stats (spellvamp, flat AP, Magic Pen, CDR) are heavily restricted. Spell Vamp, due to its restrictions on AoE, is only effective on certain champions (which abuse the hell out of it.) Flat AP by and large only applies to abilities, and even then it's more often than not less than a 1:1 ratio. Magic Pen is restricted by only applying to magical damage (which is largely ability based and thus subject to cooldowns and skillshots), and CDR has a cap.\n\nChampions like Vladimir (who abuse spell vamp) are anomalies and do not represent the vast majority of all magic damage dealing champions. The necessity of keeping spell vamp intentionally underpowered is wise, though I would argue that immediately reworking problematic champions would be more wise.\n\nAD stats (lifesteal, critical strike, flat AD, armor pen, attack speed) by contrast are incredibly powerful and largely unrestricted.\n\nEvery champion in the game is capable of auto attacking. This means, at some level, all champions benefit from AD stats, obviously some more than others (such as Quinn vs. Xerath as an example.)\n\nAdditionally, CDR/AS are not restricted stats. Items like Nashor's Tooth and Brutalizer, to name two, have both AD and AP stats, but keep in mind that these 'shared stats' are in no way equal. Nashor's Tooth is hardly an AP staple, while Brutalizer is certainly an AD staple, especially in assassin builds.\n\nFlat AD is a 1:1 increase in base attack damage, with potentially increased ability damage as well. This 1:1 increase in damage also affects lifesteal, as lifesteal only applies on auto attacks and not physical damage spells.\n\nThis leads to a significant problem, and a core imbalance in league of legends:\n\nAll AD stats are not only highly synergistic, they are also limited by only 1 factor: How often you land auto attacks, which are not skillshots and have a cooldown of +/- 1 second, potentially having 2.5 attacks per second, though this is rare.\n\nSo, to put this in a direct comparison format:\n\nAD vs. AP: \nAD increases auto attack damage by 1 for each point of AD, as well as providing additional damage based on a champion's AD ratios (if they possess them.) \n\nAP increases ability damage by a champion's ratio (if they have them.)\n\nLifesteal vs. Spellvamp:\nLifesteal is only applied on basic attacks, for the full amount (excluding healing increase or reduction.) this makes lifesteal single target only.\n\nSpellvamp is applied only on spells, and is reduced significantly on AoE abilities. Spellvamp can be multi-target, but suffers a penalty for doing so.\n\nCrit vs. N/A: Crit has no direct competitor, it's a damage multiplier for AD, specifically auto attacks however certain abilities (parrley) can proc critical strikes. There is no AP stat that correlates to Crit, though items like the former DFG and Rabadon's Deathcap do give multipliers (though Deathcap is raw stats and not a direct damage increase, while DFG to an extent was.)\n\nCDR vs. Attack Speed:\nAS increases the number of attacks per second by a percentage, up to 2.5 per second.\n\nCDR decreases the cooldowns of spells, up to 40%.\n\nMagic Pen vs. Armor Pen:\nArPen penetrates armor, which mitigates all physical damage by a %.\n\nMpen penetrates MR, which mitigates all magical damage by a %.\n\n\nAs you can see by this direct comparison, AD has a definitive edge over AP stats. The only place where AD is not as powerful as AP is in Arpen, where Armor is easier to build than MR, thus letting Mpen be marginally stronger as a stat.\n\n\nHOWEVER, this does not in any way diminish the fact that AD stats are by far more powerful than AP stats.\n\nNow, how does this relate to the issue at hand (% hp damage, and BoRK in particular)?\n\nAD already is a stronger stat. It has a direct damage multiplier (crit), a stronger sustained damage modifier (attack speed), a stronger stat increase (AD), and a stronger sustain mechanism (lifesteal).\n\nBoRK takes this innate superiority and gives it even more of an edge. Adding %hp damage as a passive on an item with AD stats... Ignoring the active it's already an abomination.\n\nConsider the significant difference between BoRK and, say, Liandry's, its AP counterpart: Liadry's applies on spell damage, ticks several times for a low % which is doubled when coupled with soft or hard CC.\n\nBoRK, on the other hand, applies on every auto attack, in addition to any ability that applies on hit effects.\n\nGiven that one can apply 2.5 auto attacks in 1 second (or, more realistically, 1 per 1 second) as opposed to 4 spells in approximately 3 seconds, BoRK has a decisive advantage in fights or skirmishes lasting longer than 4 seconds.\n\nLiandry's is also gimped by the nature of it being a DoT, meaning that each ability resets the damage ticks, while BoRK applies each effect per auto attack (basically it stacks, while LT doesn't.)\n\n\nI'm finding it difficult to formulate a proper conclusion to this argument, so I'll basically summarize my thoughts:\n\nRiot, AD is overpowered and undercosted, with superior efficiency and impact in every category EXCEPT penetration. What's worse is that AD champions also benefit significantly from AP stats like CDR, while many mages hardly benefit from AD stats (as their abilities do not scale with AD and are not auto attacking as a primary source of damage, sorry Azir)\n\nItems like Blade of the Ruined King exacerbate this core imbalance, while it's not as bad as some items (IE, looking at you) it's still a problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hizsoo","date":"2015-01-21T08:34:12.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are items in this game which are deal the damage instead of your champion.\nAnyone can get them and the biggest problem is with the both cost efficient, expensive and slot efficient ones, which are got champions \"balanced\" around them.\nI'm specifically talking about these items:\n{{item:3128}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3153}} \nThis item balance philosophy sets back the balance of champions who gets one, but rather who gets multiple of them as the most popular build on those champs and it will be the part of the game what I will keep really hating.\nThis item balance philosophy is also one of the most garbage parts that the game is laying on and the item balance team somewhat still have the will to keep failing with it.

Well, let's stop to think about it for a moment. Let's just say, even though it's kind of unlikely to achieve this without the most skewed Crit Chance builds, you have 100% Critical Chance. What this means is that the value of AD essentially doubles. Remember how it took the target having ~382 health to make the passive worth 550 gold's worth of AD? Doubling this means that in order for the Blade of the Ruined King's passive to be gold efficient (based off AD) even when you're at 100% critical chance is that your target needs at least 764 health.

That's right folks, by the late game, not only is your Blade of the Ruined King going to be cost efficient as fuck even if you have 100% Crit Chance *and* an Infinity Edge, but because many champions go well above 1910 health by level 18 without buying a single Health item, you also get 10% Life Steal *essentially for free*.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Drogmyre","date":"2015-01-20T14:47:18.001+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot needs to stop thinking % based ANYTHING is a good idea.\n\nIt, inevitably, punishes the section of the population it's not supposed to affect as much as, if not more than, the population it's supposed to affect.\n\n%pen is supposed to shred tanks.
