Its not low, just nocturne's is higher. You can do similar stuff with nocturne, minus team utility, but vs shen and top laners, you can ult to prevent tp/shen/galio ults.\n\nOnly reason i mentioned him. Plus i think nocturne is infinitely more interesting as a bruiser than an assassin.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"7thHeaven","date":"2019-11-15T05:48:14.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, dead sheen deals no damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"G0blinSlay3r","date":"2019-11-15T07:11:53.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They destroyed shen long ago move on..","replies":[]},{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2019-11-15T07:11:19.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TehNACHO,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nzTjavEv,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-11-15T05:09:28.896+0000)\n>\n> I'm not trying to be obtuse about this, I mean genuinely, I don't get why Shen players build straight tank items. \n> \n> I understand Tank Support Shens because they just don't have the budget, but shouldn't the optimal build for Shen be straight Bruiser items in the form of Trinity Force, Frozen Mallet, and, of course, Titanic Hydra? \n> \n> The only defensive scaling built into Shen's kit is HP scaling, and his allies don't get any benefit from him being tank outside of item effects themselves. \n> \n> Furthermore, a _titanic_ amount of his kit is reliant on his dueling power, specifically his auto attacks.

Bruiser items also typically have HP to give his shield some build, but health without resistances aren't all that useful. His shield is far more effective when it can't be popped by a single auto attack, and the longer he can last in a fight the more often he can activate it. \n\nShen also has literally zero AD scalings. The only thing AD does for him is increase his base attack damage. Indeed, the bulk of his basic attacks come from autos, be it normal autos or his empowered with Q autos, which only scale (don't play AP Shen I swear to God) with the enemy's health and with attack speed (more on this later). Titanic hydra, the only AD item he typically builds, is built more for its synergy with his auto attacking playstyle utilizing its health-based on-hit and active damage. In some games, particularly ones where you're stomping ass, need to carry, and have someone else to tank, Triforce, Sterak's, Guardian Angel, or Frozen Mallet could be good ideas situationally, but in generally not really.\n\nBack to your Q, the damage item I actually think is best on Shen in a general sense besides Titanic is actually Wit's End. Gives a shitload of MR, attack speed for quicker Q and Titanic procs, and sustain to help you duel better and turn losing duels around.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2019-11-15T06:03:37.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Titanic already gives him dueling supremacy. \n\nShen doesn't really have AD scaling, so building utility HP items and the resists you need to survive with them for your team often helps most after titanic. \n\nIf you really want to build bruiser, titanic+Frozen Mallet is what you should probably do. TF is barely worth it because the CDR+attack speed is useful, and most other items that provide a significant amount don't offer health, but frozen mallet provides more for your team and offers 700 HP. Its still probably better to just go tank instead though. Most champs already can't run from you, and a slow from an item like omen will be a death sentence with your team around anyway. \n\nSterak's isn't that worth it because his base AD isn't very high, he doesn't have AD scaling, and TF is just more worth it if you really want to delay tank items further. You can't go for it 3rd item because you're delaying armor/mr for too long at that point and will start to feel the struggles the bruiser class does: getting instantly nuked despite having 3500-4000 HP in an attempt to keep your damage relevant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-15T05:12:00.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He gets a hydra and sometimes triforce, but the main point of shen is to stay alive and be annoying.

Everything's in place for him to be an HP scaling bulky duelist. Of course his damage will never be high if all he ever builds are straight Tank items, even though literally half of his kit is that of Dueling supremacy. It's just odd to me that potential is forfeited for pure defense.","replies":[]}]}]}
