A lot. I feel like the king of the world being able to abuse Ability Based champions simply by hitting them during their weak points like when their abilities are on cool down.\n\nAaaaand then I went back to top lane and ran into a Tryndamere{{champion:23}} . Rarely uses his E as an actual offensive attack but a gap closer, and getting all of his power from flat AD+Crits so his Auto Attacks are the main concern, not his abilities. Well, that match up ended very badly for me.\n\nSo, how do you play against auto-attack based champions? Is there any particular trick that encompasses a large majority of them like the Cooldown Abusing trick you can use against most ability-based champions? Or are there very specific tricks for very specific champions?","replies":[{"poster":"exiledFromBadmen","date":"2014-10-15T14:14:34.429+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3075}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3110}} {{champion:33}} :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZeroAnarchy","date":"2014-10-15T21:43:59.531+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3075}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critkeeper","date":"2014-10-15T06:22:54.358+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They pay for their ability to punish people between their important nuke / cc cooldowns by not actually having any nuke or cc. In other words, melee carries are largely reactive. They wait for a weakness then strike, very much like an assassin. Except an assassin can generally make a play happen even if you have your rotation up because they do it so quickly, while yi and tryndamere and the likes need time.\n\nThe counterplay is to think about using your abilities before you use them, and never be in a position where you could be within range of their gapcloser with no abilities up-- even if that means withholding harass. Its better to have a safety net than to end up dead to yi or tryndamere because you were impatient or greedy.","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2014-10-15T06:25:41.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huh, this is a rather useful way to think about it, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Gavran","date":"2014-10-16T09:53:57.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed, I think this is the best advice in the thread. Just like you can be careful to exploit those windows of opportunity when fighting a caster, you can be careful to not create those openings when you are one. \n\nA very simplified example: When you're playing Syndra, you should never use your E to farm or harass, because if you do you are very easy to all-in not only from the enemy laner but from the enemy jungle too.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BrandNameZombie","date":"2014-10-15T07:46:02.203+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ability based champions scale more with level than AA champions do.
