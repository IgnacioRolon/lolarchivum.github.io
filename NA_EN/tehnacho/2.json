Clear?*\n\n*Okay, with that out of the way, here's the thread.*\n\nEver notice that Darius' Apprehend range is 540? I honestly wonder what is the point of that when making it something more obvious and standardized like 550 range will make **no gameplay difference at all**.\n\nThink of it like this: Because ranged auto attacks are calculated based on the edge of the auto attackers model to the edge of the target's model, whereas spell ranges are calculated based off the center of the activators model and the center of the target's model. This means that 550 auto attack range is actually *just* a little farther than 550 spell cast range. In other words, if the entire point of making Darius' Apprehend at 540 range was to make him barely unable to reach a ranged champion at auto attack range, then it was completely pointless. At 550 spell range, something that makes more sense since range is usually a multiplicative value of 25 for most every other champion of the game, Darius would still be unable to touch ranged champions. This means there's literally no point for his range to be 540.\n\nI'm trying to rack my brain for scenarios where it actually would make a difference, but I can't seem to find any. Many other melee champions have their gap closers set to an almost standard range of 600; in other words, Darius doesn't have the range advantage over melee targets either, and he's not even tied with virtually any champion in this regard since not many champions' abilities are set at 550 anyway.\n\nI can't imagine a scenario where it would make a difference that the range is 540 or 550. Can you guys figure out a good reason exactly *why* the range is so specifically 5*4*0?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-12-26T08:03:19.902+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice question, got curious myself and had a quick look at the spell's files.

Why did you give {{champion:222}}'s taser a clear hotbox for the opponent to see? Because it's actual animation was so inaccurate compared to the hitbox.\n\nAnd speaking of clarity, this is only tangentially related, but {{champion:105}}'s Q inflicting damage even if he doesn't connect.
