[confirmation bias struck hard](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/EOWnyp9l-it-feels-like-people-really-dont-know-how-to-play-from-behind).\n\nWhile I&#039;m riding on the fumes of my mostly deserved defeats, I want to rant about basic player decision making. Again. One thing that really irks me is that people are throwing themselves into counterpicks or first picking extremely easy to counter champions all for the sake of...some reason. I can&#039;t say lose lane win game because it seems like that&#039;s just not a thing anymore.\n\nAnd I blame this mostly on the lack of macroplay and the abundance of blaming others. Let me make myself really clear though, in general, players are really good at coordinating as a team...when they&#039;re already winning. The moment somebody has died their second death, it&#039;s off to the races how many words per minute they can put in the chatbox screaming at the Jungler or the Mid Laner or the Support or who ever isn&#039;t them. As soon as this happens, all teamwork dissolves in an instant. The Jungler hates their laners, the Carries are ping spamming each other for every minion, the Support is using their free time to yell at everyone else/yell at the one guy yelling at everybody else, all while Top is ignoring the team as much as the team is ignoring Top. Between the one team spending more time in the chatbox than in the game and the other team high fiving and playing off each other, the game is just a mess the moment someone types into chat.\n\nThe most dangerous snowballing mechanic there is in Season 8 won&#039;t be towers or damage creep, it&#039;s going to be how quickly players are to start screaming at each other and (almost) intentionally throwing the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-01-12T07:48:04.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:32}} {{summoner:39}} {{summoner:32}} {{summoner:39}} {{champion:20}} Snowballing has been here since season 7, still not fixed and probably never will be, save yourself dude and pick {{champion:20}} {{summoner:32}} {{summoner:39}} {{summoner:39}} {{summoner:32}}","replies":[]}]}
