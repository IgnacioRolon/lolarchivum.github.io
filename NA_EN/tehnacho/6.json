In addition, Triforce falls off somewhat late game on these champs since they all have huge AS steroids, so eventually their autoattacks surpass their spellblade procs. Jax/Xin/Trundle with this build all surpass 2.0 attacks per second with their steroids maxed, and that is basically 3 autos in 1.5 seconsd = 1 spellblade proc. 3 autos on a 45 stack devourer late game (70 damage total) is 210 magic damage, which is stronger than the 230 or so physical damage from a triforce in that time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-03-07T00:50:28.855+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">Think Trundle, Jax, Xin Zhao, all the champions who want a combination of Tenacity, 40% CDR, and a crapton of Tankiness to complement TF+BotRK and the Raid Bosses' already built in hyper scaling steroids. \n\nEvery champ you listed gets good mileage out of warrior.
