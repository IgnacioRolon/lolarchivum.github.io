But I do have to admit i believe Tsm is Na&#039;s but chance at winning a world championship. I mean they won IEM vs the Cj Entus and WE . I mean C9 had a disappointing IEM compared to Tsm **BUT** that doesn&#039;t mean C9 can&#039;t do it as long as they don&#039;t lets there emotions get to them like at IEM they will a have a very good shot. They were very shaky after their first lose and even more against the Flash Wolves. C9 did come back strong tho in the lcs and secured 2nd place so there is hope yet. I&#039;m not saying Tsm will win (Which I hope they don&#039;t) but there is a good chance they will. \n\nThank you for reading","replies":[{"poster":"KilljoyX","date":"2015-04-16T21:47:44.314+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"TSM got lucky at IEM.

Zed can only destroy games where he wins lane. If he merely goes even he'll get destroyed by the tank line. Bjerg is really the only member who is better than his opposite number. TSM also doesn't have as decisive shotcalling as C9. C9 lost two games to early game then proceeded to take NINE BARONS IN A ROW to win the series.","replies":[{"poster":"ZeroAnarchy","date":"2015-04-16T22:49:55.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, you don't exactly need good shotcalling to win.

You won't win, they will lose.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NeoDeimos","date":"2015-04-19T00:04:45.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KilljoyX,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=tq7Jaz1q,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-04-16T21:47:44.314+0000)\n>\n> C9 has won all but 5 total games against TSM ever.

Hai just has to not feed.\n\n1: C9 has been having trouble adapting to the 2v1 meta? .. C9 is the main NA team that opts INTO a modified 2v1!! Go back and count how many times this split that they sent Sneaky into a solo lane, while Lemon went with Balls. If they have any trouble adapting to it at all, it's because they themselves are causing it.\n\n2: Who cares how many times in the past that C9 won? Are you really saying the TSM team of S3 Summer is the same as this one now, when only 2 members are still around (Dyrus and Turtle)?\n\nBut fine, let's go along with your thought. According to you, having 2 members on a team from the past still makes it the same team.\nWell... going back to 2012, there was a team called Orbit that had Hai and LemonNation. That team, after some roster swaps, eventually became known as Cloud 9. So, having 2 members (Dyrus and Turtle) on a team from the past (Hai and Lemon) still makes it the same team, according to you. And, as we all know, TSM was THE dominant NA team during Season 2. And therefore, would have won pretty much every game against the team that would later be called Cloud 9.\n\nOh? You don't like me going that far into the past, even though your own logic still applies? Fine, I actually agree with that. Therefore, let's stick to games that are actually relevant to the current day matchup. Which, in my opinion, would be when TSM dropped Xpecial and brought Loco on board at the beginning of S4 Summer Split. This essentially ended the long period of in-fighting between Regi and other old school TSM players (TheRainMan, Chaox, and Xpecial), allowing the team to truly focus on the game, and Regi to focus on the business side of things. Since those changes, the series is 5-4 in favor of TSM. In other words, it's a VERY close rivalry currently.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CubedJustice","date":"2015-04-17T01:33:24.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't be silly.

TSM is the strongest team in NA right now and definitely world class, but that might not be true fast-forward 4-5 months from now. Cloud 9 has been slumping all season and been really inconsistent leading to this being their worst split ever; they got second place. But now you have Balls who's begun performing and being a monster again and Hai may improve big-time by getting through those wrist injuries, improving laning, champ pool, etc. by next split. I think TSM will win and go to MSI (still gonna root for C9, but I'm happy with TSM winning them being my second favorite team). However, I think it'll be a lot closer next split.","replies":[{"poster":"SinatraZ","date":"2015-04-17T13:12:24.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly C9 will not improve with Hai as their mid laner.
