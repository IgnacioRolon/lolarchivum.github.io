Her name is Zoe and she is one of the worst champions to come to the rift. Zoe is able to do max damage to you when she hits you with her own form of crowd control known as putting champions to sleep.  Then she has a leap which makes her tower dive with ease of no use of being harmed, and or cannot be interrupted. She is also able to pick up active items and spells. I own the champion Zoe and playing her and feeling the broken power that she holds does not rest well in my stomach. These type of ideas that are coming to the rift are beyond horrific. Zoe At level 2 is able to all in you with the spell ignite. I used to main mid and now i do not nor do i wish to play league at all if these bad ideas keep recreating themselves so that Riot Games Can change things up. My thoughts are in my opinion that they are running out of ideas and finding what they have not made so broken to make their fans leave yet.  Riot needs to focus on what concerns their fans rather than their profiting of making champions that make you want to buy with real money just because she has deleted you in lane and  want you to feel the same power that she has unleashed onto you. Riot listen to your fans and stop creating mistakes. You have a PBE for a reason lets put it to good use and patch broken champions before they get to enter a ranked facility that everyone is trying to climb the ladder on.","replies":[{"poster":"Xion The XIV","date":"2017-11-26T11:33:33.675+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I don't understand is that we have had a lot of other champions that can all in you at lvl 2. Such as Talon. The thing with Zoe is she is easy to counter. You have to remember her entire combo goes in a straight line. So when she tries her combo you need to either side step or stutter step. Another thing is her ult is predictable since it will always go back to where she starts. She isn't that hard to beat compared to other champions. Such as Ekko who after 2-3 points can just throw his Q at a minion wave and kill them except a cannon minion.\n\n\nProblem is people say the exact same thing about Yasuo but 9.5/10 times you will find a garbage yasuo that makes the game 4v6 with him feeding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-11-26T11:25:20.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A: Pbe is a horrible place for balance change testing and isn't usually used for that, it is used for bug testing. The balance patches are put there first to make sure it doesn't break any code mainly (hypethetical situation would be if they gave a champ AD and it didn't apply to an item active).\n\nB: Xoe isn't too far above balanced. She doesn't have a powerful ultimate so most of her damage is in her Q which is unreliable.\n\nC: Zoe is a very, very unique character, so much so that it is still very difficult to determine how valuable she actually is to a team. A champ could win 100% of their lanes and still have an abysmal win rate if they suck at objective control or something else enough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2017-11-26T11:22:34.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all new releases are broken just a little bit to get people interested to buy them and their skins. this isn't new news.\n\nsecondly they have to keep changing the game just a little bit every so often to keep the game from getting stale with a clearly defined \"best pool of champs\" and \"everything else\" for too long, hence patches.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teemo Did 911","date":"2017-11-26T12:08:31.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:157}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"mosaickle","date":"2017-11-26T12:01:40.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"She's a flashy playmaker whose skill cap is pretty high and thus playing against her also requires knowledge.\nWhy create champions who are more flashy than ever?\n\nTo generate hype for and during esports, their biggest moneymaker.\n\nRiot's a business man, Riot's a business.","replies":[]}]}
