Like a one and done sorta thing. I mean sure a lot of people are gonna get removed along the way but I feel like at this point its the only clear way to do it. Hell I wouldn't mind having my own account banned from this ideology since I support it. Just at this point I don't think any other option will truly remove the problem.\n\n\"We have to dig it up from the the roots, Wipe the slate clean, Burn it down!\" \n-Senator armstrong","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2017-02-19T17:46:10.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deep Terror Nami,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=AlxELipm,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-02-19T15:37:59.385+0000)\n>\n> They did have Ranked Restrictions before they phased out the Tribunal.

When you have something like this, you are basically saying its fine to do it in Normals (or any other mode than Rank) and for people who mainly play those other modes its not fair. As someone who mainly plays Normals, I sure as hell wouldnt want trolls just for the sake of them getting back into Rank.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
