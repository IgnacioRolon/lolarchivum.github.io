I keep encountering the type of person that full on utter the words \"gonna feed now\" when the team mentions he should ping mias from his lane. I guess it has something to do with people who have a major egotistical issue in terms of where they are in ranked.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blast Deadlift","date":"2017-02-11T03:14:09.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I feel the same way and tbh it just makes me feel sad anymore.

They are tilted to the point where anything you say that isn't positive reinforcement (c'mon bro we got this) is just adding insult to injury. \n\nThis is all that so-called \"advice\" like \"Stop feeding\" or \"You should've done X instead of Y\". Considering they're dead for the next 30 seconds, there's a good chance they already realized what they've done wrong; it's just too late to change it and you're only bringing it back up to the front of their mind. There are times when the latter is valid, timely advice but those times they usually ask for it or make some kind of statement hinting that they didn't know like \"wtf was that\"\n\n2. You're giving redundant information or invalid information from just saying generic shit without actually looking at the lane to see what's happened/happening.\n\nIf I've been sitting under turret getting dove from between outer and inner turret, the last thing I want to hear from my team is \"You should play safer\" or \"Hug the turret\". That's what I've been doing for the past 5-10 minutes, and just because they've found a way to kill me regardless doesn't mean that I'm not already trying to play safe.\nThere have been times where someone will criticize my farming in a losing lane. Well yeah, I'm being zoned heavily. Do you want me to die trying to farm or sit under turret and not die? Make up your mind. \nAnother instance is telling someone with no gold to buy items (from losing lane) to buy X item. It's like telling poor person that's late from riding the bus that they should buy a car. No shit, I know I should buy a car but I don't have the money. No shit, I know to build defensively but I don't have the gold to buy any of the items so for now I'm just to have to sit on this Tiamat that I was already building before I started losing.\n\nFor reference: Don't Ask \n\n- How did you die/how are you losing to X champ? They played it better than me. It happens.\n\n- Start warding. Can be valid is person just flat out doesn't ward, but in this context we're talking about instances where someone is unable to either because they have been warding but their trinket is on cd or they were ganked from a different area (no lane can singehandedly ward every route to their lane with the new changes to wards), or they have been pushed under their turret to the point where warding is a death calling.\n\n- Stop feeding. Quite literally the most toxic thing you can tell someone who is tilted/losing (that won't get you banned). No one that is legitimately trying feeds on purpose, which is the what people will generally infer from these two words.\n\n- Why did you pick X champ? They picked them because they wanted to play it or because they thought it was the best choice at the time.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, there are lots of times where you give advice that is valid, reasonable, helpful, not in a poor tone, the whole nine yards. If the people takes this as a provocation, then they probably just have a toxic mentality. No helping it. But often times it's one of the above, and I hate that people never seem to want to address the fact that thoughtless advice does not help, it only adds stress to the stressed player.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MUSHROOM MIDGET","date":"2017-02-11T05:51:10.742+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"if they want advice they will ask for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anatera","date":"2017-02-11T17:51:38.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't unique to League.

Happens in all games.\n\nWell over all it is more prominent to become a near stable on the back of the box for league. Also I have played many other multiplayer games and by far this feels as if it has it the worst. I mean the best examples I can give are final fantasy 14, Street fighter.\n\n-In final fantasy 14 advice from higher level players is pretty much needed all through out to progress and everyone takes even playful insults well. You might encounter one jerk every few months if lucky.\n\n-In street fighter 5 people are all to willing to hear advice do to the game having many play styles and ideas being thrown around. The worst you will encounter is an upset person you most likely destroyed but salt is normal.\n\nSo to better sum this up what I mean is I don't seem to see anyone else act the same way as league players do to advice.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CodyBear ","date":"2017-02-11T05:12:55.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happens it's just some people are too hard headed to listen.

I may not be building meta, because I've played that champ long enough to find an item combo that works for ME. Bugging me to buy an item that works for you is just going to distract and annoy me. \n\nIf it's a champ I'm new to, *I will tell you that and ask for the advice*. Which I do quite often, when trying out a new champ or an old champ in a new position. Solicited advice is wonderful and I always make sure to honor those people who give it after the game. \n\nBottom line, if people ask for help then you should definitely give it to them.

The reason these are both important is if you're advice is in the form of something like \"why did you let them kill you you idiot?\" then of course they're not gonna listen to you. On the flipside though even if you're advice is along the lines of \"hey you should probably flash earlier if you feel like you're getting ganked\", if they're not receptive of the advice then just drop it and move on instead of nagging them about it for the entire game.","replies":[]}]}
