Couldn't the remade function be allowed for the whole match to fix that issue? Or am I missing something? Feel free to teach me if so I need to know more on this anyway XD.","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2017-02-26T05:21:41.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you could remake at any point in the game so long as there was an afk, it'd be to easy to abuse if it looked like you were gonna lose.

But what I am getting at is people can't full on abuse that afk trick for long as after a number of afks they just can't flat out keep spamming for the next que.","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2017-02-26T19:20:36.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"at this point we'd be arguing about tiny details or semantics like: \n\n\"how *much* should we give the enemy team if someone decides to leave a losing game\"\n\"should length of the game determine ratio of lp win/loss?\"\n\"how fair is it to the winning team to recieve less ip, do they really care that the abuser lost more lp?
