The Mayor (Riot) is sadly too preoccupied with other maters at the time so he trusts his police force (The report system and its workers) to make sure that the situation of lawlessness is handled. Needless to say the town of league is a place where many laws are broken time and time again be it assault, Theft, Murder, You name it and its happening. Lucky the police force are able to round up said offenders into a near inescapable prison with ease though I say \"near\" because of the buildings one fatal flaw. Each cell in said prison has a convenient back door one can take if he wishes. It is unguarded and leads straight back to town, Not to mention right outside the door is a nifty plastic surgeon (New account creation) who has taken up shop, And a clearly shady man who can hand out new IDs to anyone who simply asks for one. Needless to say law is forever a constant here is league town.\n\nSorry if this was a tad bit short","replies":[{"poster":"Kikirino","date":"2015-03-13T08:47:18.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So smurfs are constantly breaking the summoners code and are banned so they make more smurfs?
