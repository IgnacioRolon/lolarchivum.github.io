I mean for the past 2 to 3 years people have been out right telling riot that there are huge issue with how the rank system is set up and how it goes from unfair to down right malicious but what I am getting at is, Does riot truly care? I look and look and can never seem to find a possible answer for these things since riot has never seemed to comment on the mater. And for the record, I am not shallow minded so I am willing to be proven wrong as well, ok.\r\n\r\n(For those of you who don't know what I mean when I say \"issues\" just look at ranked complaints for around 5 minutes and you will see what I mean)","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2014-11-05T19:54:51.562+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because people say it's broken doesn't mean it's broken. \nUnlike most games where if you suck you just know you're not pro but don't realize just how bad you are,  here it is painfully apparent that if you are in bronze (bronze 5) you are one of the worst players in ranked. \n\nPeople don't like being bad at something. They hate it so much they aren't willing to accept it's possible. How many people in bronze 5 do you think would say they deserve to be there. I bet if there was a poll,  99-100% would say they're better than bronze 5. These players won't acknowledge they are actually bad,  so they blame the ranking system as their only alternative. \n\nThe goal of matchmaking is a 50% win chance for each team. If mmr is accurate this will happen and if not you'll win more than you lose and move up. Aside from \"promo series being too small of a sample\" and \"losing promos from silver 1 to gold 5 because the other players are all Platinum and my mmr is plat just put me in plat ffs\" there really don't seem to be problems with ranked EXCEPT possibly there not being sufficient punishment for toxicity and not having something below bronze to separate the \"bad but trying\" from the \"trolls\". \n\nTl; dr : when anyone in the worst Tier knows they're at the bottom,  are they going to admit they suck or blame it on \"the system\"? Unless you get rid of tiers and just have the upper tiers and challenger and need to get invited to join the upper tiers,  This is always how it will be.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2014-11-11T21:31:11.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I do agree with much of what you said I think I am unable to agree with part of it do to how I didn't provide enough info as to what I was saying (sorry for that).\n\nFirst - I am not in bronze 5 (bronze 2 but I know I know )  and if I was that doesn't bother me. I like the idea of being told I need to improve and if being in bronze 5 is a way of telling me to simply \"get good, learn more about the game\" I don't rage, I simply enjoy the fact that I can still dive deeper into the games concepts and improve. Hell I am still trying to learn how to better combo as {{champion:107}}  at the moment.\n\nSecond - Your \"bad but trying\" \"trolls\" bit is basically what I am getting at since i am not able to word what I am feeling correctly. In short toxic team mates can kill your chances of winning and it seems to be a growing problem. Riots report system doesn't seem to stop this either as players seem to be able to act freely as they want in terms of just bad attitudes. For example the very vivid death threats I get from some players when I don't pick something within their strict idea of the meta. And people like this can just kill any chance of winning most games as they screw with their own teams heads. And riots tribunal set up is just unable to contend with it properly.\n\nSorry if I left any bits out or if this was worded wrong. I mean I agree with much of what you are saying but do you not see how the ranked community is? I mean the best mental image I can come up with how a lot of toxic players hold back people trying to enjoy the game, Is that one scene from god of war where he is trying to fight off the bodies trying to pull him into hell.\n\n....Just noticed that my point really does fall apart if you duo with people in ranked XD sorry","replies":[{"poster":"Cozarkian","date":"2014-11-11T22:25:26.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> In short toxic team mates can kill your chances of winning and it seems to be a growing problem.

One of the differences between a silver and a bronze player may very well be that the silver player does a better job of shrugging off negative comments and mistakes, while the bronze player gets upset easily and loses focus. \n\nGranted, that doesn't make toxic behavior okay, but it is food for thought for your own improvement. If toxic comments make you lose the game, a mental adjustment to how you respond to toxic behavior is one way to improve your game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2014-11-11T22:05:03.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's good to see you know you have room to improve :)\n\nIt's unfortunate but it does sound like there are all a lot of negative attitudes at the least levels of play. I would assume these players play well sometimes and just decide to troll people either randomly or because they think the game is lost. I wonder if there are smurfs that liar their promos on purpose (and troll during them) so they can stream how badly they stomp bronze when they try. I don't know,  but it's hard to explain how the terrible players can show up above bronze 5 and not all sink to the bottom. \n\nAnyways,  all I can say is try your best and focus on improving throbs l things in your game. You can't control others. And don't be afraid to use the mute button :p","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2014-11-12T03:03:32.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that's the thing cozarkian, Toxic player never really bug me. My mental standing on people such as that is to just tone out the dumb white noise. And I never really rage at others. The most I say when I get even slightly upset is things such as \"why would it be a good idea to tower dive with 50 hp left?\". And Well (and Jesus Christ this is no joke) because of me asking things like that I get large numbers of reports for \"verbal abuse\". And now I have a chat ban because of said player losing their cool. I talk to customer support calm and collective but they just throw me under a buss with the chat log showing no rage or toxicity. And funny how even this does not bother me...the fact that bothers me is what if this happens to someone else? I know constructive criticism is something people cant handle but I just fear for other players in the end. \n\n(example of my constructive criticism and the out come. no joke this was basically a REAL event) \n-rammus- Hey tower diving le blanc might not work with her passive try and not dive her when its up okay?\n-lux- stfu rammus reported\n-rammus- wait what? for?\n-lux- toxic verbal abuse. don't tell me how to play troll.\n-rammus- Its a tip dude just calm down ok\n-lux- muted /all report rammus for trolling\n\nI wish this was a sick joke but this is what a lot of my games boil down to and I even got punished for things like this. You don't have to believe me if you don't want to because I do get how absurd it sounds, Hell I wouldn't belie me either at how stupid it can get at times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dankified","date":"2014-11-06T01:28:11.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Just because people say it's broken doesn't mean it's broken.\"\n\nTHIS.","replies":[]}]}
