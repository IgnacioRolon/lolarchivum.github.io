I know I am a shitty person for doing this sort of thing and i&#039;m not saying that I feel a sense of right with it. It is clearly wrong and not the best course of action. But with how insanely large a 4 v 5 is in terms of a handicap I just slowly loose hope and find myself in a way just sitting in the corner. What am I to do about this? Cause I have tried to stop but I lack the fortitude to do so out of my current mind set.","replies":[{"poster":"Euthenaasia","date":"2017-02-17T19:53:11.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won a 4v5 yesterday and it was twice as satisfying.

After a point I can't even see if my actions are really improving do to constant failures on my part do to being out classed or out gunned. Its like saying \"hey your mistakes build this brick wall that is about to fall on you. Now you can't out run it but lets see if you can stop it.\" but each failure only makes the wall stronger so it just outpaces any practice you can hope to put into it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-02-17T19:31:38.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sitting in base is considered afking, just a heads up","replies":[{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2017-02-17T19:50:29.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Magical Player,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=rBdtXgIG,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-02-17T19:31:38.335+0000)\n>\n> Sitting in base is considered afking, just a heads up\n\nI understand.
