I tend to (and I think we all do) get an odd amount of toxic players that while yes they do trash and shit talk their own teams, seem to do pretty well in lane. Though its what happens after the game that confuses me with how said players are still being clearly toxic yet the other team says something along the lines of \"He wasn't toxic he did good in the game\" or something along those lines.\r\n\r\nThis is an over all example of something I have seen a lot and I find it odd that just because a player did well in game means that it acts as a free pass for his/her behavior for some people. This is clearly not a constant issue but it shows its head a lot. What do you think? should players let them off the hook because they played well? Or should they still report against the player for how he acted?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Just a topic I though of to try out the vote system here on the boards. Now I can provide more information if need be so please feel free to prove me wrong or ask question if I didn't explain something well enough)","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2014-11-26T15:41:27.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's kind of irrelevant. \n\nWhy are you complaining to the other team though?  If you complain to me that a teammate who did well was toxic,  I'm not reporting him...\n\nFirstly,  I'm pretty sure whether you get 1 or 9 reports for a game,  it counts as 1 game with a report. They investigate based on the number of games you got reported on,  not total reports,  so as long as you're reporting him I don't need to. \n\nSo all I can assume from your post game complaint would be that his toxicity made your team lose. To which I'm obviously going to think \"no,  he was the only player on your team doing okay,  the bad play made you guys lose\". \n\nI'd say you just personally report him quietly. Honestly,  I think it should be against the rules to ask the other team to report someone. I've seen it More often that the toxic player will ask the other team to report his teammate that he's been raging on all game,  either for bad play or feeding or claiming they were the verbally abusive one,  or in some cases I've gotten \"report valyrianblade for falsely reporting me\" which if you know someone is reporting you it should be obvious to anyone that you were being really awful... Apart from all chat,  the other team really has no idea what happened verbally on your team - so they have no business reporting for it. It also sort of undermines their feeling of victory - \"Oh you won?  Of course it was because our whole team couldn't concentrate because of this toxic guy we could have muted and just reported later\". \n\nI would love a team vote system to mute a teammate though. Like if the vote passes 4-0, the teammate is muted and a high priority (as in review even if first offense) report is sent in,  and the teammate is notified that they're unable to chat for the rest of the match (so basically they can't say anything - not sure if they'd threaten to start feeding if you did it though,  but in that case they should be permanently banned even if first offense).","replies":[{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2014-11-27T02:03:36.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I think it's kind of irrelevant. \n> \n> Why are you complaining to the other team though?

You see I was not asking/yelling or anything of the sort in all chat or the other. What I am talking about is mostly with my own team mostly. Though yes the other teams shows signs of the let it go attitude as well. And this is an example that I SEE not something I actively partake in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cozarkian","date":"2014-11-26T15:46:57.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  Honestly,  I think it should be against the rules to ask the other team to report someone.\n\nAgreed. It's like asking a stranger to file a police report because you were robbed last night. Just call the cops and report the crime yourself.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hi I like Vayne","date":"2014-11-26T15:31:04.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completely agree..... People think because they did well they're king pin over that match and can say what they want and get angry when someone else makes a mistake. Annoying..... But to have it supported by other players is lame. League needs to get to work with dealing with toxicity. Biggest problem in league in my opinion..... Stop creating new champions for a second, stop nurfing and buffing, and get your game to where angry people are punished for projecting their insecurities onto the team in a hurtful way.","replies":[]}]}
