Me included.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"OK chances are I might just quit playing league all together again tonight and just start playing overwatch or ff14 again to replace it. Now to explain what the topic of the post means I need to give some slight insight. Over the past three to four years since I started to feel iffy about league of legends I never really was able to pin point this odd feeling most game gave me. Sure enough I described this feeling to other players who used to play each long since given up playing and they too had the similar feeling. It was this weird feeling that you were never in control of the events that took place. Kinda like in real life where the actions of the over all community can make the actions of a single person seem small and insignificant. It didn't really hit me till today but I asked some of them a question. \"Do you feel it was because of yourself? Others around you invaliding your efforts through their own actions leading to failure? Or just trolls?\" Oddly enough none of them said it was trolls that ruined it but the first two statements were more of what they felt. This reminded me of the feeling that I got when doing boss runs in ff14. Where either I myself as a tank miss stepped and put the boss in the wrong place resulting in the team getting blasted. Or simply someone else doing the same. The feeling was all to familiar to the feeling league gave. And this is what I came to. Be it me or anyone else on the team or raid in ff14 if all the parts (parts being players) didn't do their job right it was going to end in failure. Meaning even if you did your job well if the number of parts in your team does not out number theirs, Or in ff14s case the number of mistakes. The players that did wells efforts are  wasted. Now this doesn't mean people even have to be toxic. Even something like a large skill gap in a laning opponents skill or a simple lack of knowledge resulting in their defeat can be enough to set this feeling off. No one is omitted from this happened be it me or anyone else. It just happens...But it is infuriating. This is how I feel a lot of just over all negative feelings of the game slowly builds up over time. Even the most chill players will have this get to them be it a little or a lot. And something like this can lead to others thinking that other players are trolls when they are just poor players. Or just over all over defensive people that will threaten to afk if talked to at all. The examples go on and go but what I am trying to get at if this is and will always be a problem. Not because riot cant fix it. Because lets face it you can't make a punishment system good enough to stop human nature let alone having a revolving door style system. This is something that built into the heart of every moba, Every mmo, Hell pretty much any team based game. And I feel it is this feeling that slowly builds up in most of us over time that slowly causes players to simply leave to avoid this feeling.\r\n\r\nAny comments, Questions, Or think I missed something or got something wrong?
