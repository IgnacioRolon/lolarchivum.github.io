Or does the lack of knowledge that leads to the inevitable one sided beat down blind people into looking for methods and tactics to beat them. Back when I was new to league and didn't know much I like a lot of people I presume had trouble going up against teemo. Other than freaking out at the loss I chose to look for that champions play style and how to counter it and found that mages such as Xerath and Annie are good picks to counter him with. What I am getting at is don't cry \"nurf\" or \"he is op\" before at least looking to see if there are methods that you have not yet seen.","replies":[{"poster":"Seth Lightheart","date":"2015-01-22T22:19:15.232+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not 100% true.
