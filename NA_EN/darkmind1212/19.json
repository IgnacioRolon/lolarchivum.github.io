I see too often players demanding me to gank something along the likes of a full health renekton under a tower and can&#039;t seem to understand what this type of person wants. And every result is the same. I refuse to go along the lines of a call that isn&#039;t ambitiously bad but clearly asking for death and explain myself only to have the team slowly begin to throw out the term &quot;garbage&quot; and &quot;trash&quot;. Though this bothers me little as ignoring them or just the mute button helps a ton but lately I started to notice something. It seems once the insults start to fly they just start to fall apart in terms of focus and will die while typing insults...Which I find incredibly funny. But after the game I find the chat turning into &quot;report for racism&quot; &quot;report for trolling&quot; and wonder...Am I just that bad?...Or are these people that foolish?","replies":[{"poster":"Korijenkins","date":"2017-02-22T14:38:41.452+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungler is the easiest thing for people to bash when they perform badly because its the only role that can majorly impact every lane.

I main jungle and am a support secondary, and often it takes a bit of mental prep before opening up the game, because those are the two roles most likely to get flamed. Along with the support, the jungler is an assistive role whose goal is to help out the other laners, which unfortunately means that it can become very easy for any individual laner to displace their frustration onto them, on the grounds that they didn't get enough help. On the flipside, the broad set of goals assigned to the jungler means it can also be easy for them to avoid all responsibility altogether (and you can sometimes see that with theads that take the \"It's not the jungler's fault when...\" rationale a bit too far), but assigning blame in a match is never useful, and is generally a sign of negative behavior.\n\nA useful thing to learn when jungling, which also pairs well with the role's theme, is to think independently of your team when playing in soloqueue: of course, you're always going to be trying to help out your teammates as much as possible and play to win, but ultimately you make the final call on where and when to gank. Just because the top laner is pinging you to dive that full health Maokai under his tower, right after they died to him, does not mean you need to follow up on that request, nor does refusing to obey one or even multiple laners on questionable gank orders constitute a refusal to communicate in itself (though you might want to explain why you're not ganking often, if that happens). Be mindful that you may have to gank for players who have been rude to you, one of the challenges of jungling in soloqueue, but generally the players who spend the most time typing insults and venting at their teammates also tend to be the least effective in-game, so hopefully that should not have to happen too often.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"StillRJay","date":"2017-02-22T14:59:58.089+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I gave jungling a shot a while back.

I'm in a rough matchup, getting shoved in my tower and I need some pressure. I ask a couple times for a gank (not for a kill but for pressure so I can get my wave out of turret range so I can cs easier or stop playing dodge ball with the enemy mid laner at my tower, where frankly I have less places to move and more things to concentrate on.\n\n2. If the enemy has a blue buff and I don't repeatedly without any aid from my jungler. If the enemy has a blue buff and i don't they have a big advantage over me, especially if it's in a situation where I'm not buying a mana item first (IDK let's say I'm against an annie so I rushed negatron cloak, now i've got low mana regen and defense with her shoving me in.)\n\n3. I'm repeatedly getting jungle/roamer attention and I'm not behind, but I've got a lot of pressure on me and --- THE KEY HERE -- they are not applying pressure elsewhere on the map. I am fine losing my lane in the case of another lane winning from their pressure, but if they're still roaming camp to camp farming and not ganking and i've got a party in my lane, then yes that's frustrating.\n\n4. Then theres the generic, they screwed up and idk, dove hard for a first blood and died, handed the enemy whatever double buffs and then try to fix it, but just die again even though i tell them to just leave so that this doesn't happen. Oh and then I get blamed for \"feeding\" after because they're really farmed.\n\nWhen I jungle I try to pay attention to the above things. If I take the second blue, I try to give them a gank if the enemy has it. If they are in a rough match up and having a hard time, I show up to apply pressure.  You don't need a kill to help your lane, sometimes even just a combo on them and running away is enough to change the lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MaeDoSan","date":"2017-02-22T14:49:53.109+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"If a laner can't hold his own in lane he doesn't deserve a gank","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2017-02-22T15:14:46.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not everyone is in a situation they can hold it in.","replies":[{"poster":"MaeDoSan","date":"2017-02-22T15:26:54.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you are losing 1 v 1 its your fault\nIf you are getting camped and the jungler is doing something useful elsewhere , deal with it\nUnless your death hasn't helped your team in anyway its useless","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2017-02-22T15:34:54.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But there are times that you have been camped, it's a hard counter, you're a late-game champ against an early-game one, etc.\n\nI play every lane with some frequency.
