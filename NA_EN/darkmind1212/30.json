Lately I have been thinking long and hard about if I should continue playing league of legends or just stop all together. And the choice I arrived was to well...go. I am not gonna be the kind to stand here and scream \"it was the trolls that did this to me! Its all their faults! GNMAP GNMAP WRARG!\" Trolls had no influence over my decision to leave. The reason I am leaving is because I fear the effects that the league community has on me. I have this overwhelming feeling of stress from playing and that is not what I want in a game. I want the feeling of excitement not the feeling of dread baste of idea of a mere verbal confrontation over ideals. The fact that another player can express very vivid death threats to me and face no punishment scares me and the idea that people can avoid any punishment with just another account sickens me. I want to keep playing I really do but sadly the bad just out ways the good. I know we have all seen it, We have seen what a large portion of this community is. The way that people speak to one another like they are not even human and treat every other player like they are just a champion on screen. Sadly I thought this sort of behavior would never get to me but everyone has a breaking point and I am not as strong as most others in terms of self control of my anger. I hate that this game makes me angry, I really do. I hate the feeling of just impassionate rage brought on by another harsh words and threats to my family for that of a simple mistake brought on by the click of a button.  I know I will be told that I need thicker skin...I know I will be told to just mute them. But some things are never enough, Anything and everything breaks sooner or later, And I am now broken. I didn't mean for this to sound too dramatic but these are just the few of the many feelings I have toward this place. I do hope that one day the community becomes a better place one day so that people can enjoy this game without the fear of those conflicts. Sorry for my ramblings. I do hope to return to league of legends one day but as for now I can't stay, I lack the ability to handle these conflicts anymore.\n\n( Sorry for any typos or odd phrasing. And I am really sorry for the inconsistency of it >_&lt; )\n\n(Also on a side note as I leave league of legends I find myself looking to final fantasy 14 a realm reborn. If anyone else happens to be playing the game please hit me up for hopeful fun times ahead ^w^)","replies":[]}
