I am not joking when I get whole teams and I do mean whole teams all spouting very odd gibberish such as \"im smurf diamond 5 afk you nubs troll annie sucks now\" (this is sadly a quote from one that just left me dumb founded) And then just feed or,  troll there own team in chat. This also goes for the toxic community as well, saying things like  how they will just play drafts after they are kicked and this is happening in TONS of the rank games I played since I started after the patch. Bronze was no were near this bad before the patch but now it seems to have thrown a rock at a hornets nest.\r\n\r\nI am willing to be proven wrong but did this patch do something to send toxic players and troll players into some weird over drive?","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2014-11-20T16:31:56.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, if you go to any online community and introduce a huge swath of changes that basically alters the entire game(the new map, pre-season changes, etc.) you're going to get a whole bunch of people in to try to 'have fun' with them.\n\nIt used to happen in WoW, I saw it in SC2, I saw it in DotA after each new version was released, and we're seeing it here now.
