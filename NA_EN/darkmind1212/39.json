I need some outside input to help me understand this.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"To make a long story short back in January I came across this really nasty player who was doing the typical verbal abuse nonsense of smack talking the team for simple mistake without the slightest bit of constructive criticism. After a point I told him that he had no right to judge those willing to try whole he set at the spawn point continuing the verbal assault...Then out of nowhere he stated my name...Not my username, my real life name in full. A bit shocked I didn't really say anything, Then he went to even state the name of my device in full! Now to be clear this is just some random player I was pared with in a ranked game so I have no idea who this player was but he seem to know things about me. He started to laugh in chat stating how he was in college studying computers and he could find out anything and everything on anyone he wanted to and he was going to use the info to find and KILL me....Yes I know it sounds crazy.So needless to say I was not really sure on what to do here so I did what I could, I took a few pics of the log and submited in a ticket. It took riot about two days to get back with me telling me they would look into the issue and do what they could but could not share if they were to punish him. \"understandable\" I thought...Though this happened back in January...and now its June...And his account is still very much active. Was prof not enough? Did riot just let this guy get away with it? Could someone help me understand this? I don't feel to good knowing that people can just do something like this and face no punishment what so ever. I am not angry I am just very confused about all of this.\n\n(Sorry for any typos or odd spelling.)","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-06-25T08:27:13.250+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Death threats are never acceptable.

This is not the first time it happened. In that a few months from then I was given death threats to not me but my family and I was going to be forced to watch. I sent in a ticket with photos of the log then too...He also still remains very active account wise. If this happens again is their any legal action you bet I could take? The fact that riot allows this to continue is sickening ","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-06-25T10:22:39.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know about legal action, it would probably vary from state to state (and who knows how international cases are handled) but the best choice is definitely to call the cops. They can contact Riot on your behalf and ensure that whoever made the death threat is reported to their local police department, wherever they live.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2015-06-25T15:18:35.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a guy once that told me to 'stay in the game endscreen so I can look up your IP, thanks'\nBecause he was going to find me and kill me.

Since Riot's policy (like basically every other game company on the planet) is to not give out information about other players' bans, you should not say \"I need to know if he will be banned\", but rather \" I think this was overlooked and I'd like you to check it out again.\" \n\nBTW, the whole \"studying computers\" to find your information was a whole bunch of Hollywood bullshit. You can't get a player's IP address just by being in game with them, and you couldn't just pull up personal information from an IP address anyway. It is very likely that he Googled your account name and found some site where you had posted information about yourself.","replies":[]}]}
