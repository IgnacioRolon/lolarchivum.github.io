But from what I see not a lot of people are happy with how the game is handled be it game wise, Community wise, Or even technically. So in hypothetical terms, Who would run league of legends better than Riot?\r\n\r\n(Also if you think that no other company is fit to the task please share that as well. I am interested to hear peoples thoughts even if they differ from my own.)","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2015-06-25T13:11:39.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like the thought of having a different company pick up someone's IP. In general it's just bad unless it's like a port. So I don't think anyone would do it better than Riot because Riot is the company that knows the project.","replies":[]}]}
