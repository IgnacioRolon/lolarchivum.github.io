Useless or not, people must accept they play with other real people and that insulting and flaming each other is in fact making a more negative environment to play in for a game that was meant for fun. If people act like this in ranked, you must forgive them for they may be a little more on edge, but please try to enjoy the game.

He'd looked up match histories and wasn't happy with what he saw so he blurted that out immediately. That got under our toplaner's skin and they ended up not playing well due to being tilted and ended up giving away first blood and first tower pretty fast, and that led to their Yas getting fed and being able to come down to my lane and wreck my game too even though I was winning in cs and had no deaths until that point. \n\nI don't get why people feel the need to be an ass to others. All it can do is ruin games. Even if you win by some miracle despite the mountain of salt that they're trying to bury you under, it isn't satisfying and you feel like you wasted your time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"grug","date":"2017-03-18T13:35:14.662+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2017-03-18T13:46:26.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why even bother calling people bad?

Just muting and forgetting doesn't stop a toxic player from being toxic, it just slows them down. Report who you truly believe is being a toxic/troll, then mute, and then move on. In all honesty, there's not much else that really can be done.\n\nUnfortunately, the fault of this stems from how the competitive community is overall for games in general or otherwise, not just League. For those interested in moba's, it's always best to be aware that if we sign up for something we deem fun like League, we need to be wary enough to also realize that we sign up for the faults that come along with it. In a sense, I suppose you could consider competitive gameplay a double edged sword. But it's also a sword that can have that unfortunately favored edge dulled with a stronger team response against such unruly behavior. I get that you're down about the game's you have had in the past, but the second we buckle for them, the sooner it'll get worse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2017-03-17T19:17:29.678+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"U USELESSSSS *trick2g intensifies*","replies":[]},{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2017-03-18T04:25:35.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then stop being useless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"leona4lyfe","date":"2017-03-18T09:05:45.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/eMcgl3Ef-gaslighting\n\nHappens to me all the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2017-03-17T22:40:54.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Awww","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2017-03-17T21:03:58.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It depends on what is happening in the game of whether or not to accept something like that.  Like, if I'm top and 0/5 at 20 minutes, I would have already told my jungler to abandon top and help someone else because I'm not going to be useful to the team since the worst thing that happens is the enemy top kills me and hardly gets any gold at this point.  The most I can do is try and stop TP plays and make taking the tower inconvenient, hopefully being able to be a bodyguard for a hypercarry. If I can act as a meatshield for someone who can carry and eat skillshots coming at them, it's better that I die than they do. Alternatively, if it's just because I missed a few skillshots and I'm still doing well overall (be as realistic as well;  3-7-4 isn't good so don't kid yourself) then I ignore them and try and be more careful. \n\n Probably not the answer  you're looking for, but you _do_ need to have thick skin and a strong sense of determination to play.  Even as caustic as my personality is, playing from early(ish) season 2 to before the mage update in season 6 when I quit, I haven't even received a warning, let alone a ban for anything.  In fact, I hardly say anything at all.  I won't lie and say I don't lose my cool once in a while and go way off the deep end, but it's mostly a silent game of enduring the ignorance of the stupid and the clearly inexperienced attempting to teach the team how the game apparently works, like how 4 people at half health should start Baron while all 5 enemy members at full health are literally 1500 units away was the right thing to do...for reasons unknown to everyone but this \"genius.\" \n\nAgain, it's not what you want to hear, but you just gotta deal with it, and if it's doing things to you mentally, take an hour or so break and in my case, give your blood time to stop boiling before going back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EggplantRichard","date":"2017-03-18T21:35:28.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Going 0-10 is much worse than flaming.
