And some times just nurf, buffs, add items and abilities, remove items an- ect, things without ideas of the future outcome. Maybe riot is just a little too segmented in its q and r? who knows. Feel free to share to me your thought on the mater. And feel free to prove me wrong as well as I am open minded and willing to change my thoughts if proven so.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenant","date":"2014-11-20T12:56:58.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like it's the community that lacks foresight, more than anything.

Do you think this has anything to do with that new idea of duo junglers that were seen a lot in the world tournament. HUH I guess riot only cares about the pros after all XD.","replies":[]}]}]}
