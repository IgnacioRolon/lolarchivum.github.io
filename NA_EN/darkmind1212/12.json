If you ever want to have intelligent conversation about the game, never come to these forumns. They only like memes and \"OMG OP\" \"BROKEN\" cry posts. And just mute in game the moment someone becomes toxic. Prevent the tilt before it even starts.","replies":[{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2017-02-08T20:59:13.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh, no.

You should invest your time and energy into more constructive and real things.  Playing this game will bring you nothing but anguish.  You will never find fulfillment here and this community is the worst overall gaming community that exists.  There are any number of other \"hobbies\" just begging for your attention that will end up being both more enjoyable and more rewarding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RQ Amiable","date":"2017-02-08T20:43:52.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh its a toxic community.. and riot doesnt do anything about it... so... idk what to tell you and secondly.
