Tank champions usually are pretty immobile and don't need kills to be useful later on, so id suggest you ditch ignite for flash. \nSecond, if you really want to improve, you need to work on your cs. Either go to the practice tool to work on it, or the next few games you play REALLY focus on that. Don't worry about kills, don't worry risky trades, don't worry about lane pressure as much, just get that last hit on minions. \nFinally, maybe watch some streamers.

Not in terms of score of course but in over all fights I tend to make the most out of what I can manage and can out think them a great deal. The main problem stems from either a.) I miss step one to many time on very bad predictions. Or b.) The team is laying into me for not doing what they wanted. I.e such as ganking bot from top with no tp or such on hand which starts the fights in chat. Its so damn  distracting and depressing that I end up slowly becoming cynical as the infighting grows. I know a lot of people say that I need just mute them but I did a test to see what that lead to and oh jesus is it worse to not give them attention.

The vast majority of gamers (in general) are emotionally immature, ego-centric 'kids' that do not have much in the way of empathy and respect for others -- primarily due to the anonymous nature of video games on the internet. Either through bad role models, (lack of) upbringing and/or education on how to be a generally \"good person\", gamers are also generally hopped up on adrenaline rushes and have competitiveness to \"be the best\". Even those who play more on the side of \"for funsies\" and are not _as competitive_ as others, they can still be more critical and harsh about the mistakes of other players with them (since the win/lose condition of League relies on you relying on strangers' help). More often than not this frustration, anger and resentment about being dependent on others to win a game where you, at the very least, are playing to win, and you have a recipe for asshole-ish behavior and downright nasty, disgusting attitudes.","replies":[{"poster":"New Tool Album","date":"2017-03-23T02:03:21.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so basically, this game is competitive as shit, even outside of ranked, which breeds toxicity to a sense","replies":[{"poster":"Chønklord","date":"2017-03-23T03:06:03.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Competition has no correlation with _toxicity_, there is a huge different between being toxic and having friendly banter. In league as within all sports or anything competitive by nature, toxicity is correlated directly with the kind of people that are involved and their overall level of emotional maturity.
