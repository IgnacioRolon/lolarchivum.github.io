Die less. This is actually really important, but most people at high ranks don't have more than 4 deaths a game. (I am guilty of this myself!) \n\n2. Make sure you're building the right items. Have a reason you want to buy an item that isn't \"I like it\" or \"mobafire said so\"\n\n3. So, when I was initially climbing from low silver to gold (kinda get placed around there each season since, but I don't play as much recently) I try to play champions with really clear play patterns. I had a lot of success playing champions like Sejuani in low elo games because everyone knows what to do for the most part when there's 4 blocks of ice there.  I'd also steer clear of champions that are popular unless they are champions you are good at. A lot of people get to Diamond plus because they are 1 tricks and that's ok you can be one too! Most people can't play everything. \n\n4. Check out Phylol's videos. He's got really great advice and does updates every day.\n\nHope it helps!","replies":[]}]}
