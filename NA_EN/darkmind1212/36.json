I imagine something along the lines of a high armor/health item making you super tanky but also sacrificing things such as movement speed to a great degree.Or something such as a weapon that has a nice armor penetration stat to it but do to its size and weight it lowers your attack speed.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? Would this be an interesting addition if they were to even go through with it?\r\n\r\nAlso share some ideas if you have any you find interesting as well ^w^","replies":[{"poster":"Lights And Magic","date":"2015-05-01T08:10:55.595+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think items inherently kind of do that with a lot of champions. You can build damage and be able to kill your enemies but you get 2-shot by the carries, or you can build tanky and jump into the middle of the team and not instantly get blown up, but you don't do any damage. It's not exactly what you're suggesting, but there already is a sort of give and take when you buy items, especially on bruiser champions.\n\nI think an item would have to be like \"+150 armor +500 health -8% movespeed\" to really be gold efficient and to get people to buy it.","replies":[]}]}
