Is it just me or are people with god complexes on the rise here in the boards lately? What I mean by god complex is people that act so arrogantly that he/she might as well believe he/she is god. These players going on to talk about how they are superior to their own team in every way and slowly turn the thread into nothing more than trash talking.\r\n\r\nI hope to god I am wrong on this, It makes me kinda sad knowing that the boards will slowly be effected by toxicity now so please someone prove me wrong o this to sate that fear.","replies":[{"poster":"Diostukos","date":"2015-02-12T19:39:43.184+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, Kanye West has multiple accounts here?","replies":[{"poster":"NIEKUH","date":"2015-02-12T19:42:37.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DEEEEEEE AMMMMMMMNNNNNNNNNN!!! no he didn't!","replies":[{"poster":"mvargus","date":"2015-02-12T20:17:21.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he did.  :P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-02-13T15:16:22.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I said I am just only noticing it now.

This is basically what GD was on a daily basis. Occasionally that showed up in the Champion and Item forums, but it was mostly GD. Then the Boards come, and GD didn't have their GD section at first...so they went *everywhere else.*","replies":[]},{"poster":"KING OF MASKS","date":"2015-02-12T22:05:14.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just get out of Psych 101 or what?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Killer X 12","date":"2015-02-12T21:56:46.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that is old news.

Old GD was full of posts by angry bronze players blaming their teammates for not being able to rise. It's why they're bronze.

I do agree its maybe a bit worse here than on other forums. People don't like to admit fault or weakness most of those posts are easy to ignore. There are some awesome people on this forum that do post good stuff. Sometimes finding those posts are a bit difficult as there is a bit of muck to wade through but it can be worth it.","replies":[]}]}
