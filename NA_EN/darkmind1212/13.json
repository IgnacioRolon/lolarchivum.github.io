This was my second win in my promos so I should have been able to advance to bronze 2. Though somehow when I went to go look at my information in the league tab it then showed I was at 76 Lp and now in bronze 4. I logged in and out a few times but it still remains the same. Not sure if this is a bug or something else since I have never had this happen before.  Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"AsReelAsItGets","date":"2015-06-10T20:13:47.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That does sound like a big problem man.\n\nIdk if they can fix your problem by bumping you up where you should be but you should not go down after winning. does your match history show you won your matches? use that is proof and submit a ticket. That's pretty much all you can do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crunchyfied","date":"2015-06-10T19:59:39.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit a ticket.
