A ranking does not show only knowledge. It has many other contributing factors to it be it something simple as the other player knowing more (which is normal) or simply getting that poor hand dealt with three fifths of your team fighting with themselves over a simple mistake. In a way you are right I will give you that but only to a certain degree.","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-07-10T10:30:11.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no he(strat) is right though i would argue the flip side also.

Look, I thought this was the case too when I was Bronze V. In fact, almost all Bronze V players think this when they land up there. It's the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect). \n\nThe longer you spend refusing to accept that you might not know as much as you think you do, the more time you'll waste stuck where you are. There are people who literally spend 1000s of games in Bronze V refusing to accept they may not know as much as they think they do, then they get a friend to coach them and they easily get to Gold+ (solo, no duo queuing) after a couple months.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BlacksSmokeCrack","date":"2015-07-10T07:28:24.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Stop crying when people type things about you in an online video game.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-07-10T10:11:16.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheFakeSit,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=ogZTPe51,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-07-10T07:28:24.695+0000)\n>\n> Stop crying when people type things about you in an online video game.\n\nAlso I forgot to mention none of the toxicity is never directed toward me I am just tired having to see it happen to the rest of my team is all XD.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-07-10T10:01:05.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheFakeSit,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=ogZTPe51,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-07-10T07:28:24.695+0000)\n>\n> Stop crying when people type things about you in an online video game.\n\nYou should read my reply to the other person who told me that XD.
