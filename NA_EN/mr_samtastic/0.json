So, this happened a couple days ago: I sent my friend /mistletoe LeBlanc but he didn't receive it. It turns out that I got it instead of gifting the skin to him. Would it maybe be possible to actually gift the skin to him? I don't have that much money and this is a skin he really wanted. I wouldn't want to waste 5 euros like that while I could've done something else with it. I never play LeBlanc, so this is a truly waste of money... It would be really nice if it's possible to gift it to him. This happened on 18 dec. Thank you in advance for the possible help, Greetings c:","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-20T17:25:17.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normally, we don't really assist with any content refunds once an account has already used their[ 3 refunds tokens](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ).
