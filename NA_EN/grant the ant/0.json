Let them know that you care if they fall, and that you will all get through together anyways.  If someone dies just say \"you where close\" or \"brave move\" or \"we can still do this, its okay\".  Plus as said above if you die dont blame others, let them know your team is still good and even if you are losing remember to be gracious and keep it as good an experience as possible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"alexstriker1999","date":"2013-11-29T00:05:50.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:222}} swag","replies":[]},{"poster":"jwf999","date":"2013-11-28T14:15:02.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I like this and riots support about it, good idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silencerturtle","date":"2013-11-27T21:03:25.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets d this,if it is successful the community might be nicer afterwards because we might have a habit saying \"It's okay,everyone makes mistake\"etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keikomatsui ","date":"2013-11-27T19:09:00.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Count me in like a bunch of bananas","replies":[]},{"poster":"Character One","date":"2013-11-27T16:25:12.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to take part!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hoai","date":"2013-11-27T03:30:34.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, currently, in LoL, when you die, you say, \"You Suck\" to yourself, it seems your saying?\n\nI just noticed I used too much commas.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hierodule","date":"2013-11-27T02:22:40.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I try to congratulate my opponents if it was a particularly skillful play, and I try to keep the positivity flowing throughout all the game - I like the concept, though, as a baseline to hold oneself to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheLastUzumaki","date":"2013-11-26T19:59:06.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Relogged twice after logging out twice to upvote.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paqi","date":"2013-11-26T23:58:26.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Actually, you should be apologizing for your mistake when you die.
