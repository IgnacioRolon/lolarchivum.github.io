I played him a couple games and went ~0/10 each time becuase I REFUSE to aim more than one skill shot per champion that I play.\r\n\r\nAll these champion reworks that add skill shots are making me mad, because my roster of champions has been reduced to garen akali and irelia and guess who they&#039;re reworking next?\r\n\r\nIrelia\r\n\r\nJust waiting for that all skill shot kit, so a preemptive thank you to riot for ruining my life","replies":[]}
