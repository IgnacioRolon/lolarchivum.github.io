We were doing pretty well early, got a double kill bot and a few kills mid, but as I was farming my jungle and going back our Riven died 2 times to their Riven without a kill and said \"time to jungle now\" and started taking all of my jungle and not ganking anyone. I had to go top to make sure their Riven didn't go out of control pushing top and farming but I was a bit overconfident and died to her twice as well. \r\n\r\nAt this point everyone on our team was flaming our Riven for saying \"screw top I'm jungle because Elise hasn't ganked me yet\" and basically kicking me top and flaming me for not ganking her in like 8 min. After the game we asked the enemy team to report our Riven for trolling the team and their Warwick said this: \"It's only normals so I won't report him\".\r\n\r\nThere are so many things wrong with this, so if I can't control dragon or gank lanes to help them snowball all because one person decided to go jungle because they lost their lane, it's fine because it's normals? I'm pretty sure if you had the same teammate do the same thing to you, you would want everyone to report him as well. BUT WAIT, it's only normals so it's perfectly fine for someone to screw the entire team over and force you somewhere else.\r\n\r\nThe worst thing was that it was teambuilder, I chose jungle because I felt like ganking people and making lanes snowball and carry the game. Not for a random top laner who CHOSE to go top to just go jungle bacuse 'I didn't gank their lane quickly enough'. When I play top I sort of expect our jungler to not gank me too often because if the enemy jungler has any sort of sense he would gank bot and take dragon if it's up. And when I play top and I'm losing my lane I play safe and build defensively. I don't give up when I die 2 times to the enemy laner and say 'fuck this I'm jungle' and not gank anyone and fail taking red buff (it was pretty funny watching our Riven try to take red though). I try to play safe and be more tanky and change my build.\r\n\r\nSorry, I had to take this off my chest since I'm pretty mad that:\r\n1. in teambuilder someone just went jungle after losing lane and\r\n2. the enemy team didn't report Riven because 'it's only normals'.\r\nI'm sorry if I don't want to play ranked yet, I like trying to win and not having trolls on my team.","replies":[{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2015-08-12T13:02:32.906+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":2,"body":"This attitude of 'it's not ranked, why try' seriously needs to stop. \n\nIf that's the case, why are you even playing normals.

If I want to play my best champ and work as hard as I can to play my best that game I am going to que for ranked. If I want to play something weird that can work but is more of a coin toss (Mundo mid to dive, kill lane bot, etc), or a champ I have literally never played before or am bad at and want to improve, I'm going to que for normals. I'm not going to go out of my way to make my team have a bad game, and I will report someone who does, but normals is where you practice stuff and get better (ideally).\n\nBots don't make you better, and most people don't want to tank their ranked account playing stuff they have a greater chance to lose with, so normals are where you end up to practice. I don't know that it is what you meant but there seems to be a misconception in some parts of the community that normals should be just as hard and competitive as ranked. They aren't and they shouldn't be. If you get your mmr high enough you can play just as challenging a game as you would in ranked but that is bc for anyone outside challenger or masters or something there is probably room to move up in difficulty of normals and be challenged. However, this doesn't and never should come from being a more competitive environment. Instead it is a situation where a plat or diamond player on a champ they haven't played before, or an off meta/weak champ/build is evenly matched with a silver/gold/plat player who is playing their strongest champ that they know well and building it to fit what is strong right now. The challenge is there, but it comes from playing up, and until you get your normals mmr higher than the level of people you would play in ranked, then you will always be frustrated by people playing weird stuff who aren't being jerks.","replies":[{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2015-08-12T22:36:07.673+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's fine to try new things in normals.

I almost exclusively play team builder because the only other role I am good at is top.  When I jungle, I like to do a full clear first, then take scuttles, then gank a lane.  Usually this is top or mid, because I start bot side.  If I can't gank, I will look to counter jungle before going to gank again.  If this is the case, my first gank will be around 6:00.  Most of the time, I won't get a kill on the gank, but just burn flash.  After a few ganks, my first back should complete my jungle item.  Then, I head for dragon.\nThis is where trouble starts.  While I do dragon, my toplaner seems to ALWAYS get ganked.  They will flame me for not being there to counter-gank, and all I can do is stutter.\nThen I continue to farm and gank botside, and my toplaner dies again.\n\"GG top is lost\"\n/all \"Report jg never ganks me\"\n\nEvery time...","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Chuckler","date":"2015-08-12T21:54:10.482+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I believed that al because it is normals, does not justify not reporting someone for negative behavior. Personally, I have been only playing with friends lately to avoid trolls/ragers/flamers/etc. I specifically do not like the ragers who will assault you for dying twice during laning phase, or will rage at you when they die and you backed off because it was a 2v4 and you were low health. I take feedback more personally and use it to improve my game playing, but when all I hear is raging on how \"i suck\" or \"why u no engage scrub?\" or other crap like that, I really get discouraged from playing the game. I can't help it, I just take feedback personally (wish I didn't). I remember I was playing a game as pre-rework GP against pre-rework Fiora. I could not do any damage to her as she would turn it against me with the parry. She tower-dived me twice before the 7 min. mark. I killed her the 2 times that she did, but after that I could not, and she repeatedly tower-dived me and I could do nothing to her (all of GP's Damage then was considered AA excluding ult, so I was screwed by parry and her amount of burst, not even {{item:3047}} could save me). My jg began to rage at me (who did not come top before 10 min mark or 12 min mark either) and then proceeds to go top uncoordinated and Fiora got a double kill. The then rages even more, saying \"wow, u suck. you are garbage.\" I told him I just recently began playing him (have played only 3 real games and 5 or so bot games at the time), and he proceeds to say, \"You should have learned how champ works before playing. You suck, you are garbage...\" and all of the typical crap. I tried explaining to him that I could do nothing to her, but he continued to rage and said how I cost us the game and on and on and on... needless to say, that was a horrible experience, and that has led me to mostly quit playing with randoms (BTW, this was normals, not ranked). I was as polite as possible, did not insult or complain, but he still raged. This is why people should report others, as a rager/feeder/intentional afk/ troll/etc. can really ruin the purpose of the game, to have fun and do your best. I am not against people goofing off sometimes if the have permission from their team mates and they do not mind, but to intentionally screw someone over needs to stop.\n\nP.S. the fiora began to proxy, which caused my jg to rage even more and make me feel even more like crap... it was BAD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Señor Karthus","date":"2015-08-12T20:40:47.821+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the same or even worse in ARAM.
