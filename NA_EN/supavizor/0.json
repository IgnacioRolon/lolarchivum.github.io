I did not get banned again and I didn't notice when I no longer had the border.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-15T18:58:24.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For issues related directly to your account, it's best to submit a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[]}]}
