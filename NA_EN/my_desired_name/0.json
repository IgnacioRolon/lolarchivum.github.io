I think it's working now, but it's only the legacy client.\n\n- Go to your League of Legends install folder. Default is (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends) go to \\RADS\\system\n- Locate the user.cfg file and open with notepad\n- Change leagueClientOptIn = yes to leagueClientOptIn = no\n- Save and go to your League install directory and run lol.launcher.exe","replies":[]},{"poster":"LiteSprite","date":"2017-01-19T14:56:26.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am also having the same problem, But to top it off.

Bugsplats usually indicate a bad game file or driver, so I'm worried you might end up crashing after getting into a game.  To be safe, I'd suggest a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) just in case.  Or at least test your game out in a custom game first!  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
