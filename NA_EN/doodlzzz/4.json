I don't think it's reasonable to assume that squishies like adcs or supports will be able to kill morde no matter how well they play because his kit is just so much better for 1-on-1 fighting.\r\n\r\nI personally think there was nothing wrong with his pre-rework ult, so I think if it was brought back, we'd be better off.","replies":[{"poster":"The Stripy Bag","date":"2019-09-22T06:32:35.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you try to build a QSS?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LaceUpXX","date":"2019-09-22T00:46:01.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the rest of his kit is more unfun than the ult lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChiefDovahkin","date":"2019-09-22T00:43:22.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's so many champions he can ult and just run down from level 6 on.

Getting ulted by a morde that can't actually beat you is about the most enjoyable this game gets. It's worth getting ulted when you're losing sometimes lol","replies":[]}]}
