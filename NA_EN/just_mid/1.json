Now that day is here. But are you meaning to tell me when i throw those axes they arent gonna make squeaky noises when i throw them? I mean anything, just that noise that ziggs makes when he explodes his satchel in pool party ziggs. I speak for draven mains everywhere when I say, make those axes squeaky!","replies":[]}
