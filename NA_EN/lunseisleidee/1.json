I'm at six wins now. I also received honor points after the match. My honor level is 2.\r\n\r\nI haven't been playing for 2 months so I would assume the counter had resetted.\r\n\r\nBut I haven't gotten a single key fragment so far and I am losing my patience. Am I bugged or did Riot nerf the fragment drop rate?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-20T16:21:28.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, and do see that your honor is high enough for fragments.  Fragments will drop at the same rate as it had before over a 28 day period.  The only difference is Honor Capsules in addition at Level 3.  \n\nThe last time you received fragments was June 20, and you've only played around 10 matches since then.  I agree with Kokua that playing games is going to be your best bet.  Fragments are not guaranteed, but your chances are improved the more you play.
