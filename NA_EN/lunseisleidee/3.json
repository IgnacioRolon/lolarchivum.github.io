Some people like the promiscuous types, and some like the reserved types.\n\nSome older champions that have been sexualized in the past are also becoming a lot more reserved; Lux, for example. Akali's become less sexual (And come her eventual VGU, Nurse Akali will look like an actual doctor, like Surgeon Shen, less like a stripper nurse). Riot's implied that they want Caitlyn to be less sexual. There's Karma and Illaoi and Leona and Quinn and Irelia and Xayah (Some people get it on for Xayah, but she really is one of the more reserved champions), and yes, Taliyah.\n\nYeah, people like Evelynn, but it's not all just because of her sexuality, it's because Riot is really pushing the limit, here. It's different, it's new, and it's daring, it's stuff most game devs don't try to do. Yeah, games will have sexy champions, but rarely is a champion actually sexual, much less so overtly sexual that it can't help but be exciting because it's so different and unconventional.","replies":[{"poster":"witchy punc","date":"2017-09-27T22:46:45.321+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":7,"body":"\"its something most game devs dont do\" in response to an incredibly sexual female characters? uhhh ever played literally any other video game? street fighter? bayonetta? darkstalkers??????

But there is a difference between one being sexy and one being sexual. Using League as an example, {{champion:103}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:21}} have sexuality as a part of their character and story, while characters like {{champion:84}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:51}} were sexy looking just for the sake of being sexy, which is something Riot has specifically tried to stop doing.\n\nLet's use a different example - World of Warcraft. Sylvanas Windrunner is a good example of a champion being sexy without it being sexual. She's got that 'sexy' looking appearance, and is scantily clad, but sexuality isn't a part of her theme or story; far from it, she's a vengance seeker who leads an army of undead people. Alexstrasza, on the other hand, is likened to a fertility goddess; as the Dragon Aspect of Life, it's said that her scantily clad appearance promoted procreation, similar to fertility goddesses in real life mythology.\n\nRiot has done a great job of making both sexual and non-sexual characters as of late. See the females I mentioned - Leona, Quinn, Taliyah, Illaoi, Xayah, all these characters aren't sexy in the traditional sense; someone can find them sexy, of course, but sexuality isn't the implicit thematic behind them.\n\nDo you understand what I'm trying to say?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BubblyRainbows","date":"2017-09-27T18:26:38.238+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"As a female gamer, this is the sort of thing that has long irritated me in gaming in general. However, if you really look at gaming in general and Riot in particular, it's moving in a much less exploitative direction over recent years. For League, I could be wrong, since I don't have the whole roster in front of me to look at in progression right now, but early champions seemed more slanted toward busty, scantily clad female champions, while the last few years are much more varied in overall appearance and style.\n\nAs someone else said, most gamers are heterosexual male teens. So the \"sexy girl\" stereotype plays to many of their interests, and gives Riot a good way to grab the largest gamer demographic. But there have been a lot of different body types and personalities over the last few years, each sexy in their own way (I happen to believe that almost every body type can be sexy). I do think that Riot does a pretty good job of diversifying the body types and personalities among their female champions overall. Eve is the first one in a good while that really jumped out at me as overly sexualized. But... She's a succubus (essentially, if not intended to be literally so). Sexualized is pretty much the defining trait for succubii.","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2017-09-27T19:24:08.932+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eye candy is generally liked be it because of sexyness, epicness or whatever fantasy factor you want to put in it.\n\nEvelynn rework in general has been a discussed and followed topic for a lot of time and the fact that turned out as something at the edge of the game's pegi is just an explosive \"Woah!!\" that's going to mitigate in few days.\n\nThere have been a similar explosion at the new Taric and Galio too, reading too much in it in terms of social/politics is just wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2017-09-27T23:03:52.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot once said, a LONG time ago, that the reason most female character were big-busted was because of the limited graphics engine.

There have been hints to the past that Leblanc is much older than she appears, using illusions to appear more attractive in order to better \"distract\" people. \n\n\nThen we have Taliyah and Illaoi. Both are very different from your \"sexy\" build and their body types make sense. Taliyah is a teenager, maybe 14 so she's not exactly gone through puberty. So if she was a bombshell then it wouldn't make sense. Illaoi similarly needs a large and strong body to throw around her idol (which shouldn't be used as a weapon) to hit people. Giving her a bombshell body just wouldn't make sense for her character. \n\nRiot admitted that a lot of their old female champions are basically using the same models with different hairstyles and are seeking to better diversify their women. But that doesn't mean they aren't going to stop making \"sexy\" or that suddenly making \"sexy\" champions means that they'll stop trying to diversify their women. \n\nIf it makes sense with the character, then Riot will do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JooshBox","date":"2017-09-27T19:26:59.942+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot made a conscious decision to make females of varying body types ever since Lissandra's release.

Evelynn isn't even a new champion she was always sexy she just looks _sexier_ now. I'd even argue all those champs I listed are sexy/attractive in their own way. I think it's actually ridiculous to complain about Riot oversexualizing a **succubus character**.","replies":[{"poster":"MistaFarenheit","date":"2017-09-28T11:34:40.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THANK YOU eve is a pretty damn good rework in my opinion but even so jinx is my highest rated, most played, and still favorite champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2017-09-27T20:57:26.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nicely put, took the words out of my mouth.

That's not even questionable.\n\nThat said, despite the fact that older (23+) people are a minority, they have a much higher purchasing power than teens. Especially the ones with degrees and jobs.\n\nA stable long-term strategy for League is to attract teens and retain them into their adulthood, which will yield maximum profit. This is why I believe childish and mature designs come in waves, where the former is focused on getting new players, and the latter - on retaining and winning over older ones.","replies":[{"poster":"LunSeiSleidee","date":"2017-09-27T17:43:54.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That kinda sounds like a clever plan.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2017-09-27T19:30:42.738+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to see you say something positive about a new champ just once.
