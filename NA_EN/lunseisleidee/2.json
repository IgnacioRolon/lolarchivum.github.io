Feel free to comment!\r\n\r\n1) Her design is that of a seductress-killer: that makes her essentially Eve 2.0. So I had an idea. Perhaps, while keeping her seductress theme, she may have a motherhood theme. Those little spiderlings that she creates by placing them in their victim.... It is an underdeveloped idea both in gameplay and in narrative.\r\n\r\n2) I wish she had a skin in which she looks like a spider when she transforms. If you notice, nearly all of her skins make her spider form seem like a construct rather than an animal. The only exception is Death Blossom Elise. I am still dreaming of Void Elise or Shurima Elise....\r\n\r\n\r\nTL,DR - I am not a fan of her skins, especially their spider form. I wish she had a &quot;mother of spiders&quot; theme to differentiate her from Evelynn.","replies":[{"poster":"Zyranium","date":"2017-10-15T16:49:52.849+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can agree that her theme is really outdated now, she has one of the best gameplay from s2 but we have to clarify things...\n\nLive Elise does not look like a spider queen, just a female vampire on high heels who throws kamikaze spiders and...

I think it would also be nice if monsters and other units killed within a few sec of her using Cacoon/Rappel or the poison ability became nests that mature over time. That way she reflects that spider mother/ spider druid theme more by creating areas of her spider control. They could easily make the wall webs her human passive on a CD. when it's active she clicks on a wall, walks 2 it then walks 2 another wall","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2017-10-16T00:07:57.499+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think she should have much more of a priestess look to her.

There's like 2 billion spider species on earth which could be used as inspiration for skins.

Her transformation pattern serves no strategic purpose whatsoever, you just switch form when your cooldowns are down and want more burst. A bit more restricted transformation mechanic could allow her to have more strategic gameplay. Think of Kayn's transformation on Elise but the difference being she could change her form whenever she visits base.
