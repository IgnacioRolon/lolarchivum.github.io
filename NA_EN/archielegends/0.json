As others pointed out, purely focusing the tank can be wrong, as they are meant to soak the damage. By focusing them you are doing exactly what they want you to do.\nHowever, you should certainly NOT follow a blind \"never attack the tank, always go for the carry\"-mentality. You should prioritize attacking the enemy carrys, IF you are in the position to do so or you can get into such a position safely. You should certainly not ignore the enemy Amumu and Volibear in front of and just try to run straight through them to get to the enemy ADC. Staying safe as a carry is more important in my opinion. It's better to deal damage onto the enemy tanks, than to be dead.\nBringing down the enemy frontline can also win you a fight, since their carrys then have no protection and possibly have to give up the fight. \nIt also depends on what you are playing; peeling the enemy Illaoi off of your fed ADC with your CC as Leona can also be the right choice for example.\nSo, basically it's not as easy as \"Always do this\"; I think that you need to stay flexible and adjust according to what your champion offer and to what the situation is. There is also no real way to say \"If this, then do this\"; it comes with experience when what is the right thing to do.\n\n2.) CS'ing is important, because its reliable. Getting a kill is good, but you are not always in the situation to do so. If you are for example playing against someone, who stays really far back and plays very safe, but farms alot better than you, then you will both go back at one point, but he will have more gold, giving him an item advantage. Making it even harder for you to kill him. Or when you are in a bad lane matchup. In the end, you will want to have both - kills AND CS, since both get you gold, and you want to get as much gold as possible. So, don't focus on one; try to learn how to get both.\nFor numbers: I think, 100CS at 10 minutes is the maximum, that the pros can rougly achieve, around 80 is quite good for us normal folk. For minute 20, i think you should try ro get something around 150. Also depends on the situation; if you are roaming alot and getting kills/assists, a bit less is still fine. The more the better however.\nHow to improve: Well, if you want to train it, you can go into a custom game without bots and just go into a lane, trying to get as many lasthits as possible. \nPractice makes perfect, you could say.\n\n3.) Well, typing a funny comment is not bad per se, but don't provoke people and never let youself get distracted by it. Focus on the game, not on the chat. And never argue with people ingame, there is never a point to it .^^\nAnd remember, that time is CS, and CS is gold, and you want gold. Much gold. All the gold of the world.

Focusing the tank isn't purely wrong,but if there are other targets with less tankiness and more damage that you're able to focus while not putting yourself at (too) much risk it's better to focus them rather than the tank,however if you're not capable of attacking anyone other than the tank you should attack them\n\n2. CS is a safer and more secure way of getting gold,around 20 or so minions equal 1 kill iirc,kills take a lot more effort to get and while they are good,it's not always good to focus completely on harassing the enemy to get a kill later on if you let your CS go,try to kill minions then harass the enemy until you eventually get a kill while you have no minions that will be low enough for you to kill within the next few seconds\nA good amount of CS to have is 70-80 by 10 minutes,if it's a tough lane for you less is fine. Try to go in to a custom with no items,runes and masteries and practice farming there\n\n3. Typing in all chat isn't bad,arguing with others,or insulting others and so on is bad because it makes you lose focus and play worse,but a joke or some friendly chit-chat isn't bad at all and imo actually lightens the mood and helps me play sometimes\n\n\nas for general tips\n-Don't go in to ranked until you learn 2 roles decently well\n-Practice map awareness: try to look at the map every 10 seconds at least.I'm having a bit of truoble with that too as a laner but as a jungler I'm fine\n-Keep in mind objectives > kills,aka don't chase a low HP enemy for like 2 minutes across the map while you could instead take a tower or such\n-Learn to adapt:  every game is different,different games require you to take a different playstyle and item build,don't stick with the same playstyle or item build throughout every game,this also applies to things that happen in the game,like you could be planning to go full AD J4 but if you die a few times early on it's simply better to adapt by going tank and letting your team do the dmg since you're underfed and you just CC the enemy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xelnex","date":"2016-04-23T10:57:35.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mew if you have any more questions lemme know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeBlanc Jameś","date":"2016-04-21T18:59:53.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that a nut sack in the OP's post?\n\n#ω","replies":[{"poster":"archieLegends","date":"2016-04-23T10:52:27.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ohmygod","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"4th Chiming Lamb","date":"2016-04-21T16:10:55.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, first off: DO NOT JUMP INTO RANKED YET! Ranked is a HUGE change from Normals. In normals, people have fun, chill, but still try to win. In ranked, people scream, rage whenever you miss a cs, report you for intentional feeding if you have a bad game (which is actually against the rules, y'know. Can't report someone for feeding. Only intentional feeding.), and report you for scripting if you have a good game (which you also cant do). DO NOT PLAY RANKED, PERIOD, actually.\n\nOn to your questions.\n1: You don't focus the tank because it's their job to take damage, and they're hard to kill. Focusing them takes valuable time and damage away from targets who would hurt more, like the ADC or mid laner. I personally focus in this order: ADC > APC/Jungler > Bruiser > Tank\n\n2: Killing the enemy does give you gold and put them behind, but CS is more important in-lane. Let's say that we're fighting in lane. You have 200 CS, no kills, and I have 150 CS, one kill. You would be ahead of me as if you had killed me once and I didn't. \ntl;dr: Kills are important, but don;t sacrifice CS for a kill.\n\n3: Don't type in /all with your plans. You can TALK to the enemy team, but don't relay your plans, such as:\n\"/all udyr come gank mid pls\". I had an enemy a week-ish ago who typed EVERYTHING in /all in the name of \"Good Sportsmanshit\". Yeah, you read that right.\nAlso, Shift+Enter is faster than typing /all. Try that insteasd.\n\nHope this helped y'out!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stardew Valley","date":"2016-04-21T15:40:43.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. You don't focus the tank because they take longer to kill.\nFocus on adcs/ the carry that does a ton of damage.\nIf you focus on the tank, the enemy carries can kill you before you even kill the tank\n\n2. CS isn't necessarily better than kills, but it's safer to get gold from cs than kills (unless you're a hyper carry)\nFocus more on cs if you're playing a champ that can't easily kill.\nCS is important early game because you're able to buy the items you want early, and be able to focus more on fights mid/late game.\n\n3. You shouldn't type in /all because /all allows the enemy team to see what you're typing.\nUsually people just use /all for trash talking/ other comments.","replies":[{"poster":"archieLegends","date":"2016-04-21T15:58:42.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> the carry that does a ton of damage.\n\nWhat happens if their carry is a really tanky Darius or Illaoi or something like that?

Tanks are generally in the front line and trying to prevent you from hitting the enemy carries and/or locking down your carries to prevent them from dealing damage. Don't ignore tanks, especially right now (tank items are really strong right now), but if you can, you'd rather be focusing the biggest damage threats on the enemy team and whoever you can kill quickly to gain a numbers advantage.\n\n> **2) CS &amp;gt; Kills?**\n\nI think ~10-15 CS = 1 Kill? Basically CS is your most reliable source of gold, so you want to have that as a safe source of income because you can't always rely on killing your opponent. If you can get the kill, by all means, go for it, but don't chase kills and neglect CSing.\n\n100 CS @ 10 minutes is the goal for most players; most pros hit around 80-90 @ 10 minutes in a typical game. I get around 70 @ 10 minutes if I'm playing well (I haven't been playing ranked, but I was S2 last season). Bear in mind that getting high CS doesn't mean you're as good as a pro; it's more difficult to CS the better your opponent is. No matter what your skill level is, you should aim to hit 100 CS @ 10 minutes (it's very difficult).\n\nTo practice, just go into custom games by yourself and practice. 10 minutes a day goes a long way. There are other things you can do to increase difficulty, like adding extra enemy bots to harass and zone you off of CS.\n\n> **3) Why shouldn&amp;#039;t you type in /ALL ?**\n\nGenerally, /ALL chat just incites flame wars and toxicity, and distracts from the game. Some players are incredibly toxic, even if you're saying \"glhf\" at the beginning of the game, they'll start to flame you. You can always use /ALL, but just be aware you might get wrapped up in a whole lot of stuff that doesn't matter\n\n> also if you have any tips for improving my gameplay pls tell me senpai ty ヾ(｡･&amp;omega;･)ｼ\n\nThese guys produce pretty useful instructional videos:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeGtVfZD9LVttCJzjIJLY1g\n\nThis guy is a well known coach, he knows a lot of the concepts of the game and communicates them pretty well:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/lastshadow9\n\nMostly it's practice and being wary of your own gameplay, recognizing your own mistakes and finding ways you can improve","replies":[{"poster":"archieLegends","date":"2016-04-21T16:05:18.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for this reply and explaining all the points I needed to know (especially no.2)!\nI will defiantly watch these videos to improve.\nThank you :'>","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrShoking","date":"2016-04-21T15:42:12.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. depends on what you're playing, if you're an assassin or diver you usually want to focus the back-line squishes that do a lot of damage(adc, mages, etc)\nUsually, you want to attack the highest priority target(the one who does the most damage and is easiest to kill) that's safe to attack.\n\n2.  csing gives you more gold . Killing is important, but you don't want to be missing alot of cs by poking the enemy. kills are worth + 300 gold at first , it goes down and up each time the enemy gets a kill or dies max 500, min 50. csing gives you about 15 gold per minion.
