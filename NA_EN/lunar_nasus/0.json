In my excitement, I accidentally scrolled over and clicked \"Play\", which brought me back to the lobby. \n\nThinking it was no big deal, I reopened the \"Loot\" section of the client, only to my horror, see that instead of 6 boxes to open (10 - 4), I instead only had the two \"free\" boxes left to open with keys I craft myself.\n\nThus, I am missing a total of 4 hextech boxes I never got to open.\n\nIs there a way to check + refund this portion of the purchase? I am extremely annoyed because the first 3 boxes were your typical champion shards, but the last 4 are always epic/legendary skins with a high chance.\n\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-01T03:52:31.248+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off I wanted to clear this misconception up; opening multiple boxes one after another does *not* increase the chance of getting epic/legendary skins. The drop chance is exactly the same for each chest. \n\nAfter looking through your recent Hextech Crafting history, it looks like you were able to open all 20 of those chests back to back.
