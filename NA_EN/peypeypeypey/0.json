Any advice?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello everyone. I've been running into this problem for about a day now, and when I googled it, I couldn't seem to find anyone who had the exact same problem that I do.\r\nBasically, whenever I load into a game, my computer completely freezes up. Two days ago, my computer ran League perfectly fine. However, when I got up yesterday, and tried to play a game, everything was fine up until I tried to load into the game, but as soon as I was actually in the game, my computer completely froze up. I couldn't move my mouse, it wasn't responsive to anything I did. It was just frozen at about 00:02 of the game. I tried restarting my computer, relogging, and then tried it all again, and the same thing happened. I have no idea what's wrong with it.\r\nI tried other games, and all of them work perfectly fine, including DOTA 2, so I don't know exactly what the problem is.\r\nMy computer is an HP 15 TS Notebook PC, and it has never had any problem running League before. Does anyone know what I should do?","replies":[{"poster":"dabeastslaya1240","date":"2016-08-20T19:52:23.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same exact problem it started after the new window 10 update. the updated took 5 hours to install.

My game freezes for about 10 seconds once i load into a game. It's not a big deal it's just a little annoying but this also started after the most recent windows 10 update. This only happens on summoners rift but if i try to play aram/howling abyss i load in like normal but after about a minute my game tabs me back to my home screen but stays overlapping everything forcing me to restart my computer. If i join back to the aram/ howling abyss match the same thing happens over and over however only 50% of the time this happens the bug-splat comes up which means i often get leave bans when it isn't my fault. I also have a HP laptop like Peypeypeypey.
