The ticket was 5000 won (cheap). Once I bought the ticket here in Seoul, It told me they were in the Yongson e-sports stadium. I could find a good map or directions how to get there because I was using a Korean computer, but I directions when I asked someone after walking away from where it was supposed to be. It was on the 9th floor of the Ipark mall,just south of the train station. The elevato was hard to find so I took the escalators. I saw Najin vs Samsung and KT vs Koo Tigers. I won't spoil the games, but I got exactly what you hoped for. The games were awesome. Thank you again. I highly recommend watching LCK in person if you to Seoul.","replies":[]}]}]}
