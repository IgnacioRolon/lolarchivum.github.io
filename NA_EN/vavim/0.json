And banned until Feb 22...\r\n\r\nI have no idea how to even use anything, im playing from a Mac mini, just for fun.\r\n\r\nI know i got an error message now or then cause the game could not connect. But retrying always worked without problems. I can&#039;t see anyone reporting me, as im always friendly and helpfull and get plenty honours for it.\r\n\r\nI have tried sending a mail to Riot. Is there anything else i can do?\r\n\r\nTo say that i just bought Riot points for Kennens new skin :(.\r\n\r\nAny advice?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMichael.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2016-06-01T16:39:03.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Possibly another ban wave from 3rd party program users.

I have nothing related to this game except the game itself on my mac. So what stops them from banning me again? \n\nThis is just not fair, they can just remove all they want from their game cause something somehow spotted something, even if ya didnt do it. \n\nI thought america used judge and jury?
