What I mean is that currently there is a definitive pick order. and that would need to be changed. For example when players 2 and 3 of blue team are picking; currently player 2 has to lock-in a champion before player 3 can even select one. While in tournament games players 2 and 3 can both hover / lock-in their champions at the same time. Should bans become round robin as well this would be a necessity to facilitate a smooth transition through champion select, and into the game. \n\nRealistically, short of allowing bans to be selected before even entering champion select there is no feasible solution in which you can allow each player 20-30 seconds to select their bans individually. At the same time champion select feels hurried as it is, so lowering that amount of time to 10-15 seconds would only feel bad for the players. \n\nThen there is integrating bans into the pick phase. There's two options with integrating bans into the pick phase, and both of them piggyback off of the lock-out I mentioned in the first paragraph. You can either have double round robin, or reverse double round robin. Double round robin obviously being that as champion select goes 1/2/2/2/2/1 each player would select a champion to ban before selecting their intended pick. Reverse double round robin being that each player would ban before the _enemy_ team picked their champions.\n\nOverall, moving forward with a 10 ban system it seems absolutely crucial that the selection lock-out in non-tournament games be removed. If for no other reason than to shorten the amount of time transitioning through champion select, but there are also strategic pluses to it as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ailetoile","date":"2016-10-28T00:39:37.948+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, the most straightforward way to take care of it would be to basically piggyback on the existing champ select format (blue 1 / red 2 / blue 2 / red 2 / blue 2 / red 1), which has six time slots for picking.

You could implement an extra four bans without adding any extra time to champion select by just mimicking or mirroring the champ select process with the ban process.

This can be either manual or automatic. Let's discuss automatic first...\n\nAn automatic implementation is this. Just make the client iterate through each player selecting each ban before the game starts until it's gotten through all the players for all of the bans that those players selected. \n\nFor example... \n\n1. Player 1 (blue team), ban first priority.\n2. Player 2 (red team), first priority is banned, so ban second priority, .etc. \n\nNow, this system might be problematic. There could be conflicts or the bans might not be representative of all the players \"AS A TEAM\" since players aren't able to discuss as a team what those bans should be before they pick them. In other words this system seems SoloQ oriented. The response is \"Well then teams can't decide who to ban\".\n\nAn automatic and manual ban phase could then look like this (for speed)... Output all of the teams 'preference bans' to the screen (ONLY THE PREFERENCE BANS NOT ALL CHAMPIONS), instead of beginning an automatic ban phase. Then give each player one ban, and then both teams select the bans they want simultaneously, and the client uses those bans. \n\nThe only possible conflict there is players banning the same champion on one or more teams. This can be resolved by a standard Ban Phase (like the one we have now), until there are 5 bans on each side (one representing every player) or going back through to preference bans.\n\nSorted. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} World of options Meddler!

For example, Yasuo mains will NEVER get to play the champ again at certain elo ranges. At my elo, Bronze/Silver Yasuo is permabanned. He still gets to see a bit of play but only because some people prefer to ban much stronger(or seemingly stronger) champions like Leblanc, Syndra, Xin, Darius etc and there aren't enough bans to ban them and Yasuo too. It's so bad, that it actually seems strange when people don't ban him. That is how often he is banned.

I think it&#x27;s quite likely we move to a 10 ban system, though that&#x27;s not guaranteed yet. Assuming we do go to 10 bans it&#x27;s also possible Pro games and regular games might make the change at somewhat separated times (different workflows for draft matchmaking games versus tournament draft in custom games which is what Pro uses).\n\nIf I am planning a tournament that uses custom - tournament draft and this was to take place in december what would I most likely be working with around that time? \n\nNeed to know for rules and requirements for participation. \n\nThanks in advance!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LORD27MAD","date":"2016-10-28T19:44:56.664+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meddler please respond to this .. \nAs a yasuo one trick main  in the current 6 ban system i rarely get to play yasuo .. now my fear is a 10 ban system would = 100% ban rate on my champ .. i know this might be not on your priority list but it hurts man .. the one system that seems nice to me is a mixed between picking and banning .. like on dota 2 .. and btw when a syndra and ryze more op but people still ban yasuo .. its not a balance thing ,, \"Wohoooo 100% ban rate Yasuo, cant wait.\" this is taking from the comment section ..","replies":[]},{"poster":"DoktorKaiser","date":"2016-10-28T00:01:40.201+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wohoooo 100% ban rate Yasuo, cant wait.","replies":[]},{"poster":" Señor Hot Buns","date":"2016-10-27T23:13:56.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you considered 8 bans as sort of that perfect middle ground?","replies":[{"poster":"Matt Kush","date":"2016-10-27T23:29:02.860+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its best to just jump straight to ten.\nMy reasoning is that, we already have so many champs and they will continue to make more, 8 bans would be great now, but eventually there will be so many champs that we will have to go to ten.

BUT have you considered what would happen when teams play vs SKT for example. I guarantee at least 4 of 5 bans will be midlainers, which means Faker will never again play Syndra Ryze Cassiopeia or Oriana. The same goes for every team who has a stand out star.\n       Мaybе don't allow professional teams to pick the same champions in a row, and allow them one pick before the bans. This guarantees a diversity in champ selection and allows one pick of choice for the team.\n        It's not a bad idea, think it trough and make it even better.","replies":[]}]}
