At least mini dragons and Baron are 1 minute apart so chances are that both will be up at the same time making a trade be a potential option, but with Baron and Elder being 3 minutes apart from each other that is rarely ever going to be the case in a longer game and you only really get one shot at the buff anyway.

Taking it should therefore be at least as much of a risk as Baron.\n\nThe boss fight-ey feeling of Baron can level the playing field for a team that's behind as the leading team challenging Baron has to spread their focus between the actions of Baron and the enemy as well as taking more AoE damage.
