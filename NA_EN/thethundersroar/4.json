If more of your teammates lose their lanes/objectives they lose the game. The teams with the players who are more skilled at their champion have an advantage and can push to win. I won't dare say the game is balanced right now, with early game monsters in top and late game gods in bot despite being an early game meta. I DO prefer winning a 20 min game because we pushed our lead instead of losing a 47 min game where we did everything we could but {{champion:115}} waveclear combined with {{champion:57}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:33}} means they just turtle until they outscale and win because of their PICK and not because of their skill.","replies":[{"poster":"Lios Ashenblade","date":"2018-01-14T15:09:30.391+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"I mean, this is essentially a tower defense game, defending is an important skill, too many people forget that","replies":[{"poster":"Warwick Main","date":"2018-01-15T00:42:38.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lios Ashenblade,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XiIEYpGb,comment-id=000200000000000100010000,timestamp=2018-01-14T15:09:30.391+0000)\n>\n> defending is an important skill\n\nAgreed, but there is a limit.
