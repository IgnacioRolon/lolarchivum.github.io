If Riot can do something about it, i would fight that fiora any day than the one we have right now. \n\nIf she is nothing without her ult, then Riot needs to balance that out. Giving free true damage, heals, aoe heals, attack speed reduction and so much more to balance out a toxic ult just seems stupid.\n\nBefore, her passive was jack shit. I agree with that. Her Q was okay and atleast you can stick on to a target for a little while. Her Riposte was balanced. Period. Her Ult is what made Old FIora Old Fiora. \n\nNow we have a very strong passive, which is neat but bs at the same time. This filled up the gaps of her old X per 5 sustain and the damage from her old Ripoiste\n\nHer Q is a free escape. It sucks tho, but atleast the cd is high if she manages to hit nothing. But if she is fighitng you and she lands a Q, her rapier is gonna be shoved down until you are dead (assuming it's just you and her).\n\nHer Riposte is heavily filled with bs. She deals damage. Stuns if she was gonna get stunned, attack speed reduction, slow, and takes no damage at all. Before it was just one basic attack. For Riot to balance out this riposte, she doesn't gain any AD. 40 to 50 AD (im not too sure on the exact numbers) vs all of these things above. The AD is replaced with her % health true damage so consider that extra. I would love that Fiora could just riposte one ability, but I think she got the Award of #LC$BIGPLAY$ and is in the Hall of Fame with {{champion:64}} and {{champion:412}} \n\nHer E is fine. Its just something she took from Darius same for her Riposte. Her E before was pretty strong. THats what actually made her the Grand Duelist. Burst of attack speed. Now we have auto attack reset with a stronger 2nd hit, which is basically a free crit at lv 5. A good trade off compared to the other abilities.\n\nUlt is pretty ridiculous. Can only be countered through {{item:3053}} and {{item:3140}}. Old Ult, you gotta take the damage. Trade off is that she gets a butt load amount of heal before and deals a lot of AoE damage, Now she gives AoE Heal. AoE heal is far worse than AoE damage because you can exhaust that damage. You cant exhaust true damage and you have {{champion:40}}'s ult on crack\n\nOn paper, anyone would say that Riot overtuned her. Does she need more nerfs? I don't think so right now. We will just have to wait, but she is my top ban for bs.\n\nI might've missed some \"vital\" information, but this is what I see right now compared to old fiora and the current one.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cloak an Dagger","date":"2016-03-22T17:49:37.587+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheThundersRoar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EtAgG6Pf,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-03-22T17:43:05.001+0000)\n>\n> **Skill requirement of playing _as_ Fiora:**\n> \n> * Point to the side with a vital, press Q.\n> * If you see shit coming, press W.\n> * Right click the dude.\n> \n> **Skill requirement of playing _against_ Fiora:**\n> \n> * Position perfectly so you can farm while keeping the vital side away.\n> * Keep up a near-instant reaction time to move the vital away when she dashes.\n> * Know when to simply stand back and give up farm when the vital side is facing her.\n> * Know when to hold your CC and wait for her W.\n> * Be able to bait out her W.\n> * Be able to turn on her and cast CC before she can W.\n> * Know when she is going to W to slow and dodge it.\n> * Be able to kite and lead the fight out of her activated R.\n> * Watch her Q cooldown so you can cast your skillshots then.\n> \n> #And that&#039;s on top of the skill it takes to play your own champ.\n> \n> How is this fair?\n\nShe's finally getting some nerfs but her kit is just oppressive in the way it's designed.
