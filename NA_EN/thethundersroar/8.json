His autos, while the empowered does scale on armor, are more geared towards sustained fights, which means that they aren't going to do him much good in bursty team fights. Furthermore, I've never seen a Taric build any kind of penetration, so that means his autos will almost always have chances to be diminished by defensive stats. Taric is hardly the \"overly damage heavy tank\" you're making him out to be on account of how he builds.

You can't take a champion that was balanced, had clear strengths with a mid game power trough, than make her headshots proc on E and W, add a few hundred range to them, and give her amazing seige potential by spamming multiple traps at once.  \n\nYou slapped mechanics that gave the champion the ability to do 2x the damage it did before, then did that across the board on nearly an ENTIRE CLASS, then somehow expected the game would remain in the balanced state it was in Season 5?\n\nThe reason LCS and playing the game in general is boring, is teamfights last no longer than a single skill rotation.  Go back and watch Season 4 footage.  The teamfights lasted longer, it gave people more opportunities to make plays and show off the strengths of a champion kit.  I remember back when you had to win maybe two trades before you could all in for the kill.  \n\nThis is my favorite forum post of the entire season.  Thank you OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2016-06-28T16:13:36.235+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damagecreep has been going on since S3, but it really accelerated alot this season. Especially the keystones ad so much more damage to the game while hardly giving proper defense.\nThe item changes also contributed to more damage overall, especially the LW changes, as strange as it sounds. But the new %pen items just deny any tankiness later in the game. No chance getting even decently tanky vs 45%pen.\nAlso, why the fuck did they just slap another 15-20 ad on each adc built in 6.12??? \nSlaping % damag on every tank %pen or truedamage on everyone else with every rework doesn't help either...\n\nI think it's mandatory to fix the absurd damagecreep befor the assasin-update. As it is now, assasins need to oneshot targets really fast and reliable or have a really save way out, else they don't work. If an assasin doesn't kill it's target in a splitsecond(talking about lategame teamfights), he will die on the spot him self cause an adc can 3 shot them at that point, which barly takes more than a sec. The reason why tank akali and so on became a thing is that, unless really fed, theri damage pattern is to delayed to go glasscannon, and with the current amounts of damage, bruiser is nearly the same as glasscanon, it won't make you tanky enough to survive for another rotation.\n\nThe damage creep is also a reason why tanky dps like shy struggle alot, beeing melee with sustained damage patterns doesn't work in a world where a fulltank can die within <3 sec if focused.","replies":[]}]}
