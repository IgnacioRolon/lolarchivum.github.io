Granted, this relies on there being a reasonable zone im near that i can pressure.\n\nCompletely disagree. If you are the tank and a non split push champion, as a top laner, it is critical for you to always respond to a baron call. I would say support and top laner are first responders to every baron. Your jungler can even show up late to simply smite it if you start the baron early. Yes you have TP, but sometimes the TP is too late and if you are the Tank you need to be present to mitigate baron's aoe damage (which increases over time). I use to hold the same views, but my opinion began to change as I moved up in rank and baron became a more common call.\n\nBaron calls began to improve when I hit gold, people became more aware of baron opportunities. In Silver, people only take baron's if it is \"free.\" It is the \"win harder\" objective. Players do not understand when they can take it and when they have it they often only take towers they probably could have gotten without the baron. They maybe use it to win the game but they probably could have won the game without the baron. When I hit high silver and later got into gold at the end of last season, baron was more often used to put pressure on the map or to mitigate an opponent's lead. It was used more defensively. \n\nI would say it is highly common for a team to lose their inhibitor and then immediately follow up with a baron attempt (often a successful one too). The team that just took an inhibitor may be too weak after taking that objective or think that they have an advantage and ignore vision of the objective. They are too busy backing and clearing the waves that have probably shoved. \n\nIn general, by the 30 minute mark a good rule of thumb is that if the jungler is dead or on the bottom half of the map, the baron can probably be done pretty safely by the opposite team if the tier 1 towers are all gone.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2016-06-26T16:23:04.985+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If theres no lane pushing or if my team doesnt have enough damage, sure, ill respond as a top laner.
