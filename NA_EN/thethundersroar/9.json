Farming like crazy, playing super-aggressive, snowballing your lane, and getting ahead is literally the only way you can consistently climb.\n\nPlaying 'smart' alone has a very little effect on your Elo increase. By this I mean:\n\n* Staying out of range from Blitzcrank late game.\n* Not getting hit by the other team's AoE engage.\n* Being grouped when you need to be.\n* Not getting caught.\n* Leaving caught teammates for dead.\n* Disengaging from bad fights.\n* Staying positive.\n\nThings I listed above are the some of the visible differences between a Plat and a Bronze, yet a Plat who exhibits the above but doesn't snowball out of control often will climb very, very slowly, if at all. And it's a pretty big problem when smarter players are stuck with the players who feed, throw, get caught, and flame half the time, but can snowball out of control the other half of the time.\n\n**The traits you need to exhibit to stay at a higher Elo don't allow you to climb out of lower Elo.**\n\n**You have to win the game by force.**\n\nWhether that means being farmed and putting out DPS, or stunning a whole team in a fight, or stomping your lane and being both tanky and bursty, or split pushing hard, or so on.\n\n------\n\nLast season I climbed into Gold with Volibear. Super aggressive early and engage fights late quickly brought me up a whole 11 divisions to Gold 4. But when I'm not playing Volibear, I feel pretty powerless, because even half-decent play means nothing when you can't forcefully win the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2016-03-02T21:01:55.032+0000","up_votes":95,"down_votes":1,"body":"OP is right. You win in low elo by stomping your lane, snowballing out of control, and beating the enemy team with your massive stats stick.  Slow, safe, objective oriented play does not work in that elo because your team will never have the coordination and knowledge required to pull off a strategy like that.

A lot of low elos are already focused on stomping the opposing team as it is, and clearly it isn't working out.\n\nPeople are only focusing on their team to support their arguments ignoring the fact the opposing team isn't going to be 5 smurfs, so they'll be just as bad.

I've yet to understand the mentality of the player who dies, tps to lane and dies again. then runs down the lane and dies a 3rd time and then blames that a jng hasnt helped even though i warded river w/ 2 wards for them and asked them to play safer and not push so much. once a lane is down 3 kills its hard to gank for them because the other teams laner is 2 levels ahead and a whole item ahead at least.  i meet alot of ppl who are pretty darn good at their position, but have 20 more losses than wins because so many people just dont understand how to play the game other than try and kill as much as they can. there really should be more training to go through before ranking. too many just have no clue as to what a win condition is or what a counter is to a lane opponent. they just pick garen or annie or ashe and stay in lane for 20m wondering why they have 10 deaths already. 1 person cant ward the whole map and they definitely cant make decisions for people who scream \"dont tell me what to do noob\"... /end rant","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nyhver","date":"2016-03-02T20:58:38.363+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"At which point it becomes a grind imo, which ranked for the most part, barring luck has always been about, but I haven't felt this insignificant and powerless since I first started playing ranked in season 3, was placed in silver and didn't know how to play or influence games.\n\nThe best chance you have is to crush lane and split push while your team defends turrets because they usually aren't the ones that are fed IMO, and even that doesn't always work, I had a game vs. Diana as Zed who must have been lagging really badly or just didn't know how to lane, crushed her in lane, proceeded to split push then my team attacks the enemy team when I'm not there \"Maplh missed his ult again\" Malph was on my team, great.\n\nIf you look through my match history it could be thrown up to luck, but it feels like most of the time it doesn't matter what I do, my team will not team fight properly, so it doesn't matter if I roam to help other lanes and shut down the enemy, it doesn't matter if I lose, go even, win lane or have more lane pressure. It seems like the only realistic thing to do is make oneself as big as possible and split push to draw the enemy team over while giving them nothing and taking towers because most of the time the team can't be relied to team fight, unlike in higher MMRs where they know where they should be and how to team fight, for the most part.\n\nI might be demoted to silver 1 after being placed in gold 4, that 2 division drop is worse than S4 when I was placed into silver and had to grind out platinum again","replies":[]},{"poster":"UrgotToBeKidding","date":"2016-03-02T21:29:55.469+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes.

For example, if you have a Yasuo on your team, you will have to either hope for his snowballing on his own, or babysit him. If neither happens then you lose because he becomes 100% useless. Not all champions require babysitting, which is great because then I can focus on counterjungling or helping bottom lane. \n\nAlso, at low ELO you need to play ~~junglers~~ champions that are simple and direct, or overwhelming - I have a vastly different winrate with Rek'Sai than I do with Nocturne, for example. Rek'Sai requires your team to know how to make use of your kit as much as you do, while Nocturne just kind of does his thing. Low ELO players don't know how to make use of Rek'Sai's kit and Rek'Sai has to have a functioning team to operate. Rek'Sai is good at counterganking, but when your team dies from constantly overextending then there is no way to make use of her global capabilities. Nocturne might snowball backwards, but once he snowballs even a bit he becomes far more dangerous on his own than a champion that requires a good team to work well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BRBGTGBOWFLEX","date":"2016-03-03T07:22:05.982+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think you're really wrong about basically everything.\n\nThe things you are mentioning are not \"smart\" play, they are just sort of the bare minimum things you should expect a player to do.

In general, this is what aoe engage tanks like Zac and Malphite thrive on.  Just waiting for the enemy to do something stupid and group up in the wrong place and swing a team fight at a very important part of the game, sometimes giving up a drag and a couple of towers or baron in the process.\n\nIt's not a plan to win the game outright, but it is at least a method.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulfy","date":"2016-03-03T10:06:37.912+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And that's what the difference between gold and silver is.

What ive seen is that to win, you must play smart and just abuse the mistakes the enemy makes. Typically i duo {{champion:236}} {{champion:201}} with my friend and are quite effective. I would say that yes playing smart is very possible in low elo. After one lane gets beaten by the other and the jungeler can no longer provide support we group mid. From there were do the little dance around and poke until somebody makes a mistake or we see an opportunity for a hard engage. Sometimes the fights are a bit sloppy because i dont know exactly when the {{champion:54}}  will ult or when the {{champion:92}}  will flash in but we just immediately follow up afterwards, and do our best to win the fight. To remind you guys this is with three randoms. To win one must do their best in lane, respond to their team, and when the fight starts to not back down. Even if I or another teammate screws up and im down to 300 health  as {{champion:236}} I don't back down because i can put out a crucial amount of damage that  could change the tide of the fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lolptwo","date":"2016-03-02T23:27:23.118+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk if the boards is somewhere you should be posting this.

It is common knowledge that the ranked system is flawed by its very design. Your tier and your rank are completely based on your Win/Loss percentage. The very system is built on the fact that assuming you are not the problem, you will _eventually _ climb. The number people like to use is 100 games. Personally I think it can be much higher than that depending on where you are thrown in your promos. \n\nWhenever I see someone in bronze posting advise I always tell them a few things. \n\n1. Make sure you are not the problem - I mean don't be the flamer, don't be the toxic person. Don't be the idiot who does not recall back to help hold off the enemy team who are taking your towers, or the player split pushing without vision while their team is grouping for a fight. It won't end well. \n\n2. Do not tell other people what to do and be polite - This one is expanding on point 1 a little. If someone gets gripped by a blitz hook do not say \"watch out for the hooks\" or \"come on man wtf?!\". Point one is stating the obvious. They clearly are not trying to get hooked and your comments only make things worse. They are not necessary. Don't state the freaking obvious and create some illusion that you are \"superior to them\". Despite what you believe, you are not. Get that part through your head. Everyone has bad games. You are in the same tier as them for a reason. If your top laner is getting destroyed in lane, suggest that they clear the jungle while they wait for the minion wave to push back to their turret. \n\n3. Play a champion who can highly influence the outcome of games. I used to play a lot of ADC solo Q and what I found was today the ADC alone can not carry games. The ADC is not the one making the plays. _The support and jungler make the ADC. _ anyone who thinks otherwise is an idiot. The ADC is not 2v1 ing in lane. The support and ADC make the plays and the ADC benefits. Most supports are terrible in Bronze and there are far too many group queues with duos bot. Riot tries to hide this, but they are terrible at it. \n\nTop -  trynd, Nasus, Olaf? (6.4 maybe?) Jax, and possibly Yi top. All these champions have a really high influence on games if your team does not get destroyed late game. Eventually you will \"come online\". \n\nJungle - Udyr, Xin, Shyvanna, Yi - All high influence champs\n\nMarksman - I really do suggest avoiding ADC if you want to carry games. You are not capable of getting ahead on your own. You 100% rely on your support and the jungler. Your destiny is not in your own hands if you will. \n\nSupport - Blitz, Janna, and Soraka. (Soraka is about to be nerfed to oblivion if the current PTE changes make it to live, but today she is amazing in bronze. You have the heals to help carry your ADC through the lane phase. Chances are they are terrible and will take tons of poke or decide that they need to trade in lane as an Ezreal with tear vs. Lucien with BF sword and thus get shit on. Heals cover that. After lane phase your heals are amazing to carry team fights. Tons of players dont realize they need to focus the Soraka instead of the person attacking them. So you throw out heals and silences to your hearts content. ) \n\nAnyway this is my advice. Currently the best thing you can do is find other people at your same tier to play with who are not terrible. They don't have to be good, just not terrible and you will win more than you lose by reducing the likelihood of an AFK, troll, or flamer on your own team.","replies":[]}]}
