Supports doing get the \"glorious\" number of kills that other lanes get, but if they do poorly in my lane, it impacts the entire lane so much.

Other lanes are solo (and still yell at the jungler XD). But there are two people in bot lane, and one of them is expected to be fed all the CS and kills if it's feasible. In late game teamfights, the rest of the team is peeling so all that damage you built in the laning phase can do its work. It's not that ADC's are toxic and selfish, or become that way. It's that the role tends to ATTRACT people who already are, because other players serve/wait on/sacrifice for the ADC, and that appeals to selfish people.\n\nThis of course does NOT mean that anyone who plays ADC is automatically selfish. In fact, it's pretty difficult to be any good at the role if you are. Because it involves so much support and teamplay, it pays to be a team player.
