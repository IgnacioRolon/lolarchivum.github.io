And because she is a DPS mage she needs to stick to you for a longer duration unlike burst mages, that's why Rylais is successful on her.\n\nHowever since you will always have gold enough to buy at least some items I am not sure if his statement that Cassio is so item depend is actually accurate, since she can do well with just a RoA for example.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2016-03-26T20:31:51.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She already could hit well over 1000 AP on live with her terrible passive on live.
