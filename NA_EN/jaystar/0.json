I just finished a marathon of games where I managed to climb into my series. Since I recently dropped from gold 4 to gold 5, I automatically had 1 win in my series. I unfortunately lost my first game of the series and expected to see the series at 1-1 but instead got a notification saying I was unsuccessful in completing my series. Is there any way someone can look into this. I was put back into gold 5 with 79 lp. This has never happened before in my 3 years of playing league.\r\n\r\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-25T17:53:10.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I looked into this for you and found a [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging).  :(  Queue dodging will result in a loss, followed by a match loss which ended the series.  You're still pretty high in LP, so you can still make it back into your series quickly hopefully.  Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"JayStar","date":"2017-07-25T19:24:10.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh, thank you so much. That makes so much more sense. Thanks again I appreciate the clarification.","replies":[]}]}]}
