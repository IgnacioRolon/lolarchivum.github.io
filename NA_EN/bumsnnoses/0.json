I've repaired, no dice, I've even uninstalled and re-installed, at one point I re-installed windows (for separate reasons) and decided to install it all from a blank slate, still having the same problem, it takes 1-2 tries sometimes, then other times like last night it takes 20-30 or more before the login screen pops up. It's getting to be a real bother, there's some times where i just give up trying to play because it's so annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"BlazinHot6","date":"2015-01-26T18:29:50.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive been having the same problem for a few weeks now.  Its even more annoying cuz on the second time you either have to close LoLclient from Task Manager or you have to wait for the launcher to ask to terminate the already running client.  I did check my adobe versions which are current too.  Im pretty sure the client is still running on AdobeAir.  I would love to know a fix or find that Riot has fixed it in a patch.","replies":[{"poster":"bumsnnoses","date":"2015-01-26T20:13:40.922+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"or at least acknowledge it's a legitimate bug and not our problem.","replies":[{"poster":"TheGrayBuffoon","date":"2015-01-27T02:15:27.524+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=bumsnnoses,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=y9N30O0G,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-01-26T20:13:40.922+0000)\n>\n> or at least acknowledge it's a legitimate bug and not our problem.\n\nThat's just it: It is not you or any other player.

If I launch the client from the patcher and the client doesn't show up I can open my task manager, find LolClient.exe in the process list, right-click that and select \"Go to process\". I can launch the file it points to manually and the client appears and works correctly.
