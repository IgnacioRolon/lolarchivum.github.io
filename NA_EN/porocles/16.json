If this update was useful, please comment down below to let us know!\n\n\n> **Update: 5/30/2017 @ 9:20am Pacific**\n> \n> As we continue to investigate, we've found that [turning on AMD GPU Scaling](http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/UnableToSetGPUScaling.aspx) can act as a workaround for some players in the meantime.  \n\n\n----\n\nWe've received quite a few reports of DirectX errors from players post champion select.  It looks like there might be an issue with AMD's most recent graphics driver causing this error.  While we investigate further, we've found that rolling back to a [Previous AMD Display Driver ](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop/previous?os=Windows%2010%20-%2064)can serve as a workaround in the meantime.\n\nI'll post updates or anymore info as they come.

Then I turned it on for my 2nd Screen (Big Samsung TV HDMI) and wonder, it fixed. Seriously before that fix I tested literally everything, installing older video card driver wasn't working for more than a few days too.\nAfter testing a few other games and having some strange errors too that were always \"display resolution related\" I just thought it might be Windows 10 related.
