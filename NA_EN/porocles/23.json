Go in-game while on borderless---> switch to fullscreen.\nStep 2. Fan will start--->switch to borderless fan slows and stops within 10 seconds.\n\nVersion 2:\nStep 1. Go in-game while on borderless---> switch to fullscreen.\nStep 2. Fan will start--->alt+tab to client and back again--> fan slows and stops within 3 seconds.\n\nThese are consistently reproducable on my end.\n\nI am running the game on native resolution (1600x900) on fullscreen but usually run on borderless 1280x720.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-10T22:26:45.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey LostFr0st!

Up until level 45 I haven't had problems with the capsules you earned from leveling up, but upon reaching level 45 it appears I have been not rewarded any capsules. I have done research on this and seen other people have had these issues; especially on levels that are intervals of 5. They had it resolved by someone checking their account as seeing they didn't get a capsule and gave them one.
