Check out the steps below if you run into any hot issues along the way!\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/retiringair_alt_1080.jpg\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n#***Updated Client (Beta Client)***\n\n>#***Important notice regarding Rune Pages***\n\nWe're investigating an issue with rune pages not saving correctly when re-arranged or have special characters in its name.  While we work on a more permanent resolution, our tech team can help with a fix.  Reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you're impacted.  \n\n\n>#***Why does the End of Game Stats screen take FOREVER to freakin' load?!***\n\nThis might be due to the \"Close Client During Game\" option in the client.  This option makes the client close out when you enter a game, which means after the game it has to completely reboot to start.  Low Spec Mode should be enough to keep things running smoothly, so disable this option by entering the client, clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner, [and unchecking the box.](http://i.imgur.com/smwR8be.png)\n\n>#***&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried the Updated Client before, and it was sooooo laggy&rdquo;***\n\n We&#039;ve made some massive changes to the Updated Client make it run as smoothly as possible, even on the proudest of potatoes.  Enable Low Spec Mode if it isn&rsquo;t on already.  You can find out by clicking the gear in the upper right hand corner of the Updated Client and then [click &quot;Enable Low Spec Mode&quot;](http://i.imgur.com/rPGRnYW.png)\n\n>#***&quot;Patching Failed and we&#039;re not sure why Error: 004&quot;***\n\nThis error usually occurs when Operating System Permissions isn&#039;t set properly.  Essentially, the patcher is trying to access files found on your hard drive, but it is being denied from doing so.  [Follow the steps in this guide to get this resolved!](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)\n\n>#***&quot;Something&#039;s up with our servers and it&#039;s preventing you from patching&quot; Error: 003***\n\nOccurs when the patcher isn&#039;t able to maintain a stable connection with our Patcher Servers.  If the patcher loses connection to the server to get the necessary files, it will simply stop working.  To get this resolved, [make sure to complete all of the solutions in this guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n#***Legacy Client***\n\n>***Files Scanned reaches over 9000!!!!! Or, 15k, 20k, etc***\n\nThe patcher needs to scan already installed files to make sure that none of the files are corrupt.  If it finds one, it replaces it and rescans the files.  This is why it can sometimes get as high as 20k, even though there aren&#039;t 20k files in the installation.  \n\n**The best thing to do is let it scan files!**  If you restart the client, it may cause it to scan even more files.   The patcher will eventually stop scanning files, and it will patch normally afterward.\n\n>***Patcher stops/errors out at 33%, Patcher fails at 99%, or a general &quot;Unspecified Error has occurred&quot; message***\n\nThese are usually connection related errors. Either your computer is unable to maintain a stable connection, or a 3rd party security program is blocking League of Legends from properly patching. To get these issues resolved ASAP, make sure to go through our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you&#039;re having other issues while prepping for the updated client or something else entirely, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
