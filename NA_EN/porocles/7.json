We're tracking the issue now and believe that it might be the result of using a custom resolution, 4K screen, or resolution exceeding 1080p.\n\n---\n> **For Mac players**:  [Example screenshot here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/302242899322601473/309346698331947018/Screen_Shot_2017-05-03_at_11.12.37_PM.png)\n> \n> Tapping Alt+Enter in-game can serve as a work around.   This will toggle you out of fullscreen and into windowed mode to restore your game screen.\n\n-----\n> **For PC players**:  This may come up as a DirectX error\n> \n> Delete your **Config folder**.  This  is typically found at C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n> \n>As a heads up this will reset your resolution, settings, and keybindings to default.\n> \n\n----\n\nThis thread is locked for commenting.
