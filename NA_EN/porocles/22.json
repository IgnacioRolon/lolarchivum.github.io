You may experience brief disruptions while in-game or on the client.  I don&#039;t have an ETA for the duration of the maintenance, but updates will be posted on the [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page.","replies":[{"poster":"Tiralius","date":"2017-10-04T17:13:25.398+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dc/d from game on At&t in Cali","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-04T17:42:45.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, are you able to get in now?","replies":[{"poster":"Tiralius","date":"2017-10-04T17:55:54.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am now able to get into a game as far as custom goes not sure if that helps don't want to start an actual game.

Watching other streams of NA players and they aren't having problems, Twitch chat isn't exploding about NA being down or anything, and my own team wasn't having issues (was able to reconnect one time for about 3 minutes before DC'ing again and not getting back in ever since.)\n\nFeelsBadMan, I'm gonna lose LP and get leaver busted for this crap.","replies":[{"poster":"Omar Ali","date":"2017-10-04T17:11:02.342+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I DC'd out of my ranked game and can't reconnect.
