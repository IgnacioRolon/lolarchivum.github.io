Restart your client and try again to redeem your goodies!\n\nThanks for the reports regarding the hextech crafting issues this morning!  It looks like some players are receiving a** Redemption Failed** error when trying to fuse or unlock content.  The issue has been fielded to the proper team to investigate and resolve as soon as they can!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/QuVJwvU.png\n\n**Update @ 9:50am Pacific**:  I've also seen reports of players who received a notification that hextech content was unlocked into their inventory, though redemption still fails.  We're looking into these as well!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YAoLwJt.png\n\nIn the meantime, you might be able to spam redemption to get the error to budge through.  Otherwise, hang tight!  \n\nWe'll post updates as they come!  Our [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) has also been updated with current news.\n","replies":[{"poster":"ZER0 2","date":"2017-08-04T16:51:12.119+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep!
