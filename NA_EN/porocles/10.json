Well we&#039;d certainly like to play a round with you guys, and we&#039;re lookin&#039; for a couple of upstanding Summoners who&#039;d 5v5 us on the Howling Abyss! :J\n\nStarting now, we&#039;ll be opening up a Custom ARAM game where you can play against the Boards and Twitter Support team.  We aim to start the match around 3pm pacific.  We&#039;re testing the waters and interest you guys have with this.  If we get a lot of positive feedback, it might be a continuing thing too! \n\nWe won&#039;t be answering any big questions, we&#039;re here to just have a chill and positive game with you guys. If that sounds like your type of jam, look for the game &#039;Hungry Hungry Poros&#039; and join up with the password &#039;porosnax&#039;!\n\nHope to see ya soon!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-28T22:40:02.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've had our first community game and it went off without a hitch!
