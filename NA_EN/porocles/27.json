The issue has been reported to interested teams.  **This should now be resolved!**\n\n- Mac players using an older version of their OS cannot patch.  Updating to the most recent version should resolve this:\n\n> Software Update steps:\n> - Click the Apple icon on the top left of the screen, click on \"About This Mac\", and choose \"Software Update...\"\n> - The App store will open and display any software updates available for OS X and the App Store. OS X updates will be at the top of the list.\n> - Click \"Update All\" to install all available software updates. If prompted, enter an admin name and password, then your Apple ID and password\n> If required, restart your system.\n\nWe'd also like to investigate the issue further as a whole.

Since this patch (7.24), I have had major FPS issues. I run League with no other applications running. I've checked countless times to make sure no other application is taking up any of my PC to an extent that it would effect gameplay. I've run CCleaner countless times, checked pretty much everything I could that would effect gameplay and PC issues, and have found nothing. My laptop's specs are Intel(R) Core i5-4200H CPU @ 2.80GHz. My GPU is INTEL HD Graphics 4600 and my GPU 1 is NVIDIA GeForce 840M. \nI normally get around 140-160 FPS unless I'm running multiple data-hog apps (like Chrome windows) and in that case, I generally get around 80. Now I'm getting around 70 normally and dropping to as low as 17 during fights with no other apps open and all apps in Task Manager that I don't need disabled. \nI've also been having issues where I will be normal ping (for me, around 49ms) and will just disconnect at random. I know this is mainly on my end - Spectrum being the culprit - but I have been losing games because this has been happening since the new patch. \nThe reason I mention that, though, is because there are many times where my internet isn't down, yet I am disconnected from League. I've done everything I can on my end. In regards to the FPS issue, I've also lowered my in-game settings to medium-low. I've tried capping my frame rate but it hasn't done anything. \nI pretty much exclusively play ranked, so this is an issue for me. I'm in Platinum but I'll randomly lose games because either my FPS drops out of nowhere or I just disconnect at crucial points in the game.\nI've also run a system repair but no corruption has shown up.","replies":[{"poster":"Blânk","date":"2017-12-20T20:29:50.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had the same problem this patch, makes the game unbearable to play.
