Guys, we're freaking excited about the rune changes but we know some of you are a bit anxious with the time and currency spent towards unlocking them.  \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/l303jDd.png\n\nAs New001 mentioned in the video:\n\n>***\"When we transition over to the new system, we'll have a plan in place to take care of players who've invested in runes and rune pages over the years.  More on the transition and improving rewards as we get closer to pre-season\"***\n\nSo it's totally okay to continue unlocking them in the meantime! A Rioter also made a comment reply about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6e90bf/runes_reforged_and_honor_update_riot_pls_league/di8i4e1/).  \n\nSpecific details on reimbursement aren't finalized yet but will be announced later, so we will not be offering individual refunds for runes beyond [refund guidelines ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864)through player support-- for now.  \n\nYou can find more information on the upcoming rune changes, as well as a little preview of what's to come, over here on our [**Preseason: Runes Reforged**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/coming-preseason-runes-reforged) article.\n\nHang tight as we get more information and draw closer to these changes.  Make sure to equip those runes, especially if you're jungling out there!","replies":[{"poster":"escRL Teemo","date":"2017-06-01T17:17:35.570+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hello,\n\nHere is the view of an \"old\" player.\n\nI don´t like the idea of an IP reward because there is nothing i could spend it on.\n\nLet me show some math.\n\n20 Runepages 6300 IP = 126k\n51 Quints 1000 IP (average) = 51k\n99 Glyps 400 IP = 39.6k\n81 Seals 400 IP = 32.4k\n72 Marks * 400 IP = 28.8k\n\nThis makes a total of 277.8 k Influence Points\n\nSince normal playing is absolutely enough to buy every new champion, I won´t be able to use an IP reward.\n\nComing to the next point, a skin Reward:\n\nGetting 277.8k IP needs if you get an average of 100 IP per Game (Bonus of the Day) 2778 Games.\n\nWIth an average of 25 mins each, resulting in a total of 1157 h playing (48 Days).\n\nEven with just 1€/h refund it would mean (1157 / 50) * 8250 RP = 190k RP.\n\nSo even if you get like 10 Skins each Skin it would be worth 19k Riot Points or 115€.\n\nIn the case of a RP reward.\n\nA champ wich costs 6.3k IP or 975 RP, means 154RP equals 1k IP.\n154RP*277.8k IP = 43k RP\n\nWill Riot give those \"old\" players who have tons of runes such an amount of RP, sadly I don´t think so.\n\nGreets","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-01T21:16:33.912+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://media.giphy.com/media/9lMoyThpKynde/giphy.gif\n\nI can tell this changes really means a lot to you, and it should!

( or rather the amount spent if that's what it'll be?)\n\nI mean I already totaled up the _current normal cost_ of all my runes and rune pages and came to a little over 240k. That is about the current, non-sale total value of my collection and definitely not the amount I spent on it. (I picked up a lot during sales.) Amount spent might be the metric you guys go by but it'd definitely be hard for me to figure that out after all my account is many years old. And there is the chance I made a miscalculation, how can I be sure what \"tier of rewards\" I might fall in without some kind of approved of calculator as that big patch eventually rolls by? Could be the difference of having to put down another 500 ip on runes to get another loot box possibly if that is the case for example.\n\nAlso might be useful to know but on my own I figure 220k to 240k ip is around the maximum of \"sane and has been viable\" total of runes to collect since even season 1. Including the full additional 18 rune pages. Going beyond that a person spending 250k or more is collecting % hp runes that never really been mainstream or spellvamp quints. Beyond that a person is probably collecting scaling AD runes and then eventually very much less viable ones.\n\nIn my opinion rewards for runes shouldn't stop at any value. 100k. 200k. 300k. As you go up there's gonna be much and much much fewer people at those levels to create that sort of opportunity cost for you guys from extra loot boxes if that's the thing!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-06-05T16:12:46.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> Even with just 1€/h refund\n\nLolwut? You don't get paid 1 €/hour to play a game, where did you get that number from? That's ridiculously high...\n\nThe next paragraph with your 43K RP estimation is more realistic. Except you shouldn't get a full refund for the Runes you bought, since you actually got to use them for a while. When you sell back something you used, you don't sell it to the original price.\n\nSo OK, let's say all the IP you spent is \"equivalent\" to 43K RP. If Riot was to give you back 8K RP ~ 50 €, that would already be quite fair from them...\n\nI don't think the \"refund\" process will involve RP at all, and that it will be something different, but IF they did, 50 € worth of RP is already quite generous.\n\n(Also, that's negligible, but you should count 18 Rune Pages, not 20.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"edwsfhgj","date":"2017-06-01T17:05:20.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=To8OjvVY,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-06-01T15:53:19.030+0000)\n>\n> Hey guys,\n\n@Porocles, will the 90 days limit on refund affect rune pages bought with RP?\nI'm asking because I happen to have bought the 7 page bundle not even a week ago and I'm afraid I won't get the 20$ back.\nAnything you can share with the boards on that regard?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-01T21:12:28.813+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries on that front!

I haven't had any complaints about the mastery systems (I think that it could have stayed the same) but dealing with runes was TORMENT. I don't play to win, I play to have fun, and the rune system was anything but fun. After awhile, I just quit dealing with runes at all. I just chose a set of runes and used them on all champions I played as, without ever purchasing new runes ever (even after I started to get empty rune slots.) Not tactically wise, but it was worth it because I actually got to focus on the game itself and getting new champions instead of worrying about IP expensive runes that were a hassle to deal with. \n    THANK YOU RIOT!\n    Also, although I was happy with the old mastery system, I can see the benefits of changing to the new system. This will allow greater opportunity and fun for everyone, plus it makes the game easier to balance.\n    I greatly appreciate Riot games for their lack of complacency and driven ambition in making a game that isn't just fun to play, but designed to balance customer demands and the need to earn a profit. Many companies hate their fans and/or just want to suck them dry of their money. I think that Riot has actively pursued the goal of making everyone happy and ACTUALLY SUCCEEDED, which is both admirable and noteworthy.\n    Ultimately, I have a sense of uneasiness as we move forward with new changes like this, but I will gladly move ahead with Riot games and their fans as the game is REFORGED into something better than the old. Always there will be difficulty, but there is nothing that cannot be overcome as long as we all do our part. \n   Also, a humble request, PLEASE COMMEMORATE THE RELEASE OF RUNES REFORGED WITH A NEW RYZE SKIN: RYZE, THE REFORGED RUNE MAGE !!!! (or something like that, it would be so APPROPRIATE for Ryze to get a new skin at the release of Runes Reforged because  Ryze is a \"rune mage.\")\n    Happy days to you all!","replies":[{"poster":"Rryzen","date":"2017-06-23T19:21:42.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh that would be way better than getting ip or rp back for runes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FollowMySteps123","date":"2017-09-27T19:18:52.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am really excited for the new runes!
