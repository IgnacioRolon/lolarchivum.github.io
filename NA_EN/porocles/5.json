If you happen to still run into this, be sure to submit your client logs in a support ticket, as mentioned in the original post below so we can help you out further.\n\n>Thanks!\n\n_____\n\nHey guys,\n\nWe've received reports that some players are seeing a black screen in champion select since patch 7.4.  Normally, black screens tend to be connection related but this specific circumstance is a bug.\n\nWe're currently requesting logs to further investigate and pump out a fix faster!  If you've installed League in the default directory, you can find the log files by following this path:  \n\n**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\LeagueClient Logs\\**\n\nIn that folder, you'll want to provide the following log file types:\n>* LeagueClient.log\n* LeagueClientUx.log\n\nAttach them to a [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and send it our way!  \n\nIn the meantime, collapsing your friends list groups before queuing for a match, may serve as a temporary workaround. Here's a screenshot showing what that looks like:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/wMLOFya.png\n_____\nWe'll post here with any further info and updates, as they become available. Thank you for your patience while we look into this issue further.","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2017-02-27T06:19:42.655+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Please, don't presume everyone got their games installed on C:\\\n\nLike any proper PC user, I don't install games on the C:\\ -drive.
