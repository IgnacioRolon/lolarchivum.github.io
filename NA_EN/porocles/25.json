Not all games work the same and some times the overlay is ugly and gets in the way, they flash and distract when someone talks.  When i notice any program has an overlay enabled by DEFAULT I get annoyed and then have to figure out before the game starts how to disable it and some programs have very badly made ways to find the settings for it.  I just recently installed Twitch chat, which used to be curse voice and the settings are under FILE which is a terrible place for that.  I had to put up with that crap for an entire match, hate overlays i wish people would not make them DEFAULT ENABLED.  If people want an overlay they will enable the overlay and once the people who make voice chat programs understand that we will all be a little happier.

Good try though Riot.  -___________-\n\nIt might be happening with other overlays as well from our experience troubleshooting with players--although more infrequently (or maybe they're not as commonly used as Discord). If you're using Overwolf, GeForce Experience, the Xbox app (via Windows 8 and higher), or another app with an in-game overlay, try turning their respective overlay off. \n\nWe have been working with Discord since the frequency has ticked up a bit again; note that it was fixed temporarily with a [patch they pushed out back on February 15](https://blog.discordapp.com/its-thyme-four-updates-f66dbf1266e6) But the bug re-emerged around February 27.\n\n> **Overlay should no longer cause lockups **or issues on League of Legends or Overwatch.\n\nWe got word from the Discord team that they pushed out a potential fix early this morning, but it won't auto-update. So players affected by this will need to shut down Discord--not just minimize it onto the system tray--and then restart Discord. Try a few Custom Games to see if you're still experiencing issues, but be ready to disable overlays again if it causes issues with a matchmade game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aerothal","date":"2018-03-02T02:25:07.415+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"seems to be a new issue.
