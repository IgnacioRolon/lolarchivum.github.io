Error messages might include unspecified errors or an error patching.  I've forwarded the details to interested parties, and our technicians are investigating the problem. \n\n\n> **UPDATE @ 1:00pm PT** This issue should now be resolved!  If you still have any issues with this, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so our tech team can help you directly!\n\n---\n\n> **UPDATE @ 10:53am PT** In some cases, [reconfiguring your DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5) may resolve the issue for some players.  \n\n---\n\n> **UPDATE @ 10:40am PT**: I've seen a few players suggest a workaround by setting their OS clock back 24 hours.  **Do this at your own risk, and do not play ranked.  Loss prevention is not active, and you can still receive Leaverbuster penalties.  **Your Windows clock is crucial to a lot of features to both your OS and as well as League, and changing that can cause other unforseen problems.\n\nWe've also updated our [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page, and a fix is being worked on!
