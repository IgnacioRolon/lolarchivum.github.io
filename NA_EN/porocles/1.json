It would be unfair to miss out an awesome deal, so we are honoring content from your first set.  \n\nUp to this point we&#039;ve been asking you to submit a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), which is solid and our team is working to get those to you.  We also want to open up the boards as another venue to help out.  Just **make sure you have enough RP on your account** so we can unlock them for you!\n\nWe are able to review your first set at their discount, so reply to this post with the following:\n\n* Items in the first set that you like to unlock\n* Confirm that you&#039;re okay with us removing the RP from you account.\n\nSome players did not receive a first set of personalized items.  It&#039;s likely that the account wasn&#039;t logged in at the time, so no items were loaded for it. We&#039;re unable to recreate a set, but everyone should have access to the personalized shop now.  \n\nIf you&#039;ve already put in a ticket, please hang tight for a response!  We&#039;ll reply back as soon as we can!\n\n{{sticker:sg-kiko}} \n\n_Note: Broporo and I currently have access to assist with NA and OCE currently.  If you're on EU, your best bet is to submit a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for now!_","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-09-21T15:45:38.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Porobros,\n\nMay I get a full list of my previous offers as well?\nI only remember that Rocket Girl Trist was there again and I _think_ Rakan's skin and a Sivir or Galio skin were on the far right?\nSorry I'm forgetful but thank you for assisting people on here =)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-21T15:48:25.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure thing LostFr0st,\n\n• Galactic Nasus - 50% - Discount Price: 260 RP\t\t\t\t\n• Hextech Galio - 50% - Discount Price: 260 RP\t\t\t\t\n• Rocket Girl Tristana - 20% - Discount Price: 780 RP\t\t\t\t\n• Bad Santa Veigar - 40% - Discount Price: 585 RP\t\t\t\t\n• Ghost Bride Morgana - 40% - Discount Price: 585 RP\t\t\t\t\n• Snowstorm Sivir - 50% - Discount Price: 487 RP","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-09-21T15:54:46.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aha, knew she was there too <3\n\nMay I have Snowstorm Sivir added to my account please.\nI am ok with you removing the 487 RP.\n\nThanks a bunch Porocles^^","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-21T16:06:56.862+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got it, bud!
