Our tech team will continue working with you!\n> \n\n---- \nI first want to say sorry for taking a bit to get this post up, and appreciate the troubleshooting steps you've all taken to help.

Also while speaking with someone from Support, a few of the files they asked me to find within the app contents aren't there, leading me to assume that when they do fix this issue, they'll probably make some changes to the overall client itself (for MAC) and have us redownload it off the main page.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gnome In Space","date":"2017-05-24T08:55:45.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im on a macbook pro 2007 with el capitan i try to get a support ticket but it says i need to login as i was already logged in  so now im writing it here.\ni got the same prolem as most mac users all well untill i hit the launch than it dissepears  i did litteraly everything i could believe me i've been on it for days already. to where i can send my logs so riot can check wheres the problem. its like in the patch there is a corupted file and dos not extract propperly what makes the client not open.. please help me i want to send all logs if that would help to find the issue.. \nI just want to play the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-24T15:13:11.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ticket center is independent of the boards, so you'll have to login seperately there.

When we download it off the main page or force a patch, it won't go through. I'm assuming that when a fix goes out, it's going to be modifications to the MAC client files and we will probably need to redownload it again. Just a thought though haha.\n\nI actually just tried opening LoL again just now to see if it would somehow randomly work and it seemed like it was trying to upgrade the client but went back to showing \"Launch\" after 5 seconds (and then repeat the issue we're all having).
