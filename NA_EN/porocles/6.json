First, you're only giving back BE for tier 3 runes, what about those old player who brought Tier 1 runes (that don't exist anymore) or tier 2 pre-1IP Price? They don't get anything back even when we spent a considerable ammount of IP as well?\n\n2. I brought Rune pages once, a 2x1 deal I think, I can't remember if with IP or RP, however if I brought them with IP will I get he 1500BE twice? and if I brought them with RP will I not get anything aside from keeping them?\n\n3. The tier 3 convertion is ridiculously low, maybe you can check a bit of adjustement depending on the original rune price.\n\n4. Reading about this and about the level/chest thing I must say, you haven't tackled two of the problems I see with it.\n\n4.1 The BE gain. Early levels chest are more prompt to give champion shard, I understand that, but what about older player that still don't have all champions? (League has a lot of champions), will their chances of getting BE be all about RNG? if so will be harder for them buy the new champions. I suggest if this haven't been tackled yet, that each chest gives a bit of BE guaranteed (not a lot, but guaranteed to people know how much they must level to get it surely (and if they are lucky will get shards to powder first))\n\n4.2 IP Sink. One we get all champions (again) there is nothing to spend BE on (masteries don't count since some of us can't get an S to save our lives). I suggest a convertion system to burn BE, there is two things I can think of. 1 could be a convertion from BE to Orange Essence to a ratio of 1000BE for 1 OE (an example) This would reward those who stack a lot of BE (and would work like runes did, you can spend a lot of BE to activate a shard skin and don't have enough to buy the new champion, so RP). or 2, pay discount, You can pay 6300 BE to get a 20% discount In a skin RP price, (people already ask riot for those little RP amount, why don't let them get it by playing the game?)\n\nThose are my opinions, at least the ones I get for only watching the video and reading the page. I hope one of you can read this and tell me if Riot has talked about these point in this.","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2017-09-02T01:21:01.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some people are never happy.
