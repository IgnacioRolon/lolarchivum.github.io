With start at level 2.0 the player is only on level 4 and don't get the level 5 reward.\n\n- with 400 games played:\nBoth players get the same amount of rewards and are on level 5. But the player which starts at level 2.3 gets the better rewards (3 additional rewards on level 5  -> the other player gets 3 rewards at level 2 only instead)\n\nSo with the same effort the player gets always the better rewards if he starts on a higer level.\n\n> **Also it doesn&#x27;t guarantee that the pip bumped player will get to those _better _ rewards quicker** as it&#x27;s all based on people honoring you so the player who didn&#x27;t get to honor 5 last season could still get there quicker. Meaning the people who skipped those 3 pips missed out on the 6 frags.\n\nBut the chance to get the level 5 reward earlier is higher if you start at a higher level.\nAnd after several hundert games it's not really material which mates a player has ingame. After a lot of games it's more important how to act with the mates than what mates a player has.","replies":[{"poster":"mattymaats","date":"2018-01-17T00:23:50.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're example goes on the idea that it takes X games to get to level 5 when it could take Player B 500 games but player A 900 games because they get less commends not because they are a bad player or toxic at all but because they are put in games with people who hardly honor, they could not be very vocal or a MLG player. \n\nEven if the boost is there it's not a reward it's just skipping reward tiers which I don't see how that's a bonus in a pretty much RNG on top of  a RNG system.

The other thing as well is that we cannot see how far it is between reward levels so it can be nerfed without the playerbase even knowing.\n\nAfter so much games it isn't RNG to get level 5. It's the result of a kindly player behaviour.\nAnd Riot wrote that on level 5 you need the same effort (amount of honors) to get a reward than in level 2. But the level 5 rewards are better. So there is no \"skipping\". You get the same amount of rewards no matter you start. The start level affects only the quality of the rewards (higher start = higher quality of rewards from the beginning).\n\nAnd why you need to know how far you are till the next level reward?\nWhat do you plan? Reach the level 5 reward and then you plan to be toxic because you get one of the rare skins?\n\nYes, perhaps Riot \"nerfed\" the honor system and it will be harder to get level 5 (-> more honors needed to reach level 5).\nBut for players which act alwars kindly that doesn't matter. OK, it will take longer (5 months instead of 3-4 months) but they will get the level 5 reward skin (if they haven't both skins already). And these players won't change they player behaviour after reach level 5 because it's normal for them to act friendly.\n\n> What is wrong with rewarding the previous honor 5 players with the pip rewards they should/would have gotten, really not sure why people are OK with it as if enough people actually voice their complaints it would actually be dealt with.\n\nTo be honest: Riot gives rewards for a behaviour that should be naturally.\nI didn't change my behaviour with this honor system because for me it's normal to be kind in a online game (or in RL).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Altiverse","date":"2018-01-16T23:45:28.920+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You continue to get rewards even after Lv5.\nThat means that player A will have *more* key frags, since at the time that player B gets his rewards from the last checkpoints to level 5, player A gets Level 5 rewards, which are better.","replies":[{"poster":"mattymaats","date":"2018-01-17T00:13:45.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Player A gets to honor 5 quicker, it's not a guarantee that he will it's like placing in F1 as an example, just because the person who starts at the front doesn't mean they're going to win.

So it's important to reach the finish line (in honor system: level 5).\n\nAnd the F1 driver on pole position has a lot of advantages to reach the finish line earlier than the driver on last position:\n\n- he has lead at the start\n- his skill (or car) seems to better than those of the driver on last position\n- it is very difficult for the driver on last position to gain on the deficit\n\n\nAnd in this honor system it is nearly the same:\n\n- the players on \"pole\" (2.3 start) have a lead at start (shorter way to level 5 than on start at 2.0)\n- the players on \"pole\" seems to have the better \"skill\" because there is a reason why they was level 5 in season 7 and not level 2.\n- it is very difficult for player with start at 2.0 to gain on the deficit against 2.3 -> they have to improve they player behaviour to climb quicker\n\nAnd as I wrote: it's not important to reach level 5 as the first in NA/EUW/etc.\nIf a player want the one of the two rare skins, he should act kindly ingame.

The trade off is the guarantee of at least one, which was not present last season. Previously you were not guaranteed to earn either of these skins, but this year you are guaranteed to earn at least one in your level 5 honor capsule. \n\nDoes this rule starts with the 8.1 patch or with honor reset?\n\nI got the Twitch skin last Sunday (I was level 5 and it's in the 8.1 patch but before the honor reset), so I'm not sure if I got allready the honor skin for season 8.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2018-01-16T19:49:27.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"About Grey Warwick/Medieval Twitch, can we choose which skin we'll get?
