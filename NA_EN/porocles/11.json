I will be unable to cast spells or auto attack for 4-10 sec and my character will walk in the last clicked direction , then suddenly everything that was supposed to happen in the last 4-10 sec will happen all at once. it happens 10-15 times in a 20 minute match. Its kind of gamebreaking. \n\nI have tried as follows : \n\nRe-installing League from my HDD to my SDD \nenabling V-sync , disabling character prediction \nran disk clean up \nall my drivers are up to date (gtx 770) \nno other background processes are using up system resources \n\nI don't think I'm alone with this, any one else having this issue? hoping for a hotfix soon, I cant play until then..","replies":[{"poster":"Neeebo","date":"2018-01-01T10:53:32.281+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You aren't alone, I'm also having rubber banding issues and constant stutters like every 10 seconds.

Thank you.\n \nprety much the same but i dont get the message, pc freezes on  loading screen or right after spawn such that the only way out is bruteforcing, when i do that windows starts updating some shit.  i have already disabled anti virus/firewal, even auto windows updates and rerolled some past from early december, ran hextech couple times and even clean uninstalled. now im on a fucking 20 min leaver buster qeue, despite i have been able to return to this last match and we won it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShadowsWrath1","date":"2018-01-06T14:56:44.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if this is the right place to put this, but There has been such a large influx of bots on the player vs AI game mode lately. they are ruining the game experience as a whole especially for beginner players. I was just in a match where it was literally 2 vs 5 because we had 3 bot players on my team. How Ironic that replays are unsupported for the gamemode or I'd be posting the file as proof.

I downloaded it on my MacBook Air, which is running 10.13.1 High Sierra Case Sensitive, and ran the game client. Perfect, no problem. I went into matchmaking, no problem. I went into Champion Select, no problemo.\n\nBut when champion select ended and the actual 'game' was supposed to launch, with the loading screen and champion cards etc., nothing happened. The same thing happens in all gamemodes i've tried, from Draft Pick to Training Mode, and I don't want to try again because I was given Low priority queue for not being in the game I couldn't connect to for some reason (kind of bullsh!t).\n\nIt just said \"game in progress\" for a flitter of a second and then reverted to \"reconnect\". When I click reconnect, it does the same thing, a.k.a. nothing. I did a full integrity check or whatever it's called from the options menu. My firewall is off. I downloaded the Hextech repair tool and THAT was glitched and wouldn't display any text for some reason so I had no idea what to do with that.\n\nI ran League on this computer before but now the actual game itself refuses to launch. Does anyone know how to fix this? Because I'd really like to start playing again. :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trendy2","date":"2018-01-08T18:56:23.495+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"My League of Legends client is lagging real hard... everything is delayed i press profile it will open in like 5s, all is really  slow after match i need wait 20s-40s till i get back to client. i already reinstalled game.
