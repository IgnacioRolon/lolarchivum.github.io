A** [password reset](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751734-Recovering-Your-Password) **should also help resolve this if that does not work.  \r\n\r\nIf above else doesn't work out for you, create a new post here on H&amp;S or submit a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can assist you individually!","replies":[{"poster":"Kythers","date":"2017-10-07T02:14:03.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:63}} SOME SAY RIOT'S SPAGHETTI CODE WILL END IN FIRE {{champion:63}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-07T15:18:25.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:sg-shisa}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Snowyus","date":"2018-03-15T22:05:08.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am getting this error and I have tried everything","replies":[]},{"poster":"Duroku","date":"2017-11-07T23:02:53.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue but I cant even open a support ticket.
