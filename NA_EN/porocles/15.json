We enjoyed the last one  so much, so we’re hoping to nab a match with a few more of you!\r\n\r\nThat said, you guys are really good… Hopefully we can avoid getting pub stomped this time!  {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \r\n\r\nWe’ll be opening up a 5v5 Custom game on the Howling Abyss at 2 PM PST. We’ll name the game ‘Pentakill Poros’ and the password will be ‘headbanging’. Be there, or be square… or round… or triangular. Actually be any shape you want, we just hope you show up!
