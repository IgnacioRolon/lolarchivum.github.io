COOL! Well I like that one face you drew so instead of you getting better let&#039;s just have you try out painting instead; they&#039;re kind of the same thing and still take place on the canvas!&quot;\n\nWhy?! I for real just want to MASTER a champion or two. That takes AGES of games to do. You&#039;ll get an S ranking LONG before you ever master a champion. And once you do, aside from boredom (why master that champion in the first place then?)  WHY would you stop playing them at least &quot;most&quot; of the time?\n\nAnd I mean, feel free to tell me that you&#039;re just incentivising playing more champions and diversifying the champion pool ect. But the END RESULT is that I don&#039;t even want to play League anymore because I don&#039;t feel like I can play a champion for more than 7 - 10 games. The moment I get an S rank I have to set down the champion because otherwise I can&#039;t get free stuff. I, like the rest of the world LIKE FREE STUFF THAT I PLACE VALUE ON. xD Please. Riot. Why? When I first heard about the Hextech Crafting System I thought &quot;Wow, that&#039;s cool. They saw that people like me who need more IP for champions and runes could use more IP. But instead they&#039;re giving us this cool system that does the same thing but in a possibly more fun way.&quot; similar to how you sometimes buff champions by giving them a new mechanic or removing a gate if they&#039;re really weak. \n\nBut now if I want a skin for my main I have to NOT play my main. For real. If I get that skin then what? Cool. I have a skin for a champion that I STILL feel punished for playing by the system that rewards me for playing other champions. This is POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT. And it&#039;s having a NEGATIVE effect on me :l Maybe I&#039;m the minority. Maybe everyone else just loves playing every single champ in the game. But I know my niche. Rito pls. I&#039;m but a mere Explorer type. Let me do my thing.\n\n//Complaint Thread.","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2016-03-26T15:32:08.149+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because it isn't really related to champion mastery.

I could make an argument for the sake of it that because of chances the first one is better because it's guaranteed but realistically.

(You can potentially obtain more free stuff if you play some other champions for 15-20 games each, hell maybe you might like one or two)\n\nBut you are complaining that getting more free stuff is too much work.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \n\nThat aside, riot said themselves that if you want a specific skin then getting it with rp will always be easier.  If you don't want to play more champions then don't.  \n\nPlay what you enjoy  and if you want a skin for your main then buy it and then enjoy using the skin. I only play like 20 or so champs and I only have a rank 5 with like 5 or 6 of them.","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2016-03-26T10:24:28.731+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you are missing part of the point. \n\nIn order to get free stuff you have to give up actually mastering champs, but the mastery system is directly tied to part of the drop system. The other side of the drop system is tired solo to wins. \n\nTherefore in order to get free stuff you have to abandon mastering a small pool of champs or even mastering any of the champs. \n\nThe system is literally giving mixed messages to players. Get better to earn free stuff, you got free stuff (probably not a master of X) go play something else now to earn more.\n\nSure you could twist it about people getting free things, but a greater topic about the phlio and msg of the system can be done.

But the system is poorly designed unless it was purposefully made to give out rewards that no one actually cares about. \"Oh cool, a skin for Fizz. Sure, I'll play Fizz a game.\"\n\nAnd I'm not calling them casuals or anything. But I do know that whenever I want to actually get better at League jumping around between champions (even a small pool of 6) is counter-productive because I only play(ed) League once, sometimes twice a day. So I had a choice to either focus on the game or focus on the champions. I chose to focus on the game. This system exists to send the message that my choice is the wrong one despite it CLEARLY being the proper choice when it comes to getting better at the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EminenceVoid","date":"2016-03-27T06:12:33.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct me if im wrong but here is what i understood so far.\nI have 2 champions, diana = level 5 mastery and akali = no mastery\ntrying to obtain an S on diana is way harder to do than trying to obtain it on akali?\nAm i getting this right?\n\nCan someone put this into simpler terms for me? like make an example.","replies":[{"poster":"DapperinoCappucc","date":"2016-03-31T03:11:40.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having mastery on a champion doesn't make getting an S grade any easier or difficult.\n\nMuch like school, having an A overall doesn't affect your upcoming grade on a project.
