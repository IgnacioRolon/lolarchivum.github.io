Instead of receiving the standard 17-21 LP i only got 9 LP for each game. What is going on?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-28T17:49:34.470+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A couple factors here could cause a lower amount of LP per win.  The first is that matchmaking might feel that you're in a pretty high standing, so it's going to challenge you to prove that you deserve to be there so to speak.  The other is that LP can be impacted by the average rating of each team, so if matchmaking expects you to win then you might earn less LP.  On the other hand, if it expects you to win and you lose then you can lose even more LP.  More info is also available in our [matchmaking guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide), but I hope that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf222207015","date":"2017-10-29T10:47:45.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean expects? if i lose what kind of expectations does the game have then? or what happens when you have a feeder or an afker in your team(which is really common)? what are the game expectations then? This is a very bad excuse we lose at least 17 Lp during loses even if we play 2v5, if  your company wants to continue with this philosophy i think you should do something about losing Lp cause i think you are a bit unfair here.
