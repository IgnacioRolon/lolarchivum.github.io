From my experience i&#039;m currently chat resstricted because i &quot;flamed&quot; a guy who intentionally fed in my game and i &quot;flamed&quot; a guy who was afk ( how can i flame a guy who is afk ? he cant read it  ). I admit I was toxic took my punishment etc altho i think that my behaviour is there because they broke the rules. Everyone of us knows how it feels to loose 40 minutes, LP , and be in a bad mood only because smbd is intentionally feeding i hope Riot can do smth about it.","replies":[{"poster":"elduris","date":"2016-11-02T15:00:43.906+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Internet trolls like this have existed since the beginning of the internet itself. They try to get a rise out of you and get you to react this way so your account will get banned. The best thing to do is not respond to them, mute them, and report them after the game. Flaming them only contributes to a negative experience for all involved, and you can be banned for that.","replies":[{"poster":"TRYTONN","date":"2016-11-02T23:37:30.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"problem is im forced to waste time with them in the game, its mostly a 30/40 minute games because others dont want to surrender , im obliged by summoners code to not afk , and not to flame. my real problem is i report every guy like that after game , and sometimes when smbd pisses me off i send a report to riot support. But Riot pays more attention to keeping a community \" flame free \" so every banter is considered \"negative \" on the other hand i send a ticket to riot support with screenshots with guys score and his build ( 3 moby boots ) also screenshots of him feeding intentionally  guess what he received no punishment instead i got punished because i flamed him. was my behaviour good ? hell no but in this specific case we can say smbd was \"worse \"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jpguy902","date":"2016-11-02T14:31:47.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TRYTONN,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ZvQz2vMw,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-11-02T12:21:55.359+0000)\n>\n> Like i said in the title , reports from games when you have intentionall feeders or afk&amp;#039;s should matter and you shouldnt been banned for those games. \n\nThats not what your title says.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2016-11-02T12:28:17.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you expect will happen when you flame someone, regardless of what they are doing.","replies":[{"poster":"TRYTONN","date":"2016-11-02T12:45:08.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i expect a 0/13 triple moby boots pantheon to be banned , and if my behaviour is bad towards him i should be warned.

There was no point in it, you spent time typing a message that you could have spent playing the game. There have been times in my games where people started bitching and saying they were going to int and nobody responded. You know what they did? They kept playing the game because there was no bouncing board for them to keep getting angry at.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dolasaur","date":"2016-11-02T23:08:59.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Flaming them only contributes to a negative experience for all involved\n+1\n\nNext time you want to flame someone, quickly alt+tab to Notepad and write all your stuff there. (Since if you're flaming an AFK person, you clearly don't care if you get a response.) That will hurt 0 other people on your team (aside from your alt-tabbed time, but... better than flaming and getting a chat restriction)","replies":[]}]}
