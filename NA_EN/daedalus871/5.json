Tilt happens.\n\nTrue, but both sides have their disadvantages here. CLG's is coming off a loss streak, and they seem to be playing worse as well on top of that. TL has still shown weaknesses in cooperating as a team. I'm not gonna give them too much credit for their win over T8, that's one of the only teams they've beaten before with Piglet on the roster. They haven't beaten any other mid-top tier team with Piglet starting. They've even lost to DIG, a low tier team with Piglet playing. They're a total of 4-8 (5-8 with tiebreaker) with Piglet and two of those wins are over CST. \n\nThe only bright spot for TL is that they finally seem to be coming together. If they've figured out all or maybe even just most of their issues, I feel like they can actually finish 1st. To be completely honest, when they played with Keith they looked like the strongest team in NA by a noticeable margin. If they can find that same chemistry with Piglet, I feel like they can beat every team in NA if not stomp them.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-01T16:43:49.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People need to stop thinking Keith is some overall determining factor on TL's success.

If they can play how they played with Keith with him, they'd be the best team in NA by a notable margin.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-02T16:41:55.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"God I love this post.

Piglet already did his part by improving on everything they put on the list (a 3-page list of issues too, wtf). They can at least try to shape up in their own way. They look like they've been getting better at it in the last 2 weeks, but still they need more progress.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-06T18:06:35.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They shaped up and DOMINATED FreeLG (Free Elo GG)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Smart Kitty","date":"2015-04-02T16:38:17.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vixanys,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=aRM6cMOp,comment-id=0004000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-01T16:43:49.107+0000)\n>\n> People need to stop thinking Keith is some overall determining factor on TL's success.
