It's predictable and covers a smaller area than Cho'Gath's. If you're in the Cone, you're getting hit by it. There's really no dodging it. However, Malzahar's straight line is much easier to dodge. Also Cho has his Q that sets up for the already almost inescapable silence, while Malz's only hope is really try to read movements and catch the enemy (Won't count malz's ult as CC setting up for it because that takes one scenario where you cast the silence then quickly ult, and that is on a massive CD unlike Q-W\". \n\nFurthermore, Cho is incredibly tanky so the chances of him being bursted down before laying it down are much less than a malz being bursted down.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nucleophilic atk","date":"2015-03-29T20:28:54.368+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cho's silence is better than Malz lmao.","replies":[{"poster":"Daedalus871","date":"2015-03-29T20:30:24.334+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"2.5 s > 3 s\n\nk.","replies":[{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2015-03-29T20:32:50.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Daedalus871,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yPtzg7AY,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-03-29T20:30:24.334+0000)\n>\n> 2.5 s > 3 s\n> \n> k.\n\nif looking at the duration is your only factor then its no wonder you are getting downvoted","replies":[{"poster":"Daedalus871","date":"2015-03-29T20:37:10.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Better range 2.\nMore damage, more likely to hit multiple people, lower CD, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Dusteon","date":"2015-03-29T20:50:53.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Daedalus871,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yPtzg7AY,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-29T20:37:10.298+0000)\n>\n> Better range 2.\n> More damage, more likely to multiple people, lower CD, etc.\n\nMalzahar's Q has a .5 higher CC duration, longer range, slightly higher damage (25 +.1AP), and a lower coodlown. It also has a delay on a rather thin skillshot with a cast time. While on paper Malzahar's Q is much better, Cho'Gath's W is MUCH easier to reliably land on multiple targets.","replies":[{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2015-03-30T02:41:38.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually no, Cho's is most likely to hit more people.
