The Q changes may be less reliable, but now it has more range and farms slightly easier, making up for the ratio nerfs to his ult. Really the only thing that Veigar needs right now is for Dark Matter to get changed to something other than a farming tool.","replies":[{"poster":"MrButtermancer","date":"2015-06-25T03:41:25.949+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"CD on Q increased.

With the range increase as well, he can farm waves faster and safer. All things consider, I'm calling the Q change a net positive, and it's definitely no worse than neutral.\n\nThe ult got nerfed because Veigar is supposedly getting more AP farm now. I'm not sure how true that is due to not playing him too much before the changes. But seeing as his ult still does 500 +1.0 AP + 0.8 enemy AP, I think his ult still does plenty of damage.","replies":[{"poster":"MrButtermancer","date":"2015-06-27T09:47:25.172+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He cannot farm \"faster and safer\" against way more popular mid picks, because now his Q is a skill shot, it's way easier to all-in him. Before, even Yasuo had to be careful, because Veigar could stab him with a Q for considerable damage a few seconds after an autoattack, even when Yasuo initiated. Veigar could *trade.*\n\nThis is even worse against champions like Kat. Even with Kat going in Q E Kat would probably eat a Q, it would be in Kat's favor but not by a huge amount. Now there are way more ways that can miss. For one thing, if Kat Shunpos when Veigar Qs, she will go over it. If she Shunpos right before, she's on top of him, it will probably miss. And no matter what, the CD on Q itself is lowered so it's less likely Veigar gets a second chance before she's out of range.\n\nSo despite Veigar being able to technically reach the minions better, he's WAY less threatening to enemy mids... which means they're much likelier to out-trade, or given his lack of mobility, kill him. Which is completely backwards from everything he used to be. He used to be a threat. Not the biggest threat, not even unfair, he just had honest damage. Now if you have stuff between you and him, or a mobility skill, he's irrelevant unless you can secure the gold from killing him. He's unreliable, he has no mobility, and he can't even reach the back row while standing in the middle of the enemy front line. That's a crappy mage. He's not bursting anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Daedalus871","date":"2015-06-27T15:28:47.976+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Veigar is a late game champ. He has infinitely scaling damage, his ult is probably doing close to 2000 magic damage to enemy, and really, all of his damage has ridiculous AP scaling. He is clearly a late game champ. So if Veigar has to work hard to go even in lane, I think that is more than fine.\n\nFurthermore, so what if Veigar if no longer guaranteed to hit the back line if standing in the frontline? Veigar was never able to walk up to the enemy front line and blow up the backline; he would get destroyed if he even thought about it. Veigar already has a metric shit ton of damage, so if he has to work to use it, I think that is more than fair.","replies":[{"poster":"MrButtermancer","date":"2015-06-28T03:22:41.611+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you ever *play* the real Veigar?

Which it doesn't if the enemy has a brain OR a mobility skill OR tenacity OR they are lucky and simply move at the right time by random chance. His kit is unforgivably slow.
