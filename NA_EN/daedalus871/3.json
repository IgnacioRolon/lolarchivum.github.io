He is easier to gank in general than Zed and is pretty bad at roaming compared to Zed. He has no mobility or nuking for teamfights and offers just as little peel as Zed does.

Dota, however, has more options in items, so that mages can have armor without relying solely on one item to provide it.  It has more options in the jungle, so that stacking and farming becomes a viable alternative to a lane you are getting trounced in.\n\nBasically, in DotA, it isn't about Rock, Paper, Scissors.  (Well, it is, sort of, just like League is, too.)  If you picked a good champ you are comfortable with, getting counterpicked isn't the end of the world.  In League, you don't get many options.  It's have the jungler camp or be severely lacking in farm.
