The Q changes feel really nice, and the slight nerf on the ult was tolerable.\r\n\r\nHowever, he could really use some love on Dark Matter. I would suggest reducing the delay to about half of what is is now. Something along the lines of a 0.75 second delay. Right now, it feels like its main purpose is to clear minions as a champion that has a 99% slow can dodge it. As I play Malzahar and Cho'gath, I am used to landing delayed abilities, but Veigar's feels like it is just too long.\r\n\r\nEvent Horizon could also some buffs. Something like Veigar (and allies???) gains a 30% movement speed buff when running towards Event Horizon.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I did not play Veigar before the patch.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-25T21:35:03.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed.  I've played him twice with the new kit and I really like it.  The .75 delay is strange getting used to but it in no way ruins the skill.  Also, his Q has alot of neat applications now to make up for the occasional lost farm.\n\nHe's also more fun IMO, which has to be worth something :)","replies":[]}]}
