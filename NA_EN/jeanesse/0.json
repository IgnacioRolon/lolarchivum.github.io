Because her whole character is built around being a hand of caring and protection. And the Skin was designed in that particular fashion. I don't think they designed the skin like that JUST so the splash art would look kinda hot.","replies":[{"poster":"SikhRS","date":"2016-03-30T23:24:28.119+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"Of course soraka's caring and protection was put into the skin which I like, but that's not the issue. I mean you can't deny her large titties are the same color as her face and looking at the black stuff that's covering her makes it seem that her titties are uncovered and sticking out of her \"clothes\". Even with the angle (which is nice), the exposing of her titties could be prevented. Now should it be prevented is up for debate if that really is a new skin for her (not aware of many new skins).","replies":[{"poster":"DREADN0UGHT","date":"2016-03-31T00:21:12.549+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Oh man, I guess we should make a safe space on the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"SikhRS","date":"2016-03-31T03:01:30.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nope, not needed.

They or simply the curvature designed into the metal plates that makes up her chest.\n\nSecondly even if those were real breasts, they aren't even that big. They seem about normal size compared to all the woman I've seen.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ViashinoWizard","date":"2016-03-30T23:05:21.688+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Of course she's topless.

But skins are supposed to be recognisable alterations of champions, so all of the robot skins will keep the features of those champions.
