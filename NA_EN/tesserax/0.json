I just hit level 41 earlier and opened a Jax, 270 essence, and some other stuff I forgot, but my level 40 capsule is still completely missing from my loot, I can't find it. Others have apparently also had the same problem, and not just for level 40, but for other level capsules as well. Can I get any updates on this situation? I'm feeling particularly frustrated because the level 40 capsule appears to have been supposedly a larger capsule with more stuff in it, but I completely missed out.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-15T17:26:33.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, it looks like you opened your level 40 milestone on the 12th.
