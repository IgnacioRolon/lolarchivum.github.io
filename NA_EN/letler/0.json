She has an ability that buffs her move speed and yet she has 1 run animation. Soraka has multiple runs, Ashe has multiple runs. Both were visually updated before Karma. Sivir has like 5 runs which makes sense because of how much move speed changes are in her kit. Ashe has multiple run animations and has zero move speed modifiers in her kit.\r\n\r\nWhy does Karma only have 1 run animation? She uses E and quickly hops around it's just her run animation sped up. It looks out dated even though she was recently re-released. I don't understand why 4 new models were created but only 1 run animation was made when she has a haste spell built into her kit. ???\r\n\r\n:( {{champion:43}} :(","replies":[{"poster":"nickstravaganza","date":"2014-02-18T05:10:45.212+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for bringing this up.

Another champion that could use some attention animation wise is Fiora {{champion:114}}. She has a wonky run animation and combined with her pose she looks very stiff.                                                      \nI also remember her designers had problems animating her W (she was supposed to use the dagger on her back to block), resulting in her animations feeling lackluster.
