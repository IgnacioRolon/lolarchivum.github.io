If they dont reconnect then when its their turn they dont lock in cause reconnecting doesnt put them back in champ select\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has been happening in a huge amount lately and we all have about a 15 minutes wait before queuing up even thougj we never dodged on purpose. (It also happens when we're not playing together so it has nothing to do with the premade)\r\n\r\nIs there any solution to this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-16T17:03:49.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like what happens is that the client's dropping its connection to the server, which is what's causing the drop from champ select.
