The last one was Kench, so it's possible. Plus, if you go by what she did in her story, she sounds very support-ish. She popped a soldier off the ground and into the air by making a rock launch him up, she slowed and impeded the movements of soldiers by making rock spikes erupt from the ground to keep them at bay, and then finally she encased the building in a stone prison. That sounds like a support build to me, if we go by these shows of her power as reflective of her kit design.","replies":[{"poster":"MrLlamaWaffle","date":"2016-04-30T18:43:30.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right.

They're separate pipelines, according to Riot. Which means that the last support was Kench, who was like 5 champions ago. With Taliyah here, they're restarting the chain since there's been one of each other role released since Kench. And fun fact, not only was Kench originally a top laner, he was originally Mega Gnar.\n\nEdit: PLUS we just got a new mid lane mage with Aurelion Sol. Rarely does Riot give us back to back champs in the same role.
