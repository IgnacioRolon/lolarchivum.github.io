The enemy midlaner was Nidalee. As the game progressed, we both noticed what we've concluded to be a visual bug with Nidalee. It seems that whenever Nidalee uses pounce, or comes out from the fog of war, she teleports for an instant to another part of the map, and then lands again where she originally was supposed to land. This gives the illusion that she disappears (somewhat like a Vayne tumble) and gives her an unfair, game-breaking advantage over other players. We weren't originally going to report it until the enemy Soraka told me afterwards that the player had a recent history filled with Nidalee games of over 19+ kills. I looked into it on the forums/board as well and it seems that players as far back as a month ago were noticing the same bug. I only lost one game (granted it was during a ranked series) due to this bug, but I will be forced to ban Nidalee in all possible games in order to avoid further encounters. Please look into this problem and try to get it hot-fixed, or at least fixed in patch 4.21. Thanks for listening!","replies":[{"poster":"Heavk","date":"2014-12-01T02:23:08.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had that happen in on of my normal games she used pounce then teleported next to a wall then back!!! I was like lag?hacks? also I think that her spear should do less damage as it shoots out because logic a spear loses velocity. also makes it easy to 2 shot people ward over wall stand back a little hit spear flash pounce kill X_X if its a small wall then a pounce over is used for flash. I had 3000+ hp and a bv as jax... she would 3 shot me w/ spear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rngrs Apprentice","date":"2014-11-30T22:46:20.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haven't seen nidalee in FORVER because with the recent changes she is trash, period","replies":[]}]}
