The account name was THQMAS. My son has survey anger management issues and has a short temper. unfortunately, with this company, it is not an excuse which I completely understand. My son has been very suicidal and now is seeing a therapist. The school is now fully envolved in trying to help him. The school and therapist have asked many times to try contacting the company about getting the account unbanned but they always end up saying they can&#039;t do anything. My son was on his last chance before he got his permanent ban, but here is why my son&#039;s account should be unbanned.\r\n\r\nI gave my son 10 dollars before he went to school so after school he could catch a bus which is 2 dollars to the city and spend 4 dollars at the internet cafe which would get him 1 hour he says. He would have enough money to buy one sushi roll and then I would come to pick him up. The internet cafe was what he loved. My family is in a tough place and small things like this made his day. His mates told him to start a quick ranked game and then they would all get sushi. Unfortunately, his time ran out and the owner was very angry because the boys were making a lot of noise. He told them to leave or they would have to pay more. None of them wanted to help him so my son left by himself and called me to come to pick him up without getting his favourite sushi. His friends thought it would be funny to go onto his account and not play well and be mean to others. They did this for a couple of games before they got banned. \r\n\r\nI was reading other posts and some people were saying riot &quot;does not care&quot; unless you post it on here. I was hoping I could say this to get my sons to account unbanned. My son is still suicidal and talks about killing himself every day because this account literally meant the world to him. It has made my life and my husband&#039;s life misery but we are still fighting.","replies":[]}
