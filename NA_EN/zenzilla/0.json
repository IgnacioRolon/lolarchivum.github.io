Remember they are on West Coast (Pacific) time, so if you're ahead your time will be different when you're unbanned. It's best to wait at most 24 hours after the specific time stamp of your ban has passed.  \n\nThey cannot extend the ban without notifying you (unless you did something worse like install illegal 3rd party software or other ban worthy actions. Though that results in permanent ban). \n\nFor why you were banned; unfortunately only Riot can notify you why you received a suspension on your account. I can try to decipher what might of happened, but unfortunately without the email you won't know exactly. Riot Support is the best way to get more information, just be sure you submitted it under the right tab/question. \n\nI would recommend checking your Spam/Junk folder in your email to be sure it didn't get accidentally moved. Also be sure the account that was suspended is linked to your main email. If you use a different email then be sure to check that. Riot sends out emails to the address connected to your account. \n\nI hope that helps :)","replies":[{"poster":"zenzilla","date":"2016-10-24T16:11:59.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is no time indicator on the ban notification\n\ni submitted a ticket loooong ago. all they did was say they would get back to me, same automated thing everyone gets.\n\nI check my inbox and spam/junk mail folders everyday, on the associated email account as well as 2 other email accounts that i have (just in case) - no email ever\n\nThe funny thing is, \n\n:D they DID sent me a survey about my recent customer service experience\n\n lol","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-10-24T17:57:42.613+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You ban ends at 13:51:19 PDT today.\n\nThe punishment was issued for behavior related reasons after a manual review of your account.

By retaliating you are ruining the game for the rest of your teammates. If someone refuses to stop acting up then just mute, report and move on. From the [Instant Feedback System FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286): \n\n>**WHY WAS I PUNISHED WHEN THE OTHER PERSON WAS WORSE OR STARTED IT!**\n* Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game. If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n* Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\n From [Understanding the Tribunal](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2726400): \n\n>**4) That player in my game was far worse than me. Why am I banned???**\na) I'll keep this one simple: retaliation isn't OK. Reacting to a toxic player by being toxic just incites that player to be even worse--it also ruins the game for up to 8 other players. It is far, far worse to watch two people yelling at each other all game than it is to watch 1 player ranting into blank space. Almost everyone in the game can find someone out there that behaves worse than they do--but so what? Finding someone worse doesn't justify your behavior or justify retaliation. We expect more out of our players. What players often don't realize is... those other players in your game that you thought were worse? Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on. If you retaliate, both of you will be banned. It's really that simple.\n\nTantram didn't give you an automated response here. You asked them to look into your case for you and they did. Not only that but Tantram even admitted that there was a mistake done on Supports end that should not have happened. Just because it wasn't the response you wanted to hear doesn't make it automated.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Desolas Arterius","date":"2016-10-24T16:21:36.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is weird.
