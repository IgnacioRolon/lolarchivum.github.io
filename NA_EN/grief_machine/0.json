His soldiers do a ludicrous amount of damage that no amount of MR can counter. He has countless jumps from a super long range. Playing against him sucks all the joy out of life. I would rather lane against Satan himself, Teemo. I would just love to see some of his power toned down a bit. Not nerfed into oblivion, but enough so that laning against him isn't a completely horrible experience.","replies":[{"poster":"AbsoluteSadman","date":"2014-12-23T07:34:00.429+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"hes also countered by hard assassins, poke, mobility, people who dont waltz into his soldiers, and people who capatalize on his huge e cooldown. not to mention he's probably the hardest champion to play in the game right now.","replies":[{"poster":"DropFill","date":"2014-12-23T07:42:24.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EbonyNarwhal,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IK5154w6,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2014-12-23T07:34:00.429+0000)\n>\n> hes also countered by hard assassins, poke, mobility, people who dont waltz into his soldiers, and people who capatalize on his huge e cooldown. not to mention he's probably the hardest champion to play in the game right now.\n\nBeing hard doesn't mean a champion should be OP. Also, azir shouldn't be spamming his E , which no one does, he only uses it to avoid engages or ganks. Only assassins who can actually beat him is zed or fizz, both called cancers by the community. So you basically counter cancer with cancer","replies":[{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2014-12-23T08:15:15.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or any Assassin with any gap close.

Complaining about it solves nothing. Learn to work around it. That's like complaining that ADCs crit too much in the late game, or that Fizz's mid game is unfair. It's what they excel at. During a constantly shifting teamfight, Azir starts to lose his advantages because he can't always have a soldier where he's going to need it. He won't always be able to safely jump to one. And his ult could just as easily ruin a teamfight for his team as it could save them depending on how he uses it. He's a very mechanically heavy, position focused champion. If someone can play him well enough to do well given his limitations, and how much his kit punishes you for making small mistakes, they can go ahead and win with him in my book.
