I had a really shitty ranked day where I lost all my games and there were a surprising amount of afks and ragequitters in those games. I kept my mouth shut and came on the boards and cried about it instead. No ban for me. The next day I had better teammates and won a majority of my games performing the same as I did those other days. But I recognize that I did indeed have a good day. They're not all bad.

If those guys threw the game over someone saying mean things to them, I say too fkn bad they should've straightened up hit mute and continued to play like they wanted to win. If they aren't doing that, then they shouldn't even be on the rift. Everyone loses, but right now losing doesn't give you the sense of \"man we all played but couldn't pull it through\". The game right now is more roll the dice and see who gets the unbanned troll. Trolls aren't trolls cuz they may or may not talk shit; they're trolls cuz they don't actually play the game once in it for X reason and are wasting everyone's time. Reports should be focused on actions, not some dipshits feelings about what some stranger said. Was he controlling your buttons? Did you have a mute option? Then stfu and if you're bad get better or get used to muting when you play. I'd take 4 assholes who say ridiculously offensive stuff over 4 tilted players who are just gonna throw at first death or at first insult any day.","replies":[]}]}
