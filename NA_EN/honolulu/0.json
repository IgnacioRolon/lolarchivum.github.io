I recommend using the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide, especially the portion on drivers to make sure that they are up to date.  Also keep in mind that 4k and resolutions higher than 1920x1080 are not supported, and you will need to reduce it for smooth play.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
