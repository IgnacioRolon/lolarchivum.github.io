Unfortunately, once these tokens have been used no further exceptions can be made.  I did look into this for you and found that the purchases were super close, and the Elise skin hasn't been used yet.  For your specific issue, I can't make any guarantees but it wouldn't hurt to reach out to us individually through a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  Our billing team will be happy to look into this!","replies":[{"poster":"RiddleMarvoloTom","date":"2016-08-29T15:21:15.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for replying. Has Riot thought about adding more tokens? People are still going to buy RP just maybe let us refund unless we've used it or try to buy on sale items and get refunded the actual price. I for one would rather exchange it for something I do want but if ya'll cannot it is what it is, it's just not fun to \"waste\" that money.","replies":[]}]}]}
