When I first started the game, she still had her stun on E and the old stealth mechanism. While I&#039;m in no way defending that kit, I find it ridiculous that given her current kit and the completely (nearly) useless stealth system that she has, Rito still isn&#039;t even sure that she&#039;ll be getting any attention in the FOLLOWING YEAR. She used to be one of my favourite champions, even when you guys messed up horribly by removing her stun and giving her a slow in the old days. However, she is so terrible and non-versatile that I can&#039;t even play her in normals. Not only that, she is one of the only champions who is forced into a single role in game and isn&#039;t even decent at it. This is just my two cents but I honestly believe she needs to have priority. Just giving her a fancy new splash art meant NOTHING to me and I&#039;m sure lots of other former Eve players feel the same way. I am open to any and all explanations. I&#039;m also curious about other people&#039;s opinions about the matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Aazzlano","date":"2016-04-28T19:02:08.928+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meanwhile, {{champion:238}} and {{champion:245}} receive buffs to keep them relevant in the meta at all times!\n\nHonestly at this point I expect even when she does receive a rework, that she will just get nerfed even further into unplayability so I don't even know if i should look forward to her getting touched.

Anyone who gets a rework instead of her probably needs one just as badly as she does.

Never have I ever (lol) seen my beloved Eve in a single game since like...last year or something. And the thing is I can't blame people. I don't feel like playing her either because she just feels so weak and out of place. Riot always talks about the importance of portrayal of power, as in how abilities \"feel\" etc. Even Eve's ult feels lackluster","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hella Gay Nerd","date":"2016-04-30T06:59:12.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not really sure I'd say that her stealth is useless...\n\nIt gives a huge amount of pressure.
