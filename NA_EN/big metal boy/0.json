I&#039;m hoping I can get some Riot insight on this question of mine.\r\n\r\nI watched the Frequencies documentary back when it came out and I have been enthralled by the audio and music production team at Riot Games. I&#039;m a musician myself in the US Army and I&#039;ve played and created music all my life.\r\n\r\nI have searched almost everywhere I could to get in touch with someone from the music/audio team. If anyone could give me any info on who I could contact or talk to, that would be incredible! I would try to inquire about this through the Job Search section, but there is no area to search for it.\r\n\r\nOnce again, any leads or info would be greatly appreciated!!\r\n\r\nThank you guys so much\r\n\r\n- SokoS","replies":[{"poster":"Vonderhamz","date":"2017-05-20T20:00:22.480+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey SokoS, \n\nI'm a sound designer on League. I don't think I can direct message on these forums, but I have the same user name (Vonderhamz) on Reddit, so you can DM me there with any questions you have and I'll do my best to help you out! \n\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Metal Boy","date":"2017-05-31T14:47:28.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!
