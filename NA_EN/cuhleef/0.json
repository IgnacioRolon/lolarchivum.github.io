However, when I fill, I constantly get support.\r\nI feel like people need more slots. I made a mockup of a suggestion of picking which roles are prioritized better.\r\n\r\n[IMGUR Image to Mockup](http://imgur.com/7MOsCwT)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Deflum","date":"2016-09-19T02:07:29.566+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't this literally Evolve S2 role priority? where you choose all roles in order from the one you want the most to the one you want the least? I gladly support this, just give credit to another game that uses it to show it works. Also, if you did get it from another game, please do give credit to the game for legal reasons. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Cuhleef","date":"2016-09-19T02:09:13.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've actually never played Evolve so I didn't know they used a similar thing.

I think Auto-fill would work better if they had a better auto-fill protection, not the 1 for 1 they use. but if you have no auto-fill protection then go jungle/Mid. you will usually get jungle even with auto-fill :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-09-19T01:52:05.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My idea was if you pick fill you can choose 1 role that you for sure wont get.
