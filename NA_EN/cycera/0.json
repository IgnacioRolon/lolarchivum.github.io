Sure, a 1 star Annie isn't much of a threat but with other Summoners or if she's 2 star or 3 star and doesn't get killed before ulting, Tibbers just wipes out my entire team even if I killed everyone else and have 4 or 5 people left on the board. I haven't run into the IE Kha yet personally and when it comes to Infernals (the thing I've been trying to make work), it always gets overpowered in my experience.\n\nI'm just frustrated that Tibbers can wipe my whole team singlehandedly. Olaf is just as crazy to play against though, I agree there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2019-11-17T11:29:57.967+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my matches, Olaf is a bigger threat than Annie. \n\nA lot of the $4 champs tend to be carrys.

And yes, the mage Annie team build is also double cancer, I've had the joy of playing against that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-17T06:09:04.088+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is always a counter.
