To add on to that I cant even get past downloading the launcher. My net is already slow so let me state that first so having this problem is really frustrating and demoralizing. The  first part of the download would go by without a problem but when its at 2/2 of the download it would restart to another 958 mb. I first noticed the problem when after about 4 hours the mb was at 1mb at 99% remaining. It then began recounting from 958 mb but saying its 99%. The download would then restart at random intervals like from 300mb all the way back to 958 mb. \r\n\r\nAny solution guys? I honestly just want to play this game and I'm starting to lose hope on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-17T21:52:09.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're not getting any errors but getting stuck at 99%, then it's likely that something is causing your connection to our patching servers to degrade.
