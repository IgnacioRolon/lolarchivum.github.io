I mean it could have been a bad game...or maybe a troll....but 1 game is hardly a good judge of how good he is or whats going on. I do know where you're coming from...when I Q with 4 people and we get a random 5th its always a troll...if I solo Q I get 4 cool people (sometimes) But almost every time we go in with a premade that one guy is always a loser....well 90% of the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rito Staff","date":"2016-08-04T00:26:17.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A gold could go 0/10 to a bronze.
