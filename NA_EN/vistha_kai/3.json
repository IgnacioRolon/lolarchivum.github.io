You've seen it occur recently I take it?\n\nI just did some testing on this - I'm a Syndra main on LAN (diamond last season), so I know her pretty well. [Here is a video showing what I noticed.](https://youtu.be/AOG9kBTu1XU) While it is currently working, it could use a small QoL change.\n\nEssentially, the issue is that the range just BARELY matches, and has absolutely 0 forgiveness. If you move backwards even a small bit, it won't fire. **But more importantly, if you move perpendicular to the line between you and the orb, it will also not work** because that's how circles work.\n\nI've attached a crude MS paint drawing illustrating this. This happens A LOT because Syndra casts while moving.\n\nWhile technically working as intended, it tends to create a lot of confusion because Syndra was moving for a tenth of a second between the two spells and that tiny difference in location (which usually isn't even enough show up client-side) causes a miss.\n\n----\n\nWhile on the topic of Syndra, can we please address her current balance? She's been gutted both directly and indirectly, at least during laning phase.\nDFG removal was an indirect nerf.\nChalice nerfs.\nBase mana regen changes (which were ultimately a nerf to early game mana) and item regen mechanic changes (also a nerf in most cases).\nQ damage nerf.\nDamage-focused AP items were just nerfed (Rabs and void are both less gold efficient than before).\nMR/health/tanky items are about to get buffs.\n\nHer early game has been absolutely gutted, to the point she can rarely make it to mid/late. There's a reason she's been near/at the bottom of the win-list for months now.\n\nHer Q really needs a level 1 damage buff. Landing EVERY SINGLE ONE, she will oom before she kills anything. Seriously. Go try it. That's absolutely atrocious. 40 mana and it does less damage than her auto attack. It is pretty much the definition of a noob trap. If you are casting your Q at rank 1, you're mathematically losing. Give it 10 damage on the low end and it'd bring her back in balance.\n\nAlternatively/additionally, you could look at lowering the mana cost of Q. All the in/direct mana nerfs have really hit her hard since literally her entire kit revolves around her being able to spam orbs. Since the skills rely on each other, mana changes were doubly/triply potent on her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-08-10T09:09:22.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still happens to me all the time.\n\nLol Wiki lists the range of her E at 700, wich could be outdated, but it's shorter than her Q at 800 range.
