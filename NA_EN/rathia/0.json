The issue has since been (partially?) fixed, but I still can't get on LoL (Or Warframe, for some reason.) However, I can play Strife and otherwise play Steam games with Cloud saves; I'm not entirely sure why.\r\n\r\nA DNS-related issue crippled my internet access for a while about 28 hours ago. A bit of fiddling around has mostly restored it; while at first I was unable to browse most websites other than a select few (Facebook, Youtube) and unable to properly connect to Steam (Friends were accessible, however any other pages wouldn't load on the Steam UI) this has since been apparently fixed. I'm not sure which type of information to provide for assistance, but I'll be happy to provide it once pointed in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIf it means anything, I'm using a laptop and have wi-fi internet (although I prefer to set it to LAN-mode and use a CAT5 cord for stability.)","replies":[{"poster":"Rathia","date":"2015-04-06T10:14:38.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.","replies":[]},{"poster":"amd098","date":"2015-04-05T17:15:22.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue here oddly.
