But whenever I try to install it just closes at a random point, normally around 30+% with no error messages what so ever. If you need more info please tell me\nAnd league worked perfectly fine on pc before I took the pause ","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-13T16:42:43.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really strange that your patcher is just closing like that without an error.  To start, let's make sure that your OS and anti-virus settings aren't blocking league from prepping and installing your game files.  Run through the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that League is being added as an exception.  Then give it another go, and let me know if everything's okay!","replies":[]}]}
