How do we make BE? I'm feeling pressured to buy RP because I cant make any BE, intentional or am I just missing something here. Also no rerolling champs? got 8 in my loot and i own them all? is that the only source of BE now? if this is what it is, then the normal grind just got a lot worse.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-20T01:40:48.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main sources of BE going forward are from disenchanting champion shards as always. You get a lot more champion shards from levels up now, since every level up will grant you a capsule containing some shards that you can use to unlock champions or disenchant to work towards something else. The main reason you can't reroll champion shards anymore is since that could now be a net loss of BE overall.\n\nI do also suggest checking out those two posts AoA Nel linked, as Rioters are talking there about why these changes were made as well as taking your feedback to make this a little better if needed!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rainboom","date":"2017-11-19T19:22:50.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there!\n\nDon't fret! Riot made a great boards post explaining Blue Essence (BE): https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/Jh3Mtzu6-blue-essence-earn-rates-learning-the-numbers-with-carl-and-henrietta\n\nDon't forget to check the PreSeason FAQ as well! https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012640908-Preseason-Update-FAQ\n\n- At the moment, the only source of Blue Essence is by getting the Champion Capsules from leveling up.  They broke down the numbers and it should be a bit faster to acquire the BE (former IP) - just different.\n\n- Give them feedback on how you feel about it! Providing feedback is helping be the voice of the player community - it really matters!\n\nHope I helped!\n{{sticker:sg-kiko}}","replies":[]}]}
