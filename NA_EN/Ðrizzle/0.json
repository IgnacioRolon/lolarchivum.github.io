If you're running Windows 10, then this is probably caused by the Game DVR feature that was enabled by the new Windows 10 anniversary update.

I play other games that require much better hardware without problem. I have a GTX 980 and Intel i-7, 8gb of ram, and I am very familiar with hardware and have run league of legends with much less. I had no problems before the patch and now I do. If I am not mistaken, if something changes for a game I play such as a patch or update, and all of a sudden my game isnt working while I am able to still play all my other normal games without fps drops or freezing, it is usually the patch and not my computer that is the problem.\n\nedit: and yes I have updated all my drivers if you are wondering.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-07T15:32:14.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if the steps in the FPS guide wasn't able to make a change, then I recommend reaching out to our tech team in a [support ticket.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)\n\nAdditionally, I recommend attaching a set of logs with our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to your request, so our techs have more context on the issue.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ðrizzle","date":"2016-09-01T13:26:04.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was very helpful, I can play league again !
