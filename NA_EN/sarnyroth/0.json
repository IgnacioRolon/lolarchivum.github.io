The problem has the symptoms of slight lag (Delays on champion commands, moments of \"walking in place\" for everything on screen followed by very fast \"catching up\") but without any sort of MS changes. \r\nThe issue has occurred regardless of whether or not I have other programs or pages (Discord, Skype, YouTube, etc) running in the background, and it's not incredibly consistent. I haven't found any trend in when the issue appears, such as when abilities are being cast, or during large teamfights, and by this point I don't know what the root of the issue is.\r\nI play League with 5+ other people, and none of them have encountered the same issue, so I've got no one else to compare to at the moment, to see if maybe there's some consistencies between myself and them.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-29T23:46:17.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issues you described in this post are really common symptoms of *Packet Loss* or High packet buffering.
