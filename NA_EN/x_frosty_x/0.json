I'm curious. Why the f*ck do I ping 40-80 ms all day long to the Riot servers, then around 7 pm or later the ping is spiking to 250-400ms. I'm the only person on my network and I have a 100 Mb connection. Before they moved their servers to the central area I never had any issues... but now.. its ridiculous, can't play any type of game in the evening. Routing going that badly on the interwebz?  \r\n\r\nPS:  And yes, I haven't played much since they moved them due to playing CS back in the day, I knew better than to try a central server.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-05T23:24:45.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your ISP could be changing how it routes you to the game servers and causing an increase in ping, but there could be other factors as well.
