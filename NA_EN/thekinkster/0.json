I usually don't take these ranting posts seriously, I troll these at work for fun you see. However, I'm going to believe you (something no one should do when it comes to league players, all liars.) permanent ban is usually associated with cheating. Not calling you a cheater, but cussing usually get you chat bans. Unless you went way overboard, in which case maybe this game is not helping you relieve stress so riot did you a favour.

To be honest I do get heated some times but it's usually only a couple games out of the lot. If you look down I did post my chat logs were I am toxic and trust me I do admit I was pretty pissed but still a perma when nothing the other players said was taken into consideration or at least give a warning when a player is close to getting a punishment. That would be a much more efficient system instead of just banning players out of the blue give them a warning or show them how close they are instead of letting them continue to have bad games where they lose their temper then get banned after. Riot didn't do me a favor as this is my really only stress reliever and I'm not joking when I say this. The only thing Riot did for me is have a panic attack and a mental breakdown.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2018-10-12T01:18:07.976+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"you seemed to be misinformed about a few things\n\nfirst, there is no one week ban, the current punishment tiers are 10 game chat ban, 25 game chat ban, 14 day suspension, perma ban\n\nsecond, a premade has no more power than a solo player when it comes to reports, one report does the same thing that 9 does and NO AMOUNT of reporting will result in punishment if you do nothing wrong","replies":[{"poster":"TheKinkster","date":"2018-10-12T01:31:42.722+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CharDeeMcDenniz,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Zv2PRdiW,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-10-12T01:18:07.976+0000)\n>\n> you seemed to be misinformed about a few things\n> \n> first, there is no one week ban, the current punishment tiers are 10 game chat ban, 25 game chat ban, 14 day suspension, perma ban\n> \n> second, a premade has no more power than a solo player when it comes to reports, one report does the same thing that 9 does and NO AMOUNT of reporting will result in punishment if you do nothing wrong\n\nI'm mentally breaking down right now I can't think straight moreaor less type well","replies":[{"poster":"Baka Red","date":"2018-10-12T12:21:02.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you think that League is causing you a mental breakdown, it sounds to me like you would be better off doing something else than playing League.
