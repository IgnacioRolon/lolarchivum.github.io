I never have issues. This weekend, I started playing and everything was fine, I had a great game. The next game however, I started getting ping that ranged from about 150-650. I quit and came back a day later and still no luck. I tried unplugging my router for 20 seconds and it went back to normal for about a minute or so. Sometimes it goes back to normal but not for long...I don't know if it's an issue with my service provider or not. I'm not sure, please help :)\nOh and I just tried to play Overwatch and my ping was fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-21T17:08:17.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Different servers or services are located in different geolocations, which means your connection takes a different route to each. Because of this, there could be issues along your route to one server, but not another. Before looking into your route to the server, it's a good idea to ensure your local network settings are compatible with those listed in [this guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\nLet me know if you notice any changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Rihanna Fenty","date":"2016-08-21T20:42:42.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't do anything but it seems to be working fine. Besides the random thing that happened an hour ago and rare fluctuation from 23-80. I couldn't connect to the game I was going into although I could use the the internet on Chrome... That's never happened before but it worked after pressing reconnect about 10 times. If I have anymore issues, I'll make sure to check the guide again, thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
