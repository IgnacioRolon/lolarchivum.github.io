The new {{item:3071}} gives 20% cdr instead of 10%. So with masteries {{item:3278}} {{item:3071}} you have max CDR. It should be extremely strong on riven.

It is actually terrible on Riven top. You either give up flash or TP, if you want a kill summoner, get ignite it will suit you much better. And flash is actually key to alot of Riven plays, so giving that up is more than a bit suicidal, on top of you are asking for ganks, which without flash become harder to turn around","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-04-30T00:38:05.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well duh I meant as the jungler.

It does not make your autoattacks deal true dmg. Each time you autoattack the smited enemy it **applies true dmg that deals 54 + 6 Ã— your champ level** . That being said, challenging smite functions more as a mini {{summoner:3}}  that allows you to 1v1 anyone on the enemy team.  The item costs 850 gold and you're giving up a summoner spell slot to have smite on a top lane champion (meaning you either give up flash or TP/ignite).  Considering that riven is already a beast at 1v1ing in the top, I wouldn't recommend it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Chin","date":"2015-04-29T17:27:06.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but... ignite","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZergReap","date":"2015-04-29T16:31:14.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riven properly played can apply all 6 stacks of armor reduction with her Q alone (with animation canceling of course).","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-04-29T16:00:19.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungle Riven actually kind of works, and if you don't want that, you can go smite top lane, just be prepared to sacrifice your level 3 and level 6 all in until you get you smite upgrade because you're trading you ignite for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-04-29T15:20:14.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New cleaver is okay on a tankier riven.  You can still go Yoummus if you want to blow up squishies in lane.  When you lane against AP bullies (like Lissandra) then the new cleaver will be awesome because you can take MR glyphs instead of CDR glyphs in lane and the hp on the phage/cleaver helps substantially to buffer their burst.\n\nI think it's dangerous to take smite top on Riven because it means you have to forego Teleport or Ignite.  TP and Ignite give you a ton of pressure as Riven because she can easily double kill bot lane or snowball top lane. You can't give up flash because it's your best engage tool in the mid-late game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arsch","date":"2015-04-29T15:15:05.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but the active of the JNG item is so op\nAnd it would allow u to build different boots","replies":[]}]}
