You do not have to do anything but delete the file and launch the game like normal.","replies":[{"poster":"DJ Bootie","date":"2014-10-31T02:20:19.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok i just deleted the file and am trying it now","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2014-10-31T02:03:18.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is most likely happening because your new TV doesn't support the same resolution as your old TV. You could probably resolve this by deleting your game.cfg and letting it repopulate itself. You can find it on your hard drive at this location:\nC:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\\Game.cfg\n\nIf it automatically changes to a bigger resolution and doesn't work, you can put it in windowed mode after getting in game (Preferably a custom game so you don't have any issues with other people) by pressing ALT+Enter, then you should be able to adjust your settings accordingly.","replies":[]}]}
