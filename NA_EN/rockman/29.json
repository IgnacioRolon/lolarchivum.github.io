Way worse than Garens.\r\n \r\n2. Putting his only \"defensive\" option as a reactionary, CC'less, high cooldown option is dumb. It also rapidly decays over 2 seconds. Even Tahm's lasts the full 2 seconds and he can still do other things instead of watching the enemy leave his range. \r\n\r\n3. His Left/right attacks still have the full windup. Your right attacks faster, but you still have to wait the full attack cycle like you're Graves. This means they want you to auto cancel with Q, but that means you got into melee range without your speed boost. Unlikely unless you're getting dicked on by Renekton. \r\n\r\n0/10, fails the Renekton bar. \r\n\r\nhttp://puu.sh/EOUvr/1ef1b8bf0a.jpg","replies":[]}
