The posting is way too linear, there&#039;s no skill expression in it that allows for great posts, with the exception of a few (Iaw ), and it always results in the threads being the easiest one.\r\nBefore people start throwing their critism at me, hear me out on this.\r\n\r\nUsually when someone posts a thread, they can at the very least be consistent and that&#039;s mostly because threads like that are very straight forward. You simply post shit onto your GD and then you post with the rest of your memes. There&#039;s not really a lot that seperates a boards poster from the GD posater, other than the fact the GD mains are unaware of what they can and cannot do.\r\nSomeone like Tundra Fizz can&#039;t mess up, you got no skill shots (Fish Feeder doesn&#039;t count as it&#039;s broken and wide af) and the area you cover with your slave labor are too big, it&#039;s too easy for a GD poster to post in this board.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand if a GDer suddenly gets pushed into something like frontpage, you can almost guarantee that poster will be demolished. They often don&#039;t know how to construct an argument, don&#039;t understand the many guidelines and wardens of the Gameplay and Meme boards and some don&#039;t know how to upvote efficiently either. \r\nOn on earth would a post spamming have the slightest clue on how to post something like Laughing Fish , where all of a sudden you got memes you need to maintain, but if it was the other way around the poster would easily be able to shitpost and be able to circle jerk on an average level.\r\n\r\nBoth Gameplay and GD are able to have about the same impact on the game.","replies":[]}
