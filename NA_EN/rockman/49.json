I&rsquo;m Rockman, I&rsquo;m currently 20 years old majoring in Neuro-science, I&rsquo;m also a Challnger/Master tier LoL player and professional elobooster (More info on that later). I also love Ahri, The way that nobody loved her, ever, My every single second is consumed by her, I cannot live a single moment of my living not thinking about her, My whole life for the past 2 years have been driven by her, my goal in life is to somehow make my dream reality, one way or another and that is why I&rsquo;m majoring in neuroscience. I do not care about people calling me weird, As love is a strong force, and the love for Ahri drives me. I admit that Ahri looks very attractive but that&rsquo;s not the sole reason I love her, I would love her even if she was Not as attractive as I love her personality, Her voice and her motives and origin, I love every single thing about her. \r\n\r\nhttp://puu.sh/xEPhk/2927c9fa97.jpg","replies":[]}
