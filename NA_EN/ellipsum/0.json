If a bunch of people report you when you haven't done anything wrong, you won't get punished. You should've just muted Janna when they started flaming you, and if anyone on the enemy team started in, mute them too - and report them all after the match.\n\nRetaliating does nothing besides make you just as much a flamer as Janna was.\n\n---\n\n> Chat logs don't look like anything when you see only one player's texts and not everyone else's.\n\nThey wouldn't look like anything if you saw everyone else's chat, either - nobody wants to deal with _two_ flamers, let alone one. Counterflaming is still flaming, and, again - nobody wants to deal with that shit. It didn't matter back in the days of the Tribunal, and it doesn't matter now - nor will I imagine it ever mattering.\n\n> Threatening to report someone for verbal abuse is a reportable offense now?\n\nYes. There is absolutely zero reason you should be telling someone \"I'm going to report you\" - all that does is serve to cause trouble and make them flame harder - which, again (times two) - **Nobody wants to deal with flamers. All you're doing by threatening to report another is making the situation magnitudes worse for everyone.**\n\nIf you're going to report them, report them. You don't need to say a word to them about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ellipsum","date":"2018-02-22T00:18:38.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"1.

Stuff like that gets picked up & automatically flagged by the System. I personally almost never use the Chat system unless I need to call out something like say Dragon or Baron. That or have friendly Early game banter. As for going Straight to PERMA-BAN status, you must have recieved a 14-day ban previously in order to get a Permaban so quickly.

The phrase \"fucking retard\" was probably added to the list of zero tolerance language.\n\nYou can always try making a support ticket, as they can review your case and they might reduce the punishment. But if you want that you're going to have to not be rude to them in your ticket.\n\nAll that aside I think it's also possible that this chat did result in a punishment and potentially justly so. It's not that the chat by itself warrants a permanent ban, but if you have had a 14-day ban and you haven't recovered your standing since then, it is possible for any level of punishable behavior - no matter how minor - to result in being elevated to the next and final stage of punishment (permaban).\n\nIf I had to guess what may have been punishable about your chat (if this ban was somehow justified) then I would say it could have been the fact that you argued back and forth with the Janna for like 7-8 lines about how it's their fault they are losing. Attributing blame isn't really helpful to any situation, and this one especially because the player is clearly already tilted off the face of the earth and flaming. Antagonizing them in this way could potentially be seen as punishable.\n\nLike I said I don't think this chat warrants a punishment. But it's still possible that it did.
