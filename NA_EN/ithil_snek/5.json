He's very twitchy and positioning sensitive, but also offers numerous avenues to bully the crap out of him and take advantage / kill him, as well as a decently long cooldown on his ability to prevent that.\n\nTL-DR: Read, it's not long and you're not doing anything important with your life right now.\n\nTo solidify my point, I refer you to the second mentioned thread:\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4792996\n\nTangentially related, but still related. Gnar was another champion with a very similar reception to Yasuo. A majority thought he was garbage (gnarbage), others weren't sure as he hadn't been around long, and a small minority recognized him for the threat he really was.\n\nSimilar to Yasuo, Gnar also received nothing but buffs and bug fixes the first patch after his release. I want you to keep in mind how ASTOUNDINGLY rare that was 3+ years ago. Most releases back in those days were insanely broken. Zyra, Jinx, Zyra, Jinx, Diana, Zac, Rek'sai, Vi, Thresh, and others were released very close in relation to Yasuo (and gnar I guess)...

He's far from binary and a lot of how a lane will go depends on the Yasuo player.

I think I've seen more people fight and beg for roles in Draft Pick this year than I've seen in a comparable amount of Blind Pick. Most of those people who would fight over roles moved on to Draft pick so they'd be assigned the role, leaving Blind Pick with people who are OK with filling.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sorakas Pantheon","date":"2017-10-15T18:12:08.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I see someone taking ideas from Smite, although i do agree with the 1 weak of being disabled in Ranked for new and reworked champions as it gives players plenty of time to learn how to play with as and or against it.

New champion got fed and destroyed your entire team few games before, so you dont want to face them any more.\n6. New champion actually being op, witch is shown in its win rate\n7.

You know somebodey in enemy team wants to play this champion becouse somebodey picked him and somebodey dodged\n10. Probably many more reasons that you missed.

There is no problem with the first week a champion is released using it to be learning. AFTER THAT POINT you can decide whether or not to Yasuo them (Ban every game because you hate them.)\n\nBut for the first week theyre out you should at least stick with fighting them and learning how to deal with that champion instead of banning it away for a month, ban something else for once, champion gets picked and is completely foreign AND the person is mastery 7.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2017-10-15T18:16:53.325+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Or just accept a game that relies on people not doing something dumb is going to rely on people not doing something dumb.","replies":[{"poster":"Broseidon25","date":"2017-10-16T00:30:20.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SociopathFriend,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=v08ZacTX,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-10-15T18:16:53.325+0000)\n>\n> Or just accept a game that relies on people not doing something dumb is going to rely on people not doing something dumb.\n\nExcept everyone does something dumb","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2017-10-15T19:59:13.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd bite on this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Muffles","date":"2017-10-15T18:53:00.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with ranked but normals are normals.
