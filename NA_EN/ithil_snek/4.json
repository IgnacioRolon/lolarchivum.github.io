I heavily suspect that if Varus ever gets a VGU update of a similar size to Sion, Galio, or Yorick, he'll actively be hearing the Darkin and we'll hear it similar to how you can hear the Maiden of the Mist when playing Yorick as it tries to lure him further into the corruption.   May also just be a great idea for a legendary skin with an evolving model that advances as he further is consumed by the bow until fully giving in lategame.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Steelflame","date":"2017-06-21T11:49:41.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Fizz is part of the same branch of the Vastaya genus as Nami is.\n\n\nYou have to understand just how broad the term Vastaya means.
