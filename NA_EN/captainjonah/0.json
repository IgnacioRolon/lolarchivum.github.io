It would remind you of a broken tv screen or a broken iphone. I sadly do not have a screen shot to show what it looks like but it is game breaking.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-14T17:19:16.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Store issues are usually due to setting issues with Internet Explorer.  The layers you are reporting may also be the store failing to load assets due to a connection issue.  To rule out some of these causes, I recommend going through our [Store Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202536660-Issues-with-the-League-of-Legends-Store-PvP-Net-) guide as a first step.  If that guide doesn't resolve your issue, I then suggest going over our [Connection Troubleshoot ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader)guide in case an unstable connection is preventing the store from loading.
