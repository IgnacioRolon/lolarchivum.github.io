Strikes Again!","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":7,"down_votes":35,"body":"**Dear Rioters as well as fellow summoners,**\n\nMy name is Dustin Hoffman (Yes, exactly like the actor). I am here today to explain my story, one similar to many others posted in the last couple of days. I am a member of the League of Legends community and have been since 2012. I have been on and off of League in large intervals due to personal issues that I&#039;d rather not explain. I came back in roughly late December/early January and I have been on almost every day since my return. (I have basically been binging League since I came back because of my large amount of free time with nothing to do)  I&#039;ve been playing a variety of games from the normal Summoner&#039;s Rift (Hardly touch ranked though), to Dominion (before its sad departure), and ARAM. I try to play with friends as often as possible but if none want to join, I&#039;ll just jump in Solo Queue and see what happens. When I do play League I use 3 programs to give me some insight onto who I&#039;m playing against or to communicate better with my friends and fellow summoners. I use Curse Voice, Elophant, and LoL Nexus.\n\n_**I DO NOT USE:**_\n-Overwolf\n-LoLSharp\n-Bots/Scripts/Hacks\n-DDOS Methods\n-Custom Skins\n-Announcer packs/Voice thingies\n**_I REPEAT; I DO NOT USE ANYTHING LISTED HERE_**\n\nNow, over the years I&#039;ve dropped probably close to **$600** into League of Legends, which is somewhat irrelevant but I did want to mention that to increase my Logos/Ethos regarding my loyalty to Riot. In the past two weeks alone I have spent **$200!** As of February 22nd, I was emailed (WITHOUT ANY WARNING) stating that my account is banned for 3rd party software. Now, in an effort to save time I&#039;ll simply state that in my attempts to contact Riot, all I received were copy and paste answers, the last one stating the often seen &quot;end of the line&quot; quote. After that I asked about being able to file for Charge-backs to refund the money that I just spent in the last two weeks, because yes, I am furious. I received no reply to that yet. \n\nNow, let me state for the record that over the years I have unhappily played against other summoners who DDOS and so forth. Truth be told I still don&#039;t know what scripting is. Hackers are something I see in most games I play, whether it be Call of Duty and the oh-so hated Aimbots or in Runescape where there were bots that functioned as full-time scammers (look it up). Hacking in MMOs is something I TRULY hate with all of my being and have even made reports in League for people I suspected of hacking (although there is not a category for it so I&#039;d always label is as something else).\n\nI am _**INNOCENT**_ of any and all &quot;3rd party program&quot; slander taken against me by Riot and will do anything to prove it. My case has definitely been mishandled and I will do ANYTHING to regain access to the many hours of HUMAN-ONLY effort that I&#039;ve put into my account. This is not going to sound like much, but I TRULY AM INNOCENT and have been not treated fairly in this process. I only want good for the community of League and it&#039;s fellow members but as of late I&#039;ve been treated as if I&#039;m {{champion:86}} &#039;s Villain or {{champion:203}} &#039;s marked prey. As I said, please understand that I will follow ANY steps to regain access to my account. If for any reason you see any type of punishment is still worthwhile (even though I&#039;ve not done anything wrong) I&#039;ll still take it over being permanently banned for no reason.\n\nRiot and fellow summoners, you are all truly great members and I urge you to see that there are no transgressions of the ToS made on my end and that I wish to remain a pure and innocent member of the community for years and seasons to come. \n\nThank you for your unwavering kindness and understanding,\n~Polukus~\n\n_PS: I have a VERY large group of friends that I played with on a very often basis that are more than willing to back these claims (one of them even being an ex-boyfriend of mine, who introduced me to the game when we were dating, back in 2012.) I also have Twitch streamers and such that I&#039;ve played with who most likely have **saved recordings** of my gameplay._\n\nEdit: I have NEVER let anyone use my account other than me. \nEdit: Well let me state that I have also never shared my password with another player and that any access to my account was unauthorized entirely. I'm here saying that I've reforitfied my account and that it would never happen again and apologize for any of the current actions made with my account...Please.... :/","replies":[{"poster":"mirageofpenguins","date":"2016-02-26T22:57:00.584+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dear Mr. Hoffman,\n\nSpent some time looking into your history, and you definitely shared your account with a player currently on your friend's list.

One of the easier things to point out that they likely use would be champion pool and play patterns (probably even down to idle click patterns, how you move across the map, inputs used, etc).","replies":[{"poster":"InHaruhiWeTrust","date":"2016-02-27T00:49:10.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how do the tell? what the difference between me going to a friend house and playing on his pc vs giving him my password and him playing? unless they hack your webcam idk how they could tell the difference. until i see an official riot post i'm just gonna play it safe from now on and only play on my own pc. i've spent like 150$ on this game and would be pissed if riot banned my account it over a misunderstanding.","replies":[{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2016-02-27T00:57:55.269+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, it's based on *account* not physical machine you're sitting at. Physical machine is irrelevant. Do you and your friend control the camera in exactly the same way? Do you use exactly the same champions? Are your idle click patterns exactly the same? I could go on and on here...\n\nBasically, you as a player create a fingerprint of sorts while playing the game, without even knowing it. No two players are going to have exactly the same quirks, champion pool, etc. So to your question, if you go play on your account using your friend's computer, it's still all of your quirks and habits during play. If you give your login to a friend and they play on your account (on any PC), those quirks are going to suddenly change to something completely different.\n\nAnd really, you don't need Riot to directly state that using different PCs is fine (though many examples of this exist on the boards). But I'll say beyond that, in Korea, it's extremely common for people to play in PC cafes rather than on their home machine. They probably don't necessarily go to the same cafe each time. And they might play some from home as well. Riot fully supports this, which should be enough proof that they don't care what physical machine you're sitting at when you play.","replies":[{"poster":"InHaruhiWeTrust","date":"2016-02-27T01:07:39.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok, you made some very good points. thanks for the reply, you have set me at ease good sir <3","replies":[{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2016-02-27T20:36:32.022+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if this has been said, but the time you login to different IP addresses.

It likely has to do with physical location, via ip. \n\nA very highly doubt it has to do with play style fingerprint... LOL\n\nWe can hardly get Rioters on the boards most days, let alone skim through a ton of games finding minute details... \n\nThe system that detects this is 100% automated.","replies":[{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2016-04-05T02:10:56.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IP is the worst possible means of tracing this. And an IP is assigned to a device upon connection to a network. It often has nothing to do with physical location, either. Unless you're on a static IP. That said, an IP can easily be changed at any time, which is why IP changes by themselves don't necessarily put up a major flag on an account as being shared.\n\nAnd yes, the system detecting this is automated. And you're right, Rioters don't have the time to bother hand-reviewing details like that. Frankly, some of the details I've suggested as possibilities are things that no human would pick up on. But just as you said, it's an automated system. We already know they track champion pools and average performance on a champion. That's easy. But what's to say they *can't* just as easily add in other, more minute details that are automatically detected? There's any number of small bits that they could readily take down in an automated fashion, including every single thing I've posed as possibilities. \n\nAnd that's just what they are: possibilities. We can't know the small details of what exactly it looks for. That just opens the door for abuse. But there have been hints in the past that they are able to use more than just IP addresses and such to detect sharing. And there's so much data available that their systems could automatically collect, that it's impossible to rule any single metric out.","replies":[{"poster":"FearEngineer","date":"2016-04-05T16:45:05.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right in that IP would be unreliable due to a variety of reasons, including VPN.\n\nBut if you think that is a worse explanation than a extremely complex automated system that detects playstyle... this is Riot we are talking about--- THAT is the worst possible means of tracing this, lol","replies":[{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2016-04-05T17:25:40.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except, essentially, playing from a different IP and being flagged as account sharing for it is *exactly* what the person I was responding to was worried about. So simply saying they look at IP and champs played was never going to settle this player's anxiety over playing from a different location, or having a friend play on his computer (but separate account).\n\nWe know that Riot has ways to know for certain that an account was shared. We know they're able to detect sharing for even just a game or two. We also know they don't mistake playing on your own account from a different computer or in a different location with account sharing. And we've seen cases where the person it was shared with was even using the same champion pool as the account owner, but they're still caught.\n\nBased on all that, we know there's *something* more going on with their detection. And everything I stated is well within reason for an automated system to collect while you play. If they're already collecting it, then it's not a huge jump to use it as a comparison point for sharing detection.","replies":[{"poster":"FearEngineer","date":"2016-04-05T17:48:30.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, games are not recorded visually and analyzed. That sounds incredibly silly when you consider the resources that would be needed. \n\nOn the other hand, while an IP address can be affected by a number of things, it can be used to gain information about physical location. When your physical location changes uncharacteristically (paired with change in machine) over a short period of time etc, this is a red flag. The same methodology is used by Blizzard, which actually suspends accounts pending verification when certain criteria is met. \n\nExample, I played in my home state only for years-- first time I flew direct flight a few states away and tried to play my account was tagged. It happened various other times traveling back and forth as well. \n\nIt is definitely part of the process. Playstyle evaluation is NOT-- however recorded statistics like chat, overall success etc could be indicators. Ie, someone who is bronze 5 suddenly goes on a massive winstreak climb to silver-- WITH the other location/address indicators.","replies":[{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2016-04-05T21:56:28.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No visual recording or analysis necessary. This can all easily be automatically done. We do know that they keep fine details on every game played as it is. That's all automatically done. They probably already know a player's max, min, and average clicks/minute or actions/minute. Possibly even broken down by champion. \n\nI'll give you that exact clicking patterns is a stretch. It IS something that could automatically be tracked. But, would also be incrementally much more complex than just taking CPM or APM. They might do this. They might not. We'll never know.\n\nI've also been across the country and played on many different machines before. Never had an issue. 5-6 different cities in Ohio. Then to Michigan. Then week-long trips to North Carolina. Weekends in Texas. Now I live in Texas. That's a lot of different locations and machines without issue at all.

I didn't think I needed to report the situation (With my password being given to me by some \"friend\") seeing as I thought I had handled it myself by changing my password. When Riot Member MirageOfPenguins said my account was accessed by someone else a little while ago, only THEN did I bring that situation to light because it would explain....well....everything, then.\n\nI've urged Riot to look at my messages and my chat history to see that I was messaged by someone saying \"Your password is * lololol\" and then look at my password change history and see that minutes after I was told that, I changed my password. It wasn't a case of me GIVING OUT MY ACCOUNT. I am not trying to fabricate stories for sympathy, that'd be a waste of time seeing as Riot Admins can clearly look and see when I'm lying.

Doing anything like giving away my credentials to ANYONE let alone some random hacker on my friend's list is the _**LAST**_ _thing a member of 3 and a half years on LoL with loads of being-a-MMO-scam-victim experience and $600 plundered into his account would_ _**EVER**_ do.\n\nThank you for reading and understanding,\n~Polukus~","replies":[]},{"poster":"TornVenom","date":"2016-02-27T20:22:36.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not standing up for Polukus, My statement has nothing to do with THIS situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Barkhoof","date":"2016-02-27T20:30:44.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would you....why would you post in this...Why wouldn't you state the name of your...There are too many questions.

That friend was similarly suspended for scripting applications, so this really shouldn't come as a huge surprise to either of you.\n> \n> While I'd agree that you didn't personally utilize any cheats, the sharing here isn't really up for dispute (it's very obvious), and we ultimately hold an account responsible for the actions taken on it.  With that in mind, I'd like to take this moment to reiterate the importance of account security, and encourage you to review our guidelines, [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account#h2q1).\n\nIf someone on my friend's list accessed my account it surely wasn't with my permission. As I have said (in email) , one if my \"friends\" (who of which was just a random person I played a match with on league and added afterwards, I don't know them personally) on League was able to guess/hack my password and within 3 minutes of them telling me that I changed my password (I'm not sure if you're able to see my chat history) . Is there anyway to see my password change history and see that whoever accessed my account, I found out about and changed passwords after finding out...\nThank you for responding MirageOfPenguins, \n~Dustin~\nEdit: Your use of the word \"obvious\" isn't correct in any way. My account was HACKED not SHARED and it for sure wasn't obvious or else I'd have taken this up sooner, before being banned. I assumed whoever this \"friend\" was, was just warning me to change my password and not hacking my account, which is why passwords were changed. As I've said probably 5 times, any access to my account or any knowledge of my password was NOT authorized or given away by me. Please share proof that I shared my account willingly...you won't find it. It was never \"shared\". It was HACKED if anything.

NEGOTIATIONS, BINDING ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW\n\n>A. Negotiations. Disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute or claim related to this Agreement (“Claim”), you and Riot Games agree to first attempt to informally negotiate any Claim for at least thirty (30) days (except those Claims expressly excluded in Section XV.F below). Riot Games will send its notice to the address it has on file to the extent that you have provided additional contact information to Riot Games (e.g. by participating in a promotion or survey, or contacting a customer services representative). Otherwise, Riot Games will send its notice to the email address associated with your Account. You will send your notice to Riot Games, Inc., 10736 Jefferson Blvd., #622, Culver City, CA 90230, Attn: Legal Department. Please note that this informal resolution procedure does not suspend any statutory limitation periods applicable to the bringing of a Claim.\n\n>B. Binding Arbitration. If the parties fail to resolve a Claim through negotiations, within such thirty (30)-day period, either you or Riot Games may elect to have the Claim (except as otherwise provided in Section XV.F) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA Rules”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”) that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated and under the terms set forth in this Agreement. Both the AAA Rules and the AAA Consumer Rules can be found at the AAA website, www.adr.org. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section XV.B and either the AAA Rules or the AAA Consumer Rules, the terms in this Section XV.B will control and prevail.\n\n>Except as otherwise set forth in Section XV.F, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and Riot Games will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) you and Riot Games may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator’s decision is final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.\n\n>BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND RIOT GAMES ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.\n\n>C. Arbitration Fees. If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by the AAA Rules for initiating the arbitration. Your share of all other fees and costs of the arbitration, including your share of arbitrator compensation, will be charged pursuant to the AAA Rules, and where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. Where your share of the costs is deemed to be excessive by the arbitrator, Riot Games will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.\n\n>D. Location. The arbitration will take place in your hometown area if you so notify Riot Games in your notice of arbitration or within ten (10) days following receipt of Riot Games’ arbitration notice. In the absence of a notice to conduct the arbitration in your hometown area, the arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles, California, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances. Any Claim not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction in Los Angeles, California, United States of America, and you and Riot Games agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.\n\n>E. Limitations. You and Riot Games agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between Riot Games and you individually. YOU AND RIOT GAMES AGREE THAT (A) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (B) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (C) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER.\n\n>F. Exceptions to Negotiations and Arbitration. You and Riot Games agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Riot Games’ intellectual property rights; (ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courts’ jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.\n\n>G. Governing Law. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Other laws may apply if you choose to access the Game from outside of the United States. In such an event, those local laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent necessary in that jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions in this Agreement. You are responsible for compliance with all local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable. The New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act of 1993 (the “Act”) may apply to the Game if you access the Game from, and are a resident of, New Zealand. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Act applies then you may have other rights or remedies as set out in the Act which may apply in addition to or instead of those set out in this Agreement.\n\n>H. Severability. You and Riot Games agree that if any portion this Section XV is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section XV.F), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section XV.F is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Riot Games will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section XV.F found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within Los Angeles, State of California, United States of America, and you and Riot Games agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.","replies":[{"poster":"Polukus","date":"2016-02-27T00:26:15.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bow hunter 16,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=IjqZ0AbZ,comment-id=000700000000,timestamp=2016-02-27T00:19:41.296+0000)\n>\n> Wait your gonna SUE RIOT?!\n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n5E7feJHw0\n\nEdit:I REMOVED THIS COMMENT BECAUSE HONESTLY I AM NOT IN THE CORRECT MENTAL STATE TO DISCUSS THIS WITH A CLEAR AND CORRECT ANSWER.","replies":[{"poster":"Void Nargacuga","date":"2016-02-27T00:31:13.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">[Terms of Use](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse)\n\n> IV.

Riot Games does not provide or guarantee, and expressly disclaims any value, cash or otherwise, attributed to any data residing on servers operated by Riot Games, including without limitation the Game Assets associated with your Account.\n\n>If you have a valid, active Account, you may participate in our Riot Points service offering, which is a redeemable point system that operates like virtual currency (“Riot Points”) used to license certain Game Assets that can be used while playing the Game, including, without limitation, special champions, champion “skins,” and boosts (“Virtual Items”). Riot Points can be purchased online through the in-Game store or at retail in the form of a prepaid Riot Games Game Card. Please note that you must register your Riot Games Game Card in the in-Game store in order to access the Riot Points the card contains.

Riot Games will notify you in the event that you near any such limit. Additionally, price and availability of Riot Points and/or Virtual Items are subject to change without notice.\n\n>You are solely responsible for verifying that the proper amount of Riot Points has been added to or deducted from your Account during any given transaction, so please notify Riot Games immediately should you believe that a mistake has been made with respect to your Riot Points balance. Riot Games will investigate your claim, and in doing so, may request some additional information and/or documentation to verify your claim. Riot Games will let you know the results of the investigation, however, you acknowledge and agree that Riot Games has sole and absolute discretion in determining whether or not your claim is valid, and if so, the appropriate remedy.\n\n>YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE RIOT POINTS SYSTEM AND THE VIRTUAL ITEMS YOU ACQUIRE HAVE NO MONETARY VALUE AND CANNOT BE REDEEMED FOR CASH. NO REFUNDS WILL BE MADE FOR THE PURCHASE OF RIOT POINTS OR FOR VIRTUAL ITEMS OBTAINED USING RIOT POINTS.
