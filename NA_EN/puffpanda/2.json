At the time I did it, I thought I would be able to make the same ranked team at a later time. However, I googled around and found that \"WHAT HAPPENS TO DISBANDED TEAMS?\" -> \"If the team was ranked: The team will never be fully deleted. No one can ever use the name or tag.\" BUT I also saw that, \"Please note: Ranked teams that have been disbanded will never be deleted through an automatic system. However, we will mass delete disbanded teams that have been disbanded for more than 90 days.\"\r\n\r\nI really like our team name. So even if I wait 90 days, I would not be able to get our \"team name/tag\" back? Is there any way to get the name back at all?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-13T03:13:10.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recommend reaching out to our specialists in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) about this since I'm unable to find any immediate information regarding this.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
