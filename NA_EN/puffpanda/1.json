After one of the my games today, I randomly got a gift of a Kayle champion from Riot. I remember reading about the 10-Year Gifts a few days ago, but I thought they weren't supposed to be distributed until later? Just trying to figure out where the Champ gift came from! If anyone is in the situation or knows what's going on, please let me know lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-14T23:02:46.646+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Zombiemaster* is correct. Since there are millions of players who are getting these gifts, we have to distribute it in a specific way in an effort to get it out correctly. It would be pretty awkward to get gifted Riot Kayle without owning Kayle first.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"puffpanda","date":"2016-09-15T02:03:56.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for responding!

They are gifting Kayle to anyone who doesn't own the champion first, and then they will begin gifting Riot Kayle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yiim Yames","date":"2016-09-18T17:19:23.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick question!!!! To those of us who already owned Kayle and Riot Kayle. Will we be notified when we receive our mystery skin/or RP? I already got the summ icon but have not got my skin. Just wondering and making sure that I was not forgotten. Thanks!","replies":[]}]}
