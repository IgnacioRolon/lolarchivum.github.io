First, I got like 350 orange essence, ok awesome. Then the next thing that showed up was \"Omega Squad Teemo.\" BUT, it did a wierd thing. It didn't post to my \"skin shards collection area.\" Instead, it was just gone completely after I pressed ok. Then on the top right of my client under my username it had a little popup that said \"Omega Squad Teemo has been added to your inventory.\" Cool...except when I went back to the RP store, it says I do not own the OS Teemo skin. Not cool. And I even tested it out on a game, I \"do not own the skin\" and was not able to select it.\n\nI've opened a dozen of chests but this is the first time something went missing. Can anyone give me insight? Furthermore, is this even trackable? I'm not sure if I should open a support ticket because I'm not even sure where this would fall under?\n\nEDIT: I've also restarted my client but to no avail.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T17:57:56.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking into this, it looks like you unlocked the Omega Squad Teemo Icon.  This is the Summoner Icon and not the skin.  It was redeemed from a champion mastery chest that was unlocked yesterday that included the icon as well as 150 orange essences.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"puffpanda","date":"2016-10-13T01:49:08.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the clear up! (I've never gotten an icon or knew you could get one from the chests so I assumed it was a skin).","replies":[]}]}]}
