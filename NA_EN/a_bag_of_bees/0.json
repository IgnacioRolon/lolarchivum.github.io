It gets really annoying because after the game the end result screen (and honor system) takes forever to load. It's not a huge issue but I thought if there was a fix out there it'd be nice to have it.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a game or after leaving a custom or ending spectate mode, instead of being greeted by the regular-sized client screen, I just see my desktop or whatever's in the background (in the case of this screenshot, it is the help/support boards) and just the smallest bit of the top left corner of the client.\r\n\r\nSeems to be a rare-ish case as most of my friends don't seem to have this problem, nor have they heard of it. Just thought I'd put this out here. Maybe I should have made this post when it first happened but I kinda hoped it would fix itself on its own. And also I was lazy.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-13T03:34:46.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This can happen every once and awhile if your game configuration files go a little wonky.

Is there some way around this? Or should I just adjust to a different resolution?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-14T20:14:12.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man that one res just doesn't wanna work now does it. I talked to some of my tech guys, and they mentioned that an out of ordinary monitor res might be the problem.
