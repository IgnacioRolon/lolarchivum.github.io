Many people I've worked with come from all sorts of backgrounds and more impressively to me, some directly out of high school that just had that knack to quickly acquire, learn, and expand. \n\nSo for learning, I agree with Lonewingy, I would definitely suggest going to websites for tutorials because loads exist, and wonderful free tools to get personal experience. Blender would be a great tool to practice modeling and animation with. And It's free. \n\nAfter that, the next important thing is experience. Now it's preferred to be in a studio with a launched title under your belt, but just getting experience in general so you understand pipelines and workflow is also good. So get you hands dirty! There are a number of free game engines available that can help you at least get some experience \"working\" on games. UDK, Unity, Gamemaker(2d) have very large communities and documentation. \n\nI'm not saying do or do not go school. For me, I probably wouldn't be able to focus just on my own, so school was a pricey reminder of \"make sure to do your homework\". It's important if you need guidance, and if you want a degree. I just want you to be aware, as many of my alumni did not understand, that said degree will not guarantee anything except that you've endured college enough to get a diploma :).","replies":[]},{"poster":"lonewingy","date":"2014-09-10T23:30:57.215+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to my fellow rioter, 3D animation and modeling are different paths.\nBefore you pick one or decide which one you like... explore what you wanted to specialize first, you can do this by trying out 3D animation and modeling software to get your feet wet, these websites are actually a good starting point to learn and get critiques as well as a lot of great resources such as tutorials.

In that case, I'm hoping that most of your focus will be on the soldiers, so that's where I put the most effort.

It's Abaddon, a demon who controls legions of locusts like a maestro.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Aj9H-Vc_g\n\n\nNow I'm not saying you should turn Azir into a badass demon maestro...sadly. But look at the design of Abaddon's movements. He isn't even a part of the fight, yet he makes different flashy motions based on the formation her wants his locusts to fly in. This looks completely awesome despite how needless his maetro arm-waving really is.\n\n\nSo how about this? Azir's \"auto-attack\" when controlling minions should be dramatic and maetro-like. But more importantly**, his arm waves will change depending on his Attack Speed.** At so and so attack speed, he uses one set of attack animations. But at so and so attack speed, he uses another more epic set of attack animations. And so on! At the lowest attack speed, Azir will look cool and refined. But at max attack speed, Azir is completely caught up in the fervor of battle and really go all out, even moving his entire body with each \"attack\".\n\n\n\n**PS **- you know what this forum needs?

(I did talk about the staff design in an above comment so check that out). Azir is obviously has a lot of hawk or avian themes so I tried to queue off of things that would help him feel birdlike but at the same time regal. One of the big ways we accomplished this was by keeping his motions very conservative. Most of his motions are concise and efficient. A lot of the feeling of stoic power comes from a lack of motion or flourish. \n\nOn top of feeling regal and powerful, I also wanted him to also feel birdlike. To accomplish this, I tried as much as possible to give his cloth \"feathers\" the feeling of wings. This meant hand shaping them in every animation. I also wanted him to feel light and agile as if at any moment he could catch a gust of wind and lift off the ground.

Azir has so many assets, Azir/Soldiers/ult soldiers/sun disk, so I really had to prioritize where I'd get the most bang for the buck.
