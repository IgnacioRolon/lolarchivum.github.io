Whether you're interested in Kalista's gameplay, story or art, ask away and we'll be happy to answer! \r\n\r\nCheck out [Kalista's reveal](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/champion-reveal/kalista-spear-vengeance-revealed) if you'd like to get up to speed.","replies":[{"poster":"Tact","date":"2014-11-11T18:58:05.143+0000","up_votes":136,"down_votes":10,"body":"I have prepared a bunch of questions for the Kalista team! Without further ado, here we go.\n\nGameplay Questions:\n1. What was the thought behind Kalista's passive? Was it inspired by orbwalking (moving right after each autoattack fires so you can remain on the move while attacking)? I feel like it's a great learning tool for people who want to learn to play more Marksmen.\n2. Also about her passive, why is there the need to specify that her autoattacks will miss if she loses sight of her target? Is she simply not as accurate as other Marksmen who have homing projectiles?\n3. When Kalista is using the Black Spear on her intended Oathsworn ally, what does it look like from that ally's point of view? Do they get any special notification (on top of the particles) that Kalista wants to bind them?\n4. In internal testing, has there been much success in cases where Kalista binds an ally other than her support?\n5. Is there any concern that Kalista's Rend (E) might be a bit strong in helping her jungler secure Dragon/Baron? I understand Kalista's supposed to be a very support-y Marksman, but this might not be part of that intent.\n\nGameplay/Art Questions:\n1. What steps did the art team take to differentiate Kalista's poses and animations from those of League's other spear-throwing lady, Nidalee?\n\nLore Questions:\n1. When she was still alive, did Kalista favor spears as her weapon of choice? (Is her case similar to Thresh, who was known for his chains in life?)\n2. What/who are the souls Kalista uses for her Sentinel (W) ability? Are they souls she claimed with the Black Spear after fulfilling their pacts?\n3. Does Kalista harbor any genuine sympathy for those who were betrayed, or is her vision clouded by her need for vengeance?\n4. It seems like it would be kind of hard for Kalista to have many friends in this state. Would she just gravitate towards people who she felt were wronged?\n5. Is the Black Spear the very weapon that was used to kill Kalista? (Feel free not to answer this one. You said it was a touchy subject. Pleasedon'tkillme.)\n\nSorry for the wall of questions, but thanks for your time and I hope you get to answer these!","replies":[{"poster":"CertainlyT","date":"2014-11-11T20:04:03.075+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'll answer a few here. Great questions though.\n\n> 1. What was the thought behind Kalista's passive? Was it inspired by orbwalking (moving right after each autoattack fires so you can remain on the move while attacking)? I feel like it's a great learning tool for people who want to learn to play more Marksmen.\n\nThe inspiration was actually just this -- thinking about how many players never progress toward orb walking (moving between attacks). I thought about an input paradigm that would be similar in some important regard, either cadence or button use. In the end, it ended up here, very similar in terms of button presses, but very different in terms of timing.\n\n> 2. Also about her passive, why is there the need to specify that her autoattacks will miss if she loses sight of her target? Is she simply not as accurate as other Marksmen who have homing projectiles?\n\nI've always felt that projectiles ridiculously bending in mid air is a thematic mismatch. In Kalista's case, we faced an additional problem: the server canceling her basic attacks (due to loss of vision) is jarring, since you end up not moving afterward. \n\n> 4. In internal testing, has there been much success in cases where Kalista binds an ally other than her support?\n\nSure. Playtesters have primarily bound with a lane partner, but a few Rioters swear by jungler binding. I would be unhappy if she felt like there was only one player with whom she could bind each game, and that player was distant from her throughout much of the game.\n\n> 5. Is there any concern that Kalista's Rend (E) might be a bit strong in helping her jungler secure Dragon/Baron? I understand Kalista's supposed to be a very support-y Marksman, but this might not be part of that intent.\n\nWe are watching this closely. It's a risky mechanic to say the least. Specifically, we are concerned that it will discourage enemy contestation objectives, rather than changing how enemies contest them. Ideally we observe Kalista's opponents making more of an effort to do Dragon/Baron before her or choosing to team fight rather than go for the steal.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chicken The Cat","date":"2014-11-11T19:02:46.342+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"How do you think she will affect LCS play?","replies":[{"poster":"CertainlyT","date":"2014-11-11T21:53:40.026+0000","up_votes":100,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think Doublelift will declare her to be terrible and then end up playing her for most of the split.\n\nNot sure how she'll impact the rest of LCS.

We really wanted to make sure Kalista strikes a substantially different chord when it comes to visual style, both among female ADCs & in general. \n\nEarly in development our goal was to create a shape language for a non-standardized female archetype (the fallen spectral warrior) that really told a story. For example, her spear visuals (specifically on her back) help hint at what has happened to her. Plus its an awesome way to implement a thematic ammo delivery system - she's got a hell of a lot of tortured soul spears to toss at her enemies.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KimTheNukeJongUn","date":"2014-11-11T19:03:29.690+0000","up_votes":89,"down_votes":7,"body":"How did Kalista get those spears stuck in her back?\n\nEdit: Guys it's really weird, a few hours after I asked this question this really odd smoke showed up in my hou-","replies":[{"poster":"SerBlaise","date":"2014-11-11T19:04:14.650+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":4,"body":"YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO ASK THAT!!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"LemonSnax","date":"2014-11-11T19:16:12.403+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":4,"body":"Carefully...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Moobeat","date":"2014-11-11T19:14:46.350+0000","up_votes":83,"down_votes":4,"body":"On a scale of 1 to Azir, how buggy has Kalista been given her new mechanics?
