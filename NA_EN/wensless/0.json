When I get to the login screen, I enter my details and get the message that says that the server is not responding.\r\n\r\nMy internet connection is fine, and the Service Status website says that the server is working normally. I have tried running as administrator but I still get the same result.\r\n\r\nAnyone else having the same problem? Anyone have any tips aside from reinstalling?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-08T22:51:22.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if your internet is fine, it sounds like your network is specifically having issues connecting to the login server.
