Is there a more efficient way to communicate with a support agent to fix my issue. I was given a temporary password and it doesn't work so I can no longer even access my account on the support site. \r\n\r\nI believe the issue started when I changed my email and there was already an account tied to the email. Now both accounts are locked down and I can't log in. Is there anyway to just delete the lesser of my two accounts to see it this will resolve the log in issue. \r\n\r\nIt's very disappointing that a log in issue would not be rectified with in two weeks.\r\n\r\nRiot Please help.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nyodisjo","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-18T23:44:48.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear about the recovery issue, but don't worry we can help!
