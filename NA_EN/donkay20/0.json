Like it's okay to pick up sometips and learn, but be fucking original. You go out of meta in champion select and get called a noob and a troll and then when you do successfully, no one fucking acknowledges you. An lcs player goes out of meta in select and everyone raises an eyebrow, then when they do successfully, they get praised and it's 'new meta'. I'm really getting sick and tired of the stigma. I've played Katarina since S2 and I can say that I can play her top and mid quite well. I've won against most Jax and Xin Zhao picks and that's a pretty good feat if I do say so myself. I mained adc in S4 but it got too tiring to play when they removed executioner's which further confirmed \"status builds\" on adcs like you're only supposed to build one way. Nobody fucking used Revive? Not sure if you took a survey of every single League player and was able to draw that conclusion. Just because it was an unpopular spell, doesn't mean that should be the justification of a removal.
