Yes, people might buy and account and smurf after being banned, BUT, if their honor level drops to 0 or is locked at level 1, they shouldn't even be able to PLAY ranked. That's what this is about. So basically, doesn't matter how many accounts you buy, if you're toxic you lose the privilege of playing ranked.

If you're just an average bloke who doesnt get honored several times a game, you're absolutely, royally, fucked. \n\nSeveral months ago i was chat penalized for a first-time offense. A grand total of 10 games of limited chat back in august i believe. \n\nSince then, i've done my damnedest to try and avoid being the next tyler1, But i'm far from a shining paragon of the human race. I get frusterated, but i avoid taking anger out on fellow teammates. I've been \"Honor Unlocked\" since about a week or two after the flamefest i got penalized for. \n\nTo put into perspective what it was, i had just started jungling but even then i knew an important part of jungling was ganking lanes and helping teammates in fights. When i faced Lucian and Brand jungles, whom never ganked and flamed me for losing in a hard-countered lane.\n\nSo, i got pissed at them for playing poorly and not helping the team, so i flame em. Bad idea, but i was trying to get it through their thick skulls that *we are humans, we dont play perfectly and we need help*\n\n3 months have passed and a new preseason, still honor 1 \"unlocked\". \n\nSince being \"reformed\" is descided by the people you play with, and if they honor you or not, If you're stuck in a low ELO/MMR alongside people who tend to be more inflammatory (i.e mid bronze), you'll never climb OUT of low honor, so any 2nd offense is an instant demote to dishonorable.\n\n2 minor penalties would screw you out of ranked. Minor penalties of which can be chalked up to human nature just being flawed.\n\nSo, let me just say that your idea should only work on people who have committed frequent and serious acts of toxicity, not just anyone labled dishonorable. Getting your 2nd and 3rd strikes get easier and easier as riot watches you more closely, trust me i've seen it happen myself.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2017-11-14T23:46:42.322+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"A few things.

The games all my fault because I'm not playing a meta champ. Therefore I'm trolling, deserve a report, deserve to be stuck at honor 0, and according to a lot of people in this thread, deserve to be banned from ranked games.\n\nAnd all those people who played lulu top? or Ziggs botlane? or Lucian Mid? Ezreal or twitch jungle? Or Brand/ Annie Support?\n\nI really really really really REALLY don't understand how people still get upset in this game when somebody picks something that \"isn't meta\".

I think there'd be a different mentality if not only did you lose your free rewards, but you also couldn't even play in ranked until you've at least \"proven\" to have reformed. You know what I mean? I know I was pissed that I lost my honor level from getting chat restricted, but do you know how _livid_ I would have been to realize I couldn't play my decay games and I was going to demote _because I was being a whiny little bitch one game_? You know how careful I would be? Getting a ward skin is cool I guess, getting random chests or whatever is cool I guess, but not being able to play the game mode that shows how \"good\" I am in ranked and progress there?
