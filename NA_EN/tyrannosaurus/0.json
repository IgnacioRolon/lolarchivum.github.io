The game seems to work just fine, except for seemingly no reason it doesn't sometimes. [Screenshot of what happens when I can't connect.](https://i.gyazo.com/c27d222a0a6e04e6ed210b9b79a4dc46.png) Nothing unusual. The \"League of Legends\" logo is always at the top of the screen and after a moment the pop-up window appears beneath the logo. I tried disabling my firewall and other programs to no avail. Sometimes it manages to connect after a few minutes, sometimes never.\n\nInfo:\n- The game worked fine yesterday, and has for one year+. \n- Happens to me on both EUW and EUNE.\n- Repairing the files seems to make no difference.\n- The Client works like usual, and I'm able to talk to players, even while failing to connect to a game.\n- It first happened in a solo ranked game, I was unable to connect until at least 2:40. No issues after that, I ended up winning.\n- Thinking the problem resolved itself I queued up but was unable to connect, ended with a remake, and as soon as the remake happened I was sent into the endgame lobby with the rest of the players, I was able to talk with them.\n\nInfo from custom game(always solo) tests in order:\nGoing into a custom game alone as Shadow Evelynn worked 3/3 times.\nGoing into a custom game alone as Classic Darius worked 1/1 times.\nGoing into a custom game alone as Classic Darius with a Chroma worked 1/3 times.\nGoing into a custom game alone as Mordekaiser worked 0/1 times.\nGoing into a custom game alone as Pentakill Mordekaiser worked 1/1 times.\n\nGame settings:\nVideo: 1920x1080. Colorblind mode, Relative team colors and character inking on. FPS Cap: 144, all graphics settings set to very high, but Shadows are off.\nSound: Sound is on.\n\n\nI just want to know a few things:\n\n* Is it a problem on my end, and if so, how do I fix it.\n\n* How do I prevent this from happening again?\n\n\nEDIT: Just tried to play the overcharge game mode. Didn't work until 01:00. Then it worked perfectly.\n\nEDIT as of 10 hours later: The problem still persists.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-27T22:01:00.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like the main problem isn't exactly an overall connection problem, but more specifically a problem only when your network is connecting to the game servers. Try updating your port forward and DNS settings really quickly using those two steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), and if that doesn't help you could test out using a VPN as well to see if that helps any better. \n\nLet me know what works or doesn't, and we can try a couple more things if needed!","replies":[{"poster":"TYRANNOSAURUS","date":"2017-11-28T13:24:23.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ran the Hextech Repair Tool and it seemed to have solved the issues.
