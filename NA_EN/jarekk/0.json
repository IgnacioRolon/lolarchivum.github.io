I am going around the internet and asking groups or communities that I frequently interact with to answer one question in as much detail as they can or would like to:\r\n\r\nWhat does Curiosity mean to you?\r\n\r\nBy this I mean, what do you think Curiosity is?  Is it good/bad/other?  Where does it come from?  How does it affect your life?  In school is your Curiosity stifled?  Bolstered?  Is questioning things good/bad?  When is it good?  When is it bad?\r\n\r\nI would like to know anything and everything you have to say about the topic, essentially.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure how the new boards here work - I haven't been here since the move - but I hope this doesn't get moved to an Off-Topic forum too quickly, since GD is likely still the most populated.\r\n\r\nThank you to everyone who comments.  Your feedback is sincerely appreciated.  If people like, I will make the paper public after I have finished with it and you can read what your insights have helped write.","replies":[]}
