I remember that a Rioter noticed the suggestion and mentioned that it would be an interesting way to use her otherwise-empty resource bar. Like I said, this was a long time ago, and I haven't seen hide or hair of this change since. I figured I would check up on the idea and see what people's thoughts were today. Do people still think this would be a nice thing to have? Is it entirely necessary for Riven to show her stacks more obviously than on her buff bar? What if you're not playing Riven, but playing alongside/against her? Would it be helpful for you to know this information?\n\n-Tact","replies":[{"poster":"FeralPony","date":"2014-08-02T03:25:40.322+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"We did give this a try and ultimately ended to not do this as it causes a number of consistency issues. It was a while ago and my memory on it is a bit fuzzy since I wasn't working directly on it but iirc what is came down to was the resource bar is fundamentally meant to function as a *resource bar*, doubling up on the buff bar goes against a pretty solid rule of thumb in UI/EX design which is limit special cases in UI and avoid duplication. Breaking consistency here has a huge long term cost that can be difficult to quantify. \n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, the resource bar is meant to be a relatively stable and slowish moving bar showing a characters relative strength, current threat level, and reveal their general flow of attrition (how long it takes to be exhausted). Seeing a champion low on energy or mana means they have limited casts available to them and is a moment of weakness enemies can exploit. In this case for the opponent this bar would be incredibly misleading with Riven being ***most dangerous*** but also ***most vulnerable*** when this bar is empty. With some weird middle ground of when partially full you're most likely being killed. \n\nThe second important gameplay element is that there should have some level of consistency and flow in the resource bar. Rarely do mana or energy users dump their entire bar in one go, while Riven can cause the bar to fill and empty in only a second or two. It can be incredibly tempting to see an open spot on a UI and want to fill it (believe me I've been there, as a mechanics designer I want to cram as much information as I can pretty much everywhere) but there is a steep clarity and readability cost which increases exponentially each time you break. Sometimes this cost can totally be worth it, in this specific case we didn't feel it was. I would love to explore the space of custom UI elements only the player controlling the character can see/interact with though, and this seems like a logical candidate for that.","replies":[{"poster":"3mptylord","date":"2014-08-04T11:00:36.067+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that pretty much contradicts every non-Mana/Energy use of the secondary resource bar. \n\nBattle Fury, Rage, Ferocity and Heat are not resources; Rumble and Renekton are definitely more likely to kill you when their bars are partially full. Dragon Fury is a resource only used by one ability, but it only really represents a timer (and an inaccurate one, since she can add time while using it). Flow and Iron Man are shields - if Mordekaiser has no shield then it likely means he's currently in a state of being the most dangerous (since his abilities are up) and also most vulnerable. \n\nI digress I don't think Riven is the best person to utilize the resource bar (I think Vlad's Tides of Blood should be given the Battle Fury treatment and have him generate 25 stacks per cast and have it constantly decay) - but if you added some icons that visually tie in with the runes on her sword — so each ability would light up a rune — it would look cool. Make it not look like a resource.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrimsonDivide","date":"2014-08-05T11:29:54.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> From a gameplay perspective, the resource bar is meant to be a relatively stable and slowish moving bar showing a characters relative strength, current threat level, and reveal their general flow of attrition (how long it takes to be exhausted).

Their \"resource\" bar is definitely fast moving not slow moving, and honestly it says nothing about how easily they can kill you or not. \n\nThen you have people that use Rage or other resources, or better yet Rengar that fills his at a stead pace up to 5 then instantly empties it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rafael Merlo","date":"2014-08-04T11:13:03.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@FeralPony\nSorry FeralPony but this position did not convinced me. (Fail to) Control of Riven's passive due to the difficulty of tracking it is exactly the reason why I gave up adding Riven to my champion pool when I was trying to find an AD Caster for me to master. It is really annoying to keep alternating eye saccades* between the buff bars and the down and dirty of a crowded fight that often requires tunnel-vision for her playstyle.\n\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade\n\nBut for your description of this test I believe you did the bar the wrong way. It should work as Renekton or Rengar resource bar, which indeed increases at the uses of skills or (in Renekton's case) attacks, and when full is the moment Riven should be the most dangerous. The bar on a high-CDR Rengar is a rollercoaster; I cannot but frown at your point about \"dumping their entire bar in one go\" as a relevant concern, because this should work similar to Rage and Ferocity, not Mana or Energy.\n{{champion:58}}  & {{champion:107}} \nI do wish for your team to review this; I know that your Diamond 1 testers deem this clarity cost too high but we, not so high Elo players that wish to learn an already-very high skill cap champion, would be throwing money at our screens to pay for this QoF that just separates us of mastering Riven and being better players.\n{{champion:92}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"IonDragonX","date":"2014-08-04T05:31:34.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> We did give this a try and ultimately ended to not do this as it causes a number of consistency issues.
