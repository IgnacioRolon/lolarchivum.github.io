If your fed you can clearly already kill the enemy easily, so the extra damage is really not so helpful.  If your behind the extra ap really won't help stop them from killing you again and again. however ludens is fairly good in both cases, if your ahead, the extra burst is kinda pointless, but the ability to chase more easily as well as being harder to pick both make for very helpful abilities, and when your behind, ludens will make it so that you might be able to escape encroaching death, it also gives you the ability to get back in possibly, depending on when you get it, because of roaming and farming an off lane are both good ways to get back into a game, and the movespeed will help you get around.\n\nyou know what, instead of this argument continuing, I have an idea. for the next couple of games you go ahri, instead of fitting in a deathcap, you fit in a ludens. see where it gets you, and understand ahead of time that you will be doing less damage. think of it like getting a second rylais.\n\nalso, movespeed is probably the most valuable stat in the game, as it is the only stat that is both defense and offense for every champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Ionian","date":"2015-12-31T09:45:59.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is even less of a reason to get ludens if behind. Yeah I'm 0/4 let's spend 3k gold on an item that is mostly damage huehuehuehue.\nDcap is not a lategame item, yeah it scales obviously but due to Ahri's kit if you don't get it as a 2nd item your damage falls off so hard.\nSo what's the build path if ahead? Morello > dcap.\nBecause that's what allows you to 100-0 people. You don't have enough damage for that with ludens.\nAnd when you start getting really fed, enemies will try super hard to shut you down. That's why you get zhonyas or rylais 3rd item, to not throw away your lead. With morello+dcap+ludens you're just a glass cannon, 1 mistake and goodbye.\nAnd if behind? Abyssal/treads/zhonyas/rylais are all an option. Not ludens lol.\nBut do you honestly think I've never tried buying ludens? I've done the morello>ludens build over 100 times even after the nerfs because it intrigued me that the higher elo players kept using it. And guess what, they were mostly failing miserably with it. Yeah movespeed is a fine stat, now do you prefer speeding yourself up or permaslowing the whole enemy team? I think the choice is obvious.\nI'm like one of the lowest elo players in Ahri toplist, yet I still earned a spot there, I think that shows my build is effective.
