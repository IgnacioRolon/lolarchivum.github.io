As you said, even when Trinity Force had AP, it still wasn't a very good AD option in most cases. What hybrid items can we choose from now? Just Rageblade and Gunblade, both of which are generally far less effective than alternatives or only fit one particular build or champion (on an ADC).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mecha KhaZix","date":"2016-01-29T03:03:25.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">AD champs are sometimes given AP ratios to support off builds\n\nSo every time I get reported for playing AP Lucian I can say \"But Rito wants me to be able to play AP Lucian!\"?","replies":[{"poster":"hh the thinker","date":"2016-01-29T03:06:14.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mecha KhaZix,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E8BsxpH3,comment-id=00010002,timestamp=2016-01-29T03:03:25.214+0000)\n>\n> So every time I get reported for playing AP Lucian I can say \"But Rito wants me to be able to play AP Lucian!\"?\n\nit's more that you can say it's not breaking any rules. riot doesn't want you to play ap lucian, but they allow it, just as they allow ad lucian (they try not to force a meta, and they try to allow for off builds). they leave the choice up to you, as long as you aren't actually trying to ruin anyone's game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2016-01-29T02:43:00.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is off topic and is targeted @Poppy\n\nWhat are thoughts on giving poppy's passive an ap ratio?
