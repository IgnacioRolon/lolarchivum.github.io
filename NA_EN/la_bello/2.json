That'd throw out the only good ability in her kit that gives her some safety.\n\nHer ult is a Support ability. It doesn't mean she has enough damage to kill an assassin during the ult. A Zed could take care of her if she isn't full build because Full Build Kayle is the only thing that can be a threat. She's pretty bad until late game as i said.\n\nYou can make a ton of items to counter her. {{item:3001}} and she'll basically be giving you mana{{item:3194}}  and even {{item:3110}}  to reduce her attack speed.

They're still autoattacks, which means they do 100% of AD as physical damage to her target. They just happen to also do 60+0.3x AP magic damage on hit, travel instantly, and proc spell effects in addition to on-hit effects. Hell, AD Kayle does *more* damage than AP Kayle - it's just that she loses most her W's utility to get it. Her Q scales with AD (at pretty much exactly the same rate, once you factor in the gold efficiency differences), and her E has similar scaling on the splash damage (although AP does pull ahead at VERY high amounts).\n\nWith the addition of Essence Reaver and Adaptive Helm, there are pretty much zero reasons to run AP Kayle these days. Adaptive Helm doesn't affect AA damage, which is where AD Kayle's DPS comes from, and Essence Reaver grants mana and the CDR that she normally gets from Nashor's.\n\nAs for attack speed slows hurting her... yes, that's true, but they hurt *every* AA-based champion. That's sort of like saying that armor hurts ADCs, or health makes it hard to burst people. Kayle is hard to counterbuild because she has built-in shred and does a decent amount of mixed damage even in an AD heavy build.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2017-09-10T06:42:51.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have never, ever seen a strong AD Kayle.
