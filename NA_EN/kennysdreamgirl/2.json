Battlerite has no items, lanes/roaming/pathing, only having 1 map objective in comparison to League's various structure and jungle objectives, not really having snowball etc, it's a straight up arena brawler, and so they require different skills, with some overlap with League. If you find Battlerite more fun, no reason to stop, just keep playing what you enjoy.

But I won't call people to get fired, that'd be mean. I'll just hope they finally learn what champ design actually mean, instead of just dumping out clearly unbalanceable horseshit and throw it to others to deal with it. And I haven't even stared on just how often CT borderline plagiarise their colleagues to make their stuff, but whatever), otherwise I'm personally still enjoying League or at least still onboard.
