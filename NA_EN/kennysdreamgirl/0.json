Not a dumb question.  Our playtest lead bros mentioned what they were looking for in their last Reddit call out for applicants: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5yoq2d/serious_playtesters_wanted_again/)\n\nYou can also check our https://www.riotgames.com/careers page for openings. Currently there's no Playtester spot that I see open, but I talked to their lead and he hinted that they may be looking for people soon.  \n\nDon't think there's a simple answer on how to get onto the balance team. We're mostly comprised of QA and Designers, but we're growing to include other disciplines like Engineering, VFX, SFX, and animation.  So you have to pick your route accordingly.  One of our QA came from the Playtest team.  Two of our designers were previously interns on the team. 3 others were previously QA on other teams.","replies":[{"poster":"KennysDreamGirl","date":"2017-10-03T03:17:09.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would love to be a play tester as I love league..Idk if I could do it thought since I'm just a 19 year old kid (and hard stuck gold Xd) without any experiance in stuff lile that...I'm not a designer or animater so i couldn't be balance team lol.
