Twice now I have gotten kicked out by the client after Champion Select and it has led to leaverbuster penalties and now demotion. Is it too much to ask for a stable client?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-09T17:32:50.810+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see you're frustrated and I would certainly like to help you out.  If you're getting kicked out of champion select, then you're likely having a connection issue that's leaving you behind.  This can also happen if you're running any third parties that run with League.  Your best bet would be go through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix this up.  I want to add that even if your net might be fine elsewhere, you can still have issues connecting to specific servers.\n\nThe updated client is also still in testing, and you're welcome to use the legacy client for now.  Just keep in mind that a connection issue can result in the same problem regardless of what version you use.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Best Foxx NA","date":"2017-03-09T18:22:15.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sir, respectfully speaking, it's not that I'm getting kicked out of Champion Select. I'm being disconnected from the game after champion select and my computer gives me zero warning of this happening until I see that my team decided to remake. I would request that maybe Riot suspend LeaverBuster punishments from being given out because of this issue. It's bad enough that the game kicks me out with zero warning, but it's a total dick punch to get hit by LeaverBuster too.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I appreciate that you guys have responded to this and I appreciate how much you guys are trying to get this newer client working. I would ask that Riot perhaps warn people about this and recommend to people to use the Legacy client for now, since this really negatively affects ranked games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tootieman13","date":"2017-03-09T18:00:05.645+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I love riot but this is really sad how i am just being foced to sumit with what you guys have done to me.
