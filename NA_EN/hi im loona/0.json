Whenever I attempt to comment or rate something up, I'm met with a note saying I must be \"level 5 to post in boards.\" \n\nWhat is this level? Is it in-game level? I'm level 30, have been for a very long time. Is it just boards experience? How am I supposed to level up in the forums if I can't use them? Please help me out here.\n\nEdit - Upon posting this, my boards profile has gone from _level 2_ to _level 30._\n\nBut I will keep this up.. Is there anything causing this? Is this supposed to happen?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-18T22:47:16.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your account may need to sync to the boards when posting for the first time.  It looks like your post here has sync'd you up, and showing as level 30 now.
