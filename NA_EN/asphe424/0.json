So I was wondering if there was a way to merge my accounts, transferring all of my skins, and champions from the sub account(s) to my main account. Thank you! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-21T02:15:02.883+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the moment, we don't have a way for you to merge accounts in order to combine available champion/skin pools.

I want to play Gnar more, but only on my main account because I do not see a use in playing on the sub account, and earning the mastery points/ IP when I'm only going to play on it once every month at the most","replies":[]},{"poster":"cypriclown","date":"2017-12-01T10:41:09.726+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the past i used to play on my smurf account cause ip had no value for me had everything i could buy with ip on my main so of making a smurf to make value of the time i am investing on the game now i regret that because i don't have enough blue essence to buy the new items in shop nor enough to buy the warwick skin which i might not be able to get enough blue essence in time to buy it.\nthat's my reason for wanting to merge my smurf and main hope it's a good one though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DestroyerCVARKO","date":"2017-11-24T06:54:20.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I moved to the States and have created a new acc so i could play without a lot of ping.
