In this game I got an S+ at the end, and hit mastery 5. After the window telling me I got a hextech chest, it also told me that I got a mastery 6 token. I went to my hextech crafting window to look at it, and it was not there. I thought that it was just loading in, or something and I'd check again the next day. I checked again today and it still wasn't there. I browsed the support forums a bit to see if anyone else had the same problem and I couldn't find any solution. Plz Riot... I wantz my mastery 6 tokenz\r\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Asphe424","date":"2016-08-25T01:40:16.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, both of you for your help. :) I thought the mastery 6 token GUI window came up on my screen but I guess it was not.

In all the excitement of reaching mastery level 5, it's certainly possible to misunderstand the token message that pops up. \n\nI recommend taking a peek at our [Champion Mastery Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide) as well. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-08-23T00:55:21.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mastery 6 tokens are not awarded if you get an S- or better the same game you reach mastery level 5. Tokens are only awarded for games _after_ you reach mastery level 5.
