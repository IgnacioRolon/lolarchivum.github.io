So I was wondering if there was a way to merge my accounts, transferring all of my skins, and champions from the sub account(s) to my main account. Thank you! :)\" and a riot employee responded with \"At the moment, we don't have a way for you to merge accounts in order to combine available champion/skin pools. With that being said, I'm interested in knowing why you're needing this to be done, there might be a way we can work something out to get you where you need to be in the long run!\" (his name is Broporo) and so then I responded with \"I just simply want to play some of the champions/ use some of the skins that I have on my sub accounts on my main. For example, I have Gnar, with Gentleman Gnar on one of my sub accounts. I want to play Gnar more, but only on my main account because I do not see a use in playing on the sub account, and earning the mastery points/ IP when I'm only going to play on it once every month at the most\" After this he had not responded. I just thought that he did not see the post, so I waited a little while. On this day, it has been 15 days since I responded to him, and so I was just wondering if I could get a response from a riot employee. Thank you! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-05T02:37:58.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for having missed your response in the other post!!\n\nWe won't be able to transfer content between two accounts for something like this, as Gnar was willingly bought on the account you chose to buy him on. If this was some kind of mistake or store error, we might be able to figure something out to help, but at this point, you'll have to buy Gnar and the skin for both accounts if you want him on both accounts. Since he's already on one of your accounts though, in the spirit of saving money I'd suggest using him on the account he's on.","replies":[]}]}
