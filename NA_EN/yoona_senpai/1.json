What about it is bothering you?","replies":[{"poster":"Yoona Senpai","date":"2017-12-03T05:20:14.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had 8 beautiful kittens back when I was a kid. We also had a yellow dog that we kept in a cage. One day our neighbor had to borrow the cage so we let the dog out. The very same day, we realized a kitten went missing, then another one, and another one. We as a family, were confused as to where the kittens went and we later figured out that the dog had killed every single one of them. 8 may be a good number to some, but to me it only brings back nightmares and horrific images in my mind. Please!! I'll submit a ticket! Take them away RIOT! I don't want the 8RP!!! I'll do anything! ","replies":[]}]}]}
