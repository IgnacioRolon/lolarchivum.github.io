It always froze, and it said: \"Attempting to Reconnect\". I then went to the technical support page and did literally EVERYTHING there: changed the DNS, reinstalled League, everything. When I opened League again, I was surprised to see that it got stuck after logging in on the \"Authorizing\". It then showed me a whole different technical support page, in which I, once again, tried EVERYTHING. Including reinstalling, again, updating windows, updating Explorer, updating Java, changing (again) the DNS, flushing the old ones and then restarting, like - literally every single possible thing you guys wrote. And then, you said to install Hextech Tool, because most Windows users' problems are being detected there. So I did. And it stopped working as soon as I changed it to \"run as administrator\" when it reached to \"Checking your DNS\". It just popped a message that said it stopped working, and that Windows is looking for a solution. So I came here to look for an answer in other discussions, and apparently, it happened to someone else as well. I tried the \"repair\" option from the installation folder, it forced me to restart my computer, so I did. Still hasn't worked properly. So I reinstalled Hextech Tool, and it still got stuck exactly where it did previously. \r\nI really don't know what else I can do. I literally tried everything. **Please help**.  :(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-21T21:56:04.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm those authorizing errors really sound like some type of weird connection issue. I won't have you go through those guides again since you mentioned having done everything there already. \n\nLet's go ahead and get you a little more in-depth help from our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They'll be able to do a lot more digging than I can here on the boards, so you'll be in good hands there!","replies":[{"poster":"Johncena310","date":"2017-05-22T09:17:05.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I already submitted a ticket, nobody's noticing it...","replies":[]}]}]}
