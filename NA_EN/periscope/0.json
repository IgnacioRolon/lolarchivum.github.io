And the fps at the beginning of the game would oscillate from low to 60(max) constantly. Any other macs experience this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-30T03:59:00.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After this latest patch, you might need to double check for any graphics settings that might have been reset. Go through the steps on our [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#section-mac) paying close attention to the steps on resetting your NVRAM and let me know how it helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2017-07-02T13:37:50.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this has helped, but overall it still seems slower loading up and getting to game speed. It'll be maybe 40s in before I can start moving my champion. I have mostly played bots and aram since noticing this. I've also noticed that the game will sometimes close after the victory screen without me clicking the \"Continue\" button.\n\nI did the steps involving client repair, SMC, NVRAM. I don't think my computer has a setting for graphics control, and I can't remember if I played a full game without sound, but will try when I get home.","replies":[]}]}]}
