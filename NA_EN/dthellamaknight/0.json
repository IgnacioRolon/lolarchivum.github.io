You had several warnings leaving up to this and had your chance. \n\nYou can make a new account if you believe you have truly changed and aren't toxic anymore, but the chances of getting your current account back is pretty much zero.\n\nAlso, this isn't Riot. The boards cant help you at all. You have to submit a support ticket to Riot (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) to attempt to get your account back. There is a sticky on this forum explaining this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-12-19T02:46:37.159+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't Riot, the boards is for other players to talk and discuss stuff. To contact Riot you would use a support ticket.\n\nBut Riot rarely considers appeals for bans that were not applied in error.
