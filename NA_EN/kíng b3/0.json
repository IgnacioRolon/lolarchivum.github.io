But I've been reading about it and apparently the PBE's few-week-long cycles may cause my PBE account to be deactivated. I applied to get on the PBE approximately 9 months ago (if I remember correctly) and only just recently got accepted. If/when I do get my PBE Account deactivated, will I have to wait a long time again to get back on? I'm super excited to start going on PBE but now I'm dreading losing my access. Thanks for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-23T21:12:20.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you've created a PBE account, that account should stay open through the different PBE 'cycles'. I checked up on your PBE status and it looks like you were able to create your account already, but you haven't logged onto it yet. \n\nSo you know for the future, we typically don't deactivate PBE accounts just because you've been in PBE for awhile ^_^!","replies":[]}]}
