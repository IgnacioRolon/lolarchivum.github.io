Syndra? Has to pop the R. Annie? Only useful when she does land the R. Kassadin? His R is his existence. Diana and Akali? Only Gap Closer. Anivia? If she didn't have it, her Q would've needed a buff to be easily landable ages ago. Ori? Isn't that... one of the main reasons she's picked? Fiddle? Wouldn't even scare a Yordle baby. Cho? Well... there goes his tankiness. \n\nAll in all, mages are usually defined by their R's and how their R synergizes with their kit. TF is supposed to be that omnipresent ganking mage, so his ultimate and his kit allows for such.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
