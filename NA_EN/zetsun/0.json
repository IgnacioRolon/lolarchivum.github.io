If possible, extend the time for players to rank up until Riot fixes this situation, and before the season turns.  I'd hate to disconnect almost every ranked game, and not be given a Loss Forgiven.\n\nMy ping rises from 70-2000, initially waiting to reconnect, it then goes to 500 afterwards, and doesn't change until I quit from the game, and attempt to reconnect without the client crashing.  I'm not good with technical issues, but does this concern the DDoS attacks that make the servers unstable?\n\nNote that during this significance, nobody in my household is using the internet.\n\n**Edit**:\nA classification of my prospect:\n\n* I've noticed this strange server behavior started to appear right after Patch 4.17.  (September 30th) \n\n* LogInScreen sometimes places me in a 10-20 second queue.\n\n* My ping temporarily interchanges from 70-80, to now 110-150.\n\n*  From what **I'M** experiencing, ping spikes and crashes seem to be most present around 7-15 minutes in game.  Afterwards, my ping returns back to 110-150.\n\n* My champion is unable to respond to any movements, and pings.  Although in some cases, nearby minions, and champions (excluding mine) are able to move freely, and smoothly.\n\n* The highest ping spikes I am experiencing are up to 2000-13000.\n\n* Regular spikes vary from 300-1100.\n\nUnder these circumstances, League seems to be unsafe to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Agent Koh","date":"2014-10-15T02:17:31.522+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes i cant even play a game anymore. i disconnect 3-5 times a game. its unplayable right now. i just want to come home from school and play league!!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Corteztkiller","date":"2014-10-17T01:34:43.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same i'm losing so many games because i dc under their towers and hand free kills, but there is nothing I can do, it's not even a real dc because i watch myself die","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LOHTIZ","date":"2014-10-15T02:13:23.400+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't even log in...

After everyone reconnects and the game starts, my ping shoots to about 350 (I live on the East Coast so I never have less than 100 ping) and my character icon is solid blue. So I log out and try to rejoin and it takes me 2-3 tries to log in. \n\nMy ping settles at about 110 for 5-10 minutes and then shoots back up to 400.  At that point the enemy ADC was 8-0 and their jungler was like 5-0 so I just AFK'd. \n\nThis game has the absolute worst stability of any game I have played EVER. Period. Ever. \n\nOh, funny side note: I tried to go to the forums to complain about it but they were down as well. LMAO.
