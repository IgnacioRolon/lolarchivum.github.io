I primarily use Arcade 'cause that's what I've used since the skin came out, so the particles feel right. I worked on Sweetheart, and the particles are badass, sooo I may be finding a new favorite Sona skin to use. :o","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-02-10T17:33:30.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since I started playing a lot more Sona in recent times I went from having Arcade Sona which I've had for years to having Guqin, DJ and Silent Night Sona, and I tend to switch between them on the fly. I'll probably end up playing as Sweetheart Sona for a while before I go back to switching, because of just how great it is. \n\nAlso since you worked on this skin, I have to say thank you and thank you to your team for making Sweetheart Sona a reality!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-10T19:05:25.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will play Silent Night Sona, but only if I have a Reindeer Kog'Maw to carol with. :3 \n\nI'm so glad you like her! She's one of my favorite skins I've worked on - the particles are what really make the skin for me.

Double kill in bot lane and Sona just blows a kiss as she heads back to base, almost like she's saying \"thanks for feeding nerds\" :3","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-10T19:24:55.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahaha.
