Annie is a dark, often angry, little demon child. Her eyes are going to be more frowny and slanted to match her personality. Let's not forget that her eye shadow makeup also affects perceived size. Zoe is cheerful, playful, and energetic, of course she's going to have bright big eyes.\n\nEye size conveys the (true) size of the champion and personality traits. Smaller champion _generally_ = proportionally larger eyes to the face. Tristana has bigger eyes than Zoe, but that's because she's supposed to be much smaller than a human child. But when you compare Tristana to Poppy, you see that Poppy's eyes are smaller, even though they are both Yordles. Why? Different personalities. Poppy is more serious than Tristana, so her eyes will be more slanted to convey this.\n\nThere's one more thing to consider. Your image of Hextech Annie is from a vertical angle, while Zoe's is not. That angle will make Hextech Annie's eyes look even smaller than they are. It would also be a fairer comparison to look at the base Annie skin, since skins can often change quite a lot on a champion's face to convey a different mood.\n\nActually, let's compare Annie's base model face (best angle I could find) to that picture of Zoe's:\n[Base Annie skin](http://riot-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/news/January_2013/Annie_Visual_Upgrade/Annie_comic.jpg)\n\nDo you see how much the frown, eye shadow, and eye shape takes away from the size of Annie's eyes? Let's not forget than Zoe is a different person, so she has a different facial bone structure too.\n\nTo sum this all up, Annie's dark personality means very different eyes, the size of a champion (lore-wise) scales with eye size, and your image is not a fair angle for comparison. These factors explain why Annie's eyes are a bit smaller than Zoe's, but that Zoe's eyes are actually perfectly fine and still fit Runeterra.","replies":[{"poster":"TheMoralSupport","date":"2017-11-03T20:51:18.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Annie is a dark, often angry, little demon child.

Zoe is cheerful, playful, and energetic, of course she's going to have bright big eyes.\n\nShape language is really important indeed and trying to express such a forceful personality in a small scale can be really difficult, no doubt.\n\nHowever, I don't really see this as credible argument when it comes to how Riot trying to keep a coherent visual representation throughout the game.\n>You can't compare Annie and Zoe's eye proportions when their personalities are so different.\n\n\n{{champion:497}} and {{champion:157}} share a very similar stature and proportions as well, yet they convey totally different vibes from their body language. Your point kinda still applies here tho as their shape languages differs quite a bit, however I wanted to point out that even though these characters could basically dress up as each other and look identical, they'd still portray totally different personas. They fit in together within the frame that Runeterra has set whilst being very different character-whise, theres no need to draft too far away from the core aesthetic of the game just to carry their personalities across. \n\nImo, the stylistic approach that Riot has taken doesn't suit the typical human child from this universe. They could have reflected Zoe's personality through other means instead of ignoring the context that she would be placed in. Kinda like Yas and Rakan. I also noticed the difference in angle after further inspecting the image, but I used hextech Annie as an example since I'd assume this is how Riot wants to portray a human child nowdays. This also applies to Super galaxy Annies facial proportions ingame.\n\nI feel like I was a bit all over the place in this post, but I wanted to say that altering and accentuating proportions can be really effect to portray emotion as you said, but the problem is that Riot took an entirely new stylistic approach, as i mentioned earlier, that doesn't flow well into their consisting image that they want to push forward. Yordles are out of the question since there isn't a right and wrong when it comes to fictional characters, but since they're humans it isn't reasonable to have one that has normal proportions relative to the context and another regular child (at the surface) that has 3 times her eye size. Nonetheless, I could see this working as a way for Riot to broaden their creative liberty in the future. It's a natural reaction to shun down stuff that's unfamiliar so it will be interesting to see how we will perceive this looking back at it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryusaether","date":"2017-11-04T11:56:22.679+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you gotta consider Annie's model is pretty old.

I compared her to Annie and Jinx, realized she's somewhere between them if you consider her age and I think it's maybe acceptable that she has those traits, considering the base models of those champs are a bit old and seeing the direction Riot is taking when reconsidering them in things like skins or visual updates (not happened yet we never know).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jerry SeinfeId","date":"2017-11-03T16:06:52.166+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not the point (atleast not for me).\n\nThe point is that the style of the model heavily represents the style of Disney Pixar movies, in Overwatch for example that's fine because all of them are.
