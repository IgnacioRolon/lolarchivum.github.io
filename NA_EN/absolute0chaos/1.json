Good luck.\n\nAs someone who plays Vi and Rek'sai a fair bit, I would drop the new Cleaver like it's on fire.  The fact is that for champions who benefit a lot from one or more early brutalizers, the new Cleaver seems outright worse - especially for champs, like Vi, who often build TriForce.","replies":[{"poster":"Hard4Hamsters","date":"2015-04-16T07:00:27.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do agree that some champions would rather have a Brutalizer early to help them snowball, but the new Black Cleaver will be a better choice for countering armor stacking. Brutalizer will always be a better choice for a champion looking to assassinate squishies. That being said, Triforce is also in the category for helping to pop squishier champions. What you build is based on what you are trying to do for your team. If you and your team have decided you are going to dive the carry and that is your one job, Triforce and Brutalizer will be preferred. But if you are looking to be more effective at fighting tanks and other bruisers, Black Cleaver will increase the damage that you and your team will do. And you will still be able to fight squishier champions more effectively due to the Rage passive helping you stick to kiting carries. \n\nThe one thing that I will see being a problem is that Brutalizer as a first item on many champions will be even MORE about snowballing than before. Black Cleaver as an option for your Brutalizer was good for if you wanted to build other items while you sat on Brutalizer for a fair part of the game. Only finishing it into Black Cleaver as a later game item. Now if you build Brutalizer, it is going to be Yomuu's, which is much more of an early game item than BC. It's not a bad item, but it is limiting. On the upside, they can afford to buff Yomuu's now that Brutalizer's build path is more limited.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2015-04-16T04:40:47.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just seems worse than Last whisper now.\n\nAlso I would never build it on Tryndamere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2015-04-16T04:00:54.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bruiser, off tanks.
