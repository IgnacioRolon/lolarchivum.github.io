You are willing to learn other than rant and that is great :D. OK first of all there will be tons of moments of a lane winning while others are losing theirs and this is a normal thing. The main advice I can give is a risky one but requires a bit of sacrifice on your part and that is simply to try and roam mid WHEN YOU CAN (have the lane pushed to assure more time can be spent away). No mater how strong you are its still a game about numbers over all and you will not be able to make much progress without having your other teammates at acceptable strengths. So in summery the best thing you can do is to help them out as much as you can if you feel like they are behind. Sorry if my post was kind of all over the place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-06-10T07:55:06.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"well if your team is like 3/15 after 10 minutes, it looks pretty grim. there is still a chance to come back but generally speaking, the less ahead you are, the more you have to group, and the more ahead you are, the more you have to group to counter enemies grouping.\n\nthis means, in general, after the majority of the team reaching somewhere around level 9, you should start pushing out all lanes and grouping quickly for objectives and rotations.\neven if your team doesnt understand/want to, you should always go and back them up with your power and then quickly push out any lane (doesnt have to be \"yours\") and return to them whenever they go back up to the front.","replies":[{"poster":"BlazinHot6","date":"2015-06-10T17:30:56.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is good advice.  I find a lot of times when your team doesnt have, and more importantly, wont listen to a shot-caller:  Just try to stick with the larger group and babysit them.  Since you are a top laner, initiate the favorable match ups for them and do your damnedest to peel the damage dealers off of your own carries (ADC and APC).  Sometimes give up a kill to one of your teammates(like back off at the last second).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PiVoRx","date":"2015-06-10T17:32:52.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"old lol forums rule:\n\"its only your fault that you lose, dont blame others\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-06-10T17:25:47.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ward, catch out enemies, help other lanes, use teleport for amazing ganks, hand hold and spoon feed your teammates with farm and kills if you need to.\n\nConsider playing a tank/bruiser over an assassin if your teammates are squishy, or something.

If your ahead in your lane then  try to look for opportunities to roam so you can help the other lanes so they can get an advantage.
