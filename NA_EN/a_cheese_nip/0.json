Solo/Duo que. was silver 3. Climbed up to silver 2 promos gaining 17LP every win(not great but not bad)... Silver 2 comes round. I am now gaining 8LP each win, this is bull.

I checked my MMR on OP.GG and it said it was fine at the time i was having the issue. The RP wasnt the case as i had bought some very recently to that lol, you conspiracy theorist you ;D ... I honestly do believe it was because they think i was getting boosted. took a break from Solo/Duo que. playing only Flex. came back after a week. and now im gaining 18LP a win again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-24T02:46:16.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You gain **less LP** for winning matches that matchmaking *expects you to win* and **more LP** for matches that matchmaking *expects you to lose.*\n\nYou can find complete details on how the ranked system works in our [Ranked Play FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ).

Alternatively, if your MMR is significantly higher compared to the average your current tier or division, you will gain more LP and lose less. You may even skip promotion series or advance multiple tiers if your MMR significantly outweighs your league.\n\nSo OP's issue is that he's currently ranked higher than the system believes that he should be. A long win streak should be what he needs to correct his problem!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kheldorin","date":"2016-11-24T09:41:07.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A CHEESE NIP,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=um2i0TJU,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-11-24T01:24:12.627+0000)\n>\n> I am confused.

Try buying $5 and you'll start getting 15-20LP per win. I ain't shitting you. LoL is actually pay to win on the down low.","replies":[]}]}
