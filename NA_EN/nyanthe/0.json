At the moment I am okay in laning (I think) but as soon as I get a champion challenge I panic and just start mashing keys. I am doing some custom just me and a bot games to try and get over the key mashing stage and learn better thoughtful rotations. So far the only champ I feel anywhere near comfortable on is Ryze. But I am trying others in the custom game to see what other ones I like.\n\nDo you play with a friend or sibling? Thats what i do when i wanna practice champ mechanaics. We do a cutom together. No flaming, just gaming.","replies":[{"poster":"Nyanthe","date":"2015-12-21T21:17:21.304+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just found out about a group called The Old Gamers ...

Then they blow the lead doing stupid stuff because i try to save them and we both die. (i never say it in chat but i think it or will complain to a friend near by). My suggestion tho (it is probably said somewhere in the 90+ comments) find friends who you enjoy playing with and just relax and have fun. Playing with randoms is hit or miss.","replies":[]}]}
