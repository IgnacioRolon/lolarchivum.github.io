You're not gaining anything by annoying people with this popup.\n\nI disabled all notifications, so I'm pretty sure this is how it's supposed to be. Just make this like a small notification or remove it or make it optional. It serves no purpose for me, I have no intention to get into the hextech stuff any time soon. I just want to play some games for fun.\n\nRemove the popup! {{champion:202}} ","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-10T23:19:52.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you referencing the Hextech pop window that simply announces that exists and is live?

It seems that the pop-up is tied to the free hextech box you have in your inventory.  As long as the box is in your inventory, the client is told to present the window.  However, you should have gotten a single completed key in order to open that box on the first day.  Did you use that key to open up different box at all?  Or did you never receive more than a fragment?\n\nReply back and let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Ďolan","date":"2016-05-12T13:25:25.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible that I used a key right when the whole thing launched. I don't remember 100%, I probably used a key to rent a champ.\n\nI haven't received anything since then, no matter which type of game I played (ARAM, Blind pick, Coop, URF). I mostly played games vs bots on this account, because I needed to level it up and get all the necessary runes. But I also played a few PvP and ARAM games on it. Didn't get any key for weeks, maybe more.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-12T21:26:31.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Key fragments can sometimes take a while to earn as the odds of you receiving one go down dramatically if you've earned ones in the past.  As long as you are playing match-made modes (one where you enter a queue) and are playing a champion you own (and win), you will have a chance to get key fragments in the future.  Once you get a final fragment to forge a key, open the chest and the pop-up will go away!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ďolan","date":"2016-05-10T23:39:55.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply.\nThat is the problem. I open it every time and it doesn't go away.\n\nIt's making the game also load too slow when I log in, even though my computer is fine for running League on medium settings (i5 with 16GB ram) with UI all animations disabled. This might be on the server-side, though, the client might be waiting for the server to load the hextech contents. So, for a few seconds, I just see a blurred out client, until this popup loads up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ďolan","date":"2016-05-11T01:19:56.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do I remove the popup?
