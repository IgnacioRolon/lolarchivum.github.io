After completion of the channel, I teleported to the minion before minions health depleted. I am not sure what would have happened if the minion lost all its health. Is this a bug or is this deliberate. Normally, teleporting to a minion freezes it in place and stops the health from draining. Any ideas or comments?","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-10-26T21:35:49.626+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont think its a bug, if you teleport to a ward or zz voidling as its about to die it will die but teleport will still go through, only thing that cancels a teleport upon destruction is a tower","replies":[]},{"poster":"theArtifacts","date":"2016-10-27T04:54:00.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not a bug.
