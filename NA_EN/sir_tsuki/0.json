These have come from this now often problem. Everything will run smoothly, from queue, to champ select, and into the loading screen. At that time the blue ring that indicates loading, stops, my loading percentage stays as zero, and everyone's champ border does not show up. I then have to force shutdown and reboot my laptop. Upon returning to the client, it informs me that I have been restored to an older patch, and I have to redownload patch 7.15, and by the time that is finished I can't reconnect to the game I was forced to leave. As I am not the only one who has had this problem, and it has happened multiple times, I've ruled out that my laptop is just a piece of garbage. Please fix this, I'm tired of waiting 20 minutes to start a game and losing LP from remakes.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-29T00:18:32.400+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks that your client keeps going screwy like that, but we should definitely address that before you hop back into any queues and risk getting hit with another penalty.
