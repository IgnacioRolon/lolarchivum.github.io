I've been using the new rooster ward since it came out, I tried switching back to another ward skin and the FPS problems are gone. I've only tried one game like this but everything was perfect. Will try more soon.","replies":[{"poster":"MegaV78G87","date":"2017-01-24T18:11:25.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do not use the rooster ward, but I have had fps drops here and there. Next time it happens I will have to see if anyone else has the rooster ward. I feel like the fps drops lasted as long as the duration of a freshly placed ward before it becomes stealth-ed, but I can not confirm this 100% yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fyrewolf","date":"2017-01-23T17:03:05.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can confirm that the not using the rooster ward has stopped the FPS drop for me. After doing everything on the FPS issues guide, I was still getting FPS drop.

We've had other players mention their FPS issues in-game were also affected by the new *Crest of the Rooster* ward skin.

I get massive fps drops whenever i use that ward skin. Did several games without the skin and didnt had any fps drops. It seems to be the problem. But even so it doesnt always feel \"smooth\".
