My Ping currently sits at 50, while players/friends I know in california are sitting on 50 ping as well, some sitting in the upper 50s. How is it possible? In terms of distance to chicago. I currently sit at about 550~ Miles away from the servers, and santa monica is sitting roughly triple that at 1750 miles. I have another friend who lives in toronto and gets roughly 30 ping, sitting at roughly 450 miles away. I understand that my packets may be taking an unfavorable bounce to different cities, but I don't see how my ping should be even close to california's ping. Whats up with that? Id love to be able to understand whats going on. Ive also confirmed with IRL friends that their ping also hovers 50 same as me.
