To that end, make sure that you run through our [Patcher Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues), and complete the steps there.  Some of them may seem incredibly simple, but it will allow us to rule out some of those root causes.\n\nReply back to me if your still unable to patch at all!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-03-27T02:24:38.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Final Raid Boss!\n\nI won't mince words here, you obviously had a pretty shitty experience, and I want to make sure that this is something we can either resolve, or completely prevent in the future.\n\nGiven that you mentioned that you took some time to perform a full re-install, I wanted to check in to see if this worked!  If so, it actually points to a more specific issue that may be the root cause, and maybe something we can look into further.\n\nFeel free to reply back and let me know!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Excelsior5000","date":"2015-03-26T21:17:32.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"won't even work for me when i uninstall and reinstall. guess i wasted over $200 dollars on a game i can't play","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rhan","date":"2015-03-26T15:38:53.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/J80MQrVL-league-of-legends-downloadupdate-0kbps-fix I hope my forum is usefull. :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blanchimont","date":"2015-03-26T12:55:21.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here.

I AM on my last straw with riot. YOU GUYS NEED TO FIX YOUR CLIENT cause ive had problems in the recent patches and have been penalized for it. Solve my low priority queue if you want me to continue buying Rp, or i boycott.  \n\n\nSINCERALY, \n   A concerned summoner.","replies":[]}]}
