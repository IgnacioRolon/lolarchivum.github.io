SHOW SOME PRIDE!) of all shapes, sizes, colors, genders, credos, nationalities, sexualities, and diets all with a passion for gaming! It doesn't matter what you do, or who you are; if you enjoy gaming and are AT LEAST a little bit weird you have a home here with us. \n\nWe play all games, but our most played games : \n\nLeague of Legends\nStreet Fighter 5\nArk : Survival Evolved\n\nAnd here's a personal promise from me, Bruce : We're going to build this community into a business. I have too much staked in this, unlike most other Teamspeak communities, _**THIS ONE ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE! I guarantee you stability. **_\n\nWith that bullshit out of the way, here's the rules : \n\n1. Positive energy only! - We've fostered a very special place that's ubiquitously a good time, and that won't be allowed to change.\n2. Trolling is okay, cheating isn't. \n3. Fuck with the enemy all you like, being negative and toxic to your fellow Monsters_** won't be tolerated at all.**_\n4. If you're going to be a dick, at least be funny. If you're an asshole and you're not funny, you'll get counter-trolled into oblivion. \n_* We protect each other from people that are just plain dicks. *_\n\nThat's it. >: D \n\nHere's our official event schedule (stuff that gets streamed on Bruce's stream)\n\n**Sunday:** The Cerberus Cup - 2pm (League of Legends tournament)\n**Sunday:** Survival Sundays (DayZ, ARK, 7 Days to die) - 9pm \n**Monday :** ((Open for events))\n**Tuesday :** World of Warcraft Raid Time - 8pm\n**Wednesday:** The Hot *!@# tournament (Free, terrible games - it's a big mess) - 9pm\n**Thursday : ** World of Warcraft Raid Time - 8pm\n**Friday :** Spooky Friday -- Scary game streams 9pm \n**Saturday :** The Kraken Tournament (Street Fighter 5) -- 9pm\n\nAND LEAGUE OF LEGENDS ALL DAY EVERYDAY!\n\n(Also, in case it wasn't clear, [The Kraken Tournaments are our Street Fighter 5 tournaments, and easily the most hype night of the week. >: D ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilNI8cCL8Tk))\n\n(All times are EST)\n\nJoin the Discord find friends for ranked, normals, arams, ascension, URF, tournaments, everything!\nBecome a Monster : [https://discord.gg/DY3at](https://discord.gg/DY3at)\n\nOther relevant links : \n[The McHuge Monsters Association](http://mchugemonsters.com) (currently being renovated)\n[Twitch.tv/BRUCE_McHUGE](http://Twitch.tv/BRUCE_McHUGE)\n[The Monsters Hype Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCJV0puVY0w#t=0.781)\n[The Monsters Twitter](https://twitter.com/BruceMcHuge)\n[The Monsters on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bruce.mchuge)\n\n....
