Which also by the way, is a COPIED idea. Here let me provide to you what I mean\r\n\r\nAny and everyone that cares to find the truth behind Yasuo&#039;s supposed &quot;original concept&quot;, search up Vagabond, Manga or Vagabond Musashi Miyamoto\r\n\r\nNow, in this manga, which has sold 50+ million copies worldwide, ridiculously successful thus why riot hasn&#039;t been called out on it, the creator already made bank, and riot is insignificant in the face of true content creators. This manga stars Musashi Miyamoto who at an early age of 13 &quot;was a wanderer&quot; and was without his parent or &quot;guardian&quot; now &quot;out of luck without a job&quot;. See this pattern? Let&#039;s continue.\r\n\r\nIn his case, which is the 1% riot did original is that he is no nonsense wind user, but he was a &quot;samurai looking wanderer at first. Which slowly grew into a Ronin, a rogue masterless, note MASTERLESS!!!, samurai. See? Copied entirely.\r\n\r\nThe Vagabond was an original tribute and Chanbara to Musashi Miyamoto&#039;s accounts of life, all fictional but historically accurate within the manga. \r\n\r\nNotice how very much copied and copyright lacking Riot is? How very sneaky, falsely correct and corrupted they are? I&#039;ll leave the rest to the esteemed community.","replies":[{"poster":"ReshiKillim","date":"2016-07-25T06:20:20.991+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just want to point out that Miyamato Musashi was a real person, who was famed for DUEL WIELDING.

He knew exactly what he was doing. You see his opponent was an expert with the nodachi which had a large reach advantage on the usual katana also usually sturdier made. He also knew his opponent was known for fits of anger. So he arrived law to piss his opponent off and make him sloppy. Then fought with either an oar or just a longer than usual bokken (wooden practice sword) depending on the version you like. To get rid of the reach advantage and durability issue. \n\nThe fight lasted a very long time with Kojiro almost winning several times. Until the sun set and Musashi used it at his back to blind Kojiro so he could get an advantage and win. It's thought of all Musashi's opponents Kojiro was probably the only one of equal or maybe even greater skill to Musashi himself. But Musashi was underhanded and smarter and that was why he is remembered. \n\nOf course, I would be amiss to say that the duel itself along with most of the stories of Musashi's life are only known because Musashi wrote them down in books about how great he was. They certainly spread his fame and prestige and he certainly was an accomplished duelist. But a lot of the details are probably exaggerated.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YumScrumptious96","date":"2016-07-25T06:49:01.439+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol just what I like to see, a weeb who gets angry over nothing and makes things up. Yasuo is a champion based off real life swordsman Musashi Miyamoto, a famed Japanese ronin during the later Sengoku period. Yasuo however isn't a straight up copy, he doesn't dual wield his weapons, meaning not using more than one at once, nor does he carry any other blade with him. He uses the damn wind as his weapon, like how far do you need to stretch it to make yourself seem credible? Yasuo was not a wanderer at the age of 12, he left during the Noxus-Ionia conflict, which happened recently lore-wise and he is definitely not a teenager. It never stated he was without parent or guardian early on, anywhere, nor out of luck without a job. Yasuo can't be a ronin (Which means you are a SAMURAI without a leader, being ronin doesn't disqualify you from being a samurai always)  as he is not a masterless Samurai, ultimately he serves his homeland currently looking for a killer albeit against his town/village's will as they think he is a traitor, that does not make him a ronin just because he's thought a traitor, so was Saigo Takamori, dubbed the \"Last Samurai.\" Since you think Yasuo is a copy of Miyamoto manga or whatever the fuck that is, how can the manga not be a copy of Miyamoto since they never got his express permission, huh? You ever think they just based some of his character off of the actual famous swordsman and not some anime shit. His core concept is maybe 15% of that general likeness, samurai, famed swordsman, duelist.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldyRey","date":"2016-07-25T06:50:17.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"DEAR GOD THAT ESSAY!
