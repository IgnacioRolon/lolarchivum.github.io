I ended up asking what his problem was, and come to find out that they were a \"4 man\" and that I would be reported after the game by all four of them. This was after being told to Kill myself and banning out my champion for absolutely 0 reason other than my name. Here is them saying I will be reported because they are a four man when I was flamed. Behavior like this actually kills my mood completely and makes me not want to play.

It's just really upsetting.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-15T22:17:17.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep those screenshots and shoot them over to our Player Behavior team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!
