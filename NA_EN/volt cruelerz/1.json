Could you comment on what roles these champions will fill (at least the ones that are far enough along that it&#039;s actually been decided)?  So something like &quot;We&#039;re currently working on a mage, a fighter, and a tank.  The others aren&#039;t far enough along yet to say.&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-04-21T01:24:04.655+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"What roles upcoming champions are is something we want to leave to the initial champion teaser/reveal, since role's a key part of a champion's identity. \n\nAt any point in time we aim to have a wide range of roles under development so that we can mix up the different roles being released. Role is one of the things that's usually locked down really early in a champion's development (with occasional changes if a new direction shows a lot of promise). 2014, by release order, had a mage, tank support, fighter/tank, mage, marksman, fighter and that's the sort of variety we'll be aiming for this year as well.","replies":[{"poster":"kayakninja","date":"2015-04-21T01:37:43.230+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since I was curious, figure other people may be too.
