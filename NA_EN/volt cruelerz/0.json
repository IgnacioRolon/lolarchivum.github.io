I adore the Q change.  Q farming is better than it's ever been.  The R change (as I've pointed out on the PBE forums) I believe was due to mistaking what appears to be a bug for Veigar's innate power.  The W change is...  well... kinda pointless, really, based on how Veigar is played in practice, but okay, whatever; we'll take it.  It's just the E that has everyone up in arms.\n\nAs you pointed out originally (and I think many people glossed over/forgot on account of rage-induced amnesia), Veigar was in a state that if he ever became popular, he'd have to have the tar nerfed out of him until a rework came on account of his E which is up there with even the most powerful ultimates.  I agree his classic E is bad (see footnote 1) for the game.  What I do not understand is what caused this.  Veigar didn't suddenly become popular.  To my knowledge at least, Veigar didn't become a popular pick in the pro scene (though admittedly, I only watch casually, so perhaps I'm wrong).  Given his lack of popularity, Veigar ought to have been low on the priority list to fix since while his E definitely had problems, he wasn't picked frequently enough to actually cause much of a larger nuisance.\n\nWhat piece of straw broke the camel's back?  Did you do some analysis of Veigar mains and find that 90% of their games basically had them toxically stunning/instagibbing people or something?  Did the other things in your work queue lose priority or something?  Was this just a freak thing that got through since it was chalked up to \"easy solution?\"  Was this really all just a byproduct of removing DFG and fearing that the Q change would make him popular?\n\nSo far, your posts on the subjects have made it sound like the last of the above.  This has made me curious.  You see, a lot of players (as I'm sure you've noticed), including myself, have been upset by the change that we believe invalidates what Veigar is.  Veigar is a burst mage that previously could 1v1 a squishy.  Now, that's not really much of an option.  Between the removal of DFG (see footnote 2) and the grave difficulty of hitting his new stun (see footnote 3), I see the changes having a very net negative impact on him.  I play a lot of Veigar.  I used to main him actually and while I don't play him that much anymore, I do still play him a lot.  I just don't understand why you'd allow a champion with so many strategic counters (see footnote 4) to be given such a major tactical one as well.\n\nVeigar getting more AP via Q is great.  Everyone loves that.  Yes, there's a valid argument that it's now worse against mobile champions, but overall I'd call it a buff and a major QoL improvement (though I will admit it makes keeping up in poke difficult).  But just because he has more AP doesn't mean he'll actually be more useful.  A large chunk of his damage, particularly during laning, is focused in his W.  If he can't hit that, he can't get a kill.  It's just not going to happen.  In practice, E and W were basically one ability (W being effectively worthless in 1v1 situations unless you'd previously stunned them so it would hit).\n\nWithout the assurance that E will hit now (refer again to footnote 3), W has basically been rendered useless in lane, barring a gank.  Veigar, a classic 1v1 mage, can no longer effectively 1v1 provided he is facing a competent opponent.  I just can't understand why adding a delay to his E was what was considered the best option.  You've indicated that you're confident that this is the right route to take, even if 0.75 is too much of a delay.  Why?  I don't think I've seen that explained and I'm genuinely wondering what your reasoning is.  I'm sure you have something.  Is this just a temporary band-aid until W and E get proper reworks some time down the line?  Is this here to stay?  Something else?\n\nFrom my perspective, it looks like this is meant to be a permanent fix to remove the toxicity that was his old E.  If that's the case though, why did the change implemented have to run the risk of invalidating W?  Why wasn't W changed to make it usable without E or something?  There have been tons of ideas thrown around the forums ever since the Veigar changes were announced and IMO, many of them solve the issue better than a simple delay.  I just don't understand why so much tactical counterplay was added to him without at least removing some of the strategic counterplay against him.  At this point, it just feels like he lost nearly all 1v1 kill potential against competent opponents and his ability to initiate teamfights, yet gained basically nothing except raw AP that he can't actually put to use.  Again, that's my main concern at this point (please see footnote 3): Veigar seems to have been rendered an AP collector that can't actually do anything productive on account of being too easily countered.\n\n\n**So to summarize: Why was Veigar changed at this point in time and why was he changed in this way?**\n\n-----------------\n\n**Footnote 1 - Event Horizon's Toxicity**: His E allows for unquestionable, unanswerable damage once a player has mastered Event Horizon.  I agree there is no tactical counterplay to be found here.  That said, the argument has been made that Veigar has strategic counterplay in spades and as such does not need the tactical counterplay.  Thus, it has been argued, while it may itself be toxic, on the whole, it does not make Veigar toxic.  I am not, however, advocating that E shouldn't have been changed at all.\n\n**Footnote 2 - DFG's Removal**: It has been said that Veigar's changes would compensate for the removal of DFG.  One of the biggest things about Veigar losing DFG is that he lost something that could have potentially been used to compensate for using his Q to break a Banshee's Veil (see footnote 4).  Not only did he lose damage, the removal of the item also significantly strengthened a strategic counter against him.  While the damage can be compensated by Q farming, the newfound counter is not, to my knowledge, accounted for or compensated for anywhere.  Also, I do not see Item 3285 (it's a Statikk Shiv for mages that gives 120 AP and 7% MS that's on PBE, if you're a community member that hasn't heard of it yet) as doing much to compensate Veigar.\n\n**Footnote 3 - Laning Against Competent Opponents**: As soon as the changes hit PBE, I and a friend that mains Vel'koz who also plays a lot of Veigar hit the test servers to see how it would turn out.  It's worth noting that we've done this matchup before.  I typically stomp him, at least after I get enough AP.  This time was very different.  Despite my play being worlds better than his, he was able to defeat me at every turn with ease.  He never even built boots.  That's how little he cared about my E.  He'd walk out or even if he did magically get trapped in it, he'd just walk away from my W as it was falling.  At the end of the game, I had 5k gold more than he did and 1487 AP, yet I could not 1v1 him to save my life (and I play a lot of Vel'koz, so I know how to dodge his abilities and did the vast majority of the time).  E was changed from useful in 1v1 situations to useless which in turn renders W useless.  Once he got a Banshee's Veil (see footnote 4), nothing I did mattered to him.  To reiterate: with the delay, half of my spells became useless, even without him building movement speed.  Once he built a classic strategic counter to Veigar, I was useless.  It's one thing if he can sometimes dodge it and sometimes not.  But he was dodging the stun upwards of 95% of the time.  That's... not good.  If this were one mere datapoint, that would be one thing.  But I've played games since then.  I overwhelmingly defeat my opponent in terms of CS, but absolutely cannot kill them on my own anymore unless they are remarkably incompetent until after laning phase is over.  Until Veigar gets so fed that he can QR to instagib someone, he's little more than a CS-absorber.\n\n**Footnote 4 - Tactical and Strategic Counters**: It's unquestionable that classic E has no tactical counters.  The thing is though, Veigar has always been held in check by strategic ones.  First and foremost, you can easily counterpick him due to the mechanics of his ultimate.  He can also easily be killed early game as he has not yet spun up.  Unfortunately for the little demented Yordle, there are more than just those two.  Being the archetypal burst mage, he is and has been hard countered by two items: Banshee's Veil, and QSS.  Veigar must rely on getting off his full burst in order to kill someone (now more than before since R's ratio has been nerfed and Q has become a skillshot which has made W's damage a higher percent of his total burst).  BV has always naturally prevented this by blocking at least one of his spells.  QSS on the other hand allows the player to escape E which in practice means escaping W.  Tenacity is similar, but by no means as effective as QSS.  Zhonya's, when combined with either QSS or Tenacity, allows enemies to completely ignore all of his damage.  No other mage is hit nearly as hard as Veigar is in this department.  Even Karthus is less impacted because at least he has other spells aside from his very blockable ult.  Let me be clear: a competent opponent will buy BV against Veigar, thereby forcing him to burn his ult if he wishes to do *any damage whatsoever*.  I cannot understand why Veigar was given additional tactical counters without assisting him with his existing problems with strategic counters (on top of the DFG removal exacerbating a classic strategic weakness).  I feel very strongly at this point that countering Veigar is simply too easy and will result in Veigar's win rate and pick rate both dropping precipitously.\n\n---------------\n\n**Regarding responses from community members**: I genuinely would like a response from the devs on this.

Adding a delay was the best way to preserve what we felt was the core of the skill (lock down an area, at a range that doesn't require Veigar to be completely in the middle of the fight).\n\nAs a general update our initial take is that Veigar's looking too weak after these changes. Options we're looking at include having E stop dashes once the walls are up (people attempting to dash out get stopped and stunned), starting the delay at the start of Veigar's cast time rather than at the end and reducing the delay on W.

It has the huge telegraph, giving opponents an opportunity to react, but just as importantly (perhaps even moreso), it has satisfying synergy with the rest of his kit. On its own, it's merely a pen that keeps people in, but with Disruptor's kit, it can keep entire teams bunched up while Thunder Strike shocks them down, and can guarantee a few seconds of them standing within Static Storm (which in turn prevents opponents from blinking out, and deals more damage the longer enemies stand within it). Even Glimpse, which sends an enemy back to the spot they were standing a few seconds ago, can be used to create predictable enemy movement for more accurate Field placement.\n\nBut on Veigar's kit--and why the huge telegraph has hurt Veigar more than a healthy gameplay change should hurt any champion--the stun's entire purpose was as a very oddly-shaped stun to hold a single enemy in place while you blow the rest of your nukes on them and (hopefully) delete them.\n\nIf Event Horizon is going to be both healthy AND satisfying, Veigar's kit either needs to support it 100% (as opposed to it being as convenient as just about any AoE stun), or it should be replaced with something that carries more synergy with Veigar's kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WolfBV","date":"2015-02-27T05:38:42.675+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the delay starting at the cast time would probably be the nicest one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-02-27T06:03:34.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how long do you think you need to wait before you feel like the dust has settled and you can start testing more changes for veig?

Add an early qss in lane against him and you have yourself a very easy victory.\nBut what if we gank Veigar to help him ? Before his ennemy had to play very safe, despite the fact that Veigar was extremely squishy with no escape, his pressure was that on a gank with a well placed stun, it was often very deadly, or caused a flash minimum. \nNow the Ganker must go in way before Veigar and cc the ennemy at least one second (heavy slow or stun / root) to let him come in range to stun, and again, if the ennemy is free of CC, he will just flash out before the stun hits. And that is of course if this goes well. In reality zed is almost ungankable and will probably kill the jungler, being free from any cc from veigar.\n\nHis Q, which was used not only to farm but also to kill and poke in lane, can now be countered by mobility / dodge or, yes, standing behind minions, at least 2.\nSo now all you have to do to win VS Veigar is to push the lane under tower, his W not doing enough damage to OS minions in early, his Q not being able to poke through the lane, bait his stun if you are a decent player and poke Veigar, him not being able to do anything to counter such poke. (exemple: Orianna shield tanks the only damage source, Q, from Veigar while autos + spells can be dealt with minimal turret aggro).\n\nHis stun was the only thing he was  considered a threat for, now he is just a guy with no mobility, a joke to lane against... \nI miss my Veigar i really do... The game that made us forget stress and enjoy some fun, is now taking my favorite champion and making him obsolete in any lane, even in jungle his stun is just not good enough to gank properly.\n\nI am soooooo desperate to see him buffed, and tweaked for the better this time, if not, well, i don't know, imagine losing your favorite character.. Of course we can still play him, but it is so, sooo much frustrating to no be able to stun anyone, and to be one of the worst laner in League.....\nDamn this is depressing, but it really is..\n\nedit: coming from a Veigar main ranked diamond and being well ranked in the Veigar leaderboard.","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-02-25T21:38:28.562+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may only be a silver scrub, but I've mained veigar for a while 2 yrs ago, dropped him due to me being too much of a scrub, and picked him back up again a few months ago.

Before, Veigar was easily able to use his E to harass and escape ganks, making it safer for him to farm, and lategame, he could just wreck face.

At the highest level, he's no longer played as a burst mage, in C9 Lemonnation's words, [\"He's a stun bot. He brings a stun and that's basically it.\"](http://na.lolesports.com/articles/stop-laughing-lemonnations-support-veigar) He even ended up [playing it in LCS](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/TRLH1/1001040024?gameHash=2e458128cf3104dc&tab=overview) and it's been seeing play in Korea for awhile now. As a support. Because his stun is absolutely ridiculously powerful.\n\nThe way you guys are playing him, as a mid lane pseudo-mage-assassin, is the way Riot wants him to be played, and they frankly need to change the way his E works to do that. While Riot can and should not balance strictly for the competitive level, it still does not make something ok to be played at all levels if it is incredibly abusive at some elos. I've even seen it come up in [one of my games](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1739285452/50522784?tab=overview).\n\nIt was one of the stupidest things I had ever played against.\n\nI like Veigar. I don't play him very often because he doesn't do what I tend to like to do when I play, but he's still fun. That said, I want him to be played in the mid lane, as a burst mage. In order for that to happen he cannot continue to have his current stun and Riot has put a bandaid on it so that he won't be as dumb to play against at the highest levels while they come up with a more permanent solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Ablogqwer","date":"2015-02-25T21:12:18.486+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except...

Just got out of a game where Veigar hit literally nothing on me and my ADC (he ended 6/10) except for ult and ignite, and we died (death recap literally read Primordial Burst: 1800, ignite 100). (to be fair I was TF with no defensive items, but he didn't get the bonus AP damage against Cait) He still has more damage than he needs, especially for a point and click ability.\n\nThe argument that he has \"strategic counterplay in droves so he doesn't need tactical counterplay\" is rather non sequitur. Having one doesn't mean you don't need the other, and an argument that is honestly incredibly dangerous to use.\n\n* What happens if Veigar is last-picked? Which as a niche-pick, probably ought to happen (many characters fall under this category as \"should be last-picked\")\n* Lots of weak early game characters can be ganked early. It's also beneficial to try and gank for your own strong lanes and snowball off of their advantage. The jungler doesn't have infinite time, and has to decide whether they want to gank the enemy hyper-carry or support their own, especially in solo queue. In competitive environments, Veigar should have comps built around him so that his jungler can support him due to the strength of the side lanes.\n* The argument regarding Banshee's Veil is salient, but not nearly as significant as it's made out to be unless Veigar is solo-hunting targets. There are so many ways to break the shield that having a teammate break it for you is not unexpected or uncommon, especially if you have something like Ezreal, Kog'maw, Corki, or any kinda poke champion on your team.\n\n Katarina has tactical and strategic counterplay, but is still first-picked in solo queue all the time. Veigar is meant to be an assassin, particularly against mages. He still does this very well.\n\nHis E is also much more reliable than you guys are advertising it as. The pre-indicator feels kinda wonky at the moment (it feels like you're outside the range when you actually aren't), but it's a quarter second difference between what it was and what it is. It can't be seen in brushes anymore (incredibly annoying to walk near a brush and be stunned for seemingly no reason) and is still very reliable and impactful during teamfights, especially in the jungle. The only real place this change seems to be a significant nerf seems to be during laning phase, which, considering his infinite scaling, is something that should be weak in the first place.\n\nWhile I hesitate to say that Veigar is in a good place right now, he is definitely much less weak than he is portrayed as in this thread, especially since he's so new.","replies":[{"poster":"SantoJoe","date":"2015-02-25T23:43:29.862+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is not anymore a mage-assasin, if you land your R to the enemy mage, he will just press Zhonya's, it was an assasin because he was able to land an instant cc on a mage, and then, ulti him, putting himself in danger also.

If you balance a champ around the idea of \"enemy team won't build defensive items\", what will happen when enemy laner builds a banshee's?, or pick Cleanse? (Every game with Veigar I have had an enemy laner with Cleanse, and sometimes 2 exhaust in enemy team). \n\nVeigar is right now in one of the worst places in lol, by far,you can got dived by every assasin in lane because you don't have instant cc or movility, it has no realiable dmg anymore, he can't trade in lane (Q blocked by minons), W is almost useless if your team doesn't have hard cc (Morgana's Q, etc) and in top of that, he can't offer realiable cc, which is one of the most important aspects of a pure mage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-02-25T22:14:17.711+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"A few things:\n\n1. just like riot should not balance solely because of the woes of certain elo ranks, neither should they balance due to regional woes as well.
