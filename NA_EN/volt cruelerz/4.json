As such, I suggest the following changes.\n\nEssence Reaver\nRecipe: Vampiric Scepter (800) + Hexdrinker (1450) + Forbidden Idol (600) + 350 = 3200\nStats:\n+65 AD\n+15% CDR\n+30 MR\nUNIQUE Passive: Mana Vamp - 30% of physical damage dealt is also dealt to the target&#039;s mana.  10% of physical damage dealt is restored to the user's mana.\n\nThis would give the item a solid slot as an item for AD casters and would also help it function as an anti-mage item.  In addition, it would make building hexdrinker ambiguous as it could now be turned into either Maw or Essence Reaver, depending on need.  Why get this over Maw?  If you are dealing with a sustained mage.  Why get Maw over this?  If you want to survive a burst mage.\n\n\nNote 1: yes, this was inspired by Nilok's thread, but it's different enough that I figured it ought to be its own thread.\n\nNote 2: yes, I'm aware mana burn is traditionally considered toxic in league due to lack of counterplay.  Since this item focuses on being anti-mage, it does little if the attacker is AD, encouraging interdependence between players on a team.  Even without team cohesion though, I imagine Lichbane and Athene's could do a pretty good job countering this version of Essence Reaper.  Since this item doesn't offer a lot of direct strength, all-in-ing is the proper response should your opponent build this in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2015-04-08T07:53:56.322+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> This would give the item a solid slot as an item for AD casters and would also help it function as an anti-mage item. \n\nMana burn isn't anti-mage.\n----------\n\nMana burn has 2 main functions:\n1) convert the mana of a target into bonus on-hit damage.\n2) silence a target when you don't get the bonus on-hit damage.\n\nAs you don't even convert mana to damage, the only useful aspect of mana-burn in this case is appling a 20~40 second silence.\n(If an ability can't silence a champion for 20~40 seconds because that would be broken, an item probably shouldn't.)\n\nWhich is easiest if:\nyour target hasn't purchased any items with mana.\n\n----------\nIt's also worth noting you have to actually repeatedly smack a target to burn their mana, which is 100% pointless if you'll kill said target in 3 hits, or finish them with a single auto-attack after your QWER rotation (like, if you're an AD caster laying the smack-down on a mage).\n\n-------------\nFurthermore - mages have the most range of any archetype in the game. Lux, Xerath, Ziggs are all in that group. Even when it comes to really short ranged mages like Ryze, you still have a solid 600 on abilities (50 more than the standard 550 ranged auto range).\n\nYou won't win a poke fight vs. most mages by default.\nYou can't whittle them down so they're silenced, because trying to play a strategy that would make mana-burn effective vs. a mage is playing to their strengths more often than not.\n\n-------\n\nNow, {{champion:17}}  vs. {{champion:122}} .\n\nThat's a situation where mana burn is actually extremely usful, as Darius is largely set up so he builds full-tank and gets the damage he needs from abilities. He's also 100% melee range and his weakness is getting poked to death. What better way to poke him to death than reducing his damage output at the same time?\n:D\n\n> Note 2: yes, I'm aware mana burn is traditionally considered toxic in league due to lack of counterplay.  \n\nIt's not a lack of counterplay. You can (fairly easily) deal with mana burn in a variety of ways.\n\nMana burn is considered bad due to being an anti-pattern.\nIt feels useless 99% of the time and you won't really value it when it does work, but you will certainly feel it on the receiving end.\n\n---------------\nAnyways:\n\nMana burn isn't anti-mage. Mages are stronger vs. mana burn than pretty much any other class.\nMana-burn's goal is a 20~40 second silence. If an ability can't silence a champion for 20~40 seconds because that would be broken, an item probably shouldn't.\nMana-burn favors acting like Teemo.\n\nThere's a reason Riot got rid of mana burn.","replies":[{"poster":"Volt Cruelerz","date":"2015-04-08T08:00:47.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good points here.

Which will usually feel \"meh\" when you apply it, and horrific when it happens to you.\n\nIf you really want to combat mana-heavy champions, you'd be much better off with stuff like HP/5, spell shields, cleanse, tenacity, MR, HP, MS.\nBoots are pretty solid against a lot of APs that like throwing things at you.\n\nThe niche of mana-burn is more screwing over champions {{champion:429}} is probably going to beat in a 1v1 regardless of how you apply it. It's more anti-fighter/tank or anti-tank than anything else, and the game already has %armor pen, %magic pen, and %HP shred to deal with those guys.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DragoonRuin","date":"2015-04-08T15:46:14.146+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alot of those \"anti pattern\" things are out dated in current league.

On the contrary if someone's ONLY option to get me out of lane, or out play me, is to burn down my mana, I'd just as likely All In them, and make them suffer for it, by probably killing them, or doing enough damage to force them back out of lane as well.

It gave MR and hit mana, so it should make mages unable to fight you. It sounded great in theory. However, what actually happened was that people never, ever built it to fight mages. Mages had easy access to mana itemization, and could minimize their mana costs with one or two items. You couldn't burn enough of a mage's mana for them to care. It was other classes who really got screwed by it. It was mainly built against tanks and bruisers, and also saw some use screwing over certain supports.
