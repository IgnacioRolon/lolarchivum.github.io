By the time she hits level 12 her range is almost {{champion:51}}'s, and by 18 she's got better range than {{champion:222}} with Fishbones, whilst being free cost on AAs while having splash damage on minion kills.  This is going to be nerfed, yes, but she's still going to have range greater than Caitlyn by level 18, with the same bursty dueling capabilities to boot.\n\nIn addition, Tristana's E was cancer.  Grievous wounds and damage over time is some of the most toxic shit in the game, hence why they are removing Tristana's old E and it on Fizz's W.  Miss Fortune gets a free pass because her only DOT is her E, which isn't tacked onto the greivous wounds, you need to activate two expensive abilities for that to work.  \n> Added an ability that does, at BEST, about 2.5 autoattacks worth of damage....probably the same 2.5 more autoattacks she'd have had pre 'rework'.\n\nYou have a champ that automatically one ups most ADCs' range by the time she levels up for the first time, and she trumps almost all of them by the time she hits level 9, with the exceptions being Caitlyn and Jinx.  That coupled with high attack speed, an AOE splash damage gap closer that can be used as an escape upon a kill or assist, and you've got a champion with very little counterplay once she gets rolling.  The attack speed was a tradeoff for counterplay, especially with this new E she's getting.  Despite this, I'm pretty sure she's still going to be bursting down your carries and dunking your towers.\n> \n> It's been a fun few years. I've been playing her since S1, and she was a big part of my LoL experience.\n> \n> But she is *dead* now.\n> \n> Anyone else upset about this?\n\nAnd finally, you are making a hyperbole about a champion retune that HASN'T BEEN RELEASED YET.  FFS, I want to slam my head against my keyboard every time someone whines about a new champion being the next Xin Zhao on release, or being Gnar bad. Unless you're a PBE tester, you don't have any experience with the champ.  Do I think the new numbers are a little low?  Yes I do actually, and I think Rito's going to adjust the patch after, because they are going to get a HELLUVA LOT OF DATA FROM ALL THE PEOPLE PLAYING A CHAMP YOU CAN GET FREE ON FACEBOOK.  Is she DEAD now?  Fuck no.  She's going to get the shit played out of her when the patch rolls around, just like Karthus and Twitch did, and people are going to say she's OP/UP, the whole nonsense that always happens.  \n\nTR;DL, quit whining about reworks, Riot did it because the champ lacked counterplay and couldn't balance her without changes, same thing happened to a lot of champions before.  I predict that she's going to be weak on release, but she's far from dead, and outside a new E and weaker stats, she's still Tristy.  I lump posts like yours with the millions of silent \"mains\" of a champ that immediately circlejerk about how \"RITO RHUINED MAH CHAMP!!1!\" the instant a rework goes live.\n\nEdit:  Cue the downvotes and flame me and call me a moron or whatever instead of actually making a solid argument, because this is the internet and the league community after all...","replies":[{"poster":"Beobear","date":"2015-01-28T13:40:56.473+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"....Still a nerf.
