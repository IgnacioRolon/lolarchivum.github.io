His main issue is not that he is terribly underpowered and in fact the main issue is he is toxic. He has a playstyle that is only fun for one party at any time. You either win and crush or fail and or get jungle camped. He also already has a well defined identity as \"pains paladin.\" He's the slow and inevitable death we all fear, faceless and remorseless. Overall a pretty good champ.\r\n\r\nI think many will agree that adding more mobility is not a good fix as well as adding any hard cc. These are part of his key weaknesses of being slow but powerful. But instead you can move some power into his Q. When he uses his Q mark the target with a Spell Vamp and AP AMP making all following attacks to heal him for more. You offset this by taking some of that vamp from his ult and making his E more costly to cast. This places an emphasis on getting into melee range to sustain in lane. Morde players now have to watch a ranged opponents a bit more carefully as they have to put themselves in danger to sustain. Not to mention that we now pay for pushing the lane and instead want to freeze the lane as best we can. We still keep our signature control of lane but we have incentive to now not outright push on all cylinders when we think the jungler is away.\r\n\r\nFor the morde player this now allows us to stay alive in the thick of teamfights and actually get to combo a few times. Instead of waiting for when we can win our one way trip. This gives us a way to fight a cc heavy comp without outright countering it. It adds some risk and reward around buying our hextech instead of making it a mandatory firstbuy. If you want to have a safe lane where you have to focus on ranged farming you buy your vamp early if you feel safe you can go for that early armguard to help keep assassins in line or go for a lich bane if you're feeling aggressive. This also fixes a frustrating aspect with morde, where you finally catch those evasive carries land everything on them and then ult but because morde has long gaps between getting his cooldowns back loses them and a potion they drank counters the dot he placed. This issue makes ignite for morde mandatory and would be fixed by even having a light damage amp in his kit.\r\n\r\nFor the enemy this gives them a window to sneak in a bit more damage and potentially kill morde for ranged and evasive assassins.  Due to his recovery being melee based. His ult remains his fallback for emergency saves and cleanups.  Along with that, making the amp melee based makes his ult less oppressive late game because for him to get the full power out of his ult he will have to land a Q on you or a nearby target. \r\n\r\nThis fairly simple change to his kit could easily bring him in line as a less toxic champ but still keep the feel, gameplay and overall kit fairly similar. While reducing what makes him frustrating to play and play against. Feel free to chime in on what you think and I would love to talk to you about it!","replies":[{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2015-01-14T19:18:39.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't build the hextech as my first item on Mordekaiser. I take a bid early and then upgrade to {{item:3801}} which let me spam my abilities to keep my shield up yet don't drain my hp as much. I feel hextech way too expensive as a first item for it usefulness besides sustain as it doesn't provide much AP. \nI'll rather saved for a {{item:1058}} or get a {{item:1026}} for a feasible 260 extra gold. You are going to make a full rotation and then wait for your CD anyway so there is no need to take the extra retaliation damage. \n\nBefore I get sliced I do build hextech but around mid game where the teamfights starts to occurs.","replies":[{"poster":"WhatHitYou","date":"2015-01-14T19:30:22.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I assume you build a warmogs out of that? \n\nYou could potentially get more out of a {{item:3145}}  and {{item:3143}} giving you armor/ hp and a slow to attempt to secure kills better. While getting more overall defensive/offensive use out of that build. Things like armor and MR still reduce the metal loss from iron man.","replies":[{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2015-01-14T20:01:21.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the conditions are right yeah  I build a {{item:3083}}  But most of the times I just sell the {{item:3801}} and take the 180 gold loss (it sells for 420 g) similar if you had started dorans. I just don't like being forced to push the lane with my spells in order to have sustain as it makes me susceptible to ganks with half of the times end on morde being dead as it has no escapes. Since I'm reneging life passively I can aim my Zyphons to just hit the enemy mid laners as opposed to the whole creep wave and still stay on lane for most of early game without recalling so often.","replies":[{"poster":"WhatHitYou","date":"2015-01-14T20:14:30.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:1006}} +{{item:2003}} X5 is a pretty classic morde start but it does have the downside of slowing the build unless you follow through with full building the item but it has the downside of making you surprisingly week early. Good for farming though.  I'm personally a fan of a {{item:1052}} + {{item:2003}} start to get into gunblade early. This gives you the advantage of a faster build into a power spike from {{item:3145}} and makes your poke from E pretty painful allows for larger shields for better trades but it's a very aggressive build. \n\nThough an aggressive lane is where morde shines in my opinion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-01-14T20:02:36.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I end up selling my revolver or even skipping it if I get fed.\n\nI legit never run out of hp either way.
