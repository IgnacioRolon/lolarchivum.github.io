When I went to bed my computer updated to the newest version of Windows 10. I logged on today to play some more ARURF and had no issues. Client worked just great. As champ select ended and it went to bring up the loading screen my screen flashed black then came up with a BugSplat error. I tried restarting my computer with no success and even uninstalled and reinstalled League with no success. I submitted a BugSplat error already. This can't be an issue of drivers or hardware as this only started with the new Win 10 update. Could somebody help?","replies":[{"poster":"CakeAvarice","date":"2016-09-25T00:01:11.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"almost exactly what is happening to me. the only difference for me is that it doesnt go to load screen at all so in turn i dont get a bug splat.{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"pinkrangerash","date":"2016-09-25T00:41:10.924+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!  Same here.  I also noticed that all this started to happen when Windows 10 decided to update. I can play any other games that aren't League of Legends with ease, no problem, right now.  I have literally never had a problem with League of Legends before, not on my old pc and not on my new pc.  However, now, ever since the Windows update I can choose a champion and when the time ticks down and goes to the black screen it Bug Splats.\n\nNow, I have some sort of priority queue because it has marked me as AFK even though I am not AFK.\n\nI have tried reinstalling the game as well to no avail. I truly believe there is a deeper issue that Riot needs to look into.  If I knew how to send a support ticket in, I certainly would.  I have sent each of my bugsplats in...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-24T23:41:09.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Reinstalling was a solid try as there could have been an issue with your game files.  Alternatively, you might have bad drivers or a hardware issue that's causing the bugsplat.  I recommend going over each step in the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to rule out possibilities and get this fixed up.

Is Riot going to address this issue? It is not an issue on my end as the current state of this board seems to be \"My Windows 10 updated and I'm having x issue.\" As players we should be using older versions of operating systems just to play this game. I already had to \"agree\" to not leave a game again even though this was my first disconnect that I couldn't reconnect to. I've given tons of support to Riot and it would be nice to see that returned with them acknowledging this issue and working towards a solution that doesn't require it's player base downgrading.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mtgriffin1","date":"2016-09-25T02:34:17.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the exact same issue.
