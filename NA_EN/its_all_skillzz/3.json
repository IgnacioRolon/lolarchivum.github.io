You only analyze winrates and for Platinum aswell. Shyvana should apparently be a fairly strong champ because of her 50.2% wr, right? The higher the ladder goes, the less and less of assassins you see.\n\n''I'm not seeing a problem with this post''. There is a problem: OP wants ad assassins to get gutted while there's only 1 that shines currently. Assassins arent strong in this meta but the boards prefer to bitch about them over someone whos actually oppressive and op like Galio/Liss, simply because Galio isnt an assassin (but his dmg output is like one tho lol).","replies":[{"poster":"Zardo","date":"2019-01-02T02:12:29.848+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> You only analyze winrates and for Platinum aswell.\n\nNo, I look at both plat+ stats and diamond+ stats.

She's good at being able to deny an enemy a snowball, not completely dominate lanes like other champions can.\n\nSecond, The reason the boards complains about this is because they don't like playing against it and they perceive it as \"op\" or \"broken\". They may be fine with playing against champions like galio, but not the ones they post about. That's fine, they're entitled to their opinion. \n\nIt's also important to note that something doesn't have to be broken to be be unhealthy- EG. Old akali wasn't overpowered, but she was extremely unhealthy.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Icy Hot Shoto","date":"2019-01-01T06:33:15.677+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":17,"body":"Not to mention all lethality items.
