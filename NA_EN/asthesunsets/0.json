You are free to be yourself.\n\nWhereas \"toxic\" people, have probably been \"toxic\" their entire lives. They have to put effort into changing their culture or suffer punishments. \n\nConsider anger management classes. No one goes to a single class and is magically cured. It takes time and effort.

At least my team can see that im serious about them lowering my chances of winning a game. \n\nSometimes I like putting pressure on my teammates so they can do better. Being nice never gets me anywhere, they just go and make the same mistakes over again becuase they think noone will care too much. I've seen some instances where my flame motivated a player to try harder so they can prove me wrong. \n\nThink of it like Gordon Ramsey and military generals. They both yell the shit out of people and spew insults. But do you see the recipients getting on a mental breakdown or something? No, because they are expected to have a thick skin and to do good under pressure, and to aknlowdege that someone is serious about them fucking up. Gordon Ramsey and military generals yell to *make* them do better to accomplish their goals.\n\nSome of my teammates take criticism well actually. Besides, if they really didn't want to see my flame they can mute or ignore me. In my experience, being mean is better than being nice because your team knows that your serious about winning the game, and that you won't tolerate silly mistakes.","replies":[{"poster":"IntegratedShadow","date":"2018-12-13T15:39:35.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, again, wrong mentality.

Honestly it's pretty easy to not get punished even when you're toxic. Just don't chat? I mean in the end it doesn't matter if u tell them they are bad at the game, because they would never say \"yes you are right\" because in all honestly, if they are in my elo, your elo or somebodys elses elo, we can assume that over a long number of games those players around our Elo are equal to us. Sometimes we do good, sometimes we do great, sometimes we do bad. We feed and we carry, we tilt hard and sometimes we tilt never. It happens to all of us.\n\nIf the average league player does bad in 1out of 10games which i would say is a fair number right? then in every single game on \"average\" we will meet a player who just has that 1game out of his \"10\" where he will do bad, **because there are 10Players playing right now one of them will have the bad game, assuming we as individuals are doing 1bad game in 10games**.\n\nAnd no matter how many times someone flames him or how bad people trashtalk him, it won't make him play any better. therefore flaming is a waste of time.\n\nIf your reasoning for flaming is for example \"he just needs to stop dying and i can maybe still carry\" well then don't flame him but rather say, \"try to play save i can carry this\". It's up to your teammates if they are able to do it or not.
