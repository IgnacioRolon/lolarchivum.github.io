My client is very llagy and delaying. Its takes me about 5 mins to log in after i click on SIGN IN  button. Than if i want to create a lobby it takes 5-15 seconds to create it, some times even more. I pick lanes and \"Find Match Now\" button is not available to click, it comes up after 5+ seconds. If i just click \"X\" button to close the party it returns me to home page and it still shows \"Lobby\" in left-top button instead of showing \"Play\". If i somehow get lucky and accept a match after 50 tries, than i wont be able to ban champs, or pick champs,  or change masteries, runes etc.... everything is delayed and im getting que penalties alot, losing lp, hitting desk with my right fist. \r\n\r\nAnd sometimes im very very lucky, somehow i manage to get into the game. Pre-declaring everything, like declaring the champ i want to ban at seconds 12+ otherwise my \"BAN\" button wont be clicked. Same with champ select. But when i get into the game, i have good ms 40 more or less. Still minion gold delays to spawn, sometimes hp bars just go off hits off everything goes off expect champions just go forward and back, and all that happens with 40 ms !!! \r\n\r\nTy for attention hopefully someone comes up with solution or im going to fkin breake my desk and ull play for it RITO games.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-26T00:35:28.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eep, let's not be breaking desks quite yet xD!\n\nThose weird little delays between clicks and your champion responding, and when you try to ban someone and the click doesn't go through sounds like your network is having issues with packet loss. What that means is that the data going between your pc and our servers is getting corrupted somehow along the way. Let's double check before jumping to conclusions with this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) first. Take a screenshot of what it says and post it here so we can help troubleshoot.","replies":[]}]}
