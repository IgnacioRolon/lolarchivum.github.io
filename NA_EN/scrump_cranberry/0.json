I do not know why but the only times I have been able to do any sort of draft is either when i get very lucky, or have a 4-5 man party to decline the remake. i have not had this issue in blind pick or bot games. However, almost every draft game, ranked or normal, the game waits to launch until everyone else is already in the game then takes longer to load than the remake timer allows. my load time in blind pick is only 30 seconds at most so I do not see any evidence of this problem being caused by my computer or connection(which are not the best but they are both about average). After getting a LeaverBuster cause of all the /Remakes that I have been hit with I am quite irritated and would like to know the reasoning for this issue. it seems very strange that i am having this issue. is there anything that makes a draft game take more out of computer then a blind game after champ select? and if so why would this thing be in place?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-07T17:00:10.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Draft mode isn't any tougher on your PC unless it's during champ select, due to it requiring a really stable connection.
