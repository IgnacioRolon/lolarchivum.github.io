The sword is styled in the middle eastern fashion as the modern conception of demons and hell is derived from art work of one famous painter, I forget his name, but anyways, he painted various artworks throughout his career which where inspired by the Islamic depiction of hell. The modern demon is a concept from the Islamic Djinn(Jinn). The show Supernatural shows these depictions best as they show the demon in the form of a smoke, which in Islam, Djinn were created from smoke, while man was created from the clay and Angels from light. Leagues constant use of the Islamic Djinn is evident in their infernal skin line and is probably the bases of where this skin comes from. Hence that is why Yasuo's hair is smokey and he is part fire and turns red. His sword is just a nod at the concept and the inspiration as it reflects the middle eastern scimitar. It's a skin, not meant to be like the original for a reason....","replies":[{"poster":"Riot LoveStrut","date":"2017-06-03T01:49:36.744+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bultz,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Bj7ZmJA3,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2017-05-31T22:26:03.418+0000)\n>\n> Do you even know anything about demon lore...ughh...

I can't speak for the concept artist for the nitty-gritty details, but there was definitely a shift during the early stages of concepting to go more towards that Middle Eastern (particularly Persian) influence for how we wanted to shape his demon form. The color choices, the shape language, the particles, and many other facets, including the sword, were re-shaped by this change in direction. That's why we went with the more scimitar-esque design. We had some hesitations at first because it was such a departure from his usual samurai sword shape and needed an unrealistic fitting into a scabbard, but we felt that the new design and direction were powerful, unique, and compelling enough to justify the hesitations, while pushing the boundaries of typical Yasuo skins. We also assumed that a powerful, chaotic demon probably can work some magic to fit his weird sword into a scabbard.","replies":[{"poster":"Bultz","date":"2017-06-03T03:07:57.323+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot LoveStrut,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Bj7ZmJA3,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2017-06-03T01:49:36.744+0000)\n>\n> Love that you&#x27;re identifying the Middle Eastern influences in Nightbringer Yasuo&#x27;s design!

I also love that you chose to change the sword into more of a scimitar as it fits amazingly with the horned/spiked look that you gave Yasuo. The skin is an insta buy for me.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Instant Dominion","date":"2017-05-31T21:54:29.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"also it doesn't even make sense that he has a sheath for the sword the way its shaped he can't even take it out","replies":[{"poster":"Bultz","date":"2017-05-31T22:27:30.663+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Father of you,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Bj7ZmJA3,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-31T21:54:29.669+0000)\n>\n> also it doesn&#x27;t even make sense that he has a sheath for the sword the way its shaped he can&#x27;t even take it out\n\nAs for the shape of the sheath, clearly the sword is changing and changes shape and size, just like the Djinn can in Islamic culture.
