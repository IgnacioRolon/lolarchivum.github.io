Where there is normally a box with a ward displayed on it next to my summoner spells, it is not there anymore.  Right now there is nothing clickable and I can't see what ward i have equipped or change it at all.  I tried repairing but it didn't help .  What should I do?  Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-10T22:25:42.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an issue we're aware of that revolves around some wards skins not displaying properly in both profiles and in champ select. If you had one of the affected ward skins selected when this bug began, your button to change ward skins is completely missing. We're hard at work to find a fix, but I don't have a timeline for you on when this will be fixed.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, Lambo! (Sick name btw)","replies":[]}]}
