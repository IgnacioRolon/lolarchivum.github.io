As said, they will ban those when they find them.  Only way to get the skin is to wait till 2016 when it MAY be on sale again, as that's 4 years after it's original release and it's a limited edition (as they take a certain time to come back, some not at all though)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neo Cyrus","date":"2015-05-29T17:11:05.826+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was very poorly written but I think you're asking what Riot's stance is on buying accounts?
