Obviously, it's not a huge loss but it's become super irritating since I can't help but notice the minuscule delay when taking action in game such as csing, skill shots, etc.\r\nI'm currently on a hiatus from league due to this, obviously I'll return in the near future but I'm too used to playing on the ping I was receiving compared to what I'm receiving now. \r\nMy computer hasn't updated or anything, I contacted my service provider and nothing has changed, I also went through all the devices connected to the internet in the house to see if anything changed in those aspects, but nothing.\r\nHas anyone else had this problem lately?\r\nIs it fixable?\r\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-26T04:16:47.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Subtle changes in latency are usually seen as a result of routing changes by your ISP that directly affect your path to our servers. To see if this is the case, I'd like you to run a traceroute log, which will give us an in-depth look at your network routing. I'd like you to use a network app called [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) to complete this. After loading up the app, simply paste **104.160.131.1** into the host field and start the trace. After 5 minutes has gone by, export the results as text and paste them in a reply to me.\n\nHit me up if you run into any issues.","replies":[]}]}
