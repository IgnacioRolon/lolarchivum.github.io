Yes, Hot Arm is officially my name on the Boards.\r\n\r\n Any chance we can get support added for Greek lettering and mathematical symbols?

My inkling is that it is either very easy fix, or cant be fixed due to Boards. \n\nI dont see Hotarm when you comment, so Im curious why some do. Your picture made me giggle tho, so A+. \n\nHe hasnt responded to me yet, but he is a busy dude.
