Before we can talk about changing Yuumi, we need to talk about what disadvantage states are and why Yuumi's limited ones are so problematic.\n\n Through healthy discussion and potential minor QoL changes, we can make Yuumi less frustrating to play against, keep her mains satisfied, and open up room for buffs to areas of play outside of the LCS.\n\n[](https://.)\n\n#**_*~~1 - Disadvantage States ~~*_**\n\n[](https://.)\n\n>_*~~What is a disadvantage state?~~*_\n>\n> A \"disadvantage state\" is a term used in fighting games to describe the timeframe when a character is punishable after performing an action. Although it is most commonly used in fighting games, it can be applied to any game and character regardless of the genre. \n\nYuumi being one of, if not the squishiest champion in League of Legends is surprisingly slippery and **very** difficult to capitalize on.\n\n Whether stepping out to ward or when her target ally is killed in a teamfight, Yuumi can instantly reattach to her teammates without much risk. The large majority of players are not able to capitalize on this small window without extreme and precise coordination. As a result, many players dislike Yuumi and consistently ban her [**as evidenced by her near 20% banrate across all ELOs. **](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/yuumi/silver)\n\n Frustration is ultimately subjective however, and not the only thing we should look at when discussing a champion. Yuumi's extremely small disadvantage states don't just result in frustration, they also make her a dominant pick in pro-play. At the highest levels of play, Yuumi's base kit combined with her low-risk makes her a staple champion resulting in a high winrate and even higher banrate.\n\n[](https://.)\n\n [As of the 2019 Summer LCS Season: Yuumi is in the top 20 champions with 18 games played, a **72% winrate,** **and a near 100% banrate**.](https://lol.gamepedia.com/Special:RunQuery/MatchHistoryPlayer?MHP%5Bpreload%5D=Champion&amp;MHP%5Bchampion%5D=Yuumi&amp;MHP%5Btournament%5D=LCS%202019%20Summer&amp;pfRunQueryFormName=MatchHistoryPlayer) And that's [**just in NA alone**.](https://gol.gg/champion/champion-stats/144/season-S9/split-ALL/tournament-ALL/patch-ALL/role-SUPPORT/league-ALL/)\n \n[](https://.)\n\n#**_*~~2 - Non-interactiveness ~~*_**\n\nNon-interactiveness and disadvantage states tend to go hand-in-hand. If a champion can't be capitalized on, that results in a non-interactive experience where the player can't be aggressive, take trades, or even move from under their tower.\n\n Unfortunately, Yuumi's gameplay revolves heavily around remaining untargetable for a majority of the game's duration. This makes her immune to poke, effectively makes her immune to engages (as she herself has a good disengage), and results in a very frustrating lane phase for the people playing into her. \n\nBy giving Yuumi incentive to detach and become targetable, we can alleviate some frustration and open up windows of opportunity.\n\n[](https://.)\n\n#**_*~~3 - Finally, let's get to the changes!~~*_**\n\n When reworking any champion, we want to tackle their most glaring problems while keeping their core identity intact. In this case, Yuumi is known for empowering her allies while being attached to them, however that _constant_ untargetability and lack of risk is what makes her so problematic in the first place. So I propose we find some middle ground and the easiest way to do that is by changing her W in two small ways.\n\n Yeah, it's really that simple.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/2SFjuZw.png?noredirect\n\n>_*~~Current W - You and Me!~~*_\n\n>**Passive:** While Attached, Yuumi and her ally gain a percent of each other’s AD or AP converted to Adaptive Force.\n\n>**Active:** Yuumi starts with a point in her W. She dashes to an ally champion and attaches to them. While Attached, she follows her partner’s movement and is untargetable by everything except tower damage. Yuumi’s abilities fire from her ally’s location, and she can’t attack enemies. There’s no cooldown to jump among her teammates. However, if Yuumi un-attaches entirely, she’ll need to wait for the cooldown to partner up, which starts as soon as she’s attached.\n\n>______________\n\n>#_***~~Changes~~***_\n>**_*~~New effect: Purrfect Partner~~*_** - Yuumi's allies now have meters above their health bars. (Appropriately titled _\"Meturrs\"_) Attaching to an allied champion will slowly drain their meter. Meters recharge slowly over time, but will recharge faster if Yuumi lands Prowling Projectile (Q) or Bop N' Block (Passive). Yuumi can only attach to a champion when atleast 25% of their meter is filled. \n\n>**_*~~New effect: The Cat's Out of the Bag!~~*_** - When Yuumi detaches from a champion (either willingly or through the target ally dying), there is a slightly increased delay before she can reattach to any ally. / AKA Longer W cooldown. \n\n\nClosing: While on the surface it may not seem that impactful, limiting Yuumi's ability to remain untargetable gives her more meaningful disadvantage states, alleviates frustration across the board, and most importantly reduces her impact in pro-play which, by extension, could lead to improvements for **other** areas of play.\n\n These proposed changes just scratch the surface of what could be done to Yuumi. (Yes, that was a cat pun.)\n\n Thanks for reading, let me know what you think!","replies":[{"poster":"jocomotion","date":"2019-09-15T03:34:47.529+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is an amazing concept, forcing Yuumi to spend more of the game as an actual champion is a good idea to improved her overall health and make her gameplay less toxic, if I could add one small detail though. \n\nAnother, albeit smaller, annoying thing about Yuumi’s kit is her Q. Enemies hate it because it’s free like that’s practically gaurenteed to hit, and Yuumi players hate it because it deals so little damage while costing so much. In the spirit of giving Yuumi more incentive to be detached at times riot could implement something like:\n\n> Q: Prowling projectile\n* [new] Firing prowling projectile while detached increases its missile speed drastically\n* Prowling projectile turn radius increased while attached (it can’t turn as sharply)\n\nBecause honestly her lack of vulnerability and her literal free poke are the main two toxic parts of her kit.

Maybe make it a whole separate ability for clarity's sake.\nYou could call the detached version \"The Cat's Meow\" and give it different visuals from the homing-capable and slow-applying \"Prowling Projectile\".\n\nAs for making her more punishable: \nSuggestion 2 (my idea): making her passive-enhanced auto attacks not instant would kill two birds with one stone.\n\nFor the Yuumi it would eliminate the frustration of hopping off to proc shield only to have it immediately pop before you can put it on your ADC because the enemy's auto attack arrived. Now the shield generates after the enemy's auto lands, so you will always get it to your ADC unless you overstay and take a second hit.\n\nFor the enemy it gives Yuumi a counterplay strategy, one we're all already familiar with:\n\"Focus the ~~Soraka~~Yuumi\".\nNow when Yuumi walks up you can throw autos at her and actually feel like you're doing something, the same as when Soraka walks up to land Qs and you fire back to keep her from charging up her health battery.\nYeah she's getting a shield out of it, but gosh-darn-it you're making her pay for that shield in blood.\n\nThere's just one more change that would be necessary to make this change substantial: nerf her HP regen.\nAs it is you can go for a shield proc anytime you want as Yuumi because the shield will stick until it's needed, but the damage you take will not.\nMake it so trading HP for shield is sometimes the wrong choice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PARVDOX","date":"2019-09-15T22:53:38.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"A timer to kick Yuumi off to be a sitting duck when she's a free kill anytime she's caught alone is not going to remove the frustration of anyone except people who already ban Yuumi religiously.

Approaching it that way would mean that the champ she spent the longest time on or around then she would be more inclined to share her W buffs and the new partner doesnt get the full percent right off the bat.

If we followed that logic, Xerath would be the strongest champion in the game, Sylas would 100% counter every mage, and Bard would be the best support or runner up for 2nd strongest champion in the game.\n\n Your suggestion could work too, as long as there was some limit to the length of time she could be attached. Yuumi's current problem is that she has no large incentive to detach for anything other than proccing her passive. As soon as that's done, she's latching right back on to someone and staying there for the rest of the match.","replies":[{"poster":"PARVDOX","date":"2019-09-15T23:32:45.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hotarµ,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=adXxJbn3,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2019-09-15T23:03:17.688+0000)\n> This obviously wouldn't be the only change made to Yuumi, there would be more done to her afterwards. It's just to get the ball rolling on some healthy discussion.\n\nThat's fine, I'm open to Yuumi changes, just pointing out that giving the W a reason to fail as a hard nerf will only tip the frustration in the opposite direction for Yuumi players. \n\n>Thematics and lore don't always equate to good gameplay design.

Irellia and upcoming Fiddlesticks and Volibear come to mind. Sticking to lore would mean that she would probably have a portal like Shen to be a fully roaming enchanter, maybe that's too overpowered but I still like the idea of a roaming support for her than being tied to one guy she cant venture away from, and if she had to build up a bond with a champ then it would naturally encourage roaming to different team mates. Of course she'd need something to allow that to be viable like a better E speed boost when solo.\n\n >  Your suggestion could work too, as long as there was some limit to the length of time she could be attached. Yuumi's current problem is that she has no large incentive to detach for anything other than proccing her passive. As soon as that's done, she's latching right back on to someone and staying there for the rest of the match.\n\nHer passive to proc is honestly not even enough to make low elo players get off because its RNG based at random to 'periodically' give her a shield, they removed the mana refund and weakened it . Per the proposed ideas It's not that hard to marry both ideas to the theme. Cats are fickle and go where they please, hop on and off your lap anytime, but cats can also form a bond like in her lore with her master. So a roaming support that has a lower time limit she spends on someones shoulder at the start, but that time limit increases over time based on how much time she has spent with them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Support Position","date":"2019-09-15T16:52:39.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:350}} Counters:\n\n{{champion:53}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:37}} \n\nIf you need info on why.
