More specifically: bots and Riot's (supposed) lack of action against them.\n\n[](https://.)\n\n##**_~~1 • Detecting bots is not the issue!~~_**\n\n\n It's actually fairly easy for Riot to detect bots, be it through manual review or an automated system. The issue is not that the majority of them are flying under the radar, but rather that companies have to be mindful of bot developers [**reverse engineering**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering) their detection systems.\n\n Going to keep it short and simple (because I'm a chef, not a software engineer. I don't understand all that fancy technical mumbo-jumbo you kids are on about.) \n\nHere's an example where banning bots on the spot would be a detriment to Riot rather than a benefit. \n\n> Let's say there are **30** bots created in total.\n\n>- Bots 1-10 use method **_*~~A~~*_** for leveling their accounts.\n>- Bots 10-20 use method *_~~B~~_* for leveling their accounts.\n>- And finally, bots 20-30 use method _***~~C~~***_ for leveling their accounts. \n\n>A Riot software engineer has created a program that can consistently detect method **_*~~A~~*_** without fail. \n\n>Once the bots that use that method are created, they're banned on the spot. Now that those 10 bots have been removed, Riot can get to work on detecting the other 20.\n\n>_However,_ now that the bot developer can see **which** variables got method **_*~~A~~*_** detected, he can continue to create new ones with slightly altered variables to lead Riot off the trail and make future accounts last longer. So while Riot is working on removing those other 20 accounts, three more **slightly different methods** have been released. \n\n>...and so on and so forth. \n\nIf bots are banned in waves (like they are now, something which all companies tend to do) the developers will have a much harder time pinpointing what got them flagged.\n\n_***~~There is not a single solution to stopping all bots. There is only preventative action.~~***_\n\n[](https://.)\n\n**(Also just wanted to slip this in as it's something most people gloss over: League is a free-to-play game and the signup process is simple, it's very easy for someone to mass produce bots when their older ones do get flagged!)**\n\n[](https://.)\n\n##**_~~2 • There's a reason Twisted Treeline was so popular for botting; if it wasn't Twisted Treeline, it would just be a different queue.~~_**\n\n\n Now I personally wasn't the biggest fan of TT. I'm a Rift-boi through and through, no hate towards the mode though.\n\n But regardless of your opinion on Twisted Treeline or how much you played it:\n\n>**_*~~1~~*_** - The mode was _not_ popular _**(whatever the reason may have been, that's not the point!)**_ \n\n[](https://.)\n\n>*_~~2~~_* - The games were fast and in most if not all cases, the best way to level your account.\n\n[](https://.)\n\n>_***~~3~~***_ - The map, team sizes, item pool, and \"mechanics of the map\" were smaller.\n\n\n\n** When creating a bot, developers are going to use the method that gives them the best consistent results and keeps their accounts online for as long as possible.** Now, with that being said, let's take a look back at some of the things I just listed.\n\n>**_*~~1~~*_** - The mode was _not_ popular _**(whatever the reason may have been, that's not the point!)**_ \n\n_Because_ the game mode wasn't popular, there were much less people reporting you and there was a significantly higher chance that you'd... just be matched against other bots.\n\n More bots and less people equals longer games which equals more experience and zero chance that you'd get flagged.\n\n>*_~~2~~_* - The games were fast and in most if not all cases, the best way to level your account.\n\n _Because_ games were fast and offered decent-if-not-better experience rates compared to SR, it was a viable method for quick leveling. Even if the experience rates on SR were 25% higher than the ones on TT, it would still be beneficial for a bot to go there where the games are shorter and the developers have to do less work.\n\n>_***~~3~~***_ - The map, team sizes, item pool, and \"mechanics of the map\" were smaller.\n\n Due to the smaller map, team size, item pool, and mechanics, bots were easier to create and had less of a chance of **breaking** (when a bot fails to complete it's assigned task and stops working altogether/makes a mistake before reverting back to a previous point) \n\nIf you put a bot on SR while the Mountainous Rift is active or bomb plants are going off left and right, there's a high chance that the program is going to break or they'll make a critical error like running right through a tower to return to lane which could potentially get them flagged faster.\n\n__________\n\n Nobody (not even Riot) doubts the existence of bots. It was very apparent that TT was riddled with them and removing the queue wasn't going to just make them magically disappear. Leaving TT as a vacant, outdated, bot-infested gamemode isn't something they wanted to do and on some level I can understand that. \n\n[](https://.)\n\n##**_~~3 • Closing: It's not just Riot.~~_**\n\n[](https://.)\n\n Anyone who has ever played an MMO or other popular free-to-play game will know that bots are everywhere. No company has eradicated 100% of it's bots, they'll always be here regardless of how good your detection systems are. League is a popular game and it's free-to-play, unfortunately you're going to see way more bots here than anywhere else. \n\n With all that being said: Bots... _fucking suck._ You have a right to be frustrated, everyone does. \n\nBut they're everywhere and I'm sure Riot is doing the best they can to remove them. \n\nHave a great night, everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"ToyStoi","date":"2019-11-23T04:21:02.748+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"The reason \"said\" game mode wasn't or inst popular is because of the amount of bots that are in that game mode.

Because they have no incentive to improve.\nIt's not that they can be this obvious without being detected... it's that staying undetected (in the current situation) requires too much effort to be worth it. So, since they get banned eventually anyway, they might as well just use the most simple method they can find to bot.\n\n>i also wonder who would be smarter... the ppl who made and own the game or ppl writing bots for it...\n\nIt's a bit presumptuous to believe that botters are less smart. But it isn't even about how smart the individual parties are, it's about the availability of data.\n\nEvery time Riot bans a botter, they are **obviously** informed of it immediately. If you don't ban in waves, this will give them the exact game they were detected in, the account that was detected, etc. They have all the information they need to improve their ability to hide from Riot's detection mechanisms.\n\nI strongly doubt that every time a botter **doesn't** lose their account they write an Email to Riot going \"Hey, suckers, the following account just slipped past your system, suckerz!\"\nSo Riot is basically operating completely blind. Any effort they put into improving bot detection requires **at least** the same amount of effort in acquiring data.\n\nThe botters have an innate advantage in this kind of arms race.\n\n>but again all the arguments i see are \"yeah easy to change\" so sure do nothing and let the botters keep making free money. \n\nIt's better than letting the botters keep making free money **and** create zero repercussions to people buying botted accounts.\nYou focus way too much on what is (admittedly) bad about the current situation, and by far not enough on how your suggestion would make things **worse**.\n\nAnd just to reiterate what has been sad in the OP and by me: Detection is not the problem. Likewise nobody has a problem with your proposed methods of detecting bots. Chances are, Riot is already using those methods among others.\n\nThe problem is - and I cannot stress this enough - **exclusively** your suggestion of banning them immediately, or even just significantly faster than they are banned now.","replies":[{"poster":"Jennifer17","date":"2019-11-24T16:17:11.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"unlike most people you offer a discussion. sadly i dont have the time right now.\nthe last thing i can post for now is dota2 or more likely steam. they insta ban hackers cheaters and botters. and i've never heard dota2 facing such a massive bot problem EVER. i also never heard of botters \"changing stuff so steam cant detect them anymore\".\n\nalso with tt gone and more and more ppl speaking of bots in normals and aram, riot is kinda forced to change something id say","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-11-24T15:07:25.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 - I literally **did not** say anything remotely close to that in my post.\n\n In fact, the first point says \"Detection is _**not**_ the issue.\"\n\n2 - There _are_ actually different styles of bots.

There needs to be community _awareness_ to not _buy_ level 30 accounts for ranked or _face_ dire consequences for doing so. The root of the problem is not _only_ the botters but also the _demand_ for these level 30 accounts to do ranked on. What Riot needs  to do is put a msg. across that if you buy a botted account. You will not only lose that but also be punished on other accounts associated with that _bought_ account, i.e the same owner will be punished on all his accounts.\n\nAs for the punishment, I really don't know how it should be handled. Because it depends on the statistic of how many players have bought accounts. What % of Riot's customers have invested heavily on _bought_ accounts? Too many and I don't see Riot taking any preventive measures. Its like a disease that's already spread over to most of the Tree's roots and now you can't fix it unless you cut some of them.\n\nSteam flags an account and highlights what its been punished for before in red. I think that putting that as an option next to someone's profile would be an idea. You click on their Profile name in the search bar or hover onto their names on your friends list and maybe there's an option which shows everything that they have been punished for before. People in today's society put a lot of value to their image even if its in a game. I think that this would discourage some of them if not all from getting punished. \n\nPersonally, wth TT gone, I don't think it matters all that much for someone like me who mainly used it to do my _daily_ wins. When I do AI SR, even if I have 2-3 bots on my team, I'll still finish the game around 15-16 mins. _roughly_. So while most of the player base feels bamboozled by the bots, I'm still feeling the _same_. And, I sympathize with Riot removing TT before finding a fix for this problem. If you had found a solution and then removed TT, you wouldn't be getting as many complaints because as you've stated. TT wasn't that popular to begin with so there was only a minor part of the community who was dealing with the bot _issues_. \n\nAnyway!
