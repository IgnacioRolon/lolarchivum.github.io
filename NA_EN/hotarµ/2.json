I share this sentiment although I often think about appeals and the stigma surrounding them, so I'd like to discuss it. I know people will most likely downvote just _because_ of that stigma but I'd really appreciate hearing your opinions and engaging in some conversations.\n\n **Even if it's as simple as \"No, people get enough chances as is.\" I'd love to hear what you have to say. \n**\n___________________\nWith that out of the way:\n I've always entertained the idea of appealing permanently banned accounts because it's been a staple in almost every game I've played. Also, I'd like to believe that people can always change their behavior for the better. \n\n I'm aware that this a very opinionated outlook and some will have a more cynical view, which is totally fine. \n\n#If there _was_ an ability to appeal permanently banned accounts, how do you think it should be handled?\n___________________\n\n  If I had the ability to implement an appeal system for permanently banned accounts, here's how I'd handle it:\n\n _***~~Accounts that have been suspended for hate speech (racism, homophobia, inciting self harm, etc.) are not eligible for this program. This also applies to accounts banned for Scripting (or malicious use of 3rd party programs) and MMR boosting.~~***_\n\n_***~~\"Permanent Ban\"~~***_ tag changed to **_*~~\"Indefinite Suspension\"~~*_** \nPermanent bans will still exist, but more on that below.\n\n ##After receiving your Indefinite Suspension, you will have to make a new account and meet a few requirements before it is lifted. \n\n * You must connect your new account to the old one by verifying the e-mail address and connecting a new e-mail address or phone number to it. \n\n_(This would prevent people from \"boosting\" indefinite suspensions by forcing them to be hard-locked to the old account. Also, given the extremely long amount of time it would take to lift a permanent suspension, it would be near-impossible to realistically boost this.)_\n\n## After connecting both accounts:\n\n * Any punishments on the new account will result in the _permanent_ banning of the indefinitely suspended account. The first punishment on a new account will also be escalated to a 25-game chat restriction immediately.\n\n* Your newly made account must maintain an Honor level of 3, 4, or 5 for 500+ games.\n\n* After fulfilling these requirements, you may file for an appeal with a Riot support agent. Here, you may make your case as to why your account should have it's suspension lifted while providing evidence and a personal explanation of your actions. \n\n* Following the lifting of an indefinite suspension, _any_ punishments made to your account within the next 3 months will result in a permanent suspension. Afterwards, your account may start it's recovery.\n\n____________________\n\n# My reasoning:\n\n Rather than giving people an extra chance for no reason, this is basically a \"1 for 1\" trade. You have a 'Hail Mary' chance of recovering your previously suspended account at the **risk of permanently losing it and willfully forfeiting one stage of your punishment ladder**. So, instead of getting 5 chances for one account and 4 for the new one, you only have 8 in total. \n\nNot that that's anything to laugh at, **but** it isn't any more lenient on repeat offenders than our current system. If anything, it's more strict because if you fail to appeal your account, you've permanently lost a chance on your new one.\n\n While the Honor system can act as a veil for toxicity (someone who is Honor 5 can still be passive aggressive) having the added step of actually _appealing_ your punishment with a representative would remove this issue entirely. Simply put, if a Rioter deems your logs passive aggressive or not entirely positive, they can deny the appeal. Honor doesn't act as a 'shield' in our current system and shouldn't if any changes were made to it.\n\n Since these appeals take a long time to build up (500+ games and maintaining an Honor level) Riot support wouldn't be overwhelmed with requests or appeals. It's a very reasonable situation for the very few who are willing to go to these lengths to show they've reformed. \n________\n#Let me know what you think and thanks for reading my long ass post.  :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Starmfangy","date":"2019-03-02T21:51:34.430+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"But the majority of banned accounts are mostly for harassment or racism!

It's thought out really well, solid, and the two layers (pre-appeal build-up, then the appeal itself) makes for something of a filter to prevent random Indefinitely Suspended players from just jumping straight to Riot Support to get their punishment appealed.\n\nThere are some details I'd be personally curious about - mostly pertaining to how the pre-appeal stuff would be handled (would it be like an automatic application system, would you have to file a Support ticket and get in contact with Riot to start the process, would your progress be visible, at the very least accessible, etc.), but those are extraneous and don't really affect the core of the proposal itself.\n\nI also like the touch of attaching a phone number to the primary(suspended?) account (if I'm reading that right, anyway), as that has a similar effect to the Smurf Solution from Clash - forcing players to attach a phone number to the account to ensure that the one account they're playing with is their primary account.\n\nAll told, I'm still primarily against the idea of properly-placed permanent suspensions being appealed (I'm amongst the group who believes the three chances are enough), but, this is definitely an idea I can get behind if Riot ever did reconsider their standpoint on permanent suspensions. It provides an opportunity to show that \"day-late, dollar-short\" reform while imposing a tangible cost on failure, and it's solid enough that I can't readily think of any major holes or issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaisa Aran","date":"2019-03-02T22:08:59.814+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Alright, player with 4 (potentially soon to be 5) bans here.

Just thought I'd correct that.\n\n> Also, I'd like to believe that people can always change their behavior for the better.\n\nThis is true, most people mature over time or at least get a better world view. At bare minimum you start to see people being better about avoiding doing filter-prone stuff chat wise which can help tone down things, though admittedly not by much. But overall - Yes, most people can. Some can't without extra external help though, and I'm speaking from experience here.\n\n> Accounts that have been suspended for hate speech (racism, homophobia, inciting self harm, etc.) are not eligible for this program. This also applies to accounts banned for Scripting (or malicious use of 3rd party programs) and MMR boosting.\n\nSo those morons who use Zero Tolerance words and think they'll get away with it as if those aren't high priority in the automated system? Yeah, I'm fine with this - you have to be pretty stupid/reckless to use ZT words like candy and either way if someone is using words like those freely they probably need a good amount of help. \n\nBefore people ask, I have been banned for using ZT words before - I never said I wasn't a moron.\n\n> After receiving your Indefinite Suspension, you will have to make a new account and meet a few requirements before it is lifted.\n\nThis starts to worry me because of how this'll impact the New Player Experience, but I'll hear you out.\n\n> You must connect your new account to the old one by verifying the e-mail address and connecting a new e-mail address or phone number to it.\n(This would prevent people from \"boosting\" indefinite suspensions by forcing them to be hard-locked to the old account. Also, given the extremely long amount of time it would take to lift a permanent suspension, it would be near-impossible to realistically boost this.)\n\nI'm not fully aware of what you mean by the latter, but it's true that people make new email addresses solely to create new accounts. Tying them back to the original is a good idea since it'll force people to be honest about their origins if they legitimately want their old account back, but some may just not give a shit and level a new one just because getting the old one back wouldn't seem worth it in their eyes since the leveling process will still be the same hard ass grind it can be. \n\n> Any punishments on the new account will result in the permanent banning of the indefinitely suspended account. The first punishment on a new account will also be escalated to a 25-game chat restriction immediately.\n\nUnderstandable.\n\n> Your newly made account must maintain an Honor level of 3, 4, or 5 for 500+ games.\n\nAnd you lost me.\n\nHonor 3/4/5 are no different from Honor 2, let me make that clear. You can be passive agressive as fuck and be Honor 5 because you play a bunch, that doesn't mean you're any better than an Honor 2 player (though the automated system will think otherwise). Forcing people to level up to Honor 3 first and THEN play 500+ games is a huge commitment that, again, no one will bother doing because the leveling up proceedure will already be painful as fuck in the first place and having to play hundreds more games on top of that...honestly I'd rather just create a clean account separated from the old one so I don't risk an escalation to a 25 game chat restrict. You're asking WAY too much here time-investment wise, especially for people who only play a few games a day.\n\n> After fulfilling these requirements, you may file for an appeal with a Riot support agent. Here, you may make your case as to why your account should have it's suspension lifted while providing evidence and a personal explanation of your actions.\n\nThis is fine, also lets Riot Support double check to see if you haven't been a passive aggressive shit since that's currently very difficult to punish automatically. \n\n> Following the lifting of an indefinite suspension, any punishments made to your account within the next 3 months will result in a permanent suspension. Afterwards, your account may start it's recovery.\n> \n\nToo strict, you're already forcing a huge time commitment and you have zero tolerance slapped on for ANOTHER three months? Why would anyone go about this type of process, it's horrificly long and one slipup can cost everything. You'd have to be insanely commited and careful to have a chance, and one outburst would doom things for good. \n\n> Since these appeals take a long time to build up (500+ games and maintaining an Honor level) Riot support wouldn't be overwhelmed with requests or appeals. \n\nI don't think you'd be as busy as you're making them out to be, especially since it's true that a small % of players actually get permabanned.\n\n----\n\nOverall, I disagree with this direction. Your demands for getting an account unbanned are far too high and would take an eternity to complete due to the minimum game requirement &amp; the pointless Honor 3/4/5 requirement. Add this in to the fact that one slipup on the old account within 3 months (and I mean ANY slipup) would result in a permaban and this gets a thumbs down for me, not until it's made more lenient with a better understanding of how insanely painful it can be to level up a new account and how obnoxious it'd feel to be making no progress over hundreds of games, especially if you only play a few games a day.","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-03-02T22:20:03.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">The majority who haven't ever been punished. Number goes down once people get a taste of how awful leveling from Honor 0/1 is. Just thought I'd correct that.\n\n That doesn't detract from what I said. The very small community on the Boards and Reddit agree that three chances is more than enough and the large majority of the game doesn't get punished in the first place.\n\n> Tying them back to the original is a good idea since it'll force people to be honest about their origins if they legitimately want their old account back, but some may just not give a shit and level a new one just because getting the old one back wouldn't seem worth it in their eyes since the leveling process will still be the same hard ass grind it can be.\n\n Yep, that was the point of what I was suggesting. Should you opt in for the chance to appeal your account, you subject yourself to harsher punishments on newly created accounts. I forgot to mention it but you don't have to go for an appeal of any kind, you can make a new account and have it be functionally the same as one created today.\n\n>  You can be passive agressive as fuck and be Honor 5 because you play a bunch, that doesn't mean you're any better than an Honor 2 player (though the automated system will think otherwise). \n\n That's why I said the account is subject to an appeal case from a Riot support agent. To quote myself directly: \"Simply put, if a Rioter deems your logs passive aggressive or not entirely positive, they can deny the appeal. Honor doesn't act as a 'shield' in our current system and shouldn't if any changes were made to it.\"\n\n>honestly I'd rather just create a clean account separated from the old one so I don't risk an escalation to a 25 game chat restrict. You're asking WAY too much here time-investment wise, especially for people who only play a few games a day.\n\nThat's the point. It's a risk-reward scenario. I believe that you shouldn't get an extra chance just for the sake of getting an extra chance. A sacrifice has to be made and the only realistic way is by penalizing a linked account should they mess up.\n\n Also, the intent is to reward the _very few_ that are willing to show that level of reform. It's supposed to be a difficult, pain-in-the-ass journey that requires real effort to overcome.\n\n>Too strict, you're already forcing a huge time commitment and you have zero tolerance slapped on for ANOTHER three months? Why would anyone go about this type of process, it's horrificly long and one slipup can cost everything.\n\n_That's the whole point._ You're fighting for a chance at recovering a once _permanently banned_ account. Also, this is already the case in the system we already have. Got a 14 day ban and a few weeks have passed? One slip up can still cost you everything.\n\n>Your demands for getting an account unbanned are far too high and would take an eternity to complete due to the minimum game requirement &amp; the pointless Honor 3/4/5 requirement.\n\n I'm not \"demanding\" anything. An Honor requirement isn't pointless when you have to subject yourself to an appeal case with someone who can see every single one of your chat logs, match histories, and punishment status.\n\n Thanks for reading and replying.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaisa Aran","date":"2019-03-02T22:27:02.232+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> It's supposed to be a difficult, pain-in-the-ass journey that requires real effort to overcome.\n\nI'm sorry but I get the feeling you've never been punished in League and don't understand the sheer unholiness that is leveling up from Honor 1 or Honor 0 as it is. This is exactly why people create new accounts in the first place - Trying to level up from Honor 0 &amp; Honor 1 is already bad enough as it is, you'll level an account to 30 faster than you'll get back to Honor 2. People dislike the current system because it requires too much effort for too little reward, and while I have no mercy for the homophobes/morons who ZT their way into an automatic two week I do pity the people who have one bad day and get punished the same as the previously mentioned players because they let one thing slip.\n\nIn other words you're going down a path that 99% of players would hate and simply choose to ignore because of how god awful it is investment-wise. This isn't an appeal process, this is being rung through hell (especially since you never said anything about your old account automatically getting Honor 2 back if the procss is fully completed). You can't seriously expect people to do this, right? All you're doing is capitalizing on the bad parts of the current system while adding in nothing good.

You would have to put in a few hundred games minimum to get Honor 3, then 500+ more to get the minimum for an unban, THEN get reviewed and if rejected you'd have to put in even MORE time on your new account if they say 'you're not ready yet, come back in a few months'.
