Popup window says the 'PVP.net Kernal is not working' or something along those lines. Hasn't bothered me much because I can run the game as Admin and open the interface. But now I bugsplat everytime a game attempts to load [eg. after champ select and the actual game goes to load players in]. Pisses me off quite a bit because this problem arose when I decided to play ranked and the game got remade [as it should have been in fairness to my teammates]. I used the repair option and tried to get into a game of ARAM, to see the results. Still nothing, and I still had to run the game as Admin just to open it. I uninstalled and reinstalled League, guess what? Had to run as Admin, could not get in a game. \r\n\r\nOn one hand I can see the bugsplat maybe having to do with whatever maintenance they are currently doing, but I have never run into a bugsplat this often in the 2 or so years I've been playing, which to me suggests a more deep rooted issue. Legit more bugsplats today [since it is consistent and constant] then I've had in all of my time before this playing. Couple this with the fact that I cannot even open the game normally, and I've given up and come here for assistance.\r\n\r\nSo, thoughts?\r\n\r\nP.S. If I have to uninstall the game and then go to Program, Program Files, and the registry to clean this up before reinstalling, I'm gonna be extremely pissed.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-07T15:46:55.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issues you are experiencing here seem to be a combination of different issues that should be fixed up individually.  The kernel error you're having may be due to a security setting with your OS that's preventing the patcher from opening.  Go through the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to get that fixed up.  Once permissions are restored, the patcher can work on resolving the bugsplat by finally being able to access game files properly.  \n\nThe bugsplats can be due to bad game files, driver, or hardware issues.  The next step would be to follow the instructions in the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide. Hopefully, this will get you squared away!","replies":[{"poster":"Thorn the Cretin","date":"2016-09-08T04:06:01.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adjusting permissions changed nothing. Computer is updated, and this issue did not arise immediately after an update, but between them. Also, I am not very comfortable with having to have permissions fully deactivated just to run League. \nThe bugsplats came about out of nowhere. Recently purchased a 480, and after setting it up with the right drivers [and removing NVidia drivers] the game worked fine [albeit still with the patch kernal not working]. I repaired the game, and reinstalled it. So knocking out permissions, bad game files, drivers, and hardware, where does this leave me? SOL? Is there a program or software Riot released to do a full clean that removes every mention of League of Legend from every source file so I can do a clean install, or what?\n\nEDIT: I will mention, however, that I am currently trying to uninstall the drivers to my monitor that I installed shortly before getting on League, which is the only difference between the times I played League in the hopes of addressing the Bugsplat issue. I just cannot seem to find the right ones... Still need something for the PVP.net Patcher Kernal though.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-08T18:03:49.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) which can provide a clean reinstall for a fresh slate.
