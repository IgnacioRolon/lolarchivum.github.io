Who on earth decided that whenever the download of the game is interrupted all the data reset to 0?? I&#039;ve been downloading the game for the most part of the day because for some reason the transfer is drastically slow (it&#039;s about 170kb, while I have 2mb on Steam). And then I decided to log in to see if my buddy&#039;s online. I think I switched the server from nordic to east and logged in. And then the download started from the beginning xDDD What? I thought that it was some funny bug and left it for an hour or so, expecting it to be ready when next checked. Nope, it was around 10%... I checked the folder - there were 5gb of files there. Well, let&#039;s see what happens when I turn the client off. Heyyy, back to 0%, 3gb of files in the folder. The transfer is even slower than it was before. No way I&#039;m gonna play today. ETA 1600min with 160kb transfer and I&#039;m at 6%.\r\nJust what the hell? How could have anyone approved this monstrous abomination? Slightest interaction resets ALL THE PREVIOUSLY DOWNLOADED DATA?! SERIOUSLY? AND WHAT IS THIS TRANSFER, CMON!!","replies":[]}
