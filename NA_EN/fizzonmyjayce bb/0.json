Stop banning my new/reworked champions.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"My argument is in the title. I seriously think Riot needs to introduce a feature that disables the ability to ban new/reworked champions for a certain amount of time (2 weeks?) after they have been released to the live servers. It&#039;s a huge disappointment to have spent so much time in the game earning all the BE to unlock something you reeeaally want to play, and have some braindead team mate or enemy ban it because they are afraid to learn how to play against or with something new. I apologize if this is a bit aggressive but it happens far too often. As im writing this, I have had Aatrox banned by my own team mate for the third lobby in a row after disenchanting valuable champ shards for the sole purpose of playing this champ. These games aren&#039;t short and the few times i get to play I want to play something I put time in to earn.
