Personally, I don&#039;t find Akali that hard to play against. Counter picking her is pretty easy as all you need is a champion that can aoe or lock her down in her smoke. Gragas, Poppy, etc are all amazing picks against her. She&#039;s banned often which means the people that want to main her don&#039;t have enough expierence to completely stomp and the people that play against her don&#039;t have enough expierence to counter her. The first time I played against Zoe, I hated it. Then I realized just how freelo she is if you pick a decent counter pick and just side step her sleep pre 6. I think if less people banned Akali and took the time to learn her weaknesses instead of focusing on her strengths, a lot of people wouldn&#039;t be so blinded. I know people who haven&#039;t even played against Akali, but they&#039;re still banning it. I almost feel as if Akali is only being banned so much as a weird hate bandwagon that doesn&#039;t really make sense. I ban Blitzcrank in just about every game I play because that&#039;s a champion I personally don&#039;t like playing against. Is blitzcrank good? Not really. Do I flame riot 24/7 because Blitzcrank is op and his hook is too &quot;unfair&quot; to play against? No, I&#039;m aware of how to counter blitz and if I ever decide to ban my second most hated champion, Lee Sin, I&#039;m aware of how to completely stomp such a useless support. Half of you I feel like don&#039;t even have that much of a right to complain, because Akali is pretty much garbage unless you&#039;re in really high tier gameplay. Do you honestly think that the bronze akali you faced once was honestly good at akali in any way shape or form and you weren&#039;t just unaware of how to play against her? \n\nTL;DR Akali isn&#039;t that annoying to play against, people just don&#039;t take the time to learn how to play against her. People need to stop coming for riot&#039;s weave over their own ignorance. Y&#039;all are pretty much not in the elo where people are abusing Akali, yet you&#039;re still complaining about her and it doesn&#039;t make much sense. If you&#039;re going to complain about a champion complain about Darius or Garen because they&#039;re probably 2000x better of a pick down there than Akali will ever be.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2018-12-04T09:34:06.313+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"Counterpick =/= Counterplay","replies":[{"poster":"The Trent","date":"2018-12-04T09:43:33.119+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BeatzBoyFTW,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pJ1FqHMp,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-12-04T09:34:06.313+0000)\n>\n> Counterpick =/= Counterplay\n\nYikes try playing Overwatch then.

Even if I pick someone who isn't a strong pick against Akali, I deserve to know if she has any small weak spots I can abuse into.

I mean everyone already got used to Aatrox&#x27;s dominance after his rework, when will Akali &#x27;s turn comes?\n\nI didn't say that at all first of all. Akali is a high skill cap champion like Riven. They have their counters EX: Garen, but a good Riven that deserves to win has plenty of ways to still win. By abusing Akali I literally just meant using her high skill cap to your advantage like for example Riven. People in challenger are also abusing Riven, I don't know if that isn't obvious to you considering she only gets buffs besides being the only champion that can consistently have her mains staying in challenger. Akali's W really isn't that hard to play against like literally it has a 20 second cooldown. Just go in during that time frame it really ain't that hard. If she stays back, that's your call to shove because she sucks at csing while under pressure. Calling any high skill cap champion weak is just saying you're not in diamond or challenger. Whch a ton of the people complaining about her aren't in. Akali can't spam Qs no matter what. she can literally spam 2 and then it goes up to like 5-6 later on in the game if you're doing your combos perfectly. Unless you don't think similar abilities like Kled's W, where if you go anywhere near him while it's up, you will lose the trade, are unabled to be counterplayed (literally the counterplay is just wait for it to be down), I don't understand where you're coming from. It's not even that good in teamfights. Just move the teamfight away from the shroud or use aoe abilities in it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The thigh guy","date":"2018-12-04T09:46:11.351+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"You see.

Cass took the hextech freezing item which would always reveal my position in shroud and then she would just spam q and follow me in it without actually having to see me. If I tried to go in for a trade, using AKali's q/e/ r changes her model to be facing whatever she's throwing them at, giving Cass a free stun on her ultimate. Malzahar just used very smart usage of his ultimate and silence and would usually win fights if I dragged them out for too long. Not to mention I was a free kill if Malzahar asked for a gank. So I can't agree with you as Malzahar and Cass have been my hardest match ups as Akali and in both of the games mention I actually got first blood by roaming, so I was ahead. The people I were playing against were very skillful at their champion and tbh very focused on the game. Always reacted asap and they were the ones making the plays. Malzahar wouldn't wait for me to go in on him, he would just flash R and there's his jungler with the chain cc. Cass knew she had a huge advantage with the way her ultimate works and if I didn't stay on the outer ring of my circle, the smoke would fade outwards revealing me and allowing for her to use her e. So idk I think both the match ups you listed are skill match ups. No one counters anyone. Also just saying but Malz has his shield for the micro stun too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BasedNerd","date":"2018-12-04T11:24:15.287+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cass and Malz have hard cc lockdowns that will instantly dick Akali.

I've seen a few recently like building hextech protobelt or the ice one and using that before you throw out an ability. It's like her shrowd creates a situation where you have to think harder than you usually have to in most match ups and it's really getting to people.

They are the same people who think a high banrate = a low winrate because they dont understand how percentages work. Akali is fine. In fact Im not sure Ive EVER lost a game or lane to an Akali since I started playing this again. People think because a ban rate is high there is something wrong with a champion which is utter non-sense. Ban rates mean nothing. I perma ban yasuo just because he is annoying! But having an annoying kit doesn't mean the champion is effective at winning games which is what this is really about. Akali has an annoying kit which means she gets banned a lot just like zed, pike, yasuo, illaoi, ect. That doesn't mean she can win games or needs a nerf!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeddite","date":"2018-12-04T09:42:28.999+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Her stupid walking animation is annoying to watch.","replies":[{"poster":"The Trent","date":"2018-12-04T09:45:11.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jeddite,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pJ1FqHMp,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-12-04T09:42:28.999+0000)\n>\n> Her stupid walking animation is annoying to watch.\n\nAgreed. Whenever I play her I spam S (S is keybinded to stop which stops every movement action you're character is doing) and her weapons spin non stop. Idk why they made her do that every time she pauses. I think it's cool how she moves when she turns around though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Free Roll","date":"2018-12-04T09:55:54.813+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Trent,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pJ1FqHMp,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-12-04T09:31:40.023+0000)\n>\n> I keep seeing Akali hate threads but I feel like a huge point is being missed here. Personally, I don&amp;#039;t find Akali that hard to play against. Counter picking her is pretty easy as all you need is a champion that can aoe or lock her down in her smoke. Gragas, Poppy, etc are all amazing picks against her. She&amp;#039;s banned often which means the people that want to main her don&amp;#039;t have enough expierence to completely stomp and the people that play against her don&amp;#039;t have enough expierence to counter her. The first time I played against Zoe, I hated it. Then I realized just how freelo she is if you pick a decent counter pick and just side step her sleep pre 6. I think if less people banned Akali and took the time to learn her weaknesses instead of focusing on her strengths, a lot of people wouldn&amp;#039;t be so blinded. I know people who haven&amp;#039;t even played against Akali, but they&amp;#039;re still banning it. I almost feel as if Akali is only being banned so much as a weird hate bandwagon that doesn&amp;#039;t really make sense. I ban Blitzcrank in just about every game I play because that&amp;#039;s a champion I personally don&amp;#039;t like playing against. Is blitzcrank good? Not really. Do I flame riot 24/7 because Blitzcrank is op and his hook is too &amp;quot;unfair&amp;quot; to play against? No, I&amp;#039;m aware of how to counter blitz and if I ever decide to ban my second most hated champion, Lee Sin, I&amp;#039;m aware of how to completely stomp such a useless support. Half of you I feel like don&amp;#039;t even have that much of a right to complain, because Akali is pretty much garbage unless you&amp;#039;re in really high tier gameplay. Do you honestly think that the bronze akali you faced once was honestly good at akali in any way shape or form and you weren&amp;#039;t just unaware of how to play against her? \n> \n> TL;DR Akali isn&amp;#039;t that annoying to play against, people just don&amp;#039;t take the time to learn how to play against her. People need to stop coming for riot&amp;#039;s weave over their own ignorance. Y&amp;#039;all are pretty much not in the elo where people are abusing Akali, yet you&amp;#039;re still complaining about her and it doesn&amp;#039;t make much sense. If you&amp;#039;re going to complain about a champion complain about Darius or Garen because they&amp;#039;re probably 2000x better of a pick down there than Akali will ever be.\n\nBetter question is why people like you post this stuff? what is your motivation? Guess what by match history you have played vs an akali 3 times in your last 40 matches....yet somehow you have such a strong opinion \"whats the problem shes fine\" I am sure she is when you never play against her lol. So why do you really care?","replies":[{"poster":"The Trent","date":"2018-12-04T10:04:33.791+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Free Roll,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pJ1FqHMp,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2018-12-04T09:55:54.813+0000)\n>\n> Better question is why people like you post this stuff? what is your motivation?

I'm sick of seeing all the hate towards Akali and I don't think that riot should have to take action because of a bandwagon that doesn't make much sense. If they nerf/change her, it should be a thoughtful nerf/change that makes sense, not a nerf because the fanbase wants one rushed. I've been spamming league a LOT recently so bringing up my past 40 matches is literally nothing. That's like bringing up today and yesterday. I play against Akali 3 times in the last 2 days, that's a decent amount considering the time period. If it was 40 games over a month, your point would be valid. You didn't even try to mention the fact I got mastery 5 with her, so playing as her, for like 20 games in a row, where I was playing against some pretty smart people that countered me pretty well. You're also assuming I don't play on other accounts which is pretty common in League. I just told you why I care and why what you've said makes pretty much no sense. I'd love to play against her more, with how much practice the meta sheeps that play her have gotten with her, it's a free win. \n\nI wouldn't suggest trying to ask questions like this considering they could just be turned back on you. What was your point in posting this on my thread? What is your motivation? Judging by the minimal research I did, aka looking at your profile icon I can see you're into KDA. AKali is part of KDA, is this why you have such a strong opinion about the people who comment on her. So why do you really care?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JackMcSnipeyz","date":"2018-12-04T23:31:51.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an adc i have 0 counterplay to her, so yea, she's gonna stay banned.","replies":[{"poster":"The Trent","date":"2018-12-05T00:05:14.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JackMcSnipeyz,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pJ1FqHMp,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2018-12-04T23:31:51.441+0000)\n>\n> As an adc i have 0 counterplay to her, so yea, she&#x27;s gonna stay banned.\n\nAn adc doesn't have a lot of counterplay to pretty much any assassin... That's kinda where your support comes in. Sadly most meta supports are kill supports rn so you probably don't know the luxury of your Sona/ Janna support smashing Akali's face in every time she goes near you. Rakan works extremely well too.

Am a support main can confirm literally all I have to do to peel akali is interupt her dashes and then buy a locket. Like it really ain't hard.
