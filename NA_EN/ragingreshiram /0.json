Today rolls around, and he finds out that what happened, happened, and changed his password. He waited on the game and STILL sent another message right after he changed his password. Concerned that me and my other friends may get hacked is there any way to stop this or prevent this from happening again?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-22T21:34:10.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as you haven't clicked on the link and submitting any information, you should be okay!
