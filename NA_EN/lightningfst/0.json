I could be wrong though. Then LoL client crashes, restarts with a spinner and I can hear things going on in champ select in the background but have no UI.... until champ select cancels and then I end up back in the lobby. Now I've got a dodge queue and minus a few lp...\r\n\r\nBeing a dev myself I understand things happen so I'm not going to be bent out of shape over the timer or lp, but please look into this and fix so it doesn't happen again.

I could hear client sounds and \"click\" on things but i couldn't see anything so i had to force quit and take the dodge penalty.

The dump file error can happen when bugsplat fails to get you logs, but there may have been another error about disconnecting from champion select.  Just to be safe, I suggest going over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide just to make sure everything is in order.
