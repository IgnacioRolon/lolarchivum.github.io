Leaving your teammates by themselves doesn't make the game any easier on them, regardless of what caused you to leave, so a leave is always going to mark you with AFK and possible LPQ's. To avoid those, it's best to try staying in the game if you can and then start troubleshooting outside of the match. \n\nAside from that, let's try to make sure your network is able to get a better signal to our servers.
