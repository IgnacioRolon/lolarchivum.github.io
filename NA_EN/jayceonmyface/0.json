There are some game communities that handle voice chat admirably (Mech Warrior Online comes to mind), and others that leave you scrambling to find the mute button. My concern is if League does require you to mute voice you'll be worse off than you are right now. I've seen players learn to play this game when they're primarily on voice chat with their friends, and it results in players who ping less. Inevitably people will ping less frequently a year after voice chat is introduced than they do before it is. Currently muting chat doesn't effect you too bad because most important content is via pings, but if you lose voice *and* pings then you're in a pickle.\n\nWhile there likely will be some players who remember there are people on the other side of the monitor and behave better, there are also players who have gotten use to raging at their monitors instead of typing out their frustrations. I don't think there'll be a significant improvement in behavior with a voice system, but it would be significantly harder to regulate.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ThwartinMaPlans","date":"2017-09-22T21:20:15.483+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"literally anything negative you say toward someone is 'toxic\" \"you salty\"  league community is a bunch of teenagers enabled by a bunch of moderators.

If they are not inting, and just severely tilted, they are just going to react worse out of anger at being misunderstood and unfairly accused of something, and if they are inting you are just giving them attention for it and giving them a reason to do it more (because lashing out appears to be working to get others to pay attention to their frustration).\n\nIt is much more effective to shift over to their side, appear as an ally, then bring them back to rational cooperation with the rest of the team by making them feel like a part of the whole.","replies":[{"poster":"SnakDatSmilesBak","date":"2017-09-27T19:56:20.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup I get what you're saying.

How are you going to pass on anything but misguided confusion?\n\n\nAs I tried to say before, the chat policies you find \"a joke\" aren't there to protect people's feelings. It's there to crack down on players using it to vent or fight each other instead of playing the game. Or in your case, to stop you from spamming ff and surrender before delivering your post-game Major Payne speech.","replies":[{"poster":"Jayceonmyface","date":"2017-09-28T08:04:19.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Alright, since we're getting into it now, let me start by saying, you're an idiot, and let's move on from there. \n\nI am not wrong about the ban system, if the admins find even ONE THING wrong in what you said, they will not overturn it, ever, end of story, unless you're a known spender and give dollars away to them on a daily basis, you are the lower tier of what they care about, there is a million points to support this. \n\nAt giving up at 15, let me explain since you utterly ignored that section of it just to ad hominem like the little spastic you are. At 15 minutes my team is either feeding with a 25-6 kill lead on the enemy team, and our T2's are down, the game is over, there is no returning from that at all, it's a blind pick, or ranked, you're fucked, it's not like dota where you can solo carry if you try hard enough. It just does not happen unless you're in a party with the synergy of a God, I'm sorry, but you're wrong. \n\nThat being said, we move on now to the \"ToS is bull\" The ToS more or less states that any negative 'toxicity' is a bannable offensive, that being said, we say that your entire response first off to this forum post was toxic, and within the ToS I can ask you to be banned for invading my safe square, your response to my response was also toxic by your logic, and your defense of the ToS, so now I am asking you to be banned, you have made me upset and now my happy circle is breached, Rito please ban this man for making me feel upset.\n\nNow then, to the final parts of this. If you don't give a shit about what I say, prepare to lose, end of story. I am 100% sure me going 10-3 by 10 minutes gives me some grounds to give tips about the game, easily. It's not hard to use logic, but some people are just too stupid to understand the basics, and get carried through bot games thinking they can join in on normal, blind, or ranked games and then get really fucked when people call them out on being stupid. \n\nThink of it like this, you get dropped into a blindpick game, your team is relying on you as much as they are everyone else, everyone else is doing fine, you're not, you're the problem. You can't mollycoddle it, if you're the weakest link, we are obligated to call you out on being the weakest fucking link. Jungler isn't ganking by level 6? He's a weak link, top lane is going 0-5 by 10 minutes? He's a weak link, and you can blame the jungler just a bit for not ganking or fail ganking. \n\nIt's a team game, if the team isn't doing well, best to just throw in the towel, bow out, and try again, not slog out a 40+ minute match pretending you're Tyler1 and carrying as yet another smurf Draven account, doesn't work like that. To that end, you should be obligated to call people out on their fuck ups, when your child breaks a glass, do you just roll your shoulders and go \"Gg nice gank\"? No, you slap his wrist, and tell him not to do that again. If your friend gets into a fight and gets his ass kicked, do you just go \"Lmao nice\" no, you give his head a shake and explain to him it's not a good idea to fight people two times your age and size. \n\nThe Point i'm making in all this, League likes to mollycoddle the stupid. The players who don't want to win, who just want to go \"lmao it's just blind shut up\" or \"Lol who cares just a game dude\" they mollycoddle these scum, these people who legit join games just to troll, and yes, this is trolling by the way. You as a person, are obligated to call out people's fuck ups and try and help them better themselves. That is your god given right as a human being to help your fellow man, and if helping your fellow man means he needs to have his pants pulled down infront of millions just to have him laughed at, you had better do just that. \n\nAlso, the chat policy is there to protect people's feelings. Because you can be reported for saying \"Can you learn to jungle and come help me out here?\" because that's 'toxic' it's not venting, it's not even toxic, it's telling someone to get their head out of their ass and start playing. \n\nStop being a baby, grow up.","replies":[{"poster":"Sorin Alucard","date":"2017-09-28T17:14:07.109+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're ignorant af man lol \n\nGood to know you wasted time typing that cuz all you did is prove me right\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jayceonmyface","date":"2017-09-29T07:09:16.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lmao, you didn't even read any of it, get out kid.","replies":[{"poster":"Sorin Alucard","date":"2017-09-29T14:40:05.340+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} \n\nStill proving my point","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sentient Collect","date":"2017-09-27T03:29:16.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Jayceonmyface","date":"2017-09-27T09:27:03.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You brought nothing to this conversation and infect wasted everyone's time who read this, remove yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"SnakDatSmilesBak","date":"2017-09-27T16:29:36.237+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get off your high horse.
