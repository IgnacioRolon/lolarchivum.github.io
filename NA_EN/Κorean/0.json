I changed some settings in the game.cfg and suddenly when i walk from side to side, it seems like it's lagging alot. I uninstalled the game 2 times, and deleted the game.cfg folder 3-4 times. Nothing worked, if anyone have a solution i would appreciate it, if you do. Comment below please.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-06T16:40:51.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reinstalling should have fixed any issues as a result of changing settings or game files.  This sounds like a network issue like packet loss.  I suggest running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) to know for sure.  The results should also provide some troubleshooting steps specific to your issue.  Let me know what you find.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Κorean","date":"2017-04-06T13:46:27.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"b","replies":[]}]}
