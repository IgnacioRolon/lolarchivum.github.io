It&#039;s obvious that countless others have the same issue... Do you guys not see this problem? Is it too hard to solve? Or are you actually trying to get less people to play your game?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-03T02:10:05.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why do you think riot has any control over the speed of your internet?\n\nThat is just straight dumb. Your internet speeds are based on your service provider (primary cause), the route taken by your internet traffic (which has a lot to do with the service provider and location), and the slowest point along that route.\n\nNone of those things are things riot has any control over. If you had read any of their networking blog posts, you would know they are constantly working with ISPs and other networking companies to improve the routing of data to their servers so it takes more direct and fast paths.","replies":[{"poster":"Ima Cut U Up","date":"2017-05-03T02:24:19.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, hello, how are you? Hi.. ya, so it's not my connection bro.. I can download from other sites just fine... so do you still want to talk down to me and try to buttfuck riot?

It has steadily gotten a lot better. I believe there is a place to report issues like this, if it is an entire town or county experiencing the problem (all likely connected to the same ISP or physical network).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
