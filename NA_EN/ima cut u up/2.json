If two players pick the same position it could 'roll dice' to see who wins or something. This could just be a guideline and if people still want to troll pick they could, but it would be a more solid way of picking positions and I think it's reasonable and easy to code. Just a thought.\r\n\r\nThis is at least better than seeing who can type fastest and hoping nobody troll picks your call.","replies":[{"poster":"Ima Cut U Up","date":"2014-12-14T10:02:30.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nobody agrees or disagrees with this?
