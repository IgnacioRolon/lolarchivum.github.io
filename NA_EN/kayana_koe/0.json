I played a game not long ago as Miss Fortune. My support: Leona. We were against a Caitlyn/Lulu botlane, and I thought we were doing fine but I noticed my Leona was recalling pretty often. So I asked her and I quote: \"Please don't recall so often, Leona. You're going to miss out on all the exp.\" For some reason this led her to decide that I just sucked too badly for her and she chose to abandon the lane and move into midlane. Leaving me to the mercy of 3 people in the bot lane, with no help from anyone because Leona had convinced the team that I sucked too badly to help. Well, all but one other member of the team who was having connection issues. \n\nSo how does a player deal and cope with the stress of this type of situation? My attempts to defend or push my lane during that game were rendered pointless without my support around, and 3 people always on botlane.\n\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}\n\nEdit: I was hoping for a serious conversation on the matter. It's something I really need help with right now. I'm still bamboozled over this one game and how I could have done better in this situation..","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-07T01:13:57.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd take Tiny Twitch's suggestion here.

The best thing you could do at that moment is go push out mid and try and take that tower as a 3 man group.\n\nOther than that report the Leona at the end of the game for unsportsmanlike behaviour and go on with your life.","replies":[]}]}
