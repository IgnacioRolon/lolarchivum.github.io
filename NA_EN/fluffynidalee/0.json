Your CPU is actually pretty bad, and 100% usage + crippling lag spikes on 4t i5s is normal. A lot of people are upgrading to 12t CPUs for gaming in the last year.\n\n..Just not in games like LoL, it _should_ be fine on two threads. What is using the CPU resources? Is it entirely the game client?","replies":[]}]}
