Both are completely different. However, I have noticed that if I used my login name, it says, \"Internal Server Error\". Whenever I use my ingame name, it lets me in. This fluctuates on occasion (Basically, sometimes I have to use my ingame name or my screen name to log in, and it changes which one I have to use to log in with frequently). Which one seems to work more? \r\n\r\nThe second one is about the game itself: I am pretty much limiting myself now since I have noticed that ingame, sometimes the game freezes, but I can hear the music in the game still playing. Because of this, the game has been forcing me to do a soft reset of my computer just to log into League again. This has happened on all the computers I have been on, be it a laptop, macbook, desktop, whatever. It happens in game, putting my team at a disadvantage. Has anyone else experienced this issue? It's not a computer issue since I have tried it on an old laptop, it happens, and even on my new desktop built from the ground up, been stress tested, and updated, and it still happens. \r\n\r\nAnyone have any ideas for these two issues?","replies":[{"poster":"Ritaldo","date":"2014-09-29T23:39:06.104+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats very weird for the website issue, dont know anything about that :S. Hopefully someone can answer your question. Yea alot of crashes have been happening in game, make sure that the game can handle whatever else you have running on your computer (maybe you have alot of exterior apps running as well), if not try reinstalling/fixing the client, see what happens.  League has been dropping alot of peoples connection for some reason, your internet hasnt been acting up at all has it? Try checking your firewall and making sure its not interfering with league at all. Try these and post back.\n\nRitaldo","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-09-30T03:07:45.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Mister Punches!\n\n***Ritaldo ***gave some pretty solid advice regarding your crashes.  Hopefully, I can address your first paragraph about logging in.\n\nFor the website and for the Log-in screen, both require your Username and your password.  Many players have their Username and Summoner Name as exactly the same, but make sure that you are using your same Username you use in the Log-in screen as the website.  Remember, a Username cannot include spaces, which is more than likely the reason for the \"Internal server error\" as this appears when a space is entered for the Username.\n\nAs for your in-game crashes, if you are still experiencing issues with those, respond back to the thread and we'll help you out! :)","replies":[]}]}
