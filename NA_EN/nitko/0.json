I love it. Its a fantastic game. Buuuut my computer is starting to get me in trouble with the system because it’s so old. It turns off whenever the charger is even slightly bumped. \r\n\r\nNow, usually its not an issue, but lately its been more touchy, and it kicked me out during a ranked game. 8 people reported me, and immediately i have 5 20 min queues. I was trying to get rid of em in norms, and it just shut off again. I honestly don’t know what to do... I’m in high school and can’t afford a new computer right now, i wanna keep playing, but i don’t wanna get permabanned for a technology issue. \r\n\r\nCan someone assure me that this most recent incident wont permaban my account? And should i stop playing till i get a new device?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-19T04:23:08.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leaving multiple games shouldn't get you perma-banned, but I wouldn't recommend going into any games knowing there's a chance that your pc might be turned off at any moment. I would try to take some steps to ensure that power cord won't be moved or disconnected at all, or possibly look into getting a new cord that won't mess up on you. If this were me, I'd goto my local pc repair shop and talk with them about any possible solutions you could look into.","replies":[]}]}
