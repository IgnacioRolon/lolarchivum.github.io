A toxic {{champion:267}}Nami. Don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen that. Usually it&#039;s a {{champion:11}}Yi or a {{champion:92}}Riven.&quot;\r\n\r\nAnd it got me wondering what other people think when they see stuff like that. Which champion/player combos are the most toxic for you guys?\r\n\r\nNOTE: This isn&#039;t to insult anyone or to stir up trouble. I&#039;m just genuinely curious about the experiences of other people.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-07-15T02:23:39.898+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"HAve you ever seen a toxic bard?\nI've been a toxic bard. its why I stopped playing bard.","replies":[{"poster":"VeterenMantis","date":"2016-10-18T06:19:02.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol no, but, I have been toxic to bard.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AÃ­r","date":"2016-07-15T00:36:57.893+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"The enemy team every time I play Soraka.\n\nMy team every time I play Yorick.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf210310095","date":"2016-07-15T02:27:57.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who isn't angry when you play yorick?","replies":[{"poster":"Raeyxx","date":"2016-07-15T05:01:33.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Truuuuue story.
