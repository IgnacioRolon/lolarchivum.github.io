Updated to the new client today (I was never against it just never got round to updating it) and have had two timeouts during Champion Select. The first I shrugged off, accepted the -3LP and waited for my next game. However having happened a second time within a few hours I've lost another 10LP and have a 30 minute wait. Is it the new client or am I just being super unlucky? (My internet doesn't die as I'm browsing at the same time).","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-20T18:44:51.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having trouble keeping you together with your group, and leaving you behind.  This might be more of a connection problem and not with the client but you return to the legacy version to rule out possibilities:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nOtherwise, your best bet would be to go through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and make sure that your connection can keep it together while on the updated version.
