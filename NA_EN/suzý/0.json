When the freezes occur, everything but the audio freezes, the characters, mouse, unable to interact with UI, move camera, etc. I haven't tried alt+tabbing during a freeze but I will definitely attempt it.\nWhen the game unfreezes, the game doesn't go to the current time by speeding up from where my screen initially froze (which may mean it's a latency issue). Instead, after unfreezing, the game just jumps to the current time as if everything played out normally and I was the only one that froze.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-19T22:01:00.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha. In this case, it seems that your freezing is more than likely caused by a bad system driver interaction or an issue with your hardware. I strongly suggest working through our [**Bugsplat & Crash Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) to address the most common culprits for the systems you're experiencing.\n\nLet me know if this caused any noticeable change in your symptoms.","replies":[{"poster":"Suzý","date":"2017-02-21T14:18:11.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sweet I've did everything on that link and it seems to have drastically reduced the freeze time! I still get a very minor jitter when I first play on this computer and it introduces a new action (For example the first blood, or first dragon kill will cause the game to freeze a bit).\n\nBtw, I don't know if this has to do with the issue but for some reason, when I check LoL on the Programs and Features tab on my PC, it always changes the date as if I re-installed the game. http://imgur.com/a/mADsU Here's a screenshot of what I mean.\n\nSo in the screenshot it says I installed league on the 21st, but I installed it months ago. It's been constantly changing the dates so when I check it on the 22nd, it will undoubtedly say LoL was installed on 22nd. Do you know why this is happening?

It's possible that your remaining jitters and installation date behavior are tied to League missing assets or having to repair corrupt assets all the time. I'd like you to run system logs with our [**HRT App**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367), then attach them to a [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so one of our tech specialists can work with you on troubleshooting these issues further.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Piltover Customs","date":"2017-02-17T00:05:37.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd cap your frame rates at 30 or 60 (or 59? is that an option).\n\nYou don't need uncapped on a laptop it will cause it to overheat/wear out quickly.","replies":[{"poster":"Suzý","date":"2017-02-18T00:50:25.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried to a cap the frames and it seemed to have fixed it at first, but the problem occurred.
