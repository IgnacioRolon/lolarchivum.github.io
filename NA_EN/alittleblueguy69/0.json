However, I just got an instant feedback notification and I'm pretty sure Riot finally punished an intentional feeder who sold their items for a tear and 5 sapphire crystals. Thanks for doing the right thing uncle Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Jennifer17","date":"2019-12-29T18:56:34.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"why did you say Kappa.\nKappa is the sarcasm emoji of twitch.tv","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-29T19:06:23.983+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also what a short frog spirit from Japanese folklore, that in some popularized things, would say it at the end of their sentence with a point that perhaps didn't even need to be said, except to point out how obvious it is to them, *kappa*.\n\nSince it really became commonly used in the 20's and 30's because it's Greek, it surely doesn't belong to Twitch.
