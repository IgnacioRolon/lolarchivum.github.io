I have the same issue ReD3served described, but I am playing from Germany on EUW. I don't find a post on the EUW-Boards. so I post this here. I have done most of the steps to troubleshoot it (just not the Safari setting seated to default, yea I am playing on Mac :D ). I hope you can help me too, got this problem since a few days ( I think 3). My little brother playing over the same Internet connection doesn't have this problem... \n\nYour Loki","replies":[]},{"poster":"BoxOfFedUpFrogs ","date":"2016-09-11T23:50:13.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm using a comcast network and i'm having terrible in-game lag with chat connection issues so i'm guessing it's a bit more widespread than just login.","replies":[]}]}
