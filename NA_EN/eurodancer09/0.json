My fps does not go down. My  ping does no go up. It lasts about 5 seconds. I use an ethernet cable. I've checked ping websites and redownloaded league, etc. Wondering if anyone else is having a similar problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-13T02:52:20.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those random lag stutters are most likely happening if your connection is having packet loss problems. Essentially that means chunks of your connection are getting lost or corrupted before the data ever reaches our servers which means there's not a lot we can do on our end. Luckily we can check for packet loss pretty easily using the [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) to analyze the network logs from that match. Copy and paste what it shows you here so I can take a look with you.","replies":[]}]}
