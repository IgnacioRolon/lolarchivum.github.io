What most people in the community tend not to realize is that bronze/low-elo is kinda a \"mixed bag\" of sorts that is about 70% luck-based with the occasional \"I can 1v9 carry\" mixed in every so often. Because of this, I tend to tell people who want to get out of there to take lane-bully characters (darius and rumble being two of the easiest to win lane/snowball with while still having monster lategames) and to more importantly mute/ignore your entire team and essentially think of them as mobile pink wards. \n\nWhile you did include the \"what\" part in your idea (bad players use lane bullies), you didn't elaborate on the why which is so crucial to understanding what the amorphous blob of bronze is. The reason these players take the lane bullies isn't so much because of the difficulty required to play them, but more so the skill required to play against them, something few players in the low tiers are capable of and is ultimately what differentiates a mid-tier silver from a mid-tier bronze. Trash-talking is usually the side-effect, as some of the people who play this style tend to not actually understand the matchups themselves and thus go in thinking that it's their own skill carrying them and not the brutal to lane against characters.","replies":[{"poster":"JeffLeague123","date":"2017-04-28T23:49:47.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! Yeah then there are those people who one trick somebody and when they get banned or taken they just go a troll champ and say \"I only play (Champion name)\" And when they do and they face their main. You'd expect them to also know the COUNTERS or ways to beat  the laner because they \"MAIN\" them and should have way more experience playing them and FIGHTING THEM but no, no they just feed and have no idea what they're doing. There's kind of a reason why people should main around 3 or 5 champions and 1 for each role though i don't know how toxic players deal with autofill....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"yesnobanana","date":"2017-04-28T02:49:11.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=itfArlR6,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-28T00:54:56.986+0000)\n\n> It is just kid trash trying to boost their own egos, no escaping it in free pvp games.\n\nmost 12 year old kid has large online balls tbh\nin a bad way","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cocho","date":"2017-04-28T04:36:45.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I watch a {{champion:412}} go in on a 2v5 hook only to have me leave him while he gets blown up, then get ??????? pinged.
