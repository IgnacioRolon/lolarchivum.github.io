Well {{item:3025}}  Gives 20% cdr meaning the ad carries can spam their abities more often. And the mana given helps them use more abilities as well. On top of that the sheen will help them do more damage and the Unique Passive will help your team catch somebody out.\r\nTell me if this is just downright a dumb thing or tell me if this might be a good idea.\r\nThank you for reading! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-10-09T16:05:37.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on the adc itself and the situation.\n\nMost cases {{item:3078}} will normally outright be found more useful.\n\n\nBut there are some situations where it will be far better to have {{item:3025}}","replies":[]}]}
