For example, awhile ago I made a Tencent post using mostly copy-pasting of information given to us by Tencent and why protesting Riot would be a bad idea. Most of it was quotes, but at the end I added insight as well. Just try to not word for word spam stuff. ^^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2017-06-04T02:40:09.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something like those repeated \"Zilean puns\" threads gets tiring real fast.","replies":[]}]}
