My team is one of many in a large community called Junior Bot Gaming,  and we take pride in that fact. We&#039;re looking for a talented Mid Laner and Support MAIN to join the family and to start progressing. Gold V and above is preferred but if you&#039;re Silver I or II and show a distinct desire to improve yourself you will be considered. \n\nThe team is a family, but it&#039;s also a structured and organized team. By joining you agree to being at any and all practices OR letting me know the day before hand, you also agree to play champs you may be a bit uncomfortable with to secure our team comps. An interview will be conducted before the tryouts and while we&#039;re looking for skilled and talented players, attitude/dedication will play a big part of the tryout overall. \n\nIf you&#039;re interested, DO NOT add me in game as this will result in your application being denied. Fill out your interest in a reply structured as followed.\nName:\nIGN:\nAge:\nAvailability:\nChamp Pool:\n\nThank you everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"jbdakidd23","date":"2017-03-06T22:06:19.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name: James Brown\nIGN: Jbdakidd23\nAge:20\nAvailability: weekends and most nights after 4 eastern.\nChamp Pool: Thresh, blitz, nautilus, leona, karma, nami, janna, soraka, lulu, sona, braum, alistar, brand, malz, zyra, bard, lux, morg, MF, taric, tahm.\n\n   *my op.gg probably shows alot of thresh but I'm much better with more team oriented supports.
