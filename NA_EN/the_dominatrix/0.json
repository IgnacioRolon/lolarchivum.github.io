For Sivir everything, she throws got adjusted to what her new weapon. Her AAs AND her Q. Ofcourse it would look strange if her weapon woudl completely change after leaving her hand. But why is it ok for Ashe's arrows to change colour after leaving her bow? I'm not talking about the arrows with slow effects or even her E or R. Just her AAs should (and could, since its ok for the Sivirskin) be recoloured imo.\n\n2. If the fact, that Sivirs abilities did indeed get adjustments to match the weapon in her hand, isn't enough, we can look at the nautilus skin: He even got completely new particls on his shield. Not jsut a recolour to match hs silver armour, but the small shields have a completely new silouet.\n\nConcluding: You say, that the Ashe skin can't get any adjsutments on her projectiles (neither a recolour of her AAs, nor a recolour of her abilities (like changing the white of the freezingeffect to a red or any other darker colour etc.)) because she is just a 750 RP skin. That would be ok for me, but at the same time, you have two other new skins on the pbe, who have recolours of projectiles and even completely new particles on some abilities.\nTo me this feels very inconsistan. Why do you follow the rules for 750 RP skins reguarding Ashe and then at the same time pretty much ignoring them for two other 750 RP skins? Could you pls enlighten me?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-03T17:46:52.541+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"*(Excuse the copy pasta from another post)*\n\nWe change a particle when it's something that would look really awkward if we didn't.\n\nFor example, Nautilus' Titan's Wrath shields on his base skin would look really out of place with the new armor he's got.
