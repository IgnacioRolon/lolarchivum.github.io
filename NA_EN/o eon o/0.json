Everyone on my team was a bit better than his teammates, aside from our mid of course and we ended up losing with that Fizz going 18/4/x.\n\nI checked his op.gg and the guy never got past gold for the last 3 seasons, never having great win rates or kda&#039;s either. This season he is solo carrying 1 vs 9 mid plat matches with ease (70 percent win rate over his last 20 matches), putting up extremely good win rates and kda&#039;s on most of the champs he&#039;s playing.\n\nIt got me wondering if Riot actually punishes people that get their account boosted or if they just let it slide.\n\nRepost since I had it in the wrong section at first\n\nEdit: I also added the guy and he pretty much implied he was boosting the account without full out saying it. Not looking to get him punished, just really curious how they handle situations of boosting","replies":[{"poster":"cluvie","date":"2017-04-05T23:38:27.890+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, we do.

Now, what could have happened is the guy made a smurf, won a game, and the support wanted to duo with him because he got carried. Orrr he finally got sick of being silver, and hired someone to boost him.\nThe guy who advertised told me that he's been reported over and over again and you guys don't care if someone boosts an account from a 2nd account because technically he's still playing a game with his own account.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-04-05T21:27:54.141+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Account sharing is against the terms of use, and MMR Boosting will result in a 14 day account ban and loss of all Ranked rewards the first time, and a permaban the second.","replies":[{"poster":"o Eon O","date":"2017-04-05T21:31:33.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do they ever get caught though?
