At all. Try it out. He just uses his normal auto attacking animations without the exaggerated squash and stretch on the drill. I would love this to be fixed since its one of the most satisfying parts of the legendary skin.\n\nBug: \nhttp://i.imgur.com/HyCNMdn.png\n\nWhat it's SUPPOSED to look like: http://i.imgur.com/uuR2Xy2.png","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-14T18:35:41.957+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Bombkirby,\n\nThanks for the report!

It came back in one patch after I reported it but it got removed again. Hoping it sticks if its fixed again. x_x I know how bugs can be though.","replies":[]}]}]}
