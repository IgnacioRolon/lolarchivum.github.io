At all. Try it out. He just uses his normal auto attacking animations without the exaggerated squash and stretch animations on the drill. I would love this to be fixed since its one of the most satisfying parts of the legendary skin.\n\nBug: (The drill stays grey, small, doesn't perform the special squashing/stretching animations)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HyCNMdn.png\n\nWhat it's **supposed** to look like: \nhttp://i.imgur.com/uuR2Xy2.png\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYE_aH7Nvbs#t=114","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-22T17:30:02.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the report!
