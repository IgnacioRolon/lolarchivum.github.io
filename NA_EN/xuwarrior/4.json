I didn't even notice the gromp nerf in any of the updates.  When the fuck did this happen??  You cut the damage scaling in half, are you serious Riot?\n\nI guess I can stop my countdown, you didn't like tanks appearing in the LC$, so you are slowly removing them from viability again to make room for more flashy playmakers because you apparently want to promote \"counterplay.\" \n\n Let me ask you something Riot, when was the last time you gave a shit about counterplay?  I'm legitimately curious to find out, because there are more pressing matters that should have been attended to before this.","replies":[]}]}
