(or speed projectiles ? ) . I Main evelynn from the start. She struggles now to clear jungle . So Why not buff her Q again ?\r\n\r\n2)There is no DFG anymore in game . (we all remm. DFG) . What about reverting her &quot;E&quot; spell to Magic DMG ? Now it deals Physical one\r\n\r\n3) Why not revert her R nerf . Make it % from MAX health not current health. So she can kill someone even from 1 HP\r\n\r\n\r\nLike i said im not designer . Im followin current meta and she has alot problems  If I could get some asnwers on that would be nice\r\n\r\n\r\nIdea Part about her W:\r\n\r\nWhat if she could lower CD on W for each AUTO-atack she gonna make on enemy champion . It would be kinda Trade-off. You want be more slippery make more auto atacks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall discussion .
