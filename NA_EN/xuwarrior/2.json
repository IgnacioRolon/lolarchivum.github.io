All you ever have to do is waveclear and roam while he struggles to clear mid. This is why I think he didn't need a nerf. I don't think such a style is actually good in competitive or higher ELO. I've played him a lot before giving up on him due to this exact reason. You're an amazing duelist and teamfighter but they can just waveclear and avoid you/splitpush. If he had solid mana efficient waveclear he'd probably be broken though.","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2016-02-18T23:41:48.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is also a massive lane bully, the W nerf was to nerf his ability to catch and hold people in the early game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"La Barbotte","date":"2016-02-18T01:40:23.915+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"you might not be able to answer me but is there a dragontamer/ dragonslayer swain comming with those changes :3","replies":[{"poster":"TheOminousShadow","date":"2016-04-09T08:02:13.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, please make this happen.

Unpopular =/= needs a rework in my eyes. Please don't change the essence of swain if you plan to because the ult is so cool -- it reminds me of warlocks in WoW but reverse (instead of sacrificing health for mana, you mana for hp) since you have to balance his mana regen with hp regen.
