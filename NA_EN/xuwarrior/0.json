Now he doesn't need the speed, doesn't need the attack speed, and can't use the power, but has insane CC to go with it. It's no wonder he's doing well now, and I will not play that joke of a champion who will never find his Zen point thanks to needing jungle due to lack of realistic sustain in lane, needs high damage Q's early in order to jungle while holding ungodly amounts of CC, and then no other kit impact aside from the ultimate. That's why I haven't used him, and will not until he gets somewhat reformed back to working.\n\nAlso, what's a Bronzie doing calling out a Bronzie? I play mostly normals, which makes me lack in the grind that has become standard in ranking up over the years. I don't prefer the playstyle of playing a champion simply because I counter that one, and would rather play who I like, and I liked Skarner.

Or he can Q his way up to the enemy, slow, then kick.
