She gains Crit after XXXX shots.\n\nBecause that's already Caitlyn's passive.\n\nAs I said in the last thread, all you need to do is make her gain focus faster. For example:\n\n**Focus**\nIf Ashe has not attacked in the last 2 seconds, she gains 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 Focus stacks per second. At 100 stacks, Ashe will critically strike on her next basic attack. Thereafter, Focus stacks will reset to an amount equal to her critical strike chance.\n\nDo this and her DPS is still lower while holding her fire to gain Focus stacks (it takes 6 seconds to gain 100% crit chance, but if she just autoattacks normally she can do a lot more than two shots in that time), but it will still be charging fast enough to make a difference. The idea would be to reward holding your fire for last hits instead of just spamming autoattacks, encouraging good play and synergising with her Hawkshot passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gr8job","date":"2015-03-17T17:53:44.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like the idea of it only proccing off of champions.
