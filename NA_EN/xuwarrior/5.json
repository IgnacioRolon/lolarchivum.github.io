Since it isn't poetry the rules do not apply to your post. You reworded a few words with the express purpose of mocking the original post. Which is the definition of sarcasm. So tell me. How is it satire? Just because you think it is satire does not make it satire. Here I will show you what you did which satire or sarcasm was rude. \n\nYou're trying to mislabel my Sarcasm. Revising the words and adopting the structure to take on a converse meaning in poetry is considered satire, and this is precisely what I have not done.\n\nAs for the rest I think you simply do not understand what I am telling you. You threw out your point on ad hominem because you knew you had no backing for it then just called it satire because you don't like what I said.\n\nYour entire argument is on the premise that it is that it's satire and not sarcasm, and you haven't sufficiently proven this. You cannot include such an assumption underlying your argument until it is proven, and you have not.","replies":[{"poster":"Troy242621","date":"2015-03-26T19:49:30.795+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.","replies":[{"poster":"Daedalus871","date":"2015-03-27T00:56:52.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how a comment about Meta enforcement turned into a grammar debate.","replies":[{"poster":"Troy242621","date":"2015-03-27T02:45:02.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Red herring is more like it >.>.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EnderForHegemon","date":"2015-03-27T00:11:31.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"[/popcorn]","replies":[{"poster":"TheFrozenIsles","date":"2015-03-27T12:44:58.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give some of that. \nI have to say this post are the most fun.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
