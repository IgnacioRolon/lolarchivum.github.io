It looks like you might have an unstable connection in this case.  You're able to login just fine but something is preventing you from downloading assets and reaching pvp.net properly.  My suggestion would be to run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot any instability and clear things up.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-07T15:52:30.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to know more but I'm not sure where exactly in the client you're at.  When this freezing happens, are you already logged into the client or before?  Have you recently updated your Windows or Anti-virus?   A screenshot might be able to clear that up as well!  Let me know, I'm curious to know more.","replies":[]}]}
