Not a list of champions that are overpowered, a list of champions that will lose you the game singlehandedly when picked 99% of the time.... Most of these champions can be really good, but are just too difficult to play casually.\r\n\r\nBlitzcrank... Why?! Because well he&#039;s only good for pressing a q, and a single knock up (same thing lots of champions have btw). However with him unlike a champion like pyke who does a pull and can stun, he has absolutely crap damage unless played full ap, in which case when he pulls the team better be ready to fight an odd matchup.  Yes, he can get some picks, so can thresh, so can pyke, so can lux, so can morgana, so can zyra, bard, the list goes on eh?  The problem comes down to the fact that he has no other function at all. He has no anti peel, he has absolutely no support capabilities. Look at alistar, he can actually knock someone away if needed. blitzcrank can&#039;t do that, he can just pull them towards the team. \r\n\r\nThresh... Now yes thresh CAN be good. He has great utility, great peel, can get good picks. HOWEVER he is way too difficult for someone to play, the delay on the hooks takes good timing, very broadcast when done, lanterns can go astray and be prevented from clicking on, his flay is difficult to use in the correct direction. So yes, he is a GREAT champion, however unless you are a thresh one trick, people should truly stay away from him.\r\n\r\nEzreal... Another champion with POTENTIAL, however you miss your skill shots you do 0 damage. And lets face it we&#039;re not pros, so we miss about 90% of our skill shots.\r\n\r\nAurelion Sol... Another one that if you could hit everything maybe.. but even then you&#039;re still just gonna get outclassed by a veigar or zoe or something else with CC and damage that isn&#039;t so difficult to control. To top that off, the difficulty of the champion is ridiculous to actualy hit everything and play with your team well.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s the start of my list, probably should add more as they come along. Again, list isn&#039;t for broken champions that can literally 1v9 and a noob can play them (looking at you garen), but for those that you just want to ban when you see them on your team.","replies":[{"poster":"Sorin Alucard","date":"2018-10-10T19:14:32.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haters gonna hate","replies":[]},{"poster":"BLIGHTBRINGER","date":"2018-10-10T18:23:54.302+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"For me: {{champion:412}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:119}}{{champion:236}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:238}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-10-10T20:46:54.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:103}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:238}}  you know.. the same champs everyone else hates","replies":[]},{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2018-10-10T18:59:00.988+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:238}}  when he or his items are broken\n{{champion:157}} ...\n{{champion:16}} boring to face, completely warps the game around her\n{{champion:92}} most broken champ in the game, if played by someone that mastered her\n{{champion:107}} 1shot cat\n{{champion:78}} brainless\n{{champion:133}} 1shot bird\n{{champion:76}} usually useless and free loss, if on my team\n{{champion:81}} see Nida's comment\n{{champion:117}} polymorph\n{{champion:11}} ...rework him\n{{champion:85}} autowins lane vs melees, can be oppressive even vs ranged with the AD build (that got gutted?), because of the stuns\n{{champion:75}} boring lane, gets permakited, too feast or famine\n{{champion:497}} overpowered\n{{champion:17}} autolose on my team\n{{champion:34}} unfair champ vs meless","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2018-10-10T18:44:20.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mine is:\n\nBlitz \nShaco\nBrand\nTahm\nLulu\n\n(But I picked based off of hating seeing them in the game not based off of win or lose or anything)\n\nOh... and Yi.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alzon","date":"2018-10-10T18:27:27.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:53}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:12}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3083}} \n\nðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤","replies":[]},{"poster":"what you deserve","date":"2018-10-10T18:25:53.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:14}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:80}} \n\ni dont even understand how riot's \"3 ad\" is the only nerf graves is getting after being the #1 jungler for 3 seasons","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lets have shrex","date":"2018-10-10T18:25:55.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Mine : {{champion:3}} **Every single marksman** {{champion:157}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:117}}","replies":[]}]}
