Game gets to champ select and when its supposed to oad the loading screen, it's just a black screen I can't get away from. I can't alt+ctrl+delete out of it, nor can I get out by any means necessary, I have to hard restart my comp which is a pain in the bum. I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling with no luck. Used both old and new client, no difference. My graphics card is fine and working properly. (I have other, heavier requirement games I own that have no problems loading.) I have also tried mulitple sweeps with anti-virus and no problems. Please if you could make any suggestions I'm at a loss and just wanna get a game in. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-19T04:11:21.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like League is unable to properly access your graphics device.
