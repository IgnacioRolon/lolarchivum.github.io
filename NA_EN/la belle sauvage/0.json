So far I&rsquo;m unable to reproduce something similar and as a result the dmg output seems low. (Typically I&rsquo;d produce between 25k and north of 40k if I was playing well). \n\nAny Teemo players who run this Mallet into Bork and attack speed care to comment and possible share their Rune Page setups? \n\nAnd is there anywhere outside the client I can see my rune setup per game? \n\n**Detail:**\n\nHi all, I&rsquo;m a newish player (since early season 6) and I have to say that I like the potential of the new runes. And to get it out of the way I&rsquo;m not overly concerned with how much BE is earned by match, it&rsquo;s either going to be addressed and change or it won&rsquo;t. \n\nI play Teemo Top in Normals (and mostly in flex this prior season). I followed the Mallet, BORK build that IPav ran and had a lot of success with it. I ran Fever/Resolve opting for the bonus ARM/MR and the 50+ HP in the Resolve Tree too, with the idea of taking a lot of attack speed. I think this is fairly standard, but again I ran an off meta rune page. I ran HP/LVL yellows (somewhat standard) Full Attack Speed Reds and Quints, and all AP blues. \n\nI was very comfortable with this setup in all matchups. Not to say I won them all or it was always easy. However, if I lost, I lost because I failed at something, or simply was outplayed. I wasn&rsquo;t losing because of my setup or my item build.  \n\nI realize this is low for Teemo, but most of the time I averaged between 25K dmg if I played okay and north of 40K dmg if I played well. I concede his most efficient build is full AP, with different Rune page- but my goal wasn&rsquo;t damaged. I just mention here to underscore my current issue. \n\nMy current issue is I have yet to come close to that DMG output since the new runes. I haven&rsquo;t yet found the right mix of runes to produce something similar to what I was running before the rune update.  THe best I&rsquo;ve done since the update, is 2-1-4, output about 14 K dmg and was able to CS at 8.6/min which by the way for me is quite insane. I typically CS at 6.1/min. Before you go all &ldquo;that sucks Bello get gud&rdquo; in regards to my average cs/min, realize at the beginning of the season I was averaging 3.1 CS/min. I&#039;m work in progress, what can I say? \n\nTrue, it&rsquo;s only been a few days, and this weekend I plan on diving into by experimenting with the rune setups and tinkering with builds.  Any Teemo players running into this who used to run similar setups? \n\nLook, I fully admit, I haven&#039;t got enough games to draw a conclusion on yet, however, Teemo does feel a bit off in respect to the Mallet/BORK/AS build. I say this after a full season of playing him anytime I wasn&#039;t playing ranked or with friends who wanted to play Top lane. \n\nYet, he feels off to me, I am not stating that he is broke, needs a buff or nerf, just trying to understand the new system and  wondered about other Teemo Players.\n\nI&rsquo;m curious to know the thought of other Teemo Mains and which pages your running if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind sharing. \n\nThank you and see you on the Rift. \n\nBello.","replies":[{"poster":"Chuuu","date":"2018-11-14T06:04:55.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw \"iPav\" and legit shed a tear :(\n\nBack on topic,\nTeemo mains: Hangsim Teemo (look him up on YouTube) is probably your best bet.

It makes dealing with teemo that much harder. It adds a ton of free damage to his poke to the extent that I've seen and been against many Pantheons that struggled early game against me just because of all the damage that goes through his aegis. This is compounded that when you're close enough to the enemy champ, Aery procs twice in one poke due to poison duration, especially with his shrooms. \n\nIt's really nasty and feels a bit overpowered, especially when counters to him struggle a shit ton with his poke compared to how easily it was to deal with Teemo on Pantheon or Renekton.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-10T19:54:31.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you go glacial you don't need to build mallet, so there is that","replies":[{"poster":"La Belle Sauvage","date":"2017-11-10T20:00:20.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wondered about that.
