Everyone keeps telling me it&amp;#039;s just you bla bla bla, and I keep telling them they are stupid. now i&amp;#039;ve played a lot of league games, and I can say if matchmaking doesn&amp;#039;t want you to win, you are not going to win. because if you do it gets worse until you lose and cannot win at all.\n> \n>  you think i&amp;#039;m lying, unless you have a team, they will lower the quality of the players you get and raise the enemies quality until you cannot carry. i mean you may be going 31/10 feeling like you are amazing, next game you are 10/40, what happened is it took note of how good you were and shoved it right up your (insert bad words here) and now you are stuck in silver, fighting platinum level players (platinum being the highest actual tier in the game because to get to the other tiers you have to invest money into the game (arguably gold is highest but i managed to force my way into plat by 1v5ing the gold players harder than my teammates could feed them) )\n> \n> now I&amp;#039;ve come to accept this, honestly i want to get to bronze as fast as possible because I want fair games. and based on what matchmaking has been doing to me i&amp;#039;m already getting bronze players so hopefully it will atleast lower the enemies skill level. so that&amp;#039;s my goal, get to bronze this season so i can enjoy easy games and feel like climbing.\n\nRiot controls 100% if you are going to win the next game or lose it.  Only an AFK can change that.  This is the bedrock of how the game works.  Riot wants full control of all games to balance it as they wish.  It's totally unfair to the best players, but Riot knows they are addicted and new players need wins to get addicted.  Yes, this game is analogous to a drug and Riot is the pusher.\n\nMake it more fair Riot, by scrapping this system and match people only at their level.  It would make all games close and more fun for all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Dog","date":"2017-10-20T13:44:54.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they really need to take previous season into consideration, almost every ranked game ive vsed people who were high gold or plat the previous season with a couple like that on m team (borders are a giveaway) and the highest ive ever been is s5 so now im having so much trouble climbing because no matter how good i am near my own level i cant compete with people who were plat or high gold its stupid","replies":[]}]}
