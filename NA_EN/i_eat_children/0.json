There may be a recent windows update issue that's messed up some resolution scaling.  You can try fixing this by right clicking the LoL icon, selecting properties, compatibility, and checking Disable Display Scaling on High DPI Settings.

There may be an issue with your configuration that's making your resolution all kinds of wonky.  As a first step, I'd like to try resetting your game configuration to a fresh slate:\n\nFirst, log on then make a custom game. Alt+Tab out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named Config.\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nHopefully, that will get you fixed up!","replies":[]}]}
