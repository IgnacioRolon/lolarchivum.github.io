She could have a baker's hat, apron,and maybe a dough or flour spot on her cheek. When she uses her ult it could make a cloud of flour, or when she uses any of her attacks some kind of flour smoke animation. That is probably asking for a lot though, but the baguette sword and baker's attire would be awesome. Please consider it!","replies":[{"poster":"MaliceCity","date":"2014-02-04T23:20:42.631+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"She could be in a set with Sinful Succulence Morgana!","replies":[{"poster":"BeanerofBinkis","date":"2014-02-05T22:18:06.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morg, Panth and Fiora would be a great baker group haha","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Graves III","date":"2014-02-05T07:05:48.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pantheon NEEDS to get a baker skin first.\n\n{{champion:80}} MY PROFESSION!?
