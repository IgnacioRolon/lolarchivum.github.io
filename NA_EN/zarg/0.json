I suggest grabbing our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and trying a reinstall that way.

I did use ccleaner. I did try the HRT but the tool will not work since there is nothing to reinstall, it asks me to point where the launcher.exe is, but it does not exist.

Usually, the HRT can resolve most install errors where a previous install was borked. \n\nWe'll need to have our tech team dive into some system logs to determine how to resolve this, so I recommend reaching out in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). If you use our HRT to simply grab some logs, you can attach them to your ticket and expedite your service.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Zarg","date":"2016-10-27T22:04:41.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've already sent in a ticket yesterday, so I'm just waiting.

Not only that, but they definately modify the Registry.\nHaving it installed on a seperate drive could definately have messed up the uninstaller (if it's looking for files on the same drive, but they are located on the main drive, so would not have been removed).\n\nIt's one of those two things which is likely causing the problem.\nA Fresh clean install direct onto the drive (not in a VM) is definately preferred to make sure such an issue is not going to exist moving forward.","replies":[{"poster":"Zarg","date":"2016-10-28T00:32:17.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or, maybe just, like, hear me out, we could simply install the game on a VM, zip that up, put that on dropbox, download on host. wooooooow.\n\nLeague's \"installer\" doesn't install anything. if you open the package of it, the launcher isn't even in there. It's just a bunch of DLLs and a cab file for them.\n\nI'm not a noob when it comes to computer, I'm a power user / tweaker with an extensive knowledge about troubleshooting.\nWhat you are telling me is completely irrelevant and also incorrect along with assumptions which are also wrong. The only files that are \"installed\" to the main drives are keys in the registry which are nothing but pointers to tell apps where something is (They also carry various settings), and in this case, I manually went through the registry and removed any leftovers from the older installation, they don't cause errors like that. Ccleaner also didn't help the matter in any way. Besides, installing on a different drive does not \"mess up the uninstaller\", the directions of where the files are located are spoonfed to the uninstaller by the installing software, which doesn't work in this case.\n\n\nDownloading the launcher on the VM will not be any different than if it was a portable install on a flash drive. The entirety of the game is installed through the launcher, which the installer *downloads*. It does not contain it.\nIf LoL needs registry editing after that point, I can deal with that. A broken installer that will refuse to operate due to nonsense, I can't.\n\nPlease. I can take care of my computer on my own. Never had a single issue with it, or any other game for that matter with similar context, for that matter.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-10-28T00:48:00.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fine.\nGood luck.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
