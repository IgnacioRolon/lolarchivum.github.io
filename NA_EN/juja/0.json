{"poster":"JuJa","date":"2017-08-27T15:32:07.766+0000","title":"Level 30 account got reset to level 1","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have an account that used to be named \"JooJaaCaa\" in which I reached level 30, purchased champions on, played ranked (S4 - Plat), etc.. I just recently got back into the game and when I reset the password and logged into the game, it asked me to choose a new summoner name. Upon choosing a new summoner name \"JuJa\" it brought me to the main screen and I am now a level 1 with no champion purchases, rune pages, or masteries.\n\nHere is the account on the various stat tracking sites -\nScreenshot: http://i.imgur.com/Y2PKPWr.png\nDirect Link: http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/39057045/JooJaaCaa#/ranked-stats\n\nScreenshot: http://i.imgur.com/kNh5A8P.png\nDirect Link: https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=joojaacaa\n\nYet when I logged in and was asked to change my username, I am now listed as a level 1 with no champs, masteries, runes, etc. -\nScreenshot: http://i.imgur.com/w1Ooojc.png\n\nI also just opened a support ticket under \"I am having technical issues.\" but wasn't sure if that was the best place to look for help.\n\nTICKET #31528812\n\nThank you!\n\nPS. It looks very similar to this issue (minus the URF part) - https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/cvAYZJpV-my-level-30-account-got-reset-to-level-1\n\nEDIT/SOLVED: Phatmage was able to help me and solve the issue via a ticket I opened.  The account I was attempting to use \"JuJa\" was not the one I thought I was signing into (JooJaaCaa).  Phatmage identified my other account and helped me get logged in.  Thanks everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-08-28T01:46:42.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You probably don't know how to reset the password","replies":[{"poster":"JuJa","date":"2017-08-28T03:34:39.134+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I think I just had too many accounts and have lost the account names.  I used the \"forgot username\" feature by entering in my email addresses and seeing the accounts associated to them.  When I did that, I got 2 results back - one that is my main account JuJaCan and one that is an old account I never used JuJa (Broporo discovered that for me).  But there's still another account I own called JooJaaCaa that must not be associated to either of those two emails, so looks like I need help recovering that one.  Hoping Broporo who answered below can help!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-28T00:27:40.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strange, it looks like JuJa and JooJaaCaa are actually 2 completely separate accounts. You didn't login and change your summoner name, that was the first time JuJa had ever logged in so you needed to first create the Summoner name. You'll be able to login to JooJaaCaa by using the username/password associated with that account.","replies":[{"poster":"JuJa","date":"2017-08-28T03:31:57.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for checking!  So it looks like the JuJa account was one I created in the past but never used.  Could you help me recover the JooJaaCaa account?  I don't have the account name that is associated to it.\n\nI'm thinking the account is tied to one of my discontinued emails, either my college email or old @msn that I deleted.\n\nAppreciate the help\n\nEdit: Phatmage helped me out and solved it for me, thanks again for taking a look!","replies":[]}]}]}
