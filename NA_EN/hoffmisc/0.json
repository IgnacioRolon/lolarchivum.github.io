This **Wisp** is controlled by the player and moves at 70% of Serina's movement speed. **Wisps** are invulnerable and untargetable.\n\nWhen Serina respawns all **Wisps** will fall to the ground and enter a dormant state.\n\nWhile Serina is dead all dormant **Wisps** rise from the ground and act as wards.\n---\n#***Q: Spirits, Strike***\n\n**Passive:** Every 12 seconds Serina generates a **Spirit Orb** to a maximum of 5. If a nearby allied champion is below 40% of their maximum health then a **Spirit Orb** will automatically be consumed to heal them for 45/55/65/75/85 + (0.15 Total AP) health. This can only occur once every 10 seconds.\n\n**Active:** Serina launches a **Spirit Orb** to a target location, dealing 70/95/120/145/170 + (0.45 Total AP) magic damage and slowing all enemies hit by 25%/35%/45%/55%/65% for 2 seconds.\n---\n#***W: Vital Drain***\n\nSerina drains the life from an enemy, dealing 60/85/110/135/160 + (0.15 Total AP) magic damage to the target enemy. This damage increases by 0.25% for every 1% of the target’s missing health and grants Serina a stack of **Vitality**.\n\nEach stack of **Vitality** increases the health regeneration of nearby allies by 5% per stack and all stacks of **Vitality** are consumed the next time Serina heals an ally to heal them for an additional 20/25/30/35/40 + (0.05 Total AP) health per stack consumed.\n---\n#***E: Unburden/Burden***\n\n**(Protector) Unburden:** Serina sends the souls of the fallen to an allied champion to lighten the burdens of their soul, healing them for 90/125/160/195/230 + (0.45 Total AP) [3% Serina’s Maximum Health] health while increasing their attack and movement speed by 11%/17%/23%/29%/35% + (0.05 Total AP)% for 3 seconds.\n\n**(Reaper) Burden:** Serina commands the souls of the fallen to plague her enemies, Serina channels for 3 seconds and deals 85/120/165/210/255 + (0.45 Total AP) [1.5% Serina's Maximum Health] magic damage over the channel while slowing by 16%/22%/28%/34%/40% + (0.03 Total AP)% for the duration of the channel.\n---\n#***R: Spirit's Divide***\n\nSerina channels the powers given to her from Thresh and Senna, causing her to alternate between her **Reaper** and **Protector** stances.\n\n**Protector Stance:** Serina gains 15% increased Armor and Magic Resist. Additionally Serina increases the health regeneration of nearby allies by 45%/50%/55%/60% of her own.\n\n**Reaper Stance:** Serina gains 10% increased Ability Power and 20% increased Base Mana Regeneration. Additionally the base cooldowns of Serina's abilities are decreased by 1.4/1.6/1.8/2 seconds (This applies before cooldown reduction).\n---\n#2) Lore\n---\n\"Some things were created by accident, others were created with purpose. I was created by a wandering specter's greed.\" - *Serina, The Unborn*\n---\nThere are three main people in my story, all of whom you know.\n\nLucian and Senna, the couple bound to slay the darkness in this word. \nThresh, the spirit bound to torment souls for all eternity.\n\nThis story has been told time and time again.\nBut not from my point of view.\n\nLucian and Senna went to slay Thresh, one of the numerous banes of this world.\n\nThis went well, until Thresh sprung his trap and locked Senna's' soul away within his lantern.\n\nThe loving couple, now separated.\n\nThey both grieved for the loss of each other.\n\nOne more so than the other...\n---\nWhile she could not see him,\n\nWhile she could not hear him,\n\nWhile she could not touch him,\n\nShe could feel him.\n\nShe could feel his sorrow and pain, she could also feel the joy this tragedy brought to her captor.\n\nAfter some time, she wished she could feel neither.\n---\nAnd after more time she slowly began to realize all of the things she could no longer do.\n\nShe could not hold him,\n\nShe could not speak with him,\n\nShe could not laugh with him,\n\nShe could not be happy.\n---\nThis tormented her, to no end.\n\nThresh has reaped many souls over the years, many are in that lantern of his.\n\nWhile many of them had sorrow of their own, Senna's was unmatched at the time.\n\nThey wished to help her, but the Warden would not allow it.\n---\nThresh has collected many souls, too many to count.\n\nBut he craved more.\n\nBut he was only one being.\n\nHe needed another.\n---\nThresh came up with an idea, one that would allow him to collect more souls than ever before.\n\nHe would make a partner.\n---\nWhile it pained Thresh to let so much of his collection go, he knew that in the long run it was worth it.\n\nThe body of an unborn, created but never meant to live in this world.\n\nThe souls which he had painstakingly collected just for the occasion.\n\nMagics darker than any mortal could imagine.\n\nAnd Senna.\n---\nWith a portion of Senna and Thresh combined within this body of the unborn, I was created.\n\nMy mother I do not know, for her soul resides in the lantern to this day.\n\nMy father I wish I did not know, however similar we may be.\n---\nAs for Lucian, I do not know.\n\nHe avoids me, he probably detests me.\n\nI am the offspring of his most loved and hated after all.\n---\nDo I like to take the souls of others?\nYes, it delights me.\n\nDo I take them against their will?\nNo, I only take the souls of those already near death.\n\nI let them roam and come back to me as they please, although they stay close for the most part lest my father gets his hands on them.\n---\nTo bend and break,\nTo mold and make,\n\nTo take and give,\nTo those who no longer live,\n\nTo reave the souls of others, lost,\nTo leave them trembling in the dark.\n---\nI am my mother's child, I care for the souls who stay with me, I protect them. I do not own them as my father does.\n\nI am my fathers child however, reaving souls is part of who I am. Its what I do and why I was born. Its how I live.\n---\nI believe my mother would be proud of me to some extent. I stay true to who I am and yet I do not destroy the lives of others as my father does. I console them, care for them. \n\nBut then again I can never truly say this with confidence, for she has remained in the lantern for the entirety of my life.\n\nMy father is irritated that I don't aid his cause. But his collection is his collection and my ‘collection’ is my 'collection'. Aside from the fact that I was born from the souls he carries I want nothing to do with him.\n\nI wish I could speak with Lucian, he avoids me. \n---\nIs speaking with him the one thing I desire most in this world?\nNo.\n\nWould it be nice to speak with him?\nYes.\n---\nIn the very least, \n\nOnce he passes, \n\nI wish to hold Lucian's soul.\n\nI wish to keep him from suffering the same fate as my mother.\n\nI wish to keep him from my father's torture.\n\nThat, is my one and only wish.","replies":[{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-01-13T02:56:16.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like Wandering Wisps, it means that if a player died in the middle of a fight they wont feel completely useless and will have something to do. It helps with the fun factor, like you defied death, but the best thing is that if you do fight in the middle of a fight, the wisps that are wards can help with the mop ups in that enemy players will find it hard to escape. So only Wisps that have been placed in a previous death time can act as ward after you have placed them. The wisp that a player would currently be moving would have a sight radius right? So unlike other wards her wisp are completely dormant until death, and thus do not have a timer, and could not be seen or targeted by enemies? Vitality stacks are interesting i really like that mechanic, GJ. Liked the lore, its a good read.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-12T04:33:47.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First and foremost, this lore is INCREDIBLE.  Your story evoked so much emotion, personal connection and resonance with existing League lore it's iNSANE.  I typically have to fight off a cringe when reading amateur designer's back stories; especially as someone who has written hundreds of them in his career.  This, however, was a true work of art, and accomplished with virtually zero walls of text.  Bravo!\n\nThe kit itself is simple, clean and effective.  None of it necessarily has that \"wow!\" factor, but it all works and is very cohesive.  I particularly like the passive component of the Q, as if the wisps really do have their own agendas and control over their actions.\n\nThe passive, while incredibly interesting, worries me.  I look at a lot of ranked games and see Soraka's and Janna's who rarely if ever die... as a support champion, it makes me worried that this passive will see little to no use.  Might I recommend finding a way to make it more practical somehow?\n\nWhat is the cooldown of the stance dance Ultimate?  That would help me get a better idea of her play patterns.\n\nThe numbers overall look very conservative to me.  Serina's damage is practically non-existent.  I feel they could use a considerable bump- especially her Q.  Conversely, I'd be worried about just how much she's healing her allies for, given Riot's firm stance on how careful they are with introducing healers into the roster these days.\n\nFinally, while I get the symmetrical nature of the E, I don't think a channeled heal synergizes with an allied speed boost.  You're stuck there channeling and meanwhile  they're oooouta here!  If they need to run, it's likely that you do, too.  I'd suggest finding an alternative secondary effect to the heal.\n\nOverall I am highly impressed with both the theme and execution of Serina's lore, and the simplicity and simultaneous effectiveness of her kit.  This concept shows a lot of finesse and restraint, which is a very hard skill to acquire in an environment like this.  My only major criticism is to perhaps open up a little more with one of these abilities and truly give Serina something iconic and impactful.","replies":[{"poster":"Hoffmisc","date":"2015-01-12T13:38:43.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, so, I made a few changes:\n\nThe base damage and AP scaling on the Q's active is higher.\nThe additional healing from **Vitality** (W) has a lower base.\nThe the movement speed from ***Haste*** has been changed to attack speed.\n\nI'll make a few more chances later as this post was a little rushed but thanks for huge amount of feedback.\n\nEdit: Haste is no longer Haste and Waste is no longer Waste.
