We was talking 'bout which champions we main and I mentioned along the way that Shyvana was one of my mains, which then began our conversation about AP Shyvana. He had asked, \"Do you play AP?\", to which I replied, \"Nah, I only go AD on all Junglers I play.\" This than led to my journey to playing AP Shyvana for the first time and Shyvana in general since months. \n\nThere was a total of 3 games of Shyvana. The first game, I felt pretty alright about and was not too shabby for playing her again in awhile since I went 6/4/5. I was so shocked with the way her E legit took out more than half an opponent's damage, wtf. I also took Dark Harvest every Shyvana game; adaptive damage ehehe. They had a fed Caitlyn that game since our ADC who was a Jinx just stood there hesitating most of the time to engage or not, but it's whatever since we still had fun despite losing the game. {{sticker:sg-kiko}} \n\nSecond game came around, and my final score was 2/5/8. In this match, my boy Vasyl {{champion:15}} (little precious one) joined Koko and I. Although I performed worse than my last game, I had Koko to cheer me up and encourage that I was doing just fine as her. I started to enjoy this AP Shyvana style very much, so much that it placed several smirks across my face multiple a times that you could HEAR MY THOUGHTS THROUGH MY FACE, YA JUST HEARD IT BY LOOKING AT ME. Dragon come out of the damn wall, \"WUSS GUUD\" and POP THAT- mm. MMMMMMM.\n\nLast game rolled in and I was feeling great, I was so confident and excited and YOU KNOW I WAS SMACKIN' THEM LIKE HOW I SMACK THE LAST ICE CREAM BAR IN MY MOUTH BEFORE MY YOUNGER SIBLING CAN TOUCH IT WITH THEM DIRTY CRUSTY HANDS (wash yo hands Angelina).{{summoner:1}} 12/3/14 y'all, MMHMMMM. This game is where my wheezing and uncontrollable laughs began oh boy, let me preach..\n*BOOM*, *RAWR*, *WHAAACk*, EVERYONE. QUAKING. \n\n\n*Intense sigh of accomplishment.*\n\n\n\nI am aware that I am late on this yes, YES HELEN WE ALL KNOW. {{summoner:14}}","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-28T09:15:35.935+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sound like you've had more to drink than I have.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sancre","date":"2019-06-28T09:38:36.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"After this i'm confused and frightened\n\nI think it means that he/she enjoyed Ap Shyv, but I'm can't tell","replies":[]},{"poster":"MordridtheBlack","date":"2019-06-28T10:35:58.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP Shyv hurts like a truck but it is such a 50/50 play\n\nif you do bad early/mid game, you are pretty much screwed\n\nthere's also the separate issue that while her E still does decent damage in her human form, it does far more in her dragon form...which can take time to get up...so there are times when you can't engage on a fight because you won't have dragon form for a good bit and are stuck popping shots in base form and not doing as much damage","replies":[{"poster":"Luxanet","date":"2019-06-28T10:59:50.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MordridtheBlack,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=trEzaJta,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-06-28T10:35:58.811+0000)\n>\n> AP Shyv hurts like a truck but it is such a 50/50 play\n> \n> if you do bad early/mid game, you are pretty much screwed\n> \n> there's also the separate issue that while her E still does decent damage in her human form, it does far more in her dragon form...which can take time to get up...so there are times when you can't engage on a fight because you won't have dragon form for a good bit and are stuck popping shots in base form and not doing as much damage\n\nOh yes, but despite of all that misfortune {{champion:21}} (ehehe see what I did there), Iâ€™d say she is still definitely really fun to play!","replies":[{"poster":"MordridtheBlack","date":"2019-06-28T11:02:26.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh yeah she is fun to play that way, mainly because the damage is unexpected, as is running ap shyv in the first place\n\nwhile it has become more mainstream it is so different than normal shyv builds (which are tank, or adc) people don't use it often due to the problems it faces because of the reasons I listed","replies":[]}]}]}]}
