As soon as the game window is launched, my mouse speed increases.  It's definitely League of Legends.  I do use Yolomouse, but after disabling it, nothing changes.  I've also tried using a different account and it still occurs.  So it's definitely not user settings.  What could this possibly be?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-29T23:51:14.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The mouse in League is hard coded to change your raw mouse sensitivity after you launch into game, this is working as intended.

I can't comment on why it worked differently for you in the past, but as of right now, it sounds like it's working as intended. I recommend hopping into a custom match to tweak your mouse settings before you enter a live game, to eliminate the awkward transition or discomfort.\n\nLet me know if you have any other concerns.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
