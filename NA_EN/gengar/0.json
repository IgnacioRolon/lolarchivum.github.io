I remember sometime in like April C9 vs TSM, TSM won but I don&#039;t believe it helped them at worlds.  I would have thought that everything before worlds would just consist of games deciding who goes to worlds.  Anyways, would anyone mind explaining it a bit? :D","replies":[{"poster":"Tiza","date":"2016-01-14T22:06:57.118+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you said TSM-C9, I'm going to frame this from an NA/EU perspective.  It's very similar in other regions, but there are some minor differences.\n\nThis is the **Regular Season** of the **Spring Split **of LCS.  The regular season is a \"round robin\" format, meaning every competing team plays every other team at least once.  In the LCS, they play twice.  The purpose of the Regular Season is to determine the teams that get to go to the **Playoffs**.  The playoffs determines the winner of split.  Teams earn **Championship Points** based on how they finish the Spring Split.  Then, we do the whole thing again for the Summer Split, and give out even more Championship Points.\n\nThe Championship Points determine who gets to go to Worlds!  The team with the most points at the end of the year automatically goes to Worlds.  For everyone else, the next few teams play in the Regional Qualifier, where having more points means they start closer to victory.\n\nThis is a pretty simplified explanation, so feel free to ask more questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2016-01-14T22:14:10.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"not really related to the topic at hands...but after watching the 5 EU games now - don´t you think the snowballyness of the games hurts the entertainment of the sport? it really doesn´t seem like there´s much a team can do once they´ve fallen behind...so edepending on the game it´s deceided within 10-25min and then you can go make dishes or sth instead of watching a quick but painfull defeat of the losing team.","replies":[{"poster":"iamleburk","date":"2016-01-15T02:11:17.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weird how the Koreans do it differently. Its basically farm fest until 20 minutes, maybe take out an outer side turret, then camp mid and hope the other guy fucks up. Then after making a pick, take baron and declare victory. Thats why Lux and Leblanc are now big picks over there, because of the way they can easily exploit the other teams mistakes. Also means Tahm + Double AD is probably the best possible composition to have in this meta. Btw when i say double AD i mean like long range ADCS like Varus, Ezreal, Corki, Tristana... Vayne and Graves probably not included in this (they might be powerful, but we are talking literally the best team composition possible). \nUsually the counter to double AD would be an assassin or a big engage like Zac or Malphite (see OG vs FNC), but against a Tahm that is useless because he can save one ADC from a pick and poof you're safe. \n\nAnd for that Origen game, they should have last picked Soraka and flexed the trundle top and the Lissandra mid. Lissandra vs leblanc is pretty even, while Trundle would do really well against the olaf. Meanwhile Soraka gives that silence zoning and allows for more seige. I think Soraka is sleeper OP atm for competitive.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2016-01-15T02:38:14.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just think they respect the snowballing and play it very conservative/save early on to not give away anything unnecessarily. Still, those games got deceided by 1-2fights around 30-40min if they played fairly even. And double AD tends to use Graves jungle a lot recently, as Kindred is always banned and he works very well with a farm-centric early game as is played in Korea atm.\nI really start missing S2...80min games had some lengthes, but at least you could feel the tension all the time instead of just waiting for a team to reliably close out so the next game can start.","replies":[{"poster":"iamleburk","date":"2016-01-15T03:24:21.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the most dominant game was like SKT's Tahm top, Corki mid, and kalista ADC. I actually don't think there is a better composition in this meta, maybe extreme wombo with Lux/MF/alisar or something along those lines could match it, but i dont think would be better. Graves and Kindred will definitely be important junglers, but they aren't the perfect combination im talking about. Every other out draft was mainly a counter to the opponent (like FNC vs OG or JAG vs IM game 2). \n\nActually the OG vs FNC game was very interesting, because FNC first picked poppy, then OG started drafting around poppy (kiting composition, no dashes), then FNC completely fucked over OG's kiting comp, and imo OG didn't respond properly (picking orianna...)\n\nAnd the reason i think the KR meta has gotten so boring so quickly is because now the only objectives really worth fighting for are mid lane turret and Baron, and losing a big team fight usually means losing the game. So yea, objectives became riskier but worth less reward, so Koreans are just ignoring them now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Maszii","date":"2016-01-15T00:32:12.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good post btw!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2016-01-14T21:15:49.903+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"like every sport season: primarily entertainment. \nalso practice and last but not least points that can help qualify for worlds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2016-01-16T12:18:02.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I don't see the point to any of them.
