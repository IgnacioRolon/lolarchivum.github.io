I was kind of hyped after we won despite being so far behind.**\n--GodCarry: nice flame btw.\n\n**Response from Riot Support**\n(03:51:51 AM) SupportAgent: Sadly, you engaged in negativity with players in your game that were flaming, and called them out for their behavior \n(03:52:18 AM) SupportAgent: generally when we engage with those that are being negative (IE calling them out for being negative, or calling them morons) we are furthering the negativity in our games \n(03:52:30 AM) SupportAgent: this does sadly break our terms of use, and the penalty is justified :( \n\nThis rule is so loose and subject to opinion, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they used it to justify 100% of disputed bans. For the most part, I don&#039;t believe I engaged in negativity, however one single message out of frustration could be construed as an insult.\n\n**Background Info**\nI played one normal game yesterday with a very friendly premade. The game went well and no one would have reported me. Today, I played a ranked flex game with a premade I found through my &quot;LF Serious Flex Group&quot; post. I specifically said in my post &quot;No mic.&quot; and I made sure that the group leader had read my post and felt I was a good fit for their group. He didn&#039;t see that I didn&#039;t want to use comms in game. So we queue up, get into champ select, and I tell them I&#039;m going to leave voice until the game is over. They became extremely frustrated before I disconnected from Discord.\n\nOnce we got into game, my teammates were clearly tilted, spam pinging me to gank and spam pinging me the instant I died. After this is when I sent my first message in the game. They began flaming me in chat, questioning why I wouldn&#039;t use voice and questioning why I queued with a team in the first place. At this point, the game felt so toxic I didn&#039;t even want to be there.\n\nI ended the game with equal damage to my two carries. It felt good to know I wasn&#039;t completely carried by my team. I ended with a poor KDA, but I played the best I could at all points in the game and managed to contribute a fair amount to my team&#039;s success.\n\nI also realize muting all may have been the best option for team success and for my own mental health, but muting all and ignoring harassment is never a requirement. I preferred to defend myself and I feel I did so in an okay way. In my opinion, I wasn&#039;t toxic this game. I wouldn&#039;t have spent all this time disputing my reform card if I didn&#039;t truly believe that. Please tell me what you think!","replies":[{"poster":"u n me","date":"2018-05-11T04:22:49.354+0000","up_votes":73,"down_votes":5,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Azthort","date":"2018-05-11T04:35:13.326+0000","up_votes":60,"down_votes":8,"body":"For real lol he wasn't even toxic.

That is not acceptable.\n\nTo be frank, you were already in trouble, and instead of choosing the very reasonable option of muting the person you'll never meet that clearly just wants to beak off (which for me would render anything they say and their opinions on all matters insignificant until such time as they calmed down and regained their mental functions) you responded and made the situation worse, so when the group of toxic malcontents all reported you together and you had still technically committed an offense, you got banned. It sucks that happened to you, but it's already kind of a running joke in the community how much crap people get away with, if Riot didn't at least punish you, how could they continue to defend their position that they take harassment seriously? If you reported them back, and they really did harass you so bad, I doubt they weren't punished in kind, but due to lack of transparency in the system, no one outside Riot will ever know if they were also punished regardless. \n\nIt's a crappy thing when a system meant to try and protect decent folk from nasty hatemongers gets used to take down someone who doesn't deserve it, but it does happen (especially if the hatemongers can find something like return-fire from you to blur the line as to who's really the victim).

What you've said in chat isn't even really an offensive defense, more of an attempt to show that you're a chill dude and you are going to do you. I think being with a premade, as much as it doesn't matter how many reports you get does somewhat influence the attention you receive upon instigating a  manual review. I think you need to be given a chance to adjust to your new punishment tier and that this level of toxicity isn't demonstrative of your desire to return to whatever behavior warranted a 14 day ban, but rather a proactive attempt to redefine your character so as to become a better person and avoid future punishments. As such I believe that you should be given another chance and that if you are given another chance, you should tone your overall chat down volumewise until you are in the clear and off the radar. Then that level of chat will not even net you a chat restriction unless it is frequent enough.","replies":[{"poster":"GodCarry","date":"2018-05-11T05:49:15.723+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really was trying my best to diffuse the situation, explain my reasoning behind not using voice, and remain positive while performing poorly and being doubted by my team.

However you're like a newly released \"prisoner\" after 10 years of being locked up. The eyes are on you for a while for the slightest mishaps. In that situation you just need to mute them and do NOT unmute them. I know it can be a lonely game of league but it's a necessity until you lose the heat and are determined to be a normal member of league society again. It's like trying to fix something without the knowhow makes it worse.

If you were to not play for 6 months and come back and say anything you'd still be banned. So it's number of games played. \nYou were only toxic because the other players perceived it as toxicity. The game I was recently chat restricted for went about the same way, the whole team was begging in chat to report me all game and I was just chilling and bam I got a chat restriction, though I think the two prior games I was a jerk in helped. \nBasically if you try to mitigate damages in chat and the toxic players refuse to calm down you now earned a chat restriction or ban. Kinda sucks really because the extra abusive people can pidgeonhole you into getting punished simply by trying to stop the flame war in the first place. \nAlso more often than not reports are like a herd of cattle, it'll start out with report x and then suddenly y starts to do something a b and c didn't like so instead it's report y and forget about x. The more people that are tilted the more they try to rally against someone. Kinda sucks, I've done it before when I was not in the right state of mind to justify myself.
