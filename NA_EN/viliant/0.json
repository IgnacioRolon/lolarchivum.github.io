Someone I played with said they were experiencing the same thing, my character seems to be stuttering when I move or change direction. My ping is at a constant 97, which is it's usual amount. This has never happened to me before, not even when I lag. I can only assume there is an in-game issue happening atm or somehow one of my settings changed. I'm curious to know if anyone has a solution to this, or if it's an actual problem in-game that needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Viliant","date":"2017-03-27T22:13:04.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I turned character movement prediction off and it seems to have stopped, neat.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-28T01:43:33.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad to hear you got it fixed on your end ^_^!","replies":[]}]}]}
