This has caused a lot of terrible game because in laning phase it catches me out when I try and dodge the q but the hitbox isn&#039;t accurate and it just hits me anyway causing her to full combo.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-20T00:34:28.250+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey g0dcat,\n\nI took a lot at Star Guardian Lux's Light Binding and compared it to her base and the hitboxes are the same.","replies":[{"poster":"g0dcat","date":"2015-10-20T04:48:50.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Alright I understand the hitbox is the same as her classic light binding but I find the visuals on start guardian lux's light binding is misleading","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-20T16:25:59.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Follow up question 'cause I felt similarly when she first came out - Do you think it's just because you've been so used to playing with base particles that this is something that may need some getting used to?","replies":[{"poster":"Lady Septimus","date":"2015-10-20T23:35:02.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that there are a lot of spells with weird hitboxes in general, or hitboxes that aren't very clear. Like when you get hooked by blitzcrank even though the fist was beside you and clearly not hitting you at all, that's the most frustrating. I've had higher elo players say just assume the hitbox is bigger than how spell looks like because the hitbox is bigger for whatever reason or at least it seems that way. In other words, it seems that where the spells end should be the end of the hitbox but there seems to be some space or leeway for that spell to actually connects or not. This probably isn't true, but it certainly feels like it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saixos","date":"2015-10-20T16:52:19.936+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tbh I think it's because the default skin has that fuzzy front that's not entirely clear, while the star guardian one has a really smooth rounded one. The fuzzy one makes it seem like the hitbox is slightly bigger than it is and causes you to dodge a bit wider, while the smooth one makes it feel slightly smaller and so you don't dodge as much. \n\nThat's my explanation for it, it does kinda feel harder to dodge but I think it's mainly psychological. The hitbox feels really big anyway, kinda like morg >.>","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"pripustas","date":"2015-10-20T18:24:26.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Lux is completely broken after that buff.
