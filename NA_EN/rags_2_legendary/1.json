However, dear Rito, **I ask you to keep one thing constant: U.R.F.. **\n\nThe game mode itself is brilliant. Ultra Rapid Fire (U.R.F.) has created some of the most splendid moments that I - and many others - have ever experienced in League of Legends. Fortunately, I do not have to debate why it should come back as it is foretold to be released again. Instead, I must debate how it should come back. \n\n**Whether it be Hexakill: Twisted Treeline, or One For All: Howling Abyss, Riot has shown a tendency to keep attempting to reinvent the wheel**. This strategy should not affect U.R.F. as well. For instance, the consensus is that the original One For All on Summoner's Rift was far superior than the one that occurred on the Howling Abyss. The \"Why?\" for now is unimportant, for it would set me off on another tangent, but it does provide a valuable lesson: not every experiment is successful.\n\nNow, do not get me wrong, I do love experiments. My love for U.R.F. is a testament to that fact. However, like Victor Frankenstein sewing a few body pieces together, I fear U.R.F. will be reanimated in a frightening state. **People enjoyed U.R.F. as it was** - there were only minor areas of improvement. There is no need to prohibit the release of U.R.F. 2.0 because it may seem more interesting to put it on dominion, or more dreadfully, the Howling Abyss.\n\nFurthermore, the few things that could get patched are relatively easy to fix. For example, banning champions outright - such as Sona - was just downright silly. While she definitely was over powered, U.R.F. 2.0 has the capacity to fix the problems rather than band-aid them. A proposed fix would be reducing healing/barrier effects, or setting a cool-down floor (Can't be lower than .5s, for example.)\n\n**I now plead to you, League of Legends overlords, please release U.R.F. as it was before. I believe a few changes would be tolerable, but please do not create a One For All U.R.F. Howling Abyss, or something that will boggle our simplistic minds. Or, better yet, if you do change it up, please release the regular version as well. **\n\nIt only makes sense, for from a scientific perspective, the most favored game-mode would be played the most, and therefore be clearly more successful.\n\n/endplea\n\nTL:DR = BOLD\n\nP.S.. Why does everything have to be a secret? A grand unveiling is one thing, but keeping people in the dark is another thing entirely. Let us, as a community, offer our feedback. What are the current plans for U.R.F.'s release?","replies":[{"poster":"Killer X 12","date":"2014-11-06T08:42:40.334+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"One for all on the howling abyss...such a terrible idea.

Changes i'd be cool with, personally, would be:\nA minimum time between casts so you don't have to ban helicopter hec from the gamemode.

For instance, Zilean's rewind got tweaked, and the number of traps place-able by Teemo and Shaco got limited too. **However, the latter change is better, because it is more general. I**f every champion was tweaked, then it would take the developers forever.

For example, playing a champ like Zed was GREAT practice in my opinion. You can dodge Morg/Nid spears... Just gotta be prepared for it. Flash was up every like 15 seconds also. And i do believe there was a banning phase.. I understand the annoyance with Sona, but that a pretty easy fix. And if you didn't want to play against them just simply ban. Urf was so much fun because it was very fast pace. The amount of plays to be made were amazing to count. Its just what we needed when we wanted to take a break from our stressful climbs. Not even to just BINGE it. Just to play for fun. But honestly switching maps with it like they did on One for All might kill it. We enjoy it because its on the map we all know and love... And because its the same gameplay but more fast pace and thats why we enjoy it so much.\n\nTL;DR: Urf improved players mechanically, and we all love it because its the same exact gameplay but much more fast paced and great to play for fun. Changing the map would definitely hurt it, but i don't dodging a couple skillshots is a problem at all. If anything its great practice to look forward to. They did have a banning phase so all you have to do is take advantage of that. Hope riot doesn't change it too much.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gløry","date":"2014-11-06T22:21:06.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Combine URF mode and Doombots mode, please!","replies":[]}]}
