I think the counter is also innaccurate. IE it will report that I am gettin around 24 FPS, but in reality it will be around 10. Teamfights are near unplayable. Also, it actually seems like the BEGINNING of animations are cut out the most. It seems like with 20 fps I should be able to notice casting animations, but a lot of the time the skillshot appearing is the first thing I see. Riot pls help :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"MCNT052","date":"2017-02-24T07:00:59.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I seem to be having more fps lag, and i say seem because the FPS counter is gone. is there a way to get it back or is it art of the patch? either way, having fps issues was annoying in my last game since there was a yasuo wizzing around everywhere, it made it look like he was flashing more than dashing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-23T23:52:49.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been seeing quite a few reports on this, and would like to find out if something is going down.
