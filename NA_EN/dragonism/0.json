An idea that I have would be to slightly alter the appearance of Mastery 6 &amp; 7 either in color scheme or in theme that would still preserve the unique Mastery feeling (Butcher's Bridge variant?). These new iterations could be used exclusively on ARAM along with the original versions so you could tell if the player mastered the champion on ARAM or SR. (also viewable on their profile page) You would also be able to choose between which of the two varieties to display on ARAM if you have both, unless one mastery is higher than the other, in which the higher mastery would be displayed. (I'm open to different ideas on how to implement and alter this) This would also mean creating a Mastery system for ARAM, which could go either one of two ways. \r\n\r\n*  Start the system from the beginning as if they have never played the champion. (more work intensive and frustrating for players of both ARAM and SR, feels grindy, redundant since Mastery 1 through 5 is based upon time spent playing the champion and can be achieved in any game mode) \r\n\r\n**OR**\r\n\r\n* Split off after Mastery 5. (which I think would be the better and more easily approachable option)\r\n\r\nThe conditions to achieve ARAM Mastery 6 &amp; 7 could be identical to that of SR (Blue Essence + 2 S- and 3 S grades and above respectively), or could have their own ARAM themed twist. (both utilizing Hextech Crafting, with and/or without Blue Essence) Possible Mastery Emote theme/color variation ideas include an ice blue/gold, frosted ice blue/gold, Freljord style/theme gold (whatever that may look like). Jewel setting could also have theme/color variations or could be stones that are valuable and/or unique in Freljord that would still allow someone to differentiate between Mastery 6 &amp; 7. All of this would be exclusive to ARAM and the standard Mastery would be used in SR regardless of ARAM Mastery rank.\r\n\r\nThese Ideas could also be applied to Twisted Treeline as an exclusive, with Shadow Isles themes and colors! (both for obtaining the Mastery and the Mastery Emote itself)\r\n\r\nLove to hear y'alls thoughts on this!","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-08-08T23:25:25.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What exactly does this mean?

Except that we can't earn tokens outside of a specific map.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-08-09T04:57:54.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We cant?

Now we can exclusively earn mastery tokens on the Rift. No HA, no TT.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-08-09T21:09:04.187+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
