Once loaded the game would just run normally for 1 or 1 and a half minutes then it would just start disconnecting and reconnecting constantly, not allowing me to move or anything, just \"attempting to reconnect\". Weird thing is that League is the only thing in my pc having problems, youtube works fine, other online games run fine, I tried to use the initiate full repair option but I didn't have much luck. I haven't gotten a penalty, or ruined a ranked game thankfully, but i'd like to start playing normally again. Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-09T21:13:40.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This can happen with an unstable network, never really certain if the connection to our game server will crap out or when.  I recommend sticking to custom games for now to troubleshoot without penalty, and run through the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.
