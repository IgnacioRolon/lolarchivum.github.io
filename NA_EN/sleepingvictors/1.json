When I unlocked it, my friend invited me to duo ranked, and while the chest was unlocking, I clicked the invite and went back to see what I got. Turns out that the chest and a key had disappeared and i got no reward. Please help, and thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-05T22:30:15.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a peek into your hextech crafting to see what might have caused that chest to disappear. As it turns out, it opened correctly and gave you the Blood Moon Diana Icon and 150 Orange Essence. Icons don't go into your hextech loot, since you don't need to actually redeem them. They're automatically unlocked and place into your list of summoner icons.","replies":[{"poster":"SleepingVictors","date":"2017-05-06T03:39:11.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, thank you.
