I called him a moron once through the entire game. asked the team to report him. then him and I get into an argument about how he &quot;isnt trolling&quot; when he 100% is. he even sat there using emotes in a 2v1 fight till i died then he decided to help me. he just stood on top of me emoting ...\n\nIll be leaving this game for good now because your system just doesn&#039;t work which is really unfortunate because league is a fun game.\n\nBut when you dont ban trolls and you just ban the people that actually play ranked to win and climb ... sad really","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2019-01-12T12:12:10.145+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"If you see an asshole today, it might be your unlucky day.

Even using those '0 tolerance' words often don't result in ban from 1 game and some people who've said some pretty vile shit could get away for quite a while and has been a bane for many.\n\nOtherwise, the notice bubble when you relog after banned, or as we call it reform cards, would find at least 3 exhibits to show why you're banned.\n\nLastly, I could probably guess you were casually using the \"buzzwords\" if all of your punishment as you'd implied went straight to ban. Because in League there is only 1 tier of ban that actually leads to gameplay suspension BEFORE the perma ban. And there are 2 chat bans that only limits you from typing in chat before the said gameplay ban; and the chat bans do not bar you from playing, just typing beyond a certain amount. And the only way to skip the first 2 layers of chat ban from chatting is if you use diction that are considered deeply offensive.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-01-12T12:51:58.005+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So .. are you done done? \n\nOr do you want us to explain the system to you so you can learn from your mistakes and not get punished again?","replies":[]},{"poster":"hshtagniemehrcdu","date":"2019-01-12T14:13:56.258+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system does not need \"fixing\", at least not according to the story you tell.\nIt works exactly as it is supposed to.\n\n> Ill be leaving this game for good now\n\nThis may be news for you but ....\n\nYou do not get permabanned because Riot welcomes you as a customer.\nYou dont get reported by tons of people because they enjoy playing with you.\n**You get permabanned, because everyone involved wants you gone.**\nThe only regrettable thing is that it took you 7 accounts to get the hint.\nUnfortunatly there's no easy solution to people such as yourself creating new accounts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PH45","date":"2019-01-12T13:40:49.041+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> So I now have 7 banned accounts and I'm starting to get really annoyed by it\n\nPerhaps you should change your attitude then. I have played this game from the end of Season 1 and haven't had a single banned account. Only one punishment and that was a 1-day ban back when those existed cause I had to leave a game due to an IRL thing. All I'm saying is maybe it's not Riot's system, maybe it's you.\n\n>  I was just perma banned 5 minutes ago for calling a guy a moron cause he was intentionally trolling me the entire game\n\nYou are just feeding the troll if he is inting and you are flaming him. That's what trolls want, people to get agitated and banned over flame. Just mute, report and move on.\n\n> asked the team to report him\n\nYou don't need to ask for reports, as 1 report already starts an investigation on the reported account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-12T12:14:18.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ಠ_ಠ","replies":[]},{"poster":"fatherdarius","date":"2019-01-12T20:19:20.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lukrezia,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=KMc3XrnB,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-01-12T12:09:51.498+0000)\n>\n> ...So I now have 7 banned accounts... \n> ...I was just perma banned 5 minutes ago for calling a guy a moron...\n> ...your banning system it makes no sense...\n> ...the moment i say something to him I get banned...\n> ...I called him a moron...\n> ...asked the team to report...\n> ...him and I get into an argument...\n> ...I'll be leaving this game for good...\n> ...you just ban the people that actually play ranked to win and climb...\n> ...this 1 guy was pissing me off...\n> ...It just doesn't make sense to me...\n\n\"From the standpoint of the psychology of personal constructs **we may define a disorder as any personal construction which is used repeatedly in spite of consistent invalidation**.\"\n\n-- _George A.
