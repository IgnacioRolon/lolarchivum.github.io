Even if your ping is only 30 ms, you are still technically 'lagging' slightly.\n\nThink of it like this, you throw the hook at the perfect time and it should hit, except the natural slight lag between you inputting the command and it happening makes you miss by a very small margin even though it should've worked. Thus, the 'lollypopping' (who the hell coined that phrase?) helps with that very minor lag.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellpyre","date":"2017-09-05T02:33:22.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The phrase comes from the overall shape of the missile path.
