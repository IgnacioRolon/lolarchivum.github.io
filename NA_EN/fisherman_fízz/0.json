When I tried to upgrade an error ocurred but when I checked the champion list I noticed that Garen was level 7 and no essence was used, also the 3 tokens were still there. I changed to the legacy client and I got the notification that I just got to level 7 on Garen. \n\nI've reported this using the report option on the client but I&#039;m posting this here for clarity.\n\nSorry for any typing errors","replies":[{"poster":"CrabDust","date":"2016-09-23T17:55:37.593+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you close and relog the legacy client, does it still show lvl 7 on that champ in profile or on the champs page?
