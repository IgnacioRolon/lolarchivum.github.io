Basically what happened was my League somehow got corrupted. I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling....numerous times. I have followed every tutorial on youtube, and the forums. Basically during the \"Applying Patches\" phase of the install process, it will give me the message \"Update Failed: Unspecified error has occurred. Please check logs for more information.\" I have no idea how to get rid of this problem. I have even gone as far as to completely factory restoring my pc.....and it still gives me the same problem. I have no idea how to fix it at this point and i know it cant be a virus in my pc now because i have wiped it clean. This is beginning to get insanely frustrating and if worse comes to worse I will have to buy a new pc just to play league which is very very unfortunate because i was trying to get myself out of elo hell before the season ended. Also i forgot to mention that when i got in game i few times before the corruption, my game would crash on the load screen, and my team would remake. By the time it loaded, It gave me a message saying that the game had ended and i should feel free to start another. Next thing i know im down about 20 LP because of this. You don't understand how enraged this made me because that shit isnt easy to come by in this game. if no one helps me then im just going to quit league until i can buy a new pc.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T02:49:11.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like this issue may be stemming from a poor connection to our servers, especially if your issue during patching happens after 32%.
