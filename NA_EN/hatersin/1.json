Riot please help me fix this. This is very very very very annoying and enraging. Please get rid of the leavers and please give me my LP back if at all possible. Thank you &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-01T02:02:59.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, we cannot modify your Leaverbuster penalties or your LP, as the systems were designed this way to prevent any sort of abuse of the system. Because you have a 5-game penalty, it means you've consistently disconnected from matches as of late, so you'll definitely want to investigate and resolve what's causing this to happen.\n\nMost disconnections in the loading screen are caused by a poor connection to the servers. I strongly encourage you to work through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local network settings are in good shape. Let me know if you have any further issues with this.","replies":[]}]}
