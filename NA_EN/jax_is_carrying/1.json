You are more of a threat because a death can be more than just a numbers disadvantage. So far I've found it's great for objective fighting.

Imagine Liss goes bot for a gank. If the gank goes well, your team gets a double. A lot of the time both bot laners will be dead before your passive explodes. In the alternative, you nuke the support and the ADC just dashes away from the zombie. Or the zombie actually does explode and damages the ADC, but they still survive and recall anyway. No matter how you slice it, the passive is usually doing nothing and certainly not making up for 50 + .2AP in nerfs and a spectacularly weaker lane phase.\n\nI also can't find the passive's range published anywhere. So who knows how many times you could go into the middle of a team and they scatter while you're in stasis and get out of range before dying. If the range is very long, that's a whole different story, but something tells me it isn't very long (guessing 1000 *max*).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sharpest glasses","date":"2018-11-20T12:16:19.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Imaging Wukong had 10-30 lower base resists than every other fighter to justify his current passive. \n\nIts already the case.
