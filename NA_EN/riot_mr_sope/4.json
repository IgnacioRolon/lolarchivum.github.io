In order to maintain a steady flow of these contributions, in the coming weeks we'll be approving a large number of preexisting applications (subject to Player Behavior review). If you've applied previously, keep an eye out for an approval email heading your way.\r\n\r\nOn a long-term note, we're looking to make good on some of our past ideas and implement various improvements to the PBE. A robust tester population is essential for thorough coverage, so we'll keep an eye on the PBE's numbers after the coming approval wave and take additional measures if necessary. Ensuring a positive testing environment is another priority, so expect more Player Behavior measures down the line.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to the PBE!\r\n\r\nRiot Chesties\r\n{{champion:21}}","replies":[{"poster":"HowPlayGAEM","date":"2015-02-10T18:38:58.840+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Mr Sope","date":"2015-02-10T18:59:10.961+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't know if there were any pruning of old applications, but it wouldn't hurt to apply again for possible future approvals that may happen. \n\nFor this round, I've pulled up all the applications I could find in our database.","replies":[{"poster":"Shoken","date":"2015-02-10T19:07:54.487+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I applied a long time ago but trying to re-apply just says me that i've already applied and should wait a response.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Mr Sope","date":"2015-02-10T23:31:29.637+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're getting that response, than your account will be among those that are evaluated for possible approval.","replies":[{"poster":"Kasti","date":"2015-08-23T05:11:14.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know this is late ,but ive never gotten accepted into PBE i know im safe when it comes to the summoners code and i meet requirement but ive never been sent an email and it feels like my applications have been getting eaten by something..idk jsut wondering if my application is aactualy there.

I went to the PBE signup page and apparently I got accepted, but.... I never got an e-mail notification of approval, or at least never saw one. Do you think you can see if I signed up for PBE with a yahoo e-mail?? If you can check for t7allen@yahoo.com\n\nCause that's the e-mail I originally made this account with, but I've changed it to gmail after losing access to my yahoo account. My yahoo e-mail account still exists, but I don't have access to it. So I'm not sure if I tried signing up for PBE with my yahoo account (where the approval notification would be), or with my gmail account (where there is no approval notification, not even in my spam folder). Both e-mails have t7allen on it.\n\nSo do you think you could check for that e-mail??
