We're still seeing some lingering issues with match history, but no LP/IP gains should be affected.  We'll keep an open ticker for match history, but otherwise we're considering the maintenance complete.  Thanks for your patience everyone!\n\n------------------------------\n\n\n>#Update 12:25pm\n\n> TL;DR - Ran into more tech debt than expected while performing the maintenance.  Network engineers are working on stabilizing to at least get players back into the game.  Ranked is still staying down until we can confirm everything's stable, but looking positive at the moment.\n\n------------------------------\n\n\n\n>#Update 11:29am\n\n> We're still working on next steps, but just to be on the safe side, we've extended the expected maintenance window to 1:00PM PDT.  We disabled RP purchasing while we triage the issue as we started seeing some RP purchases start to fail\n\n------------------------------\n\n>#Update 11:00am\n\n> We're still seeing a higher level of login issues and other errors than we'd like.  Currently triaging and working on next steps.  Should hopefully have a more robust update shortly\n\n------------------------------\n\n>#Update 10:10am\n\n>  We briefly saw a spike in players unable to login at ~10:05am, but should already be recovering. We'll be keeping an eye on it as maintenance continues.\n\n\n------------------------------\n\n\n>#Update 9:45am:\n\n> At around 8:40am normal draft queues went down for ~5 minutes due to a communication error on our end.  Normal draft queues should currently be active, but you may need to restart your client to have them show back up.\n\n------------------------------\n\n\nHey all,\n \nHeads up that in the morning of June 7th at 7:30AM PDT we&rsquo;re going to be disabling ranked queues for about 4 hours to make some hardware configuration changes.  Changing configuration settings may not be sexiest of changes, but the maintenance is important to us as it&rsquo;s targeted at removing some backend tech debt by making sure our systems are set up in a comparable way across all regions. Unfortunately, outside of ranked going down, you won&#039;t be able to notice much else.\n \nIf you get into a ranked game before 7:30AM PDT, you&rsquo;ll still be able to finish the game, but won&rsquo;t be able to create a new one after.  For all you Normals/ARAM all-stars, some disconnects or login issues are possible during this time but we&rsquo;ll be keeping an eye on things while maintenance is ongoing.\n \nWe&rsquo;ll also make sure to update this post when it&rsquo;s completed or if we run into any snags along the way!","replies":[{"poster":"Duchess Katarina","date":"2017-06-06T23:05:46.976+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Currently, there is a bug that I'm facing where in Normal Draft mode (with the new 10 ban system) sometimes red side has first pick. I submitted a ticket/talked to a support member and he gave me a suggestion to delete my Config file and then repair the client. I thought that did the trick, but today it happened again a couple of times. \n\nIt will show me that I have blue side and we will have first pick and we will pick in usual order but then when we hit loading screen it swaps us to red side. Or vice versa. He thought it might be something to do with how there was a feature that would show you had blue side regardless of what side you were actually on. But I don't think that it is. In my match history it shows that all my Normal Draft games are Blind Pick. So I think maybe when you guys flipped the switch for the 10 Bans you accidentally flipped the Normal Blind Pick side chooser (I don't even know what to call it). \n\nI know this might not be the place to ask, but since you guys are doing a Config maintenance, is this something that could be looked into by any chance?","replies":[{"poster":"VCS QuanLe","date":"2017-06-07T17:06:29.727+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's time it will be back ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jame Gumb","date":"2017-06-07T19:59:17.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Proof this is happening\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/149900948?t=21m42s","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crystalyzer","date":"2017-06-07T18:55:34.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your team is always blue in champ select unless it's different in norms.","replies":[{"poster":"Duchess Katarina","date":"2017-06-07T21:14:36.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But sometimes it will show that we are red side and then it will swap us to blue side in loading screen + game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jame Gumb","date":"2017-06-07T19:58:43.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are always on the left side but when it shows what role you are in draft it will show which side of the map you are on.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yung Snek","date":"2017-06-07T01:06:09.121+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"yeah so i can't even log back in. was getting DC'd in ranked match, then i couldn't even get into game, closed the client and now league won't even open.{{champion:498}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2017-06-07T02:28:17.597+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"The maintenance won't start for about another 12 hours, so sounds like you're running into an unrelated patching issue (I say patching because it sounds like nothing displays after you click on the LoL icon).

Couldn't the maintenance have been split up instead of doing both at the same time? 4 hours is a long time without ranked. Additionally, as a side note, the data for peak hours may make an interesting article. I would be interested to know the patterns of play for NA ranked.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TortugaDeLechuga","date":"2017-06-07T15:50:47.529+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So normal draft pick is down as well lol","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-07T16:39:26.226+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for reporting this!
