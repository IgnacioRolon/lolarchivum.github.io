You are untargetable while enemies are outside the circle. If they get in the circle, they can target you just fine. \n\nFor your allies, they are untargetable for a short duration after they leave the circle as well, but they get their own circle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-11-15T03:34:06.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) TF can reveal camouflage anyways.\n2) Being in the circle disables any effects of E, although it doesn't stop the persistent duration. In other words, you can flash and get away and the E will recover, but until you do, you're a sitting duck.\n3) You can attack twice before E no longer affects you at all. If you have a Duskblade, that's pretty useful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2019-11-15T00:55:45.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Untargetability is mainly useful against single-target attacks. \nExamples: Caitlyn auto attack, teemoâ€™s Q\nAOE spells like Caitlynâ€™s Q or TFâ€™s Q can still hit you while you are a wraith.\n\nAnd Seenaâ€™s E is a camouflage. Senna and allies in her E will be revealed by a revealing action: enemy champion moving close enough to Senna, a control ward, Quinn W, or abilities/effects that grant true sight like the Fountain and ignite (idk about ignite, havenâ€™t heard any mention of the interaction and I havenâ€™t seen any gameplay where a Senna or an ally was revealed by an Ignite)\n\nDonâ€™t confuse camouflage with invisibility. {{champion:121}}â€™s R and Vayneâ€™s R are good examples, their invisibility canâ€™t be broken by simply walking near them, only the fountain and a small amount of other abilites/summoner spells can reveal them.\nThe entire reason why the Boards got so worked up over Senna (before she was available on the PBE but after her abilities were announced) was because they confused camouflage, invisibility and untargetability lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-15T00:25:39.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wraith Form: Gain Movement speed icon 20% bonus movement speed and appear as an Sweeper Drone icon obscured wraith to enemies beyond 150 units.","replies":[]}]}
