Could play draft a few days ago, and now suddenly I can't. It has nothing to do with the minimum champ requirement (only had 13 total before and now, including free, no overlap). \n\nSO I'm guessing it's just some sort of bug that let us play before we should've been allowed? It's quite a mystery.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-21T21:43:09.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe you need to have 15 champions available including the free champion rotation in order to play draft.  It looks like your total should bring you enough now to do draft pick.  Is this still an issue?","replies":[{"poster":"50CaliberHecate","date":"2017-02-23T02:40:01.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My issue fixed once i bought 2 more champions.
