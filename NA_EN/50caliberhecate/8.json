Attempting to micromanage an ally never works. I've never seen it work.\n\nBut I think for supports just whoever you're good at because the important thing as support is lane control. You have to keep the pressure off your ADC so he can farm more easily. Ez is good at last hitting from range but it's still really important to keep control of the lane. It's also helpful if you have some sort of waveclear in case the enemy lane shoves you in because Ezreal's waveclear sucks.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2018-03-29T02:17:24.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trackers knife?
