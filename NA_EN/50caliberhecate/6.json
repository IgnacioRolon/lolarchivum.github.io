Most AP champions can be level 10-11 and kill them with at least 3 items. Some earlier than that...\r\n\r\nI just hate how she&#039;s tied to ONLY support just because &quot;oh she heals. Insta-support!&quot; I mean look at Nidalee, she can play Jungle, support, AND mid. \r\n\r\nI thought it would be interesting to rework her kit! Maybe she can have different Spell paths!\r\n\r\nHer passive would remain the same because it works so well, even if she was a mid/support hybrid, the gank potential would be awesome!\r\n\r\nQ - Soraka can choose 2 damage paths; STARCALL/STARECHO\r\n-STARCALL - Her original Q ability\r\n-STARECHO - Instead of healing for a percentage of health, a secondary star additionally falls in it&#039;s place, dealing 10/30/60/120/180 (+60% Ability Power) Damage. \r\n\r\nW - Soraka can choose between 2 heal paths; ASTRAL INFUSION/ASTRAL MEND\r\n-ASTRAL INFUSION - her original W ability\r\n-ASTRAL MEND - Soraka can additionally heal her self. If she has STARCALL active, she additionally gains a permanent 5 health for health received to her. \r\nIf she has STARECHO active, she gains a temporary shield one she is below 30% for 2 seconds. This shield gains armor/magic resist stats based upon damage dealt by STARECHO. \r\n\r\nE - Soraka can choose between to CC paths; EQUINOX/SOLSTICE\r\n-EQUINOX - her original E ability\r\n-SOLSTICE - Soraka throws out a line of 5 stars, enemies who walk through this field of stars are slowed for 1 second. The stars will additionally attach to an enemy, where they will then explode dealing 10/30/60/120/180 (+60% Ability Power). \r\n\r\nR - Soraka can choose between to additional ult paths; WISH/REAP\r\n-WISH - Her original R Ability\r\n-REAP (I originally wanted to say, rework Karthus and give his ult to Soraka! But I thought maybe I could be creative too)\r\nSoraka gains an additional 30% cooldown for 10 seconds on all of her spells, allowing her to exceed the cool down limit. (Yes, so she can spam you with MORE Qs! HEHEHE!)\r\n\r\nI just thought with the way Riot was going with so many champs having all this additional path stuff and what not,  it would be cool to see her expanded to more than just a flat based spam healer your ally Draven uses as a meat shield.","replies":[{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2018-12-22T02:39:46.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't a rework.

I want a new Soraka all together. She's very flat. And wouldn't surprise me if Riot thought it was fair, I mean look at Zoe W, Veigar passive, Akali Shroud (before it's nerf), Lux ult(CDR wise), the entirety of Irelia before her hard nerfs, Pyke's passive, Kai'sa passive before hard nerfs. It's really not that unacceptable to see things done over the top anymore. I'm not even adding a bunch of damage to her, I'm giving her kit options. Like I said, she's a flat character Draven would use as a meat shield. I don't want her to just \"heal a little more\", I want her to be able to have power and oomph.","replies":[{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2018-12-22T02:58:03.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I don't want to revert Soraka.

See how it works and remove on up (sorta like reverse engineering I guess?)\n\nI just wish League would go more into kit specific duality rather than mastery specific, cause' the rune system was suppose to be \"design your own path\" but.. we all know Zed is gonna take Electrocute. We all know Janna will take Aery. We  all know Nasus will take Grasp. I think allowing us to choose between different characterized kits would allow Summoners to feel like they are playing what THEY like, not just \"oh here's what is op in the runes tree atm.\"","replies":[]}]}]}
