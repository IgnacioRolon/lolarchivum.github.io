He lacks in overall use as a champion, like I thought getting him from a \"?\" would mean he'd be pretty good, but even adding him against 1c champions, he did nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-09-15T02:42:16.293+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"His base stats are pretty awful, but he itemizes and synergizes very well.  Both blademaster and gunslinger help him apply any on-hit effects multiplicatively, and his spell easily applies on-hit effects to most of an entire team.  Stack him or sack him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grundle47","date":"2019-09-20T03:29:16.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 things:\nFirst, he's not supposed to be a strong unit individually. He has 3 traits. He's meant to be a synergy piece. If he was a strong unit on his own he'd be overpowered. Not to mention one of those synergies is pirate, which considering how strong bonus econ is overall, needs to be kept at a slightly lower power level anyway. \n\nSecond: He actually is a solid unit. The \"problem\" is that you have to sink a bunch of items into him to make viable, especially a couple tears or a GA so he reliably gets his ult off. But what you might be forgetting with him is that his barrels apply on hit effects. On-hit items are already strong on most gunslingers but he gets that extra boost from them because his ult will spread those effects all over the field. Itemize him like you would a Kennan and you should be good if you're looking for him to carry in any way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DracosKasu","date":"2019-09-17T13:50:08.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could be a risky move since he is blademaster and gunslingers but for some reason I will buff is movement speed because he is way slower then any other unit when he move from hex to hex.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Partholonian","date":"2019-09-15T23:54:17.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO his mana cost is just too high.  At 1-star it's basically impossible for him to live long enough to cast, even without something like demons/Kassadin.\n\nThe thing is, casting more often wouldn't even be *that* big a buff as long as he still generated barrels at the same rate; it would just be some bad luck protection against \"he died at 90% mana, so he did absolutely nothing all fight\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"HoldMyPlank","date":"2019-09-15T00:41:28.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you build on him because I usually go morrello/gunblade and take gunslinger/blademaster and he does A ok ","replies":[]}]}
