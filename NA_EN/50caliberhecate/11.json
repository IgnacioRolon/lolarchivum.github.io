People preferred to take him toplane even though it meant losing on the exp inflation and the dragon ghost, that should tell you how much he sucked botlane. You could find examples of people playing weird things since ever, doesn't mean those things were ever viable.\n\nAlso you're ignoring how the items those ADCs relied were deliberately gutted early, with IE being given a deliberate awkward buildpath specifically for this reason. An ADC needs to farm before backing for longer and the items they do purchase offer less of a powerspike to booth. And if they are forced to back before having the that higher amount of gold they have to go back to lane with less stats than before, which makes having a bad early game even worse. Hence why their winrates dropped all across the board.","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-06-23T21:31:17.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just another example of you being horribly informed/experienced.\n\nMorde was common bot Season 7 because of how they adjusted {{item:3307}} .\n\nMordekaiser was the friggin original abuser of dual support item bots.

I don't know where you get that by the time you could purchase it it's early. It was more like a 10 minute buy unless you had a team explicitly feeding you. \n\nLife steal items are cheaper, offer more utility than they ever have. I suggest you start building them instead of IE. 20% life steal as a first item has never been something to shirk at.
