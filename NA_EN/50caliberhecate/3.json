Like... how do I explain it?\r\n\r\nI’ll be sitting there autoing and suddenly my champion will auto fast and then be in a different spot when I click. \r\n\r\nSometimes if I’m walking down lane, I’ll walk say from 1st turret to river, it’ll show my champion sliding over without the walk animation and then I’ll still be at the 1 turret? \r\n\r\nOr if I die, I’ll attack an enemy over and over then show the actual death screen like 5 seconds later without the enemy actually being there?\r\n\r\nIdk if it’s League or my pc or my game has corrupted files or what?","replies":[]}
