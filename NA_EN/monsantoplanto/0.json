This freezing continues past my pick/ban, causing tons of unintentional dodges, as I'm unable to pick a champ or ban when needed to.\r\nOn a Mac btw.\r\nAnyone got any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"PaeanAsklepios","date":"2016-02-27T20:40:56.226+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm on Windows with the same issue.
