I've gotten two leaver busters in a span of a week because of it. Although I have yet to try the methods mentioned in the given \"support\" page since I'm honestly at a loss. I play League on the SEA server as well (Garena) and I've had no crashing problems with it.. so why is my NA one so full of problems?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-23T20:12:44.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best first troubleshooting steps are going to be found on [**bug splat and crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) since typically those steps are able to fix most of the reasons why you'd get these crashes. The most common reason being that some of the actual game files were damaged or somehow corrupted, so running a quick repair might be able to fix that up but so be sure to run through each step.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZiiroSkill","date":"2017-08-23T17:13:50.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem here.
