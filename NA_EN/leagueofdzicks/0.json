The game will randomly crash and an error message saying \"Failed to Create Dump Folder\" pops up. Once I hit 'OK' it closes the client. In game signs that will tell me this is going to happen are: Red scoreboard, red item shop(i have to mouse over items to tell what I'm about to purchase), but sometimes it doesnt even give me the luxury of knowing it's going to happen. I've lost so many games due to this happening at a crucial point in the game. It almost always happens during the first fight, but if it doesn't I'm horribly paranoid of it happening when the death timers are 30s+ and cost us the game. This has NEVER happened on SR, so I havent attempted a fix or re-install. Please help Riot, this thing really ruins my experience on these maps that I love to play :/","replies":[{"poster":"LEAGUEofDZICKS","date":"2013-11-27T17:54:32.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought it might be this since I am automatically prompted to update my NVIDIA drivers from time to time. However the issue has persisted through this. When I get home I will play a few ARAMs to get the necessary log info. Should I repeat the process with Dominion/TTYL game modes or should the ARAM game info suffice?\n\nThank you for the response and help @Eliv!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2013-11-20T02:55:49.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for posting!
