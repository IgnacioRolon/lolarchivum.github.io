Currently, I experience the audio on the backing repeats only the beginning of the audio track I usually hear when recalling. It sounds clunky and broken as of right now. I asked friends to listen in when I was backing but they could not hear any backing audio at all. Noticed it two patches ago (6.4). \nSmall issue but looking for people to confirm if it is happening to them as well.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-29T20:36:33.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya ReDiemer - \n\nThanks for the report!
