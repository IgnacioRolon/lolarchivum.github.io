It&#039;s childish and stupid. I&#039;m at 0 LP, so I literally cannot afford a loss in order to report these kinds of people.\n\nThis isn&#039;t going to stop any time soon.

Sounds pretty bad but who knows.\nI've gone teemo/mf/ashe/ryze/veigar/fiddle support for certain comps and my average winrate is equal to or higher than my winrates for \"normal\" supports.
