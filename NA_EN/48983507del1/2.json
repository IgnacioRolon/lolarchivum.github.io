People firmly believe that every season has ruined League, changing their favorite aspects of the game because Riot&#039;s balance team doesn&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing. \n\nThe problem is that these perspectives are often flawed, and don&#039;t grasp the fundamentals of how the game functions each season. \n\nFor example, people say the game favors snowballing way too much, when in reality the game goes to 35+ minutes quite often. Snowballing has actually been hindered a lot due to catch-up XP, making champions like Lee Sin worse and tanks like Sejuani very strong. \n\nPeople also say that the game is overly reliant on which champions are picked, giving the game a feeling of lower variety. I honestly don&#039;t understand these arguments at all, since changes to the pace of the game have made so many more champions viable than in previous seasons. \n\nThere are only 2 or 3 champions in each role that are truly bad, such as Shaco in the Jungle or Dr. Mundo in the Top lane. Even if tanks are strong, carry Top Laners like Riven are still playable and ganking Junglers like Lee Sin can still impact the game. No one showcases this better than Longzhu, who will give J4 to Khan despite what the meta dictates. \n\nFinally, people believe that if there is not perfect balance in the game currently, it means that Riot doesn&#039;t know how to balance their game. First of all, people have the audacity to assume that they know far better than Riot despite probably never working on a game balance team in their life. Take a step back and realize that Riot has been doing this for years, and they most likely have a better understanding of how they want their game to function than 99% of people on these boards, including myself. \n\n**If Riot hasn&#039;t changed something that you think is wrong, then the issue is either more complicated and challenging to fix than you comprehend, or they want this to be in the game and you need to adapt to it. It&#039;s still their game after all.**\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of Season 7 being the worst season yet is entirely subjective. However, if you truly think that it is the arrival of the 4 Horseman, you need to understand what&#039;s actually wrong with it. The biggest problems this season were Lethality at the beginning and Ardent Censor &amp; Knight&#039;s Vow at the end. \n\nDespite the game being focused on the ADC at this point, I&#039;d still say this season brings welcomed champion versatility and intense matches where team-fights matter more than ever. This would&#039;ve been my favorite season if Rengar hadn&#039;t have been changed, and I&#039;m looking forward to the next season&#039;s changes. Also, Kayn is awesome.

Both smell pretty much the same.\n\nThey greatly reduced the duration of the game at the beginning of season 6. Increased death timer AND weakened towers. Games ended from horribly weak conclusions. They've taken a step back on that but it's something that is still left on my mind. I know season 5 had absurdly lengthy games but it was great, a lot of story could happen in a game. That promptly stopped happening.\n\nSweeping class reworks yada yada mixed results. It would be another long paragraph if I went into this.\n\nDominion was killed off, which is understandable as the players were just not there anymore. It had a dated appearance which if there were players they might have updated. Big rip. I'm kind of pissed off about the neglect of 3v3 however because 3v3 can be really fun semi competitive map with a tight small group. The tiny lane design feels extremely limiting to the 3v3 gameplay favoring range too much. I feel like the map needs to be reshaped to have lane spaces similar to SR lanes with the jungle reworked considering gank pathways.\n\nThe overarching balance trends as of the past few years have been very repetitive too. From the perspective of high rank play the game continuously favors safe boring gameplay favoring melee building meatshield and ranged carries dominating lanes and scaling. Proactive play can do stuff but largely the best strats are about being as lame as possible. This stems from players practicing and optimizing the game so much. It's like this game is at least 50% PvE. Actually, it IS indeed. The Game Needs To Be Shaken Up. Things that are chaotic need to be Kept good. Not instant nerfed. Even the lower ranks have begun to see how biased the balance is. I don't even need to look at a character's numbers to know how it's gonna be treated. Just its traits are enough to know. Some champions are designed with LOADS of counterplay in mind. Others are not. It's a shame because the ones with a million counterplay seem like they are fun, just not effective on average. It's not the best strategy to use champions that leave the skillchecks ultimately in your opponent's hand.","replies":[{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2017-10-13T22:43:16.793+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot to mention what made Season 6 unquestionably the worst Season ever. \n\nForced Dynamic que.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keitron","date":"2017-10-14T00:23:14.210+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dynamic queue and the awful balancing made season 6 hands down the worst season to date.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"robot takeover","date":"2017-10-13T14:10:36.385+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think season 6 and season 7 are that different.

Keeping the right balance there is tricky, especially given how influential champions are - if you get a run of Riven vs Yasuo in your games for a few days, the game will feel super snowbally; if you get a run of Maokai vs Cho'Gath top lanes for a few games, the opposite will be true.\n\nHow snowballing occurs and how you come back also matter.

If we could go back to season 3 or 4 again I would GLADLY go back. Season 5 and 6 had a lot of problems but I would still rather have them. This season has not been fun, forced numerous changes that are not thought out nor fun and has generally been a massive let down. I really hope season 8 picks up the pieces and we go in a good direction but still nothing is being truly fixed. The problems are still there. We are just getting at least something to ease the pain.\n\nTanks and supports are still in a bad spot. Marksmans haven't been toned down. There isn't support for mages or fighters.

But i mean, every season has it's low's, they usually get fixed though, this one's low, which in my opinion is games that are completely focused on Bot Lane and how you play around it, hasn't been touched. Not only that but Riot seems to think that ADC's hitting power spikes at 15 minutes, every single game being focused on 4 man bot lane ganks, and support's like Soraka, Sona, Lulu and Janna being the best champions for months is completely fine. They have yet to significantly nerf the champions and have yet to attempt to fix this focus on ADC's so early in the game. \n\nNote: It make's sense to attack the lane with the most people in it 2 Kills > 1 Kill but when doing that just once results in a tower 5 minutes in, the enemy ADC already reaching a massive power spike and becoming unkillable due to their Support that's when the problem exists and that's why i hate this season.
