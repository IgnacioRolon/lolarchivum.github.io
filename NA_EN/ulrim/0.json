I am trying to reform. I understand now that I'm not allowed to use chat ever, not even to defend myself. Let this post serve as a warning, Riot does not care if you are being victimized. \r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that I understand that I could have just muted them. I apologize for not doing so. But does this really warrant a 2 WEEK BAN from the game?\r\n\r\nWatch this clip and tell me my behavior warranted a ban: https://clips.twitch.tv/GrossExpensiveDunlinCoolCat\r\n\r\nDuring this game I played from behind safely while my mid and top went a combined 25 deaths in a 20 minute game.\r\n\r\nI just got a 2 week suspension because the entire team raged, flamed, and called me names while literally all I did was defend myself.\r\n\r\nThis is ridiculous. I don't swear, I don't even say bad things in chat. I didn't call for reports. I didn't rage at anyone. The worst insult I said the entire game was \"You are being dumb, it's not my fault you lost your lane.\"\r\n\r\nI am so sick of Riot banning people for defending themselves from verbal harassment. Literally harassed to tears, and I'm the one who gets banned for two weeks. This is ridiculous. Riot literally allows streamers to repeatedly call their teammates foul language words and IRL threats, but I can't defend myself from abuse. Real?\r\n\r\nHere is the chat log edited only to insert what other people are saying:\r\n\r\nGame 1 - There was only one game on the card.\r\n\r\nIn-Game\r\n\r\nKai'sa, Pantheon, and Veigar get into an argument after Veigar dies for the third time in 3 minutes. At someone point, Veigar says something rude and Kai'sa reacts.\r\n\r\nMe: hes just inting ignore him\r\n\r\nVeigar and Pantheon asking me why I'm not ganking their lanes after falling too far behind.\r\n\r\nMe: its gg\r\n\r\nMe: nothing i can do against someone who hard ints a j4\r\n\r\nMe: my early game advantage is gone\r\n\r\nMe: nah this games over\r\n\r\nKai Sa and Yuumi having a conversation about why the other two lanes are losing and why I'm unable to effectively gank.\r\n\r\nMe: veigar literally just hard inted\r\n\r\nMe: at level 2 everyone knows that if j4 is ganking you surivive it and win the game\r\n\r\nMe: instead he died 3 times lol\r\n\r\nUpon having my second and third red buffs taken because I'm not safe in the jungle, and I'm being spam pinged.\r\n\r\nMe: i cant even go to my red buff because of veigar\r\n\r\nPanthon then rages at me and says it is my fault the game is lost and that he is going to report me.\r\n\r\nMe: how it it my fault that veigar died to a level 2 gank\r\n\r\nMe: dude\r\n\r\nMe: you are so dumb\r\n\r\nVeigar death #6 or 7, him raging in chat.\r\n\r\nMe: veigars dead again btw\r\n\r\nMe: j4 might be at my blue guys\r\n\r\nVeiger talking trash from beyond the grave after his 10th death.\r\n\r\nMe: dude youve died 10 times\r\n\r\nMe: 10\r\n\r\nMe: like holy shit\r\n\r\nMe: how are you blaming the lee sin\r\n\r\nMe: for a 10 death mid laner\r\n\r\nWhole team is on the raging at me hard now.
