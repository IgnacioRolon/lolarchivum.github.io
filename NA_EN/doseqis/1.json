I even gave up on him for a month or two (because started playing A.Sol), but recently I play him a lot of again. I just love his lore, gameplay, visual design, etc. Although he is so weak, I keep playing him and still sometimes manage to score a good kda. Right now, he is way too team dependent, you can easily lose your lane as Azir and if you do so, you can serve as utility mage with little damage unless you have 4-5 items at least. His early mana costs are a bit high and you can easily go OOM if you try to poke your opponent, because his damage is not high either. The only way to success as Azir in an equal match-up is to farm as much as you can and also your laning depends on the jungle pressure.\nMaybe changing the passive will be good for Azir?
