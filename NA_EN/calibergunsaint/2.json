The old lore that you may have loved was just a shotgun blast of random stories that barely tried to connect to one another, let alone make a believable world. The retconning of the lore is creating a concrete universe for everything to fit into, and that kind of things happens all the time in games and series that are trying to make a more rich environment for it's characters to exist in. There's not really any point in getting hurt over the stories being updated when it's kind of inevitable, like in comic books or videogame sagas, especially since it's for the better of the lore of the game.\n\nBesides, it's nowhere near as bad as printed or physical material getting retconned. Take the Star Wars Expanded Universe for instance. Back in the 90s, the only content we had before and after the Original Trilogy were books that sought to fill the void that Lucas left open. They did a marvelous job with it, introducing beloved characters like Mara Jade, an assassin employed by the Emperor who became Luke's wife, and then Han and Leia's children, Jaina and Jacen. There was also Grand Admiral Thrawn, who attempted to keep the empire alive after Palpatine's death. There were also novels that touched on the Clone Wars as well, though not many. Either way, Lucas Arts made TONS of merch for the Expanded Universe, from card games, video games, action figures, comic books, EVERYTHING - only to have all the stories and content essentially evaporate with the introduction of those trainwreck prequels and Disney's versions of 7,8 and soon 9. So basically, if you loved anything that Lucas Arts made prior to the prequels, every piece of merchandise and book you bought became pointless since the movies basically erased the rich universe that was created.","replies":[{"poster":"Hozenb","date":"2018-05-08T20:00:16.330+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, Blizzard has also been writing a huge ongoing story of the whole universe of World of Warcraft.\n\nSometimes changes have to be made on the settings of the world history to keep the ball rolling. One of the examples of the change that had been made was the reason of blood elf entering the horde. In some cases, Blizzard sometimes tried to explain that the history wasn't changed, but it's just that the original history is unilaterally depicted by different persons from a different point of view.\n\nBut you would never see Blizzard retcon Sylvanas Windrunner to become a completely different person with totally different personality and stories. And you would never see Blizzard say something like \"we think that character just had a random boring archetypical story that had no depth in it,  so let's make her the queen of the Alliance instead!\"\n\nThat's why people are upset. Because the characters (like Karma or Varus) we loved for years, attached to so heavily, were just confirmed by the author that it's nothing but an archetypical story that can be wiped away anytime. And the characters are no longer and will never be himself/herself again.\n\n And, are those original stories really that archetypical? I can't say about Varus. But for Karma, many fans showed their love towards the old lore on both the Boards and Reddit. I also wrote a full analysis of her old lore, arguing that she was actually a complete character in the old lore, matching her concept design and that Riot had no reason to completely tear that apart.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-05-08T20:21:14.214+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't discuss Karma, as I didn't know her before her rework. However, Varus WAS super archetypical. It's a plain revenge story of a guy who lost it all, then stole a weapon to get vengeance. It didn't have any depth to it, aside from hoping you identified with him because maybe you have a family too, and you'd get upset if they died. His old lore relied heavily on feelings outside of his story to compel you to like him, it didn't do much at all to build an actual narrative around him and build him as a character in a story. His new lore actually did flesh him out and give him depth of character, and gave us actual stories that revolved around him.\n\nAnd Blizzard is actually a completely different animal, in terms of narrative. Warcraft has had it's story developed for decades, from the original Warcraft 1, the strategy game. They've done their fair share of retconning, such as making the Dranei not be hideous looking goat people from Outland (as they were in WC3), along with the whole Cataclysm thing that added in classes to races that had no business with those classes, just because \"worgen taught dwarves to be shamans\" and hogwash like that. They've had a world that was established with rules and races and locations LONG before World of Warcraft came into being, and their narrative exists within that world, progressing the story forward. They don't NEED to evolve or change the story that much, because their world already is very established. \nLeague, on the other hand, is in the process of establishing their world. It was only a few years back when the new lore initiative began that started to tie the champions together and build the world up so that they all made sense. When you have to actually work to create a living world, as opposed to simply operating within the bounds of one that already exists, you WILL need to make some changes in order to make pieces fit. Once League lore is established, then yes, they won't retcon characters as hard. But until then, expect changes to be made to allow for characters to better make sense in the world that is being built.","replies":[{"poster":"Hozenb","date":"2018-05-08T21:32:17.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still, all the examples that you cited from Warcraft are about changes in  \"world settings\" instead of a complete change of character (i.e. denying everything that a character had gone through and all the traits that he/she had gone through). That what I want to emphasize in my previous comment -  retconning stories can also be found in other games, but it is more likely to be in the form of changes in world settings, instead of completely changing an already established main character (i.e. denying all the things that a character had gone through, and changing all the traits that the character possessed). \n\n\nRegarding Varus's lore, as I have said, I can't talk about it. That's because I am a fan of Karma instead of Varus. But, let's assume what you said is right - his story was archetypical (P.S. this is totally not the case of Karma under any circumstance). Why didn't Riot try to expand from what he already had to a more in-depth piece? A vindictive character desiring revenge for his/her family can also be seen in classical literature, but their stories were seldom considered as shallow as there could always be twists or more conflictual motivation to add depth to the characters. When there are choices to expand instead of to delete, Riot chose the latter one. And I always believe a character, especially a character in a champion-centric game should be respected as a real living person, instead of someone that can be replaced anytime by another soul.\n\nAnd for the case of Karma. I think you can try to read her old lore as it wouldn't take so long. I believe Karma is a very well established character with a full set of personality traits, motivation and cohesive behaviors that derived from the former two. She also had been a very appealing character to me and kept inspire me throughout the years.\n\nIf you are interested, you can also read my post regarding Karma's old lore and the lore update.

He's still the grand general of Noxus, and his lore is no longer \"Swain and his bird eat secrets, shit mystery, and are enveloped in suspense.\" Instead, they built on his old lore to give it more definition and more of a place in the world. Old Swain was just old leader of Noxus who appeared with a mystery bird and ruled Noxus. New Swain now explains that his bird is now a demon that lives in the Immortal Bastion that Mordekaiser once ruled from, and in exchange for secrets, it grants him a new arm and the power to propel Noxus forward. Old Swain was too vague for the narrative, and that vagueness isn't good for someone who's supposed to be one of the key characters in the grand story arc of the game. The new Swain solidified him and gave him purpose and gave us understanding. It dissolved Beatrice from being one bird to being a hivemind demon raven, and in all honesty, it works much better in the long run. New Swain is also more self propelled and more of a character than old Swain, as we actually get to see his personality and understand what kind of ruler he is.
