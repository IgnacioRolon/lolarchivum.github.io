Besides the lag I am experiencing inside the client before the game (which is manageable), I am experiencing lag inside my games. Ping is fine (between 190-220, for South Africa this is good), my frames per second are always 60+ and I am still experiencing lag. Click to move or pressing a skill shot will takes 3 or more seconds. Sometimes just standing in a one place unable to move.\r\n\r\nAll this is new. With previous client I had no issues out or in game. \r\n\r\nYes, I have changed my settings in my client to low specs mode and to close when in game. I have swapped between WiFi and cable. I've lowered my in game graphics as well. But still lagging.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else I can do? I need help!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Ultima Weaponz","date":"2017-05-08T08:48:09.679+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"dump , same feelsbad","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-08T23:43:39.305+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Broporo ooooon duty! {{summoner:31}} \n\nWhen you mentioned that it takes 3 or more seconds before your champion reacts to your commands, it really sounds like you might be experiencing some packet loss. Essentially what's happening is when you use an ability, that command has to goto our servers and then come back to each player. If some of that data gets lost along the away, some funky stuff like rubberbanding or those delays can happen. \n\nLet's use our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) to check for any packet loss. Take your recent game logs that had problems, pop it into that log reader, then use something like Gyazo to link me a screenshot here to look over!","replies":[{"poster":"VaakSeun","date":"2017-05-09T13:49:19.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.gyazo.com/00a6e3669268942a32b8aa9a5957822c.png\n\nYou can click on the link above and see that the Log reader says I have Major Issues","replies":[{"poster":"VaakSeun","date":"2017-05-09T17:14:48.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.gyazo.com/de28f40749040edd7da9db6db5faa8b1.png\n\nhere is another screenshot of my issue...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-11T21:26:58.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the slow reply!

It could be ISP related, but there may be some settings we can adjust to get things smoothed out a little bit.
