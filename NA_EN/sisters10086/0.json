Firstly the meta is still shifting around and people are still not sure how to maximize what they have with the new changes in the patches(I still don&#039;t get how the new assassins work...)\r\nBut most importantly, rank is now full of people hoping for a 10 win streak so they can get somewhere they do not belong, and trolls who don&#039;t give a f*ck about rank. Every year when I was pumped to rank right away I always get one or two of these players on my team, and this year it is a singed support who starts to proxy top, leaving the top laner with no EXP and bot lane 1vs2. It was a 20 gg game. \r\n\r\nJust wait for a month or so, at least it is what I will do.","replies":[{"poster":"Baemax1","date":"2016-12-08T08:08:20.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't visit forums often, but I wish I did before doing my placements. What you described is exactly the shit I went through. And I did all 10 games today because I hate myself I guess. I kept thinking the next game would be better, but my god I lost like 7 games in a row. This has never happened to me in ranked lol.
