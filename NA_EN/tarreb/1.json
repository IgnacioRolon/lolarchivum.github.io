In order to form a proper ordered list, there must be a blank line before the start of the list, or else it starts acting weird (seem the example below). However, there is nothing that indicates the requirement, and using the ordered list formatting button does not create a newline above the start of the list.\n---\nExample - Results\n\nSome Test Line\n* This is what happens\n* If you merely start an ordered list\n* without putting an empty line \n* between the start of the list \n* and whatever came before\n---\nExample - Input\n\n> Some Test Line\n> \\* This is what happens\n> \\* If you merely start an ordered list\n> \\* without putting an empty line \n> \\* between the start of the list \n> \\* and whatever came before","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2014-10-03T23:30:38.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overall, our formatting needs a little TLC which is why it's high on our list to address. Along with how quoting currently works we'll be taking a look at the other formatting options and implementing solutions that make a bit more sense + function a little more cleanly. +1 for the great feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Math Test","date":"2014-10-06T21:58:38.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a reason why you couldn't keep a BBCode-style formatting options? That would make the transition more seamless and give people some sense of familiarity. I realize the design of the boards is to \"get away from\" old style forums and be more like reddit, but that doesn't mean you have to forsake some creature comforts for those transitioning.","replies":[]}]}]}
