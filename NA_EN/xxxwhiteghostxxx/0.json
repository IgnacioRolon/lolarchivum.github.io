If the game finished, but it failed when attempting to go to the End-Game statistics screen, then this will not count against your promotion series.  Rest assured, I also performed an in-depth audit of your account, and was able to confirm your game recorded correctly.  You can see this here:\n\nLEAGUE_POINTS_UPDATE_WIN\t | LP: 122 | Mini Series Wins: 1 |\t2013-09-30 06:25:09 PDT\n\nI hope this helps alleviate some confusion!  I do sincerely apologize that you experienced this display glitch!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zaught","date":"2013-10-01T06:23:17.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, here in Oceania I am having the same probably just now. But they are fixing the problem apparently ;P\n\nEdit: It seems that I got no LP. It crashed as soon as it said victory, therefor I got no LP. I won the game and was finally going to get promoted XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"IVDelta","date":"2013-10-01T05:32:24.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having this same problem!
