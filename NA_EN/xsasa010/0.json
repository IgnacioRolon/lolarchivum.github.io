The Hextech Loot is free to begin with and no one's forcing you to buy the keys, or chests. You get an S on a Champion you haven't got one on before and you'll get a Chest. You stay friendly and honorable towards your team you get a chance for a key, and for you even a loot chest. You're already winning, now you just have to be patient when it comes to that loot. You login and sometimes you'll find it pop up for you being honorable. \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"xsasa010","date":"2017-08-11T08:39:01.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"man i can`t force anyone to honor my if they premade in honor fAQ said u not need to get honor for keys just play sportsmanlike and u get ur key seond \ntheys aid if u play all saturday all night u maybe found a little surprise for u so i`m do it \nand i quote :KEY FRAGMENTS\nI'm spooked about key fragments. Can you give me all the changes?\n\nSure can. First, they drop through Honor now. The idea here is to give them a proper home, rather than just having them drop through arcane calculations at the end of your games.\n\nGet all your key fragments by doing two simple things: Playing games, and avoiding Instant Feedback penalties like chat restrictions and bans. That's it. It's an intentionally low bar, because we want you to get your stuff. You donâ€™t need to be honored by teammates to get keys. Individual honors are connected to other rewards like loading screen flairs. Keys can drop whether you win or drop the game. Key fragments no longer drop at end of game screen. They'll hit while browsing the client or on login.\n\nidon`t give a shit about honor i`m just playing safe and make my team won as far as i can they so much friends play together so i`m not granted to get honor so much dont make me a broder to get a key kiss all ur teammate and peg him for honor \nso don`t tell my:{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}  When you're honored you'll find that the loot, such as keys and chests ......... i know i can drive my team to won but shouldn`t ur reward to please everyone to give u honor the key should on my performance....i hope my message was arrived {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]}]}]}
