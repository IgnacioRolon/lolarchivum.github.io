If we want to do some skins where we change everything - particles, sounds, animations, etc., we'll likely have a lower number of skins, as opposed to if we just did some model changes.

You or a friend may have seen a survey pop up at the end of a game. I personally received one after purchasing DJ Sona asking how satisfied I was with the purchase, and what I thought of the skin. We do various surveys that span a wide range of topics.

Looking at the line up for that year, those skins don't have all the bells and whistles that the skins this year have. 1350s, legendaries a couple years ago aren't on the same bar as the content we're putting out in 2015. As I've mentioned we're always looking to improve the content we produce, which sometimes mean quality over quantity. \n\n> That year, the Harrowing felt absolutely magical.

Releasing cohesive, lore-driven events that include game modes, map skins, champ skins, lore stories makes far more sense then releasing random game modes, random skins, etc that don't feel like they are a part of the event. Releasing Twister Treeline made sense as a part of Harrowing. Releasing Underworld Wukong, Ravenborn Leblanc that mimicked the style of Shadow Isles champs made sense as a part of Harrowing. Releasing Zombie Brand, Zombie Ryze, and Zombie Nunu makes sense as a part of Harrowing. Releasing Zombie Slayer skins that could have been released at any time of the year as apocolyptic skins without any negative comment does not. Releasing One for All, a mode unconnected with Harrowing when other old gameplay modes, like Doombots perhaps, that have a spooky theme are available doesn't make sense either.\n\nClaiming that \"this will allow Riot more freedom to act without constraints\" as the Rioter does in that follow up post is flat out laughable. This is the exact same claim Riot made when the decision to burn down the lore was made and *not a single lore event since then has been made that couldn't have occurred in the realm of old lore*. It's patronizing.\n\nI'd like to get one of those surveys. I'd like to explain how much of a chore and an unenjoyable pain Ranked has become for me since the poor balance decisions surrounding  Juggurnauts. I made Plat this season and didn't enjoy it at all. I'd like to explain how much I dislike the way Champ Up seems like a complete toss up as to whether a favorite champ's identity and gameplay will be ripped up and tossed out by a developer that thinks they know better. I'd like to explain how it feels like Riot plays favorites in balance and skin release, while some champs languish for years that Riot doesn't have stated plans to change kit or model. I'd like to explain how I don't trust Riot enough to buy things from them with real money since the Gangolank debacle.

I think it'll make a bit more sense as events start to roll out, and you'll see that it's not as bad as it may be coming off. Part of why we're a bit vague on the subject is because we're still planning some of the later stuff, but trust me, it'll still be cool, just different. *This is just my two cents on the subject!* I do understand the frustrations you've mentioned above - game modes, lore, etc that were tied in previous Harrowing events. I'd ask you give this a chance, and if you'd like, drop me a line once this particular events rolls out - I'd love to see how you feel after the event happens. :] \n\nI handle the skins portion of this, so I can't speak to the events that have tied into Harrowing, Snowdown, etc in the past. Speaking from the skins standpoint - the majority of skins that we create aren't lore-driven and that's by design. We don't want to limit our skins based on who a champion is. By doing that, it gives us a chance to make Sivir good (Warden Sivir), or make Lux a Star Guardian. \n\nThat said, for something like Burning Tides, we did create some lore-based skins, but that was tied into the huge event that rolled out. I understand lore is a touchy subject, and I don't have enough subject matter expertise to speak on behalf of it. *(Not trying to avoid the feedback you've given, I just don't know enough about what's going on with their side of things.*\n\nWe do surveys pretty frequently on a wide range of topics, but I'm not sure the exact reach we aim for. It seems like you have a lot of feedback you'd like to give, and I'd suggest making posts on the board regarding things like gameplay changes, or Champion Updates.

Maybe something in a completely different direction would be cool. But, like _completely_ different. :)\nI still like Slayer though, despite and thanks to the resemblance it holds towards the classic skin, in a way, and I'd probably buy it if I was a Jinx player. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Anihaku","date":"2015-10-14T00:53:52.493+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=EOtjEGZo,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-10-14T00:31:47.654+0000)\n>\n> Hey Sinspunch,\n> \n> *(Sorry for a bit of copy paste here)*\n> \n> As [we've mentioned](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/vg5QEGPB-pbe-bugs-feedback-thread-slayer-pantheon?comment=00010000) in one of the PBE posts, we're doing things a bit differently this year.

For Pantheon and Jinx, we felt they were good candidates for 'zombie slayers', which is why they were the final choices.\n\nKatey,\n\nIm curious about the other skin ideas that you guys were debating over.  Any chance you can give us some info on that?

We did that with Guardian of the Sands Xerath, Rammus and Skarner. When they were originally created, we didn't feel it was the best time to release them, so we held off for about a year, and then released them when we were doing more Shurima-related content. \n\nThat said, there are rare instances where we do scrap something because it just doesn't work out. If we said we had x concept and never released it, it'd be a shitty feeling if that concept was for your favorite champion and you were attached to it. D: \n\nSame would apply for if we said we had a concept for x skin, but we didn't plan to release it soon. It'd be unfair to say we had a concept, but we didn't want to say *when* we'd release it.","replies":[{"poster":"Pykel","date":"2015-10-14T19:59:24.941+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree with the logic behind it, i was just explaining to him that you guys wouldnt give out information like that because like you said say you scrapped or held off on pulsefire lee sin id feel sad. id rather not know you had the idea.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"kneel on Ice","date":"2015-10-14T11:42:08.116+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"So there is no chance Lissandra is getting a new skin this year ? cause she was a great model for Halloween , and she cant get one snowy christmas skin cause her base model is already ice ...","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-14T19:11:07.777+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"*(Replying here as well)*\n\nWe don't have plans to give her a Halloween-esque themed skin this year.","replies":[{"poster":"kneel on Ice","date":"2015-10-14T19:43:35.619+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for answering twice , you are really kind ^_^ Lissandra is my main i was waiting for a new skin of her and i really expected a halloween one , guess i'll just have to wait more and see what is planned for my witch !","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Penta Penguin","date":"2015-10-14T08:36:51.904+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I dn't believe that shit, especially with champs like Tryndamere and Garen that would make great chain-saw wielding maniacs at 1350 or 1800.\n\nIf you wanted to slap a chainsaw onto a stick adn give it to Pantheon, it should have been a Space Marine / Warhammer style skin, especially with the mandrop and jetpack stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"TBakes","date":"2015-10-14T19:01:36.502+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chainsaw Massacre {{champion:86}} \n\nHe would be terrifying charging and spinning with that thing!","replies":[{"poster":"Penta Penguin","date":"2015-10-14T19:23:05.598+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Too bad we'll never see it because selling zombie-shit is more important to Riot","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
