Are you saying that some marksmen might actually get Mordekaiser-level nerf to their visual effects?   Morde lost a bunch of unique effects among most of his skins after the Juggernaut update, effects he's not going to get back because you're done with him for the time being.\n\nI'm afraid of what you guys have planned for the future if this is the case.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Totalwanabe","date":"2015-10-08T22:17:25.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"add item don't remove any and bring back FoN for the laugh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azteryz","date":"2015-10-08T21:59:23.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have faith you guys will make my fav adc {{champion:104}}  even more fun (an actually feel like hes using a shotgun) <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Adalvar","date":"2015-10-10T00:16:46.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you atleast tell us, if this class rework will involve all ADC's or simply those you've deemed as necessary.
