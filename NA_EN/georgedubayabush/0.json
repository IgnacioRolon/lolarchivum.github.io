FPS and ping is fine, but champ stutters","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello everyone i have an Intel i7 4790K Processor 4Ghz, G1 Nvidia GTX 980 Graphics Card 4GB, Corsair Vengeance 8gb 2133mhz overclocked memory. I should have no problems running league at max settings, however, I stutter whenever i leave my FPS uncapped. In game at max settings i will get 600 FPS at beginning going into 300 FPS during laning and 250 during team fights but i \"stutter\" every 5 seconds! The only thing that seems to fix this \"stutter\" is when i set my FPS cap at 144 but every now and then i glitch. Does anyone else experience a similar issue and if so how did you fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-10T00:20:05.456+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey GeorgeDubayaBush, \n\nIf that didn't help the issue  you should write into Riots Tech Support and ask for a little extra help.

I will reach out to them after troubleshooting this issue by adjusting and configuring monitor settings and such. I reset my overclocked RAM to default, and the game runs ALOT better now but it still hops/anti-aliasing every now and then. the good news is that i dont have to run VSYNC or cap my FPS now to even play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-09T21:45:47.694+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey GeorgeDubayaBush, \n\nI read over your post and you're right, you shouldn't be having any issue running league at max settings.
