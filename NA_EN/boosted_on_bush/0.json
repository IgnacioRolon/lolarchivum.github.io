No, when i get into late game it stays at a constant 10-15 fps and i dont even want to get started on team fights. So  i hopped in a chat with a riot support member and we went through a clean reinstallation. nothing has worked. i repeated the steps he gave me at lest 4 times now and nothing seems to fix it. there are many threads that arent being acknowledged on this issue and there are many posts on reddit. i can provide my LoLLogs file from the hextech repair tool to let you see whats going on. my drivers are up to date and so is my pc. i just want to know why im having these problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-16T20:55:56.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your hardware or drivers could be having some issues or just outdated, which can cause drops like the ones you're reporting.  The clean reinstall was a good step, in case any bad game files were failing to render the game properly.  My suggestion in tis case would be to go over each step of the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide.  This will help tune up your pc as well as rule out possibilities.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Boosted On Bush","date":"2017-03-16T23:45:27.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my drivers are up to date as i said in my post. guess i have to make that clear a second time. ive already gone through the guide. i need a solution. none of this is working.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-16T23:50:34.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry about that, I didn't see that you had already created a post on this in another thread.   Usually, a reply to the same thread will ping that it's been updated with a response and help prevent confusion.  :D  That said, It's important to make sure that all of these are covered to rule out possibilities.
