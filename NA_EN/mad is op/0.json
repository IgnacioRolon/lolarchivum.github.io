A client bug that causes you to disconnect from a match is pretty rare. If you provide me with a bit more detail about what behavior or error messages you see when your issue happens, I can give you the right actions to take in order to resolve this.","replies":[{"poster":"MAD is OP","date":"2016-09-04T22:00:10.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when i load into the game the screen stays black until I get a message saying that the game couldn't connect to the server.
