I'm not part of the networking team, so I'm kind of deciphering this with you guys.  :P  I'll reach out to interested parties and  try to get some more clarification on this!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-09T18:05:38.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are different services within league that your network connects to like pvp.net, game servers, and even the matchmaking.  Though you can play matches, it's possible for the ranked server to specifically be unavailable.   Better to have the game up for play, instead of taking it all down if it's unnecessary.   I'm not part of the networking team, so that's just my assumption here but I hope it helps.  Make sure to bookmark the [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page, it could always come up sooner!","replies":[]},{"poster":"0mnivore","date":"2017-05-09T17:52:18.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bumparino","replies":[]}]}
