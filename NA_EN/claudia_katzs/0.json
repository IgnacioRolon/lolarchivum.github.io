First let me tell you what my problem was. When I executed(started) my league of legends client there was a patch to be downloaded. The download speed went from 5MB to 300KB and the ETA was 600 minutes. I tried everything, I looked for the P2P option every forum was suggesting I disable it, I disabled firewall as well as anti-virus software, but what really did the trick for me was the following. I had downloaded the League of Legends installer from north america. Every region has it's own League of Legends installer. If you write League of Legends in google you would see something like https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/ or https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/. You see these links are exactly the same except for the small part after \"https://\"  which signifies the region. I live in East Europe and had downloaded the NA(North America) installer which gave me such a hard time with the download speed, but after I deleted the installed League of Legends from the NA installer and downloaded the eune(Europe Nordic & East) I got full dowload speed as I got from speedtest.net.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-11T22:52:40.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your network might just be hitting some rough spots on it's way to our patching servers.
