Thing is, I was always popular and even now people&#039;ve been telling me I&#039;m liked by a lot of grills but no one comes up to me, and I don&#039;t know their names or who they are if I do, so I can&#039;t talk to them. And I know a lot of guys, but they&#039;re all the type of friend that you only talk to occasionally, or they&#039;re assholes so I don&#039;t wanna get into their clique. What do I do? I feel like I&#039;m \"popular\" but no one wants to talk to me ;___;\n\n\nEdit: Why am I coming to a league forum for this, I have a side bitch for a reason. ","replies":[]}
