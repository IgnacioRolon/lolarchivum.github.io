I doubt any reds will look at this but is there any way you guys could give a better description to me about how you select for pbe.  Im not an old player by any means but i hit thirty fairly wuickly and was wondering. I like to keep track of champions lore maps and bugs that go through pbe cause i think theyre neat. New champs are always fun but thats not my main concern. I found a bug someone posted about cosmic reaver kassadins reaction to a veigar stun basically making it null and want to try testing it out. I dont expect a pbe account at all i was just wondering if maybe you could give me an idea of how it works? Thanks rito ou gys are the best","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-22T01:26:42.138+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HERRO!
