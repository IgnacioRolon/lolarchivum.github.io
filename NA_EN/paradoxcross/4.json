I really enjoy plying Ekko he&#039;s my favorite champion to play. Like over 100k mastery pints on him. Got him on release hour and loved him. Love his kit, love his story, just love everything about him. It&#039;s why I&#039;m sad that his only skin aside from sandstorm (which is a good skin) is Academy which I really am not fond of. I just really want to get a better skin than Academy Ekko.{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"ExecutorDill","date":"2016-04-01T22:06:40.768+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"PaperBoy Ekko!\n\nSet in the time of Knockout Lee Sin and Media Jinx.

Unfortunately, I'm not able to tell you if we have something in mind for him or not. (We generally don't discuss what we do/don't have in development for skin 'cause things can change.)\n\nIn Ekko's defense, He came out in May of 2015, and already has two skins - Sandstorm on release, and Academy Ekko at the end of August 2015. We try spread the love in terms of skins, and there are certainly other champions who deserve a skin a bit more over Ekko at the moment. :)","replies":[{"poster":"ParadoxCross","date":"2016-07-12T02:24:26.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"KATTTEEEYYYYYYYY!!!

It's a weird breakdown, haha. \n\nSo, per patch, we'd have, let's say 3-4 skins in a patch that are actively being developed, so animation, particles audio. We'll also have skins for the following patch being modeled and textured (so again 3-4), and then we'll have stuff several patches out being concepted and ideated on (again, around 3-4). Buuut, this can all vary patch to patch, especially if we have higher tier skins in development, and likewise, if there are a group of 750 RP skins, there may be more in development.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"XxxLumberJackxxX","date":"2016-04-02T12:30:23.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hes been out for a year.
