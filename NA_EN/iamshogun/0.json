I have even been booted from a game and had to restart LOL just to get back in. It's not my computer, but in fact this new client. I've spoken with other players during several of the games and they too experience terrible lagging. To be quite honest, I was never booted from a game, nor did I experience such a terrible lag with the Legacy client. Does anyone else have any thoughts on this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-10T22:45:19.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting disconnected during a ranked game is super stressful, and League is always online so it's bound to happen to the best of us sometimes!  If you're still having this issue, start with going over the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to resolve any obstacles that could be blocking your network from reaching the game server.  You'll want to test this in a custom though to prevent penalties.  Keep in mind that the legacy and updated client are seperate applications, so while you're settings are okay on the legacy they may need to be re-adjusted now.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
