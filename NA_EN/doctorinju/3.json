That's like saying ranged auto attacks are unreliable because of Amumu, Teemo, Graves, Nocturne, Quinn. Or for that matter, anyone that has a stun/fear/charm. \n\nExcept Vi R has much more impact and a much longer range, meaning you aren't gimping yourself if you save it for when it is guaranteed to have an impact. As an engage tool, it is extremely reliable. Just don't be dumb and use it at dumb times. \n\nEdit: People downvoting because they don't have common sense I guess. The lower effective CD something has, the more you're setting yourself behind in a fight when you reserve its use. The longer CD, the more likely someone is to reserve it for when it will have maximum impact. Something having counterplay doesn't make it unreliable. It makes it fair.

You use it when it will have maximum impact. If you know somebody can go untargetable, don't ult them until they use that ability. \n\nCaits ult only does damage, and can only have an impact on a single person, which anyone can block. Imagine of someone could block Vi ult. Cait was given that little utility that back when her Ult was considered one of the worst in the game. Even now good players just use it as poke before a fight more often than not, so that 'reliability' you're trying to claim isn't really there. It would be stupid if Vi got the same treatment. Especially since her ult can't be interrupted. Cait's a pretty terrible example. \n\nMelee abilities are often more reliable than ranged ones, so I don't know why you're trying to argue that a melee ability is more reliable than a ranged one.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-01-13T01:51:05.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":">  It would be stupid if Vi got the same treatment.

One that no ADC except sivir has, who is exactly who you should be ulting the majority of the time. Not to mention that you can still auto, e, q, auto, e and kill sivir during that. \n\n\nLess than 10% of the cast having a tool that can respond to something doesn't make it unreliable. That makes it extremely reliable. \n\nOutside of that, there's Zhonia's. If somebody uses Zhonia's on your ult, they're basically dead anyway if your team is following up on you properly, otherwise you chose an extremely poor target. \n\nReliable doesn't mean perfect. Some things may be advertised 'impossible to break' and have a warranty to back it up, but there are still situations where they break. That's why there's a warranty. Its just rare.

For example:\n\n{{champion:223}} - Despite his Q being \"just another skillshot with a slow\", having it exist as part of An Acquired Taste's system (having it apply a stack, rewarding players with a stun if they've already applied 3) gives it a fresh new feel and new decisions to make. Even among other similar abilities tied to champions within Tahm's role, it's not like Braum's projectile because allies can't interact with its effects, it's not like Mundo's cleaver due to target selection (Mundo wants to hit healthier targets to optimize % current health damage), it's not like Olaf's axe because it's equally useful for chasing and fleeing rather than strongly preferring one over the other with an interactive minigame, it's not like Sion's shout because there's no reason to try to use it on things in front of your target, etc.; it's the decisions that surround these abilities that make them different, not the basic tooltips they're tied to.\n\nLikewise, with 3-hit passives--hell, 3-hit passives that give the user a huge movespeed boost, even, or 3-hit passives that can be partially triggered with a boomeranging skillshot--Gnar's and Ekko's still feel substantially different due to the factors that surround their use. Whether that's attack range, what kind of damage they deal (Ekko's wants to nuke squishies, Gnar's is great for kiting bruisers with high HP but not much MR), whether or not they have an internal cooldown (Ekko wants to skirmish, Gnar wants to kite and flee and chase), and so on! \n\nMy main worry with Jhin, though, is that from what I've seen, it doesn't feel like I'll really be having to make different decision with him compared to Cait, who was recently reworked. My main gameplay as him is still going to involve setting up traps in advance and responding to them with a narrow, long-ranged skillshot that I don't want other enemies to bodyblock; I'm still going to have a special attack that I want to hit a champion with, which I'll generate by attacking minions from safe range; I'm still going to want to either use a really long-range ult to finish people off or soften them up and hope people don't block my projectiles; I'm going to mainly focus on bullying my opponents with impressive range and positioning carefully due to my low mobility, but I'll still be able to distance myself a bit if I prepare for it, and so on. \n\nStrategically, as Jhin, I don't think I'd be able to bring anything to the team that Cait can't aside from some nitty-gritty specifics. \"We want a really slow Marksman that can set up with traps, poke enemies down from range, throw a little CC in the mix, and pick off enemies with their ultimate if they just barely get away from the fight.\" Will the difference between the two really be that Cait provides her root with her trap and not by shooting someone immediately after they get slowed by her trap? That Jhin has to manually aim his ult and Cait doesn't? It doesn't seem like enough distinction to me, and I fear we're just going to get another Akali/Diana situation again--only one of the two will ever be played due to doing their thing better, and the other will sometimes be mentioned as a problem by devs on the forums.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2016-01-13T01:21:53.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ACENOX,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ioagNZtE,comment-id=0006000400020003,timestamp=2016-01-12T23:05:04.096+0000)\n>\n> i think it's already the end, isn't it? at least it is if all the designer think like you \n> \n> because what is important is that we use spells that we consider none has ever in the game, when i play {{champion:82}}  i can turn the fight into 6v4 and none NONE IN THE GAME can do this, and i smile when i think about it. \n\nUh... {{champion:83}} says hi?

After firing all four shots, Jhin takes a moment to reload.\nJhin’s crits deal less damage than normal, and his attack speed doesn’t actually scale with attack speed. Instead, Jhin gains attack damage from any attack speed and crit chance he earns through itemization and runes, while crits give him a burst of movement based on his attack speed.\n\nHe has a reload passive like Graves does, and seems to not be able to use attack speed at all (in the traditional sense). I'm curious to see if he reloads faster as the game progresses, or always at the same rate.

Draven is unique, but you don't need a three page report to describe what his abilities do.  \n\nI see a lot of champions recently who follow this pattern, and Jhin is partially guilty of this as well, though not as extreme as a few others: Here's one ability or passive that does this, this, _this_, is inhibited by this, but gives him this instead which does this to other people, and gives this buff.  That's over-dramatizing the situation, but it's something I don't believe is helping with either readability or accessibility, and instead creates the frustration you guys said you wanted to avoid.\n\nToo much effort is being spent on making the champion look and feel cool without much thought going into what it's like to play with and against them, which is why I consider Jhin was _partially_ guilty seeing as he doesn't have mobility that puts Usain Bolt to shame.

And we sure as hell won't miss you here.\n\nLeague may be getting bigger, but it is definitely not getting better. It wouldn't have such a large amount of people who are dissatisfied with the state of the game if what you said was true. \n\nGranted, I don't believe people should complain about champion kits. They all feel drastically different, no matter how similar kits are. One of the largest over-laps we had was lucian/graves prior to the rework, and they still felt VERY different to play. There was just little reason to pick graves over lucian because lucian just did it better. \n\nAt the end of the day, I appreciate Yasuo being a champion. His design is interesting and he brings much needed interaction to the game, bringing it a little closer to how strategic DotA is. I think people just refuse to adapt and want to keep picking champions he counters. \n\n\n\nWhat's off is champion tuning and map tuning. The current balance state of champions is the most abysmal its been in a long time. Surprisingly, Yasuo isn't even close to being the largest of those issues, despite how much people want to complain about him.\n\nSummoner's Rift is in one of the most dissatisfying states its ever been.\n\nThat doesn't strike me as better. That strikes me as developers shoving out content to scream \"HEY LOOK! NEW STUFF! SPEND RP! ESPORTS!\"\n\nIt strikes me as a company losing passion for the game itself and replacing it with a passion for the money it makes them.\n\nAnd its a shame that the majority of the players are ignoring Riot taking this slippery slope and actually supporting them for it. \nMaplestory used to be massively popular, and they basically died after taking a similar turn. WoW used to be massively popular, and lost a huge following after taking a similar turn.\n\nThe people that just accept what they're doing are the ones allowing Riot to head down the same path. The people supporting them for doing it are the ones killing the game.\n\nCreating content is good. You can praise them for that. Creating content with a blatant disregard for how it affects the game is a terrible, terrible mistake.

I will not support a company that sacrifices quality for quantity as Riot has been doing. Journal of Justice was the first step. Removing weekly balance patches was the second. Downgrading lore was the third. Blatant disregard to game health with champion releases was the fourth. Huge changes to age-old systems that upset the entire roster and cripple diversity even further. Nerfing champions that benefit from a specific item, nerfing the item, and not giving compensation buffs/reverting nerfs. Refusal to fix any problems resulting from changes they make. Power creep despite their original stance against it and still absolute refusal to address it. Mobile champions still having a higher power-budget overall than the majority of immobile ones...3 years later. \n\nThey aren't invested in the game anymore, they're invested in the money, and I will not support that and waste my time on it when I know they're slowly killing themselves. \n\nIts happened time and time again with the most massive games.

As I said, feel free to quit permanently this time, season 6 is right around the corner. You won't drag me or anyone else with you, the game ain't going nowhere.\n\nYou're saying I lack knowledge of the game when A) I'm higher rank than you, and that's with essentially no effort or commitment on my part. You have over 1000 games in ranked, comparatively B) I've been theory-crafting and testing stuff since season 1. I called Abyssal rush and DFG being over-tuned as hell before anyone thought so back in season 1 and 2. Several other similar instances. People called me bad for being ahead of the meta back then, but guess who was right. C) I'm one of the few people that's actually willing to adapt and learn. I can play my champions and I can still get ahead fine. The games just aren't fun anymore. \n\nThe Bilgewater event gave slightly better lore than the original sets of lore. And that was only to a select few champions. There are what, 10 or so champions with what can be considered decent lore now? Compared to just under 100 back in the day. Let's not forget about them removing 3 huge parts of lore that everyone loved. 4 if you include the retcon. But your bias shows, since you've only been playing since season 4 I guess.\n\nThis game is balanced around pros for the most part now. Take a look at pro picks. The majority of champions have some way to engage/disengage in the form of non-ult mobility. The fact that mobility is that influential shows that there's a decent skew of balance. Ezreal's one of the few mobile champions that's balanced properly, if that tells you anything. \n\nSejuani almost CAN'T be weak now. She's Amumu 2.0. She's not the only one who's suffered from being nerfed, then the core item that made them strong gets nerfed, and never getting compensation buffs/reverts. Again, you show that you're highly biased by only considering a single champion like they make or break the argument alone.\n\nWe didn't need keystones. Masteries had a huge impact on either scaling or early game. Support masteries were weak, but offense/defense were very, very strong. You not noticing them practically shows your mindset in games. You don't notice the small things that add up to being huge. Things like the 4% attackspeed and the AD mastery allowing Nasus to perfectly farm under tower without missing any CS. Without it, nope. If you took AD marks and quints on him, nope. Masteries often give the perfect amount of stats, and many people take those stats for granted because they were used to them. Besides, having keystones doesn't require us to have a shitty mastery system. That's the biggest issue. Keystones being poorly implemented and balanced is another.\n\nAs far as champion releases go, practically every rework and release, outside of Bard and Illaoi, have been irritatingly broken to the point of being 100% pick or ban even in tournies. This extends prior to 2015 as well. \n\n\nMy accusations are not emotionally based.

Just your side isn't providing any argument counter to the evidence provided, which is that Riot is heading in a similar direction to other massively popular games that had a huge falling out with their playerbase.
