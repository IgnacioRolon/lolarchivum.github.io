Grab our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run it with **Force Repatch** turned on. If that doesn't work, let's push it a little harder by using that tool to run a **reinstall and clean uninstall**.
