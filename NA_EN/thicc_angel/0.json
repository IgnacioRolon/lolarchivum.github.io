This means in your 10 ranked games, you had Silver 1 to Gold 1 players to start with. To end up in Bronze, you have to lose a minimum of about five games. My rank was silver at the end of S3 and half way through S4, I was plat 1. RL kept me away for about three months though, so I dropped to 5. I'm now back in Plat 4. I've also been in Bronze. At the start of S3, I was Bronze because of the League system kinda screwing up everything. ELO after 10/10 wins was about 1200-1300, depending on what ELO your enemies were, which was considered Bronze still, so... League system introduction didn't make us re-do the first 10. They shoved us into ranks based on ELO. Despite this, I went from Bronze 4 to Silver 1 by the end of S3 and into Plat 1 in S4. If I can do it, anyone can 'cause I know I'm not a pro. You play your best and stay quiet. Mute your teammates if you have to. Trust me. Been there, done that.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"zane yalgir","date":"2015-01-19T10:35:10.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1702044756/211846831?tab=overview\n\nnunu the elo  terroist bro i ganked i got dragons i ruined the enemy team as they got to lane im not b3 cause of me and yes this is a decent game where i actually got a decent start not some loser sitting under a turret to afraid of me with friendly teammates feeding which is the normal for me\n\nand no you cant help when they fed their lanes and you can only hold yours or let them have all the way to inhibitor for a slight prary you can pick those feeders up","replies":[]}]}
