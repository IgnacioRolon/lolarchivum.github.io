The problem is, there is only one real viable strategy at the moment, which is to gangbang botlane because botlane tower happens to be weaker then other towers.\n\nOne mistake dictates the entire flow of the game. But I think what is more maddening is when I see an ADC getting crushed and they somehow REFUSE to build any defense. ADC&#039;s have access to great items that allow them to gain resistances while not losing that much damage themselves ({{item:3156}} is an example) and yet I see ADC&#039;s building the SAME WAY, pretty much every game.\n\nLeague at the moment, feels more like a deathmatch then an actual game about strategy. \n\nI suggested in one game that I go {{champion:43}} support with a {{champion:157}} top and smack about the enemy top laner until he screamed at the jungler for help. It drew the jungler up to top lane and did not allow them to do the usual gangbang in bot lane so our botlane was able to fight on even grounds with the enemy botlane and win through pure laning power. Yes, we sacrificed a jungle (I am a crap jungler anyway) but the strategy worked really well and we won the game because Yasuo got stupidly fed and I kept shielding him. (However, at the beginning, my team called me a \"TROLL\" until we actually started winning)\n\nWhy are people so against adapting to the current meta. Experiment, try new things. A wise man once said,\n\n_&quot;The definition of madness is trying the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result&quot;_\n\nIf you have died in your lane, look at the scoreboard and CHANGE YOUR STRATEGY. Don&#039;t just blindly walk back into lane with your offensive only items and expect to win again.","replies":[{"poster":"GarthBrooksXD","date":"2017-01-05T11:40:08.025+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":20,"body":"Don't worry dude.

Of the items mentioned, one has zero of those stats, one has movement out of combat (assassin-esque, basically the opposite of a carry's needs), one blocks less than a quarter of damage of only one damage type on the squishiest of champions (barring MPen), and the last has major protection against the same main defensive stat the others all already overload on, Magic Resist. Meanwhile, champions like Yasuo, Vi, Camille, and Rengar are popping in and one-shotting ADCs with little to stop them. These were meant to mitigate the abuse, but they won't dig you out of a hole like simply catching an enemy out, which is easier on full damage, and may be squandered otherwise.\n\nThese are items that full-on tanks forego for better protection elsewhere, and tanks are insta-deleted in this meta, particularly on the losing end of things. Why are we thinking a little trickle of damage mitigation is going to bring the tides in your favor on the strongest damage-scaling, most focused champions in the game?\n\nAll in all, damage vs. mitigation, either could save you in the right circumstances. But to say that the best scaling, most range-abusing champions in the game are unwise to build damage on the losing team is just wrong. In fact, the defensive bolster usually only works when the team is literally useless in peel, and basically uses you as fodder to Yi/Yasuo/Darius/Illaoi the enemy team out of existence, in which case your items rarely meant jack to begin with.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Finn Teh Human","date":"2017-01-05T18:05:35.074+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm an ADC main and the problem with what you're saying here is that ADC is the damage powerhouse.
