Even remotely.) She was super toxic to everybody so I made sure to rub that in when we won the game.

Riot doesnt let people get away, or at least in their view they are doing the best they can. I guess no one ever brought up a question at meeting: what if the best isnt good enough. Anywho but yes, they 'dont let people get away'\n2. Its not the game that brings out the worst in people. You see you cant bring out something that isnt there, so lets just be honest: the game PROVIDES an opportunity and environment for people to act in their most honest way. Without restrictions. See people dont act like that in real life because theres consequences. In League such consequences are a hit and miss. You can rage and maybe you get punished, but also maybe not. This allows people to take risks like gambling, And if they won once, its an addicition go repeat. \n\nIm sorry you had to see the basic nature of some people in league.  Lets just say that those never do much better in real life either because basic nature is hard to hide. I hope you find better community in your next games.

I know people get punished because I've seen it (the popup saying my report got someone punished) at least 3 times in as many years.  It's rare and Riot could improve the communication that your reports matter.  However, that doesn't mean since you don't see that little pop up that people aren't being punished with the help of your reports.\n\n2) \"Fight fire with fire\" just makes the flame bigger.  I hope you know that.  If you go at people with negative attitudes, you're going to get nothing but negativity in return.  Try turning that around.  Also, before you blame EVERYONE ELSE for the toxicity you see, I find this quote to be rather enlighening to think about in regards to your own behavior and how it impacts the toxicity of your games. \n\"If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole.\" -Raylan Givens\n\n3) You can think highly of yourself (definition arrogant) and still not be toxic.  I think you mean abuse.\n\n4) See 2 for reference.  I don't see nearly the toxicity people seem to claim is so ubiquitous to the community.  That's because I try to bring positivity with me, and if it is clear that someone is: finger pointing, blaming others, being hostile.  I know how to mute someone really easily, and do so quickly so their toxicity doesn't come even close to my mentality beyond that point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-01-07T04:28:19.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Intentionally feeding?
