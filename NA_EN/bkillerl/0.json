Should Riot give more Refund?","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone thought on the League store refund? I feel like Riot should bring back more of our refund. Sometime there are champions that we don&#039;t play or sometime out of meta, or maybe they get reworked, and it like a waste of money and investment for the Skin of my champions. For me personally, I have 3 Tristana skins, but since they reworked her back in Season 5 I barely played her, and the skin look way different than it was before and I didn&#039;t like that because sometime the old Visual look better. There are also situation where some people might miss click on a skin. I know we got 3 already,but if you been playing league for a long time, back then, the refund wasn&#039;t as important and there was no champions spotlight back then so we couldn&#039;t see how the skin would look like. Maybe one or two Refund per season could also be a possibility","replies":[]}
