And jokes should not be made at peoples' expense, especially when the purpose of the game is not to bring those kinds of issues front and center. It's a game, for people to play.

It's not a part of the expected experience, so people don't have the context needed to know it's a joke. It's bound to offend people because it's extremely offensive material. It will frequently offend people unless they know ahead of time that it's intended to be used as a joke. Are you unfamiliar with the importance of context and the importance of preparing your audience for a punchline?\n\n> It only gets political when you try to get rid of it. Before then, you just either have a laugh or shake your head and move on.\n\nracism is a social and political issue. Joking about it doesn't change that. And joking about it by pretending to be part of a scummy organization is too extreme to work except in environments where the audience is prepared and is expecting it to be a joke.\n\n> So action should be taken based on speculation?\n\nDon't cherry pick, you're taking pieces of my argument out of context. You did this for the whole comment.\n\nThe problem is that the representation of the organization is bad for things overall. Not only is it offensive and racist (and entirely unacceptable for reasons already outlined related to jokes and when it's safe to make extreme ones), but it is also visibility and representation for said group. If people are forced to remember it or think about it then they are reminded of a whole bunch of awful shit that they didn't queue up for a game of league to be reminded of in.\n\nI feel like it's necessary to qualify here: the topic we're discussing here is very touchy in the USA, you're not from the USA so I think it's possible that you're talking about in EU.
