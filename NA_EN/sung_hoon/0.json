Because of this crash, it was immediately recorded as a loss on my series. This is extremely unfair. I don't know how many people have had the same bug, but client will usually crash during champ select in a variety of situations. If anybody else has had similar issues, please post because I'm curious as to how many people have actually had this problem.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, please do consider patching the current client. I understand there is currently an alpha for the new client underway, but that could take an unknown amount of time to be implemented and a large number of people would definitely benefit from fixes to the client right now. Many of my friends complain and I'm sure the community would be happy with a delay for champions or renovations as long as we can get a stable, unbugged client.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-26T20:29:15.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has happened to me personally as well, and it is one of the shittiest feelings that you are already starting your series in a deficit without ever getting into a game.  I went ahead and looked at North America as a whole, and I haven't seen any widespread issues with disconnects from the client or Champ Select.  Therefore, this issue seems to be more local, and given it happens consistently, there may be an issue with your connection to PvP.net (the client).\n\nIn order to rule this out as a possible root cause for the client crash, make sure to complete all of the steps found in our [Connection Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).  There are a lot of steps there, but they are all crucial in hopefully preventing this from occurring again.\n\nReply back and let me know if you are still experiencing any issues!","replies":[]},{"poster":"what you deserve","date":"2016-05-26T19:36:51.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has happened to me through about 5 series so far..","replies":[]}]}
