But there is and has been, I have been playing games long enough to know what one is and how they use them. Aside from the DDOS attacks even on the best players in the game at that time, which they can easily check on op.gg which I have had done on myself as well, right down to hacking my LoL account last week while I was in game, which I caught and traced the IP back to EU. \n\nThis is a theory, but I get the feeling there are some exploits developed for this game Riot has no idea even exist. And many will say the hell with that, and that is ok because only a fool would think that. In the computer world almost anything is possible. So aside from what Riot already knows about such as the lag switches, dodge, auto, ummm ward and map exploits, zoom-hack, aim-bots for the skill shot champ,  lag switches of course, EX/LP exploits I could go on. These exploits are still in the game I encounter them still often. And or just boosting and the worst one bots, some still running from years ago from what I found on line in the hacking forums. I don't use these by the way, just research to develop my anti cheat for games coming out in the next couple years. \n\nBut I also feel ones that don't get sold online and stay on the black market, a couple tools that help the hacker see who the other team is selecting for champs in champ select, and another that allows players to dodge Q's, and dodge Q's until they get either their bot or feed account on the apposing team, and or 4 of them in game together on the ranked solo/duo Q. This is just a theory of mine at this stage, but I am researching. I have my degree in Network Security, and Admin/Forensic which I finished year before last, since then it kind of opened my mind to the possibility's of exploiting in the PC world and games. \n\nI have a couple other theory's as well which I am researching for Riot which I will keep to myself until i have proof or enough evidence. But given the games coding, and server set up's it is not hard to exploit in this game and develop programs that can work around the games boundaries with our Riot knowing. \n\nSo if you think you are being targeted sometimes in game, you could be. \n\nBut first start ruling out all other options, repair the client? See if the problem continues? Uninstall the game and delete all files and folders of from the previous installation from your program files as well, taking LoL right off your PC. Then reinstall the game see if the problem continues? \n\nHave you checked your Video card and short term memory (Ram) for errors or any needed updates on your Video audio? Is your video card old? Do you have enough ram? Also if your power supply is not powerful enough for all the components, the performance will be dramatically negatively affected. It won't work, or it might work for simple things, then fail when your graphics card powers up to run a game or graphically intense application.\n\nIs your PC dusty? That one you would be surprised about, many do not blow the dust off of their components in their PC tower or Laptop?\n\nChange your passwords, encrypt them as well. \n\n\n~J","replies":[{"poster":"ControIIer","date":"2017-12-22T19:16:48.697+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll see what I can do about it, I'll try to be more aware of my games and be vigilante around League.\n\nAnd no, I don't think my Graphics card is outdated, nor that if I have enough ram. It is possible it could be a malware or a virus affecting something, but the recent scan and search I received back was no threats. So I'm still around the gray areas of this issue.\n\nThank you for the wonderful suggestion, it really does sound pretty intriguing and something to be fully aware, much appreciation!","replies":[]}]}]}
