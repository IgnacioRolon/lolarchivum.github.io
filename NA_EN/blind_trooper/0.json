I would love to see that scroll with you somehow, either as part of the PvP.net banner at the top or something that scrolls at the bottom. It's annoying to always have to scroll that far back up and would make the UI a smoother experience :)","replies":[{"poster":"MaliceCity","date":"2014-02-05T20:42:21.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a good suggestion and we will definitely look into it.
