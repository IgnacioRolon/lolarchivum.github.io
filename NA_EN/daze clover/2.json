So maybe you should look for other people to watch, people that play top and that know how to play aatrox before you state that he is bad. And he just got a GIANT hotfix, so another overbuff would push it too far.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ValiantKiller","date":"2018-07-06T22:00:43.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=saltran,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gnfU6QEo,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-07-06T21:50:29.037+0000)\n>\n> No, he&#x27;s already beign picked on Rift Rivals without the last Hotfix buffs since they play in the last patch and he&#x27;s fine on soloQ aswell.\n> \n> The moment I saw both the Boards and Reddit claiming that new Aatrox was useless, the worst rework in the history and CLUNKY I knew that he was a fine rework that would be good with just a few numbers changes.\n> \n> So no, don&#x27;t overbufff Aatrox (more).\n\nHe already can take 70% of hp of his laner level 1 by full good Q combo landing, idk why they need more buffs for that god.","replies":[{"poster":"Daze Clover","date":"2018-07-06T22:11:37.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a new released champion 47 percent winrate, all I ask is to buff him to 50 percent and then they can nerf him\n\n_this is his biggest problem\n_\n* everyone in solo q picking squishy  and the squishy champions are so good at dodging aatrox q","replies":[{"poster":"ValiantKiller","date":"2018-07-07T00:58:37.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Daze Clover,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gnfU6QEo,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-07-06T22:11:37.029+0000)\n>\n> a new released champion 47 percent winrate, all I ask is to buff him to 50 percent and then they can nerf him\n> \n> _this is his biggest problem\n> _\n> * everyone in solo q picking squishy  and the squishy champions are so good at dodging aatrox q\n\nLook dude, he got that winrate cause i saw many people using the old build with him which is Bork, RAgeblade, Hydra and not using black cleaver or death dance or anything that fit his style.\nJust give it time till his pick rate goes normal and you will see improve.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
