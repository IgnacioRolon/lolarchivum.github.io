It looks stupid. The knife he throws should at least spin, if its not going to spin then make it a ballistic knife.\n\nAlso, you guys made him into like some kinda Tom Clancy's Ghost/Splinter Cell thing. Make his passive be indicated by his cape, like a vfx in which the cape changes colors or pixelates as he stealths. Pls Rito, don't rush this awesome skin. I can wait.\n\nFurthermore, give him more interactions!!!! For an 1820 skin he should have more! For example, Teemo's best friend is a bush, give him an interaction when he enters a bush like \"They won't find me now.\" etc. Since he already has a Nashorn's Tooth interaction, give him an actual Baron interaction if he assist or slays Baron possibly Dragon too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Goilo","date":"2015-03-26T01:41:52.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure that would be cool, or some spinning top glassy looking with a nuke symbol flashing on them, when blown up it mushroom clouds","replies":[]}]}
