I was AFK all day, unable to watch today&#039;s games live. I exerted extra effort to avoid getting spoilers from friends, social media, etc. Logged into the client to get a link to the first game I want to see and BAM! There&#039;s the results plastered right above the video! Not only does it display the results of THAT game, but also the current standings of both teams involved (aka the final standings after the entire day).\n\nI could understand if someone ELSE gave me spoilers, but no. I managed to dodge everything EXCEPT YOUR OWN WEBSITE! What&#039;s so frustrating about this whole thing is that I remember a time when that option was available. When viewing past games, spoilers were turned off by default, and I would need to explicitly click a button to enable them.\n\nSo why is the system set up like this? Why is it that when I go to watch a game played earlier today, the results are in a location where it&#039;s the very first thing displayed on the screen?\n\nNotice the LoL Client is free of spoilers:\nhttp://imgur.com/5Ozh1wv\n\nBut clicking &quot;Watch&quot; brings you straight to spoiler town:\nhttp://imgur.com/H1j8NI4","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-10-07T07:37:57.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I can only assume you don't go to ESPN to look for anything ever...","replies":[{"poster":"Wiksolop72","date":"2016-10-07T07:56:09.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is that relevant? ESPN is either just as disappointing or they're setting a higher standard. Either way, I would still expect Riot to step their game up.\n\nedit: so I checked out the ESPN website and there's a fundamental difference. You can't watch past broadcasts online. ESPN treats their website as more of a source of sports news, rather than the place to watch. Providing spoilers is actually the point. You don't go to ESPN.com to watch games, but LoLesports.com is a primary source to watch games.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-10-07T08:08:36.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The intended use is the same as ESPN. Just because they are able to put the full games doesn't mean that's the place mean to watch, it's more of a statchecking site like ESPN, which is why it's basically a spoiler, it keeps up with a live upbringing\n\nYou're better off hitting up youtube first instead of a highlight factchecking website lol LoLesports.com which does what it's intended to do. Asking them otherwise negates the entire reason for the site.","replies":[{"poster":"Wiksolop72","date":"2016-10-07T08:37:19.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But there are other pages to check the stats. LoLesports.com has a separate page for \"Teams & Standings\" and \"Stats\". There's no need to provide spoilers on the page where I wanted to watch a game. \n\nI'm not asking that they REMOVE the results, but instead HIDE them behind a button prompt. If you want spoilers, you can get them. If you don't want spoilers, you don't see them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
