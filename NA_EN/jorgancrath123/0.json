If a rioter sees this, please reply and I would be happy to argue this further. If not, please upvote so that we actually have a chance of reporting s*itty support like this, because we have no chance of doing anything as they don't fear repercussions at all. I proved this because I opened another ticket and got instantly connected with the same Agent where he just said hello again ^^. \r\n\r\nChat started on 13 Aug 2019, 10:11 AM (GMT+0)\r\n(10:11:20)\t*** Visitor 18474762 joined the chat ***\r\n(10:11:20)\tJorgAncrath123: I just lost 15lp because of your idiotic 10-year-old bug for the Xth time did not start the game after champ select, just said game is still in progress, and nothing happens. Waited for a few minutes, nothing, restarted client twice, nothing and then while i restarted my PC they remaked and I took the full penalty that is your responsibility and not mine (not the support agent, but the incapable developers and Q&amp;A team ofc). How am I going to be compensated for the loss of this LP, since it's not on my side?\r\n(10:11:33)\t*** Genathos joined the chat ***\r\n(10:11:40)\tGenathos: hello there ^^\r\n(10:12:35)\tGenathos: I'm pretty sure the problem it's not on our side but I can troubleshoot to check what needs to be improved :)\r\n(10:12:44)\tJorgAncrath123: by all means\r\n(10:12:48)\tJorgAncrath123: go ahead\r\n(10:13:11)\tGenathos: sadly no compensation or LP back since we don't have reports about this :-&lt;\r\n(10:13:16)\tGenathos: are you familiar with the hextech repair tool?\r\n(10:13:20)\tJorgAncrath123: yes\r\n(10:13:23)\tJorgAncrath123: ran it a few days ago\r\n(10:13:30)\tJorgAncrath123: nothing is corrupted since then\r\n(10:13:35)\tGenathos: can you run it again and give me the logs provided by the app?\r\n(10:13:38)\tJorgAncrath123: no files have been downloaded except for simply playing the game\r\n(10:13:40)\tJorgAncrath123: sure\r\n(10:14:49)\tJorgAncrath123: And I want an investigation to clearly let me know exactly what casued the bug\r\n(10:14:52)\tJorgAncrath123: caused*\r\n(10:14:59)\tJorgAncrath123: and i do mean to very well be compensated\r\n(10:15:07)\tJorgAncrath123: since i am 99.9% sure it isn't on my side.\r\n(10:15:42)\tGenathos: let's see what happened first :)\r\n(10:16:37)\tJorgAncrath123: trying to find the LoL logs folder\r\n(10:16:54)\tGenathos: on the desktop\r\n(10:17:07)\tJorgAncrath123: aha\r\n(10:17:08)\tJorgAncrath123: i see it\r\n(10:17:12)\tJorgAncrath123: so which file do you need?\r\n(10:17:51)\tGenathos: all the folder\r\n(10:17:55)\tGenathos: just drag and drop it here\r\n(10:18:13)\tJorgAncrath123: Visitor uploaded: ping.txt URL: (Link hidden due to safety concerns)

network _ info _ log.txt file\r\n(10:19:11)\tJorgAncrath123: during the entire duration of the issue\r\n(10:19:20)\tJorgAncrath123: i had music working on youtube\r\n(10:19:26)\tJorgAncrath123: and my phone's wifi was working as well\r\n(10:19:31)\tJorgAncrath123: and i was on the riot support page\r\n(10:19:38)\tJorgAncrath123: not my network\r\n(10:19:45)\tJorgAncrath123: so if it was a connection issue, it was on your end.\r\n(10:20:19)\tGenathos: well you wanted an explanation, _**~~can i explain or you are gonna accuse us that is on our end?~~ >.>**_\r\n(10:20:34)\tJorgAncrath123: sure, by all means explain away\r\n(10:20:51)\tGenathos: open the network_info_log.txt file\r\n(10:20:55)\tJorgAncrath123: done\r\n(10:21:00)\tGenathos: and check for the row \"Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx(Preferred) \" (hidden due to safety concerns)\r\n(10:21:18)\tGenathos: your ipv6 is active which is not good, good connection doesn't mean only good ping\r\n(10:21:27)\tGenathos: servers read numbers only, otherwise errors encounter\r\n(10:21:41)\tGenathos: you will encounter eroors*\r\n(10:21:58)\tGenathos: _**~~that was the issue ~~^^**_\r\n(10:22:22)\tJorgAncrath123: okay, so the fact that I have that enabled and I haven't touched any of my network settings in months\r\n(10:22:32)\tJorgAncrath123: and that it is an isolated issue that happens once in forever\r\n(10:22:42)\tJorgAncrath123: you're telling me that's causing it?\r\n(10:22:53)\tJorgAncrath123: even though it doesn't reoccur\r\n(10:23:03)\tGenathos: yes, i know, laptops/pc are basically doing that automatically but it's always better if we turn that off\r\n(10:23:05)\tJorgAncrath123: so something on this specific lobby, this specific game\r\n(10:23:13)\tJorgAncrath123: caused an anomaly\r\n(10:23:43)\tGenathos: well i don't argue with you, ~~_**it's a god damn broken client xD but this wasn't a problem with our servers, it's just something meticulous**_~~\r\n(10:24:02)\tGenathos: that happens to everybody at some point\r\n(10:24:51)\tJorgAncrath123: I am amazed\r\n(10:24:55)\tJorgAncrath123: literally speechless\r\n(10:25:00)\tJorgAncrath123: that i lose LP over this.\r\n(10:25:14)\tJorgAncrath123: and you tell me \"happens to everyone, your fault for having ipv6 or whatever on\"\r\n(10:25:39)\tJorgAncrath123: please escalate this ticket to your senior agent or superior, I'm not satisified with the lack of proof provided\r\n(10:25:45)\tJorgAncrath123: you just looked at a setting and guessed it might be it\r\n(10:25:54)\tJorgAncrath123: without any certainty\r\n(10:27:23)\tGenathos: if you are not satisfied with my investigation please try to submit another chat or ticket since we are all equal here. ~~_**if you refuse to accept this explanation or you cannot understand it it's not my problem, I tried to explain it to you even though i wasn't obligated to do this ^^**_~~\r\n(10:28:17)\tGenathos: ~~_**you are not the only one with these problems, and others have a lot more serious problems and even bigger losses**_~~\r\n(10:28:57)\tJorgAncrath123: Yeah, I'm also gonna report you. You're a god awful support agent, without soft skills or tact. And if someone is having a bigger problem that does not devalue or deflate my problem one bit.\r\n(10:29:00) \t*** JorgAncrath123 has rated the chat Bad ***\r\n(10:29:31)\tGenathos: that's just your opinion, players usually are more understandable and happy with the explanation ^^\r\n(10:29:39)\tGenathos: anyway, thanks for your feedback :)\r\n(10:29:57)\tGenathos: I guess you don't need the troubleshoot steps since you are so ~~_**refusing to collaborate**_~~ :)\r\n(10:29:59) \t*** JorgAncrath123 has commented: Extremely unprofessional, lacking any tact or soft skill, outright told me my problem is insignificant because someone else has a bigger problem and bigger losses. This agent needs to be fired asap. ***\r\n(10:30:00)\tGenathos: have a good day.\r\n(10:30:11)\tGenathos: you can close the chat by going to options.\r\n(10:30:34)\tJorgAncrath123: just making sure i get the transcript first\r\n(10:30:44)\tJorgAncrath123: This kind of support needs to be disciplined\r\n(10:30:47)\tGenathos: yes of course, you can send it to your email\r\n(10:31:32)\t*** JorgAncrath123 left the chat ***","replies":[]}
