Second off, the problem with busting intentional feeders and trolls is that proving intent to troll or int as opposed to having a bad game or just simply playing off-meta is far more difficult to do compared to simple chat related offenses. There's also the matter of validly banned trolls and inters rarely coming to the forums to complain about it, as more often than not they already know what got them in trouble.\n\nTrust me, we all wish that these types of players were punished faster and more consistently than they are now, and that's something Riot definitely needs to work on improving, but they do get punished as the examples I listed shows.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tokishi7","date":"2019-12-02T07:19:37.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Periscope,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=k59Ku1y0,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2019-12-02T03:48:30.446+0000)\n>\n> Pretty abnormal since most people that peruse this sub board don’t agree with that point.
