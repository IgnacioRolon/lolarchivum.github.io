I&#039;m too low elo to make balance suggestions, but the difference is that I actually recognize that so I don&#039;t make suggestions. The majority of you are so low elo that you are unable to comprehend that your bronze - mid Diamond experience means absolutely nothing and that challenger/pro players are playing a different game.\n\nThere are far too many QQ shitposts in Gameplay and Balance, the saddest part is that they're not even intentional, but rather made out of ignorance. \n\n[Edit]: Key points are (Warning: walls of text)\n\n>High elo players are the best that we have to work with. Sure they're not knowledgeable in everything, but a challenger support main has a much better idea of how the game should be balanced than a silver support main, simply because they are actually seeing what is actually strong or weak. A silver player is not playing the same game as challenger players because in silver champion potential is always left unrealized. As a result they have a distorted sense of what is strong or weak. \n\n>**This also ties into balancing from top down and why it's better (this is for people who keep on insisting that we balance for the majority of players instead of for the best)**. Not only does it undermine competitive integrity if you balance from the bottom up (competitive players will have to deal with extremely imbalanced champions) but you cannot get a good idea of how strong a champion is when you have confounding variables. Imagine that you believe a champion is weak, but is it weak because\n\n>1.) Champion is actually weak\n2.) Players are too shit to use the champion\n3.) Champion is new and people have completely adapted to it yet\n\n>So 3 can be ruled out as the reason (or at least part of the reason) for why the champion is weak once given enough time. If you cater your balancing for silver players, you need to consider 2, which then means we don't know if the champion is ACTUALLY weak or if the players are just to shit to use the champion. What happens if you cater your balancing for the best players? Then you can rule out 2, because players at that level are able to realize the champion's full potential. Therefore if the champion is still struggling at the highest levels of play, we can say that it's truely because a champion is weak and not because of anything else. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>And also, if I am so bad and not playing my champ to full potential and neither is my opponent, then we could still make accurate statements about their strengths/weaknesses and if something is out of balance. \n\nNo. A low-skill Riven will be way worse than an equally low-skill Malphite. A low-skill Zac will be way better than a low-skill Lee Sin. When you're at a low-skill rank, champions do not perform equally despite everyone being low skilled. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Fate Fire,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QugMEt3p,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2017-01-12T00:48:42.917+0000)\n>\n> A dwarf on the shoulders of a giant will see farther than the giant himself. That being said, every person has a blind spot so everyone&#x27;s opinions should be held at an equal level. Dividing people into &quot;elos&quot; shows that you have no respect for the players themselves and hold a higher value to a rank over experience.\n> \n> Let&#x27;s say you have two people, one is a Bronze V Draven who has played him since release, then you have the Diamond I Draven who&#x27;s playing him first time. Who&#x27;s word would you trust more, the one who&#x27;s played them more or the one who&#x27;s played the game more? Skill and Knowledge are two separate things. Just because you made it up there does not make you instantly knowledgeable of the entire game.\n\nExcept your analogy fails because there is a positive relationship between height and eyesight. If the dwarf represents a bronze player and the giant represents a challenger player, then the dwarf would have the eyes of a human while the giant would have the eyes of a hawk. \n\nYou are both looking at the \"same thing\", except the bronze player will miss all the details while the challenger player will be able to see them. Bronze players will watch a high level replay and fail to grasp the reasoning behind a player's actions. A challenger player will watch a replay understand the player's motive for their actions. \n","replies":[{"poster":"HazyCloud7","date":"2017-01-12T00:34:27.885+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should've said stop making balance suggestions based on anecdotal experience.

Bronze players will watch a high level replay and fail to grasp the reasoning behind a player's actions. A challenger player will watch a replay understand the player's motive for their actions. \n\nSkill and knowledge are two different things, and they both help a player to climb. It is exceedingly rare to have someone so far under the bell curve in terms of mechanics yet be so far above the curve in terms of knowledge that they end up somewhere in low elo.","replies":[{"poster":"Risk of Fate","date":"2017-01-12T02:07:54.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're assuming that the player is going to watch a replay and say \"I can do that!\" and hop right into it.

Only people with a lack of patience really do that, for the rest people will look at a replay and see what&#x27;s going on. \n\nNo, I'm not assuming that at all. What I know for a fact is that a low elo player will be watching a high elo player do something and not even realize that something was done.\n\nLet's say the player they are watching (call that person X and the enemy laner Y and say that they are top lane and are both challenger) did NOT kill two ranged minions that were both one hit away from dying. Let's say that we're exactly 3 minutes into the game. The next wave is in an advantageous location for X, because the wave is then closer to X's side than it is to Y's side. The minion numbers advantage wave will continue pushing the wave to X's side if left alone.\n\nA very low elo spectator will not even notice that the minions are in a good spot for X. A slightly higher elo spectator can see that X has the wave closer to X's side and so X has the wave at some advantageous location. A bit higher elo spectator will see that player X intentionally did not last hit those 2 ranged minions to freeze to have the push to X's side, and last hitting even one of them would not have resulted in the minions pushing to X's side.  \n\nAn even higher elo spectator will see that X's jungler has already cleared their bottom side jungle, and X's bot lane has little kill pressure since it's Ezreal and Janna. What that means is that X's jungler has little motivation to go bot side (gank will likely fail bot lane due to having little lockdown), and will come top side because at the very least X's jungler will have camps to clear. What that means is that by the time X has the minions close to his tower, X's jungler will likely be nearby if Y overextends to get CS. \n\nWhat a high elo spectator will see is what Y's jungler showed themselves in a gank and has revealed three pieces of information: the remaining duration on red and blue buff, their level, and their CS. Early on in the game you can deduce from that exactly what camps have been cleared, which tells you where Y's jungler will be motivated to go. Then you can assess the risk of Y's jungler being there for a counter gank if X's jungler decides to gank. \n\nA low elo spectator and a high elo spectator will watch the same replay yet the high elo player spectator is able to see so much more. It has nothing to do with patience, because one spectator is effectively watching a different game than the other. \n\nTo further illustrate I'll ask you: if you're in the top lane with teleport, do you think you can punish an enemy top laner who grabs a summoner spell other than teleport (like exhaust or ignite) besides using your teleport for TP ganks around the map? If you think you can punish them for taking ignite/exhaust, how do you do it? \n\n>Sure they might not understand it, but it does not mean they are not willing to try and learn how things work a certain way. Humans have a want to do better than their ancestors, to build up and improve upon what&#x27;s been done before.\n\nEven if they're willing to learn, that doesn't mean they know how to go about learning. As I illustrated earlier, high elo players are able to see things that low elo players cannot. Merely wanting to learn does not allow you to suddenly see things. \n\n> Two people watch one thing but get two different answers. As I&#x27;ve said before, every person has a blind spot when it comes to knowledge and others might see what you don&#x27;t. Let&#x27;s say for example when I was playing Ahri.

Me thinking that I&#x27;m the better mid laner suddenly finds themselves losing lane, hard.\n\nA low elo Kassadin will not be able to use Kassadin to his maximum potential (which is why they're low elo). Even if you play against a Kassaddin, win or lose, you will not be able to gauge from that experience the true strength of that champion because it has not been shown to you. Which again brings me back to my point: shitters (myself included) should not talk about balance when they know nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Risk of Fate","date":"2017-01-12T15:01:34.715+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Since you're going to go on invalidating my points by saying \"Oh, they're Low Elo and therefor incapable of doing better, a Challenger knows everything,\" I'm going to stop arguing here.
