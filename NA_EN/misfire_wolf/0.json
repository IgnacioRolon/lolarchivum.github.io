I didn't think much of it but after like 5 game I started to have random spikes where I would lose control of my champ and everything would freeze . after that the game would quickly rush me back to what I missed which normally was me dyeing cause I couldn't do anything during the spike. I have tried using the hextec repair I have restarted my connection I have also tested it its saying my ping is fine but when I open league and play I have 70+ ping which is still green and I only freeze/lag in league pls help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-06T03:35:47.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you're experiencing sounds just like *Packet Loss* or *High Packet Buffering*.
