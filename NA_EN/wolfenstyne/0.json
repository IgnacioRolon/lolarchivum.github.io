Why are they coming to Tallahassee though? Not exactly a center of culture for the state. Would Miami (Tampa, Orlando) not be a better location? Does anyone ever come to vacation in Florida and go : gee I would love to see Tallahassee . Miami works as an international metropolis that you can use in discussion with Paris, Beijing. Tallahassee does not.  \r\n\r\n  Any Rioters in eSports want to give insight to the thought process here?","replies":[{"poster":"NeoDeimos","date":"2015-04-14T23:29:22.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure, why not in Miami? At last, Miami would finally have a sporting event where people actually showed up on time... instead of the 4th inning of a Marlins game, or midway through the 2nd quarter of the Heat or Dolphins...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-14T18:12:49.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's likely Venue Pricing and Availability. Not all venues of the size they would like may be available. \n\nJust a brief search of May events in the locations you pointed out shows that most large venues (that would accommodate MSI) are in use for other events.","replies":[]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-04-14T16:16:05.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It covers way more people. It's easier to drive to from other states, basically. Charlotte, Miami, New Orleans, Atlanta, and Charleston are all within ~450 miles away.  Not an impossible drive for a weekend, and at least it's cheaper than flying to Miami. Plus it was probably cheaper and easier to arrange their equipment installation.","replies":[]}]}
