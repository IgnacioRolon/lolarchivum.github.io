I started experiencing really low fps (4-1 fps) despite my decently low ping between 80-110.  I've already dropped all the graphics to Very Low and Off (used to be Medium with Low shadows).This has never happened before and I'm at a loss. Any help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"root winner","date":"2016-09-06T19:59:56.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so I got the same problem but only with fps and like a day ago I had no and my game was always 60 fps but now Is like 20 fps  and here is the fix for that make sure you have latest drivers for your video card I haven't updated them since I got my pc so doing so my problem was instantly fixed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-04T23:46:13.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Latency (ping) and FPS are *rarely* connected, as they're influenced by very different systems.
