Rebooting, restarting client and reconnecting doesn't give any different results.\n\nI'm currently running a full repair on the client to see if this will fix the problem.\n\nOh and I'm pretty sure it's not that my internet has been disconnected as i have no issues playing other online games, writing this post, streaming movies and none of my other flatmates in the house has complained about internet issues.\n\nI have googled and i see there are several people here on the forum complaining about this exact issue with no real results. This post just happens to be the latest which is why i'm replying here.\n\nRito please.  {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"miyue147","date":"2017-01-08T17:42:13.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"come on... somebody.. plz..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-09T00:30:36.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"This error message indicates there's an issue with one or more of your local network configurations that could be causing a *poor connection* to our servers.
