No.  Are there other items that don&#039;t sustain a build by themselves, but count on picking up another 250 mana to help you do so?  No, it&#039;s a bit greedy for support to count on that.

The fact is that aura items are just balls of stats, and while some players find that incredibly useful, few find it fun. It's better to introduce some new mechanics into the game to spice things up.\n\nThe same can be said for Runeglaive; Riot is taking away the ball of stats magus and adding an item that's a little more interactive.

It's certainly cost efficient, but the number of champions that can use it's effect needs to be really high in order to make it good.

Imagine if Bloodthirster suddenly became an AP item, with nothing remotely equivalent to replace it. Or imagine a pair of boots suddenly became a gold item with nothing to do with movement speed. That's what we're dealing with here. \n\nAnd Zeke's is fine as is. No, it's not the most popular item on AP Supports because it wasn't meant for them in the first place! It's meant for tank supports and should be kept for them, not changed into yet another AP active item.","replies":[{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2015-06-30T04:39:00.970+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The difference between Zeke's and something like BT or boots getting changes is that BT and boots are core items that people actually build.\n\nNo one builds Zeke's Herald, and for good reason.\n\nIt's stats are bad (you can get better stats for 600 less gold with double Kindlegem) and its effect is either bad due to a lack of targets or is good because you built a bad team comp.
