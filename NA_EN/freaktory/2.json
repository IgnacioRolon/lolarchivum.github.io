If you sign onto a competitive, objective oriented game, then refuse to actually push towers just so you can pretend this is a call of duty tdm...Get the fuck off the game. \nYou arent wanted, or needed.\n\nYou dont sign up to play baseball, then say you ONLY came to toss the ball back and forth (and not actually play baseball...just play catch)\nthats the same thing. You sign onto an objective based game that revolves taking towers to destroy the enemy nexus, Then just fuck around wanting to run around chasing kills. No interest in actually taking towers or winning.\nThen turn around and use \"hur its just a game\" or \"its just norms\" or \"its just ARAM\" as some debate-ending victory response. \nYeah, its a game, -A COMPETITIVE GAME- \nthese are the same people who get mad at people like me who try and take towers because I wont help them spend the game ARAMing mid for kills. \n\nyou want a casual game? Go play \"go fish\" or \"checkers\" \n\nYou want to chase kills? Fine, FUCKING UNISTALL LEAGUE and go play an FPS. Go play CoD, Go play Halo. but GET THE FUCK OFF LEAGUE. YOU ARE NOT WANTED. \n\nI am so fucking sick of this NA Casual attitude on a competitive game.\n\nEdit: Oh Look, My first Downvote. Someone apparently likes having all thier hard work and effort completely dismissed and invalidated by 3-4 little words.\n\nyou work hard to take dragons, you work hard to farm your levels and secure the kills needed to HELP YOU TAKE TOWERS. \nAnd one person throws ALL THAT AWAY and decides to throw the match. They turn to you and completely dismiss you, your hard work,your effort, your strategy with \"bruh, its just a game/Its just norms\" \nYeah. Why actually try and win, why actually have a competitive game based around objectives. cuz \"its just norms, bruh\" \nand yet Riot says people arent allowed to give up? \nUsing \"its just Norms/game/Aram\" is a COVER you use to comfort yourself when you have given up. \nSo thanks for the downvote.

Experimentation is all well and good and I have no problems with that at all.\n\nBut If I actually want to try and WIN matches in ranked, I am shunned and dismissed as a \"tryhard\" like wanting to actually win matches is something I should be ashamed of. They will run up and down and completely ignore towers but use \"its just norms/its just >insert game mode&lt;\" as a dismissal. \nThey tell me \"If you want to go tryhard/want to win. Go play ranked\"\n\nSo I do. I go to ranked and what do I get? \nMore of the same. People dont care about actually WINNING matches, they want to treat it like another form of normal draft. \nAgain I am shunned and labeled a \"tryhard\" because they want to play \"4fun\" and ignore objectives IN RANKED. And they will replace \"its just norms\" with \"its just a game, chill. Dont be so tryhard\"\nI have actually been told by players that \"If you want to win matches you should go play another game\"...again..these are IN RANKED MATCHES I am being told that I should be ashamed of being \"tryhard\" in ranked. \n\n30+ minute games, 30+ kills farmed. \nNo enemy towers taken (outer towers still stand)\nNo dragons\nNo herald\nNo baron\n\nBut I need to shut up and stop \"crying\" because I actually want to push objectives and try and win while my team is more interested in talking about how hard they are \"carrying this trash team\" with 20 kills and No objectives.\n\nThen when they lose, they blame the \"feeders\" (aka anyone with less kills than them) for thier loss. But If I suggest they lost because they completely ignored the towers, I am labeled as \"toxic\" and reported. \n\nSo yeah, There is no respect for ranked, and at this point I pretty much laugh anytime someone tries to use the \"its a team game\" excuse. That is only used when it is convenient for their side. the \"its a team game so shut up and do what I tell you to\" argument.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Freaktory","date":"2020-01-11T14:31:51.136+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you ever heard the saying \"Its the squeaky wheel that gets the grease\"\nIf you want something changed or improved, you have to bring ATTENTION TO IT.\nI have a problem with people who will go into Norms, and use \"its just norms\" as a free pass to fuck around and casually go after kills. They will never ONCE even try to take towers, try to take objectives, because they think as long as they have \"more kills than u\" then thats all that matters.\n\nThen they take that SAME attitude into ranked, And replace the phrase with \"its just a game\" to again give themselves a free pass. They dont have to try and win, they dont have to bother with objectives, they dont have to try and take the nexus, because \"ITS JUST A GAME\"\nAnd then They end up throwing match after match, players lose LP and get demoted because these people just want to treat ranked no different than Coop vs AI. \n\nAnd then people like you come in and demand that players who came in to play a COMPETITIVE, OBJECTIVE ORIENTED, STRATEGY GAME need to just shut up and \"Quit crying\" and accept that we are having matches ruined.
