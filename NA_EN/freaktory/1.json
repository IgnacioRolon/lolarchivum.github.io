It's STRONGLY discouraged BY THE GAME, NOT JUST \"COMMON COURTESY\" as you put it due to the nature of support items before quest completion, and that you're wasting gold for your team because it disables the gold passive on them. It's just wasting resources.\n\nThere is however a rule \"try your best to support the team and give them the best chance at winning\" and regarding that rule, 99% of the time the support role is best off leaving the CS to the ADC and that's why people consider it griefing and report for it.\n\nI've had games where it's something like brand/draven botlane, and our draven dies to ganks until 0/4 low CS and brand lives every time soaking up more exp, having to kill minions at tower so he's okay on CS, and just generally less behind. Then they take farm and it helps us win the game because draven is so far behind it's less useful on him. This is NOT what you described. It's dependent on the champion you're playing.\n\nMost typical support champs are champs that are strong without gold, and are always stronger without gold than an ADC without gold. If you're playing Thresh, you don't make that judgement call and start taking CS because items aren't nearly as impactful on you than on your ADC. A Brand can **on rare occasions** make better use of the gold, like in that example.\n\nOne problem with this post is that you're implying that EVERY game your ADC will complain about any accidental CS taken. That's dishonest. People praise good supports all the time, when they make good plays. Just like any other role. Just like people shit on any other role when they're doing poorly. The game's always been like that, the community sucks that's no surprise.\n\nAnother problem is you acting like you could never be wrong and shouldn't have taken that CS. For *truly* the best chance to win, you're probably often wrong about \"the CS is better on me\" or anything relating to it.\n\nNo offense but it just screams salt, there are valid reasons people call it griefing and I won't lie plenty of people do it when it's not valid. People complain about support taking kills all the time, when it's only considered valid when there's 100% no chance they escape, and the gold is far better on the ADC than you. I rarely see ADCs complain about a high damage support getting kill gold. \n\nPlenty of people are toxic as hell in this game for no reason, but you sound like you're the one on the high horse here just because you got some bad ADCs recently.

The only REASOn this has become an issue is because adcs have become so entitled and full of themselves they ALREADY see thier support as an obstacle. If you spend the entire game telling your support how \"Trash\" they are for missing an ability or falling to cc to make yourself feel better, dont expect them to extend the common courtesy of uncontested farm. \n\n\n> D) Wasting resources; even if it is just autoattacks that could have been directed elsewhere.\n\nI am not wasting resources I am ensuring that I can at least hold my own with the REST of the team when my adc does (it happens like clockwork) finds something to throw a frigging tantrum over) and ends up pulling the \"Im done, gg, Im afk\" bullshit. \nI am focused on making sure That I can at least help pick up the slack and can hold my own Without having to babysit an adc who thinks themselves so high and mighty that the whole team is only there to powder thier ass and tell them what a wonderful person they are. \n\n> And let's not talk around the bush here, if you are doing these things intentionally or willingly? You are griefing. If you prefer that term over \"cs stealing\" I'm fine with using that word.\n\nWillingly or intentionally? You mean building MYSELF up to support the REST of the team for when the adc intentionally has a screaming shitfit in bot lane and eventually pouts in spawn begging for reports on the support for \"stealing cs\" \nYeah sorry as much as you think it is, thats not greifing. I am trying to win, I dont have time to waste on an adc who is more interested in fighting to keep the spotlight and attention on THEM ALONE rather than trying to win the match. \n\nThats not greifing, thats called readjusting my priority. Back in season 3-4 it was about keeping my team alive, and yeah, even as a support main now. My priority as a support is to keep the team alive. But now, my priotity is adjusted in order of:\n1: Build myself up in strength and ability \n2:Take towers and objectives to help give the rest of the team more breathing room to work in\n3: Help keep THE TEAM (notice i said team, NOT \"keep adc\") alive and help where i can\n4: see if the adc needs actual help and not just looking for someone to chase kills with them...assuming they arent pouting over the match not being \"all about ME\"\n\nSo yeah, keep trying to call it greifing, its not.
