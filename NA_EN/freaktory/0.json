Just walk away\" logic is still something you would do.\r\n\r\nIf a relative of yours or a close friend is addicted to drugs and is destroying themselves, sacrificing everything for the drug. Then Its not worth your time to announce your dissatisfaction with thier current state. Just leave them alone and let them destroy themselves right? Let them drug themselves to the grave because if you were to bring up that you dont like what they have become, it is dismissed as \"whining\" or \"bitching/complaining\". Why should you try and tell them that you arent happy with what they have become. Why should you waste YOUR precious time to get your friend or relative off thier drug addiction. Stop whining about how they are destroying themselves because being around them is no longer enjoyable and just walk away. They will destroy themselves, they will no longer be around, and you wont have to worry. \r\n\r\nYeah, dont waste your time trying to fix a drug-addicted friend/family member, someone you spend alot of time with. Just let them destroy themselves and go off to do something more enjoyable. This is exactly how those of us who have played league sinse the beginning see its current state. But when we try and bring up issues with the game, with the community, we are dismissed as \"whining\" or \"bitching\" and told to \"just leave\". And yeah...Many of us are. \r\nTime to find matches are going up, problems being dismissed as \"u just salty\", and people are just dismissed over kda, what they build, who they play..anything other than admit there is a problem. \r\n\r\nYeah people have grown up with this game and see its self-destructive path. Why should they waste thier time trying to FIX the problems infesting the game. Just go find another game and let the game destroy itself. Let it fall into its death spiral as More people leave, the time between matches gets longer and longer. None of the problems are solved, so more people leave...the game looks worse and worse. \r\n\r\nBut hey, why should people who enjoyed the game as it once was try to get it back to its former glory. Just stop complaining right? if you dont like the game? Dont play it! Just ignore it as it destroys itself. I have already uninstalled league and I am just here to see who else I can convince to drop the game. \r\n..That and roast marshmallows as I watch a game I loved and promoted to all my friends (but now wouldnt wish on my worst enemy) burn to the ground because Rather than fix genuine problems, they decided it was more important to turn the game into a self-contained nanny state. Any problems with the game are dismissed because they might give someone unhappy feelings, or make them say not nice words. \r\n\r\nNice logic. People who grew up with league and dont like what it has become, those who can see it pretty much destroying itself.. They should just shut up and stop \"complaining\" about obvious serious flaws in the game driving players away and contributing to a death spiral. \r\nCuz fixing something they grew up with that is being ruined is \"not worth your time\"\r\n\r\nRiP League. Hope you can afford the flashy funeral when your game overdoses and ends up being Toe-tagged. \r\nI am a season 3 player, I already uninstalled, I moved onto SMITE and other games. \r\nI am just here to watch the game burn. I do not foresee a chance of recovery.","replies":[{"poster":"Julevi","date":"2019-07-03T08:11:18.129+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"First of all: I read your whole post but chose to not make a statement about the \"drug-addicted family member\" as I personally find the comparison more than tasteless.\n\nRiot Games is a company which major interest is profiting of you as a player. You either \"pay\" with your time or actually invest money in the game. Encountering a problem normally leads to some questions:\n\n* What's the problem?\n*  Are you able to fix it yourself? \n\n* Is it something Riot can fix easily? If yes, how?\n* Are you part of the problem?\n* Does Riot choose to ignore the actual issue?\n\n\nSorry to say that: you, as a player alone, have not much power to change anything. But as a community the whole thing changes. When you dislike something in-game there are various options how you could handle the situation, for that let me give you an **imaginary** example first (not my actual opinion).\n\nStatement: the pass is way too expensive (=problem). I am not able to fix it myself and I am not involved as a leading part of the problem. Riot could fix it easily, when they adjust the price as soon as possible. They try ignoring the up-coming complains and focus on making more and more money.\n\nSo, we encountered an actual issue. We, as a community, could try **raising awareness **and **putting pressure** on them so they feel forced to make a change, usually this happens due to **boycotting ** as you refuse to pay them a single buck for this pass (the financial aspect). Or we **boycott the game as a whole** (playtime aspect). Drastically changing shapes and figures need attention of their side and force them to actual do something. \n\nThat was one example where \"Don't like it? Leave\" could actually work.\n\nSome people here on the boards complain about ideas/believes they personally dislike but a majority of the community does support (partially). I won't go to a catholic private school and then moan about attending religious actions so I shouldn't play this game and then be pissed about their applied rules.\n\n[Example] You think calling your teammates \"%%%\" is okay because your teammates \"provoked\" it as they called you noob and idiot once? Now you had to face the consequences (ban) and I see already the upcoming anger in your eyes. You try blaming Riot for it but it was your decision alone to call them like that. \"%%%%%% is a normal word, I use it all the name. You are all pussies\" is the justifciation of yours but we a lot of us disagree with you. Throwing your fist and demanding a change in this field just because you couldn't stick to the rules. You are part of the problem and don't see it at all.\n\nYou are not able to follow those simple rules and would do it over and over again? \"Don't like it? Leave\" - there are games out there who fit your needs and language. League of Legends does not revolve around you.\n\nComplaining is okay and questioning the companies decisions is even better - but I rarely see any useful suggestions how they could/should fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2019-07-03T08:18:54.667+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"well said bud, gj\n\nespecially this\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Julevi,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pvvfK9Ap,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-07-03T08:11:18.129+0000)\n>\n> First of all: I read your whole post but chose to not make a statement about the \"drug-addicted family member\" as I personally find the comparison more than tasteless.\n> \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"FederationFurry","date":"2019-07-04T14:39:29.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Well if Riot weren't so greedy, selfish and sexist... we might have a shot at being listened to but people like you who act like shills are the reason why this company will never change and why League has fallen from grace.","replies":[{"poster":"Julevi","date":"2019-07-04T19:20:46.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excuse me but what?\nPeople like me (like shills?

But what do you do when they do not accept it or do not want it?  Your example only factors in that they will take the help. Your not even considering all the factors that could go into the  process of what you to help them and what do you do when you try every thing and does not work. \n\nAnd yes they are going to balance the game around the e-sports.... that's what brings in quite a bit of  money so that is  what they will focus on. Do you have to like it no. DO you have the right to complain about it sure. Does Riot have to care or listen to you complain about what they do with  their game? No they don't  it's theirs  to do what htey want about.  At the end of the day   its like you said you hate hearing if you do not like it leave.   As for smite  I ave the god  pack to... Id still rather play  league. One I hate the ping system they have.  And 2 I like Leagues ARAM mode better which is my favorite mode to play.

Idk why youre giving so much thought to those who just say cliché lines like \"mad cuz bad\". Obviously they arent providing anything useful. So why focus on them? Why act like only those posts exist? If you really think only those types of people exist here, then I cant do anything other than disagree with you. They do exist, because this is the internet, but thats not everyone. There are many good discussions to be had and that have been had. \n\nIve even had my own opinions change over the years as a result of these discussions. I used to think Riot's rules were like big brother shoving morality down our throats. Then through a series of observations, thoughtful conversations and disagreements, I came to a better understanding of their rules and their purpose. Its very possible to have good discussions if you're willing to listen and respond. Some discussions only reinforced my beliefs and I dug my toes in the sand and refused to budge. \n\nTheres all kinds of discussions here. Ones that go nowhere and consist of two sides being passive aggressive and using ad hominems, to ones that result in finding common ground and both sides come out of it with a better understanding, sometimes even changing one person's mind. It is hard to come by, I will admit that. But that doesnt mean its every one. \n\nIn the end, you do you, I guess. I dont care about the future of this game, as i was 27 before I even discovered it. It has no nostalgic value to me, its just another video game. So it doesnt bother me if league dies, or if it thrives and grows even larger. I only come here for the discussions when I'm bored at work, and I've been doing it for years. Its not all \"just quit then!\". But its not all meaningful good discussion either.

Proly not so long if you think that it is great game lol\n\nYeah, considering I have the founder's Pack on smite, and have enjoyed it sinse the first oddysey. It has its flaws but at least its community isnt actively working to destroy it and the developers actually LISTEN to the player base instead of \"heres a problem, Lets throw a shiny skin at people to distract them\"\n> \n> You are also showing blind hate with \"I actively DISCOURAGE people from joining\" which is complety opposite of \"If you dont like the current state of the game, Just Leave!\", but you are still one of them, just on the opposite side of spectrum, don't tell others what to do, that's it.\n\nNah, as I said, when I started out, I frequently went on an on about how great the game was, how there was a sense of strategy and challenge. People actually tried to go after the towers, not sit around chasing kills untill one side got bored enough and surrendered or the enemy team finally took out our nexus. Why the hell should I advocate or encourage people to join a game where the community will act like you just did and call it \"blind hate\" for \"wrong-think\" \nand again, you make my point for me. Rather than address the problems in the community, rather than try and fix what is dragging the game down to try and FIX IT, your suggestion is \"you dont like it? leave!\" \nSo If your family falls into a drug or gambling addiction, you gonna turn around and just leave them? I mean if you dont like it. Why bother speaking up and shining a light on problems when you can just turn a blind eye and walk away. After all, its not YOUR problem at that point. \n\n\n> You sound so butthurt in comments that it's actually sad, you hate LoL, but it looks like you hate community more than the game, which is stupid, community was always like this, hell, I wish you to spend one day back in Warcraft modes/WoW arenas, slurs and death threats \n>  and many 4fun players were bread and butter for us back then, you know nothing, let's give some constructive critism. We can have discussion if you want to. \n\nUh huh, More dismissals \"ur just buthurt, ur just mad cuz bad\" \nand yeah, I will say it. I DO hate what this community has become. Self entitled, narcissistive, over-sensitive snowflakes who think they are all \"Faker in disguise\" and think all that matters in the game is how \"better than you\n\n> From one of your comments\n>> Sadly lost many accounts because suggesting to my team \"stop chasing kills and attack the towers\" is considered \"toxic\" so I end up getting banned\n> Total massive bullcrap, you know it, you were saying stupid shit that brought nothing valuable to the game, you are part of what you hate xD\n\nBrought nothing to the game? How does sitting around chasing kills for 45 minutes while ignoring towers, Ignoring dragons, ignoring the rest of your team Help ANYTHING. \nThis community is so obsessed with who's kda is bigger in thier pissing contest that the outer towers can stand Untouched the entire span of a match, then when the enemy actually pushes towers and steamrolls, the team will just immediately fall over, or decide its more important to chase a solo kill in top lane while the enemy team plows through and takes the nexus. But me suggesting to actually take towers, to take dragons and I get told \"Stfu, u dont know how to play the game\" or \"ur just mad cuz bad\"\n\n> \n> Let's go through rest of one of your comment\n>> Sinse riot pushed the \"solo carry\" ideal\n> Are you sure? Feel free to watch any vods of challangers, occasionally even them aren't able to solo carry, solo carry concept died in early seasons, you live in your delusions, but you won't ever 1v9 in your main elo.\n\nRiot DOES push a Solo carry Ideal, they go into a team based game and then tell each player they are a \"solo carry\" and put a target on the rest of thier team's back. Players are then more concerned with how \"solo carry\" they look so they will intentionally screw over the rest of the team so they can go \"18/2\" kda and claim they are \"carrying this trash team\"\nMeanwhile they WILL NOT touch Towers, They WILL NOT touch dragons, They WILL NOT bother with objectives. And often they will intentionally sit on the side and WAIT for the rest of thier team to die so they can jump in and secure one or two last hits and go back to patting themselves on the back. This is NOT a solo carry game, yet people are too busy trying to prove how \"too good for this team\" they are to bother helping thier team. If you think trying to 1v9 gets you ass-pats and kudos, you are on the wrong game. Thats like playing chess but thinking all you need is a pawn to win the entire match, no other pieces are required.\nI have had games where my teammate could sit right next to me and watch me get ambushed, wont lift a finger to help. Yet when I ask them why they stood there and watched, they respond with \"I might have died\". NOT \"I Would have died\" Not \"I was for sure gonna die\" (at full health), But \"I -Might- have died\" Meaning possibility, not a guarantee. \nYet as soon as teams die, these same people will instantly jump in, secure one or two last hits, then turn around and brag about how they are \"carrying the trash team\" and \"report my team for inting\" \n\n>> Riot has created an atmosphere where the game is NO LONGER about \"Work together with your teammates to take down towers and fight through the enemy to destroy thier nexus\"\n> Blatant lie, nothing changed, players in iron-dia do this and always did.\n\nYeah, Nothings changed hmm? Maybe because when people try and bring UP problems, you pull this attitude and tell them \"Shut up and stop complaining, no one cares. Ur just salty\"\nAnd thats why people are getting fed up and leaving, Thats why the wait times for matches will get longer. Thats why I will continue to steer people away from this game. Because If a problem presents itself, people arent allowed to actually call attention to it without people like you telling them \"stfu ur delusional, league is great, its awesome! I dont see ANY problems\"\nWhats the saying? \"The Squeaky Wheel gets the grease\"? By your logic the squeaky wheel is just jealous because it isnt as quiet and smooth rolling as the other 3 tires. \n\n> And this goes on and on and on in every single of your comments.

I feel like you peaked gold-plat and that's it, game/players started to go against you, right?\n\nGee its almost like The game has a problem and those who can SEE the problem are trying to call attention to it, yet people like you come in and call them crazy and delusional. Yeah, I havent played in a month, I am just trying to see how many people I can pull out of a burning house before riot decides maybe its time to pull out the fire extinguishers, But then people like you come along and tell them \"no, the house isnt burning, you are just jealous of all the flames\" \nAnd Nah, I never once claimed to be \"gold-plat\" But please, keep trying to drag up ad-hominum attacks about me, all so you can go back to plugging your ears. \n> \n> I remember comment, where you were shit talking some Vayne bcs she wanted to have fun in normal game, who cares about winning in normals? You shown us two senteces of her talking, I wonder what you said.\n\nYeah because regardless Of If its normals or Ranked, The GOAL OF THE GAME is to: Fight through the enemy team and destroy thier towers to take down the enemy nexus.\nIt may be more casual but the goal is still to DESTROY THE NEXUS. \nGoing back to the chess analogy, How would you feel if you sat down to play a competitive game of chess, and someone sat down next to you and started playing \"dollhouse\" with the chess pieces, Telling you that \"if you want to win matches, you should go play another game\"\nYeah it would probably piss you off too if you came to play chess and they saw the chess board as a dollhouse. \n\nBut keep trying to tell me how \"delusional\" I am for being able to see the real problems chasing people away. \nGame is already going downhill, No, its not in its \"best place its ever been\" \nMaybe pull your fingers out of your ears and you will be able to hear it. \nSo who is the real delusional one, the many calling attention to the burning house that is league of legends, or the one telling those people the flames dont exist and the house is in perfect condition. \n\nEnjoy your death spiral game. More people leave, longer match wait times, lower game value, more people leave, Longer wait time....etc etc.\n\n> \n> Any way, good luck with Smite, longer you play it more you hate it :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"R107 Games","date":"2019-07-03T05:30:13.839+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"> \"If you dont like the current state of the game, Just Leave!\"\n\n^ this is just an argument people use when they don't like someone voicing their dissatisfaction/disapproval of any aspect of League, because they disagree with it.\n\nThey know damn well any sensible person will quit a game they don't enjoy playing, so this argument only serves to dismiss/invalidate someone's opinion","replies":[{"poster":"Freaktory","date":"2019-07-03T06:06:20.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"as I said, I have played sinse season 3, when I first started I would go ooon and on about how great the game was, how it needed strategy and teamwork.

Then you just complain that \"they\" do this and that, without even acknowledging that not everyone does that. People who do that arent everyone. Youre dwelling on the unhelpful posts andgeneralizing it as everyone doing it. Thats a bad way to go through life. You should pay less mind to those with no advice or constructive criticism to offer. Stop dwelling on them, its useless. \n\nIve read many good discussions on issues with the game. One thing they usually dont contain is sarcasm and mockery, which is the tone of your entire post. Thats not how to have a good disscussion. Its like those youtube comments where someone is dropping \"truth bombs\" but they open with \"alright listen you r%%%%%s\" and it goes nowhere because you started by condescending to the people youre trying to have a discussion with.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
