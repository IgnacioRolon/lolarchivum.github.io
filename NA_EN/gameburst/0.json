I'm going  to keep this quick but I think its absolutely ridiculous that if I dodge twice it is automatically becomes a 30 minute dodge the last time I might have dodge was 2 weeks ago and the first time I have to dodge its instantly 5 minutes which also makes no sense. I really don't care its only 5 minutes  but when I get into my next champ select and my client lags and I can't ban anything so it dodges me and gives me 30 minutes I find it so stupid explain to make how 5 minutes to half and hour makes any sense. Frankly, I think whoever did that is an idiot what casual player is going to see a 30 minute dodge queue timer and still want to play after that, they would probably just close LoL and go player another game if they were really in the mood to play something. Also, the LP loss is so much 3lp is fine but from 3 to 10 ten for most players is like half a win if your losing half a win for leaving champ select I don't even know what to say. This post probably wont make it anywhere but if you could just up vote this for the chance it might that would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-10T22:02:17.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you do eventually get a low priority queue, it's taking your recent afk's into account. When you play through the first 5 min timer and then get hit with another LPQ shortly after, it bumps the penalty up little by little. It sucks that you've ended up with a 30 min timer, but you'll need to wait through the penalty before you can get into matches normally again.","replies":[{"poster":"GameBurst","date":"2017-06-12T01:16:47.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I havent afk'd any recent games though and still went from 5 to 30 instantly thats not bumping little by little thats like a nudge into a shove.","replies":[]}]}]}
