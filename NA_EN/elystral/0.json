But leveling a smurf to have a second account is not a problem and is common.\n\nCommon reasons:\n\n1. Play with new friend.\n2. Multiple ranked accounts.\n3. High normal mmr on main. Have lower mmr account to play with lower mmr friends. (for diamond + players not me). \n4. Main accounts get banned.

But that doesn't mean that if you CS'd better you could have won the game, nor does it mean it's your fault that 3 of your teammates AFK'd. There are totally outlier games that you can play perfectly and still lose. It's a team game, after all. But if you play an infinite amount of games you'll absolutely hit your deserved rank. \n\nThat's what ELO hell is though.

Congrats, you will now be instantly gold if you stick to Nasus, simple as that.\n\nFrom there you can branch out into whatever you want to play.

They do things such as ward and have map awareness, often knowing where each member of the enemy team is/could be even if there's no vision on them. They know not to overextend and know to poke/harass, and when to make trades. \n\nADCs focus on the micro, since they're so gold reliant. Mid laners focus on the roaming and top laners focus on 1v1s. To be honest, people should play every role. They'd be like the perfect league player if they were decent at every role. \n\nI agree that it's hard to climb as a support. You'd have to play something like Brand or Velkoz. But to say 9/10 supports are bad is just silly. It's more like 9/10 players are bad, not just supports.

You simply won't understand where the pressure is on the minion wave, where to stand at what point, how to deny the enemy cs, how to help your adc get cs.\n\nI can climb on any support all day if I want to, it's dumb to do in Silver IMO.

Glad I didn't just downvote you and go \"lul troll.\" Yeah, I've played ADC a few times (I'm a support main) and noticed it's actually pretty hard to CS and poke. Like at first I'd always complain about my ADC never auto attacking the damn enemies to get fed after I chunk them for 80% of their HP or stun them. But it actually is hard at first. You can't do it and expect your ADC to follow up when they're not in range, otherwise you'll be caught out.\n\nI still wouldn't say 90% of supports are bad at the game, but I totally agree playing ADC makes you a better support. I'd even argue the reverse is true, because I do still see ADCs that are blind and only farm minions when there's easy kills that are being spoonfed to them. Like farm is good and all but if you're only gonna farm and that's it, there's not much of a reason to have a support. That's when I roam to mid and secure kills there. \n\nI think Janna has a high winrate because she keeps champions like Zac off of the ADC completely. I don't think it's her E really, but rather how she hard counters divers. A lot of people in this elo spam Zac or Xin. There's also Rengar and Khazix and the likes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ThePartyLeader","date":"2016-12-01T18:39:47.805+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NightyNightt,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=l8RXLa9c,comment-id=00090000,timestamp=2016-12-01T16:36:05.780+0000)\n>\n> Why would you make a smurf for ranked if you are in bronze in your main account? wtf?\n\nSame reason people who get bullied bully other people.
