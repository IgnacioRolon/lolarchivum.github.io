So I had to win two more in a row...an then it placed me in B2....so I had to win my series twice? why? I should be 40 LP into B2 but now im just at B2 0LP, its not the LP that is irritating, is the fact that I WON my series, and didnt get advanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-05T00:47:43.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had to be a fair bit of research into your League history, but I was able to figure out what happened here. When you first started that miniseries, it looks like you lost the first match and then had some type of queue dodge after that. Since queue dodges count as a loss, that was your second loss pushing you out of the miniseries. \n\nAfter that, you played 2 matches which put you back at 100 LP which started the next miniseries attempt.","replies":[{"poster":"GhostLockdown","date":"2017-08-06T02:32:01.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its funny the queue dodge thing didn't show on my end it was a \"attempt to reconnect / choose\" I think it said \"there was an error choosing your champion.....reconnect?\" and it spit me out into my series w/o a loss, thats so weird, and annoying.","replies":[]}]}]}
