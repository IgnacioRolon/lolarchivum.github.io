I recently received my 1st ever in game punishment after playing for 4 years because I used a racial slur to tease my friend. We were in a call and had been playfully tolling/flaming each other all night and I called him a n***** (don&#039;t want to get in trouble here because people are oversensitive). Despite this not being an insult directed at anyone, not being demeaning to anyone, and not being taken offense to by the person it was directed at it, I still received a suspension for 14 days. After filing a support ticket to complain that in the context in which the offensive term was used wasn&#039;t actually toxic in anyway I received an email the next day claiming that &quot;**Regardless of the context, and your intention behind saying it, it is never ok to use hate speech in League chat. Just because there is a language filter in chat, does not mean that it is ok to use racial slurs**.&quot; \n\nSo a few things to dissect here:  \n1. It was not hate speech as the definition of hate speech is &quot;**Hate speech is speech that attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity**&quot; which I did not do, simply used an expletive to tease a friend.\n2. Then what is the point of the chat filter if not to allow people to not see words that they are uncomfortable with?\n3. I have checked all official rules for League of Legends and have found no official document or page explicitly forbidding the use of racial slurs so claiming that they aren&#039;t allowed despite no clear indication of that anywhere in the game or website is unreasonable.\n4. My biggest issue being, why, if you have the ability to filter words, would you allow words with a Zero Tolerance Policy to be sent/received at all?\n\nInitially, I was upset about such a severe first punishment for what I perceived, for all my understanding of them, to not be against the rules. Now upon further examination of the situation I realize something that I am much more upset over: the lack of a clear explanation as what Riot defines as &quot;toxic&quot; and &quot;racist&quot; and the lack of a personalized filter, something that everyone could have and customize to automatically filter words/messages containing words that they are uncomfortable with. \n\nOverall this experience has revealed to me that the definitions put forth by Riot are so unclear and up for interpretation that being offended/not liking what someone says is, in Riots opinion, grounds for a report.\n\nThe terms of use that state:\n> v. Transmitting or communicating any content which, in the sole and exclusive discretion of Riot Games, is deemed offensive, including language that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, or racially, ethically, or otherwise objectionable;\n\nHave been posted here and I would like to refute them in the OP so that the nature of this complaint is better understood. All swear words fall under this definition. The are all vulgar, obscene, and defamatory. And as I have said the reason my appeal was disregarded was not because it was deemed to be flaming but because it was deemed to be racist. It is the literal definition of a double standard to have two items that meet the exact same definition but one is excusable and the other is not.\n\n**Also to anyone who wants to claim the word is harmful to black people _I'M BLACK_**","replies":[{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-09-03T04:03:22.195+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 3.

Other words that are \"or racially, ethically, or otherwise objectionable;\" are perfectly fine given context aka not a Zero Tolerance Policy as racial slurs seem to be. By this definition swearing as a whole should be Zero Tolerance instaban but isn't. Its just a horrifically worded vagueness that basically means if someone is offended then they can report you but as long as it isn't in the group of nebulously defined words that can't be excused no matter context you can give it context and have it passed. For instance if I had called my friend a bitch of a %%%% or any other vulgar, obscene, **or otherwise objectionable** word this situation is non existent. It's the double standard for what falls under this definition that I have a problem with.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2018-09-03T04:38:19.409+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CÃ­rdan,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=hAw5MoMM,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-09-03T03:59:26.353+0000)\n>\n>\n> 4: My biggest issue being, why, if you have the ability to filter words, would you allow words with a Zero Tolerance Policy to be sent/received at all?\n> \n\n10 If you remove the ability to send hate speech in the chat box, then people who want to send hate speech will just use a spelling variant that isn't filtered.\n\n20 Then, Riot filters that specific variant.\n\n30 The people who want to send hate speech will just use a spelling variant that isn't filtered.\n\n40 GOTO 20\n\n50 Eventually, the overzealous chat filter is blocking essentially everything","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2018-09-03T23:35:13.785+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyyyyy, that's an infinite loop!!!
