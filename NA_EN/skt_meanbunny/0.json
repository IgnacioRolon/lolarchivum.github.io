I am not going to waste time with the \"I was unfairly banned\" yada, yada ya. What I am going to say is that I am truly baffled at what it was specifically I said that caused me to get 14 day banned. Because I did not say anything racist, sexist, or personally offensive remarks. I have heard before in another post that when you have been recently chat restricted, sometimes just typing too much in a game can get you banned even if you are not overwhelmingly negative.\n\nPretty much, I am fine with accepting the consequences of negative attitude and behavior, but what I am not fine with is not knowing the exact reason why I am being punished.\n\nMy point is basically that if \"negative attitude\" or \"communication that does not help the team to succeed\" is enough reason to 14 day ban someone, then I feel they need to be a lot more specific about what is allowed and what is not allowed in a normal game of league of legends.\n\nSo I am going to post the chat log now for the game in question and I am going to preface and say even though it doesn't matter why anything was said at all by me to these players, I still want you guys to have context for the exchange.\n\n I was abandoned in lane at around 5 minutes, called useless and berated in chat after a level 2 Kayn and my Yuumi tried to 2v3 in bot river while I was being shoved in hard because I was alone in lane 1v2, they got destroyed and even though I was in no position at all to help, I got flamed hard. I was in a particular large amount of pain that day, so I reached my breaking point and when he told me I was useless I said \"You are preform Kayn, your champion is literally useless\" because he had just called me as a player useless. Notice I said his champion and not him his self.\n\n**CHAT LOG:**\n\nKeep in mind, the part where I say preform Kayn is useless, he had just told me I was useless as a PLAYER. I simply talked about his champion, not him as a player. I do not truly feel that way, it was just a heated response because of what he just said to me. I then later said I didn't want to play anymore because I was not having fun, it was a normal draft game, and I couldn't perform anymore because of the disgust I had for my team mates.\n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nTSM Meanbunny: why did you leave me\nTSM Meanbunny: kayn was running it down\nTSM Meanbunny: dont run it down with him\nTSM Meanbunny: yes I do no dmg its early game before first back\nTSM Meanbunny: fighting is pointless\nTSM Meanbunny: and youre kayn pre form\nTSM Meanbunny: this isnt lvl 1?\nTSM Meanbunny: jkust get inside me\nTSM Meanbunny: what are you doing\nTSM Meanbunny: go heal urself\nTSM Meanbunny: pls\nTSM Meanbunny: dont die\nTSM Meanbunny: I flought\nTSM Meanbunny: you are pre form kayn\nTSM Meanbunny: your champ is useless\nTSM Meanbunny: literally\nTSM Meanbunny: cus they focused you\nTSM Meanbunny: not my fault\nTSM Meanbunny: pls since you so unhappy with my lane so somewhere else\nTSM Meanbunny: dont need you down here\nTSM Meanbunny: ff 15\nTSM Meanbunny: dont want to play with you\nTSM Meanbunny: ur both muted and reported\nTSM Meanbunny: so..\nTSM Meanbunny: not only do you not heal me\nTSM Meanbunny: you unattach mid dive\nTSM Meanbunny: and then decide to ult\nTSM Meanbunny: lmfao\nTSM Meanbunny: dont ever, ever mention something about another players skill again\nTSM Meanbunny: report kayn and yuumi pls ty\nTSM Meanbunny: inting and toxic in chat\nTSM Meanbunny: exactly\nTSM Meanbunny: on hit in bot?\nTSM Meanbunny: whatever that means bud, I have been 1v2 the entire game, cant play this way\n\n\n\nFor those who care to read further:\n\nI don't mean to make this post personal, because my physical health should have no bearing on this topic, but I have cancer and I live in a great deal of pain on a daily basis. League of Legends is one of the only escapes that I have in my life where I can go into a game and not think about the day I am going to die and how it is going to happen. Literally, even when I'm in que or loading a match, I am anxious and depressed, but the minute that game clock starts ticking, I get to temporarily forget about the pain. I love this game and it means the world to me, but every human being has a breaking point.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I know facts such as \"Who started it?\" or \"Why?\" does not matter when it comes to negative communication in chat, but I feel that sometimes the instant feedback system doesn't feel like the best way. I am sure that for 95% of the cases its great, but for those remaining, I feel like there should be some other course of action to determine whether or not a punishment was appropriate.  I am sure some of you solo players out there have experienced a time where you were paired with a 4 man and just happened to have a poor performance. Somehow, even if you didn't attack anyone, they get their friends and even sometimes people on the enemy team that have no idea what the issue is to report you as well, which ends up with multiple reports and your account getting punished.\n\nWhat I also find confusing is that I have played this game for about 3 years and have never been chat restricted, now all of a sudden I am getting chat restrictions and now a 14 day ban?\n\nAlso one thing that I have found as a pattern in the games where I have been chat restricted, in a majority of them I have had a Yuumi as support. Half the Yuumi's I have had play with me so far have not only abandoned me in lane to go roam less than 5 minutes or so in, but after I die to a 3 man dive bot because I am being constantly shoved in because I am alone 1v2 in lane, I get flamed by my premade team mates. So not only was I griefed in lane, but I was harrased by my team mates, which I also muted after things became slightly heated. Something I have never done before.\n\nSo honestly, my comms have improved over what they were before! The first game I choose to not engage in an all out flame war and mute players, I get 14 day banned.\n\nBottom line, I just want the community's feedback on if you all think that this punishment was appropriate, and even more so if you do think I was punished properly, what was the sentence I typed that got me banned, because I am truly baffled at which it was. Either Kayn as a champion preform is useless or saying I didn't want to play with them anymore and to ff after being harassed for 20 mins by my own team. So could I have muted them? Yes, but like I said, even if I was not right for engaging, I feel like there should be at least a decent reason to give out a 14 day ban.

The rules say \"do not violate the rules at all\". You did not heed **two** prior warnings to fix your behavior. Thus you were given a stronger punishment.\n\nKeep in mind that if you continue to misbehave, the next punishment will be a permanent suspension of your account.","replies":[{"poster":"SKT Meanbunny","date":"2019-06-04T03:55:04.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"I said that as far as the punishment goes it does not matter, I still have context because I feel in the player's eyes (the people who's opinions I asked for here on this forum) who have no bearing on my punishment, it would be nice for them to know why I said the things I said.\n\nAlso you have zero context for any of the replies you gave me according to the chat logs.

To me, that is a broken system.\n\nA lot of things have to be taken into account about punishments. \n\n* Did someone report them for it? \nPunishments are mostly handed out after reports or a support-ticket - so when everyone was okay with the words said (usually) no actions will be taken. \n* Did they say it out loud or actually type it in chat? Many people here are confused that talking badly about others in e.g. a stream on Twitch is the problem of Twitch alone and doesn't need to involve another party. \n* Are they high-elo players? Due to the limited player-pool in the higher elos many players know each other fairly well and don't take things too seriously. But here we go and it leads (more and less) to the first question: did they got a report? \n\n> \n> **PS: The first person who replied agreed with me.

Just do it. No need to make a big dramatic scene about it.\n\nThank you for this response because one of the things I was worried about in the future was being reported randomly with no context in the report other than an inting or negative behavior check mark. I don't want to make a dramatic scene, this is just mostly my frustration with the system, that is all. It is nice to know that I am allowed to /mute all and not get in trouble for it. \n\nI know things like motive and intent are irrelevant in this video game's behavior system, but in the real world, which is governed by the rule of law and not mob mentality, things such as motive and intent can be the difference between the death penalty and living. So I was purely mitigating an unfavorable response from random forum goers rather than have them just assume off the bat that I am just a toxic person.\n\nWhat is so sad to me is that the only things that get highlighted here is negative behavior. I get no recognition for the countless number  of games where I pulled my team out of tilt, out of a flame war and gotten us to work together and win a lost game.\n\nBefore I got my first chat restriction after 3 years of playing the game and NO CHANGE in my behavior or communication with players, I was about to be honor level 4 at the end of the previous split. Honor level 4. Last I checked that requires quite a few honors and games to achieve. I doubt if I was such a \"toxic player\" that I would of ever achieved almost level 4.\n\nSo apparently from my point of view, whatever changes have been made to the instant feedback report system in the past year or so have completely changed the protocol for punishing negative behavior.\n\nI go from practically honor level 4.... to 14 day banned.... all in about the span of 30 days. I know League is a snowbally game, but good grief. It also doesn't help that the client and customer service rep for my 25 game chat restriction basically told me I was in no danger of a ban after looking at my reform card and to just keep improving.\n\n2 days later after being HARD griefed. I get banned.\n\nI must say that this is a learning experience and I now know how precious my account is and that the policies at Riot have apparently changed sometime earlier this year. No one goes from almost honor level 4 to banned in 30 days without something fairly bad happening.\n\nSo in the meantime I am going to try and find out what is and isn't considered a punishable offense. Because as we all know, not everybody can be positive all the time. Anyone can pop off at any given moment and I don't want one of those moments to cost me thousands of dollars and hours played all because some disgruntled person decides they had a bad day and someone is gonna pay for it.\n\nIt's quite a scary thing to be honest and my willingness to use in game chat has been diminished for the future.\n\n**PS: My personal health and reasons for my attitude were included in the \"For those who wish to keep reading\" section. Last I checked, everything needed to give me feedback was included in the TL;DR: and the chat log.**\n\nFor the normal, humane, compassionate, caring human beings out there, I give context because I CARE what people think about me, even if it is the internet. I care about people's feelings. Do I make other people's problems my problems? No, but I have enough humanity about me to care if some random person on the forums thinks I am a toxic person.\n\nKnowing that I am battling cancer and am in a great deal of pain is a LARGE if not almost complete reason why I have a low tolerance for unfriendly players. Because to me personally, providing context goes a long way when it comes to judging a person's character. I know that this is not a character judging website, but I cannot help but include these facts because my image is important to me.\n\nFor any \"non Riot affiliated player\" reading this that hears that I was flamed, attacked personally and griefed in game and am dealing with this disease all at the same time, I feel it would make them second guess labeling me as simply \"a toxic player\".\n\nTo me, that makes everything I said worth it. Which at the end of the day, is all that matters to me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-06-04T04:25:25.413+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you click reply, it notifies people.\n\nHarassment is not always a crime.

I appreciate that believe it or not because the whole reason I typed this essay and a half was because I wanted to learn something and prevent my account being compromised in the future.\n\nI also got plenty of useful information believe it or not from a couple of these posts and now understand the mode of my punishment. I see now that if you get reported for negative behavior too close to a 25 game chat restriction, your account may be in danger even if you didn't say anything particularly egregious.\n\nIf any Rioter is reading this by slim chance, the one piece of feedback I would like to give is to update the part of the FAQ about chat restrictions and how if you \"continue to be toxic in chat you will continually find yourself chat restricted.\" Also I get no warning about the behavioral status of my account such as \"Your account is on the 14 day punishment tier\" rather than let it be nebulous whether or not you get another chat restriction or a ban, because if I thought there was even a CHANCE that I was gonna get banned, I would of muted everyone from the get go.\n\nSo not only did a customer service rep tell me I was in no danger, but the website FAQ is pretty vague about the escalating and de-escalating of punishment tiers.\n\nFor example, I have gotten multiple punishments of the same tier without escalating because I played enough games as an \"honorable player\". It gives you this false sense of security that you can at least be \"not positive\" and only get chat restricted. I think it should be much more clear. Something like a way to see what punishment tier you are on could go a long way to stop toxicity in game because to be honest, if I knew there was even a chance that what I said in that chat could get me banned, I would of never typed a single word.\n\nI feel its a pretty intuitive way to help players like myself out, but I can also see how that can be abused. For example if someone is on a 10 game chat restriction tier, they may feel uninhibited to be as toxic as they please because the worst that can happen is a \"25 game chat restriction\" as long as you don't say anything egregious such as racist, sexist, politically or religiously motivated speech.\n\nI am not sure what the exact answer is and I 100% agree that regardless of context, the rules are the rules and I should of not engaged. So at least that is achieved. The one thing I disagree with is what warrants a 14 day suspension. Not the reason why I was suspended. Because right now, if \"chat that does not contribute to the success of the team\" or \"chat that is not positive\" are grounds for bans, than half of this games population should be banned in no time.\n\nThanks for the feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-04T07:30:37.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TSM Meanbunny,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=lu1xN3er,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-06-04T06:16:06.072+0000)\n>\n> Thank you KFCeytron.\n> \n> Thanks for the feedback.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ROf1Eu0.gifv","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-06-04T11:51:36.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! Glad you've read through some threads and learnt that the behavioral system is an escalating punishment system with 4 tiers;\n\n1. 10 games chat restriction\n2. 25 game chat restriction \n3. 14-day ban\n4. Permaban\n\n---\n\nNot sure if you come by this while browsing through PB boards, but the behavioral system punishes based on consistency x severity.  Meaning a player can be punished for 1  game of extreme toxicity or many many MANY games of mild toxicity. \n\n---\n\nWhile not that obvious, the reform card does indicate what your next punishment is. \n\nBut clarity of the system and certainly one of the factors we've been fighting for, and hopefully we'll get it one day.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lemexis","date":"2019-06-04T10:27:36.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"As unpopular as it seems to be, I'm on the side of \"toxic players should be banned\" because I truly think that toxicity ruins games, and we shouldn't have to use the \"mute\" option so often.\n\nThat said, I frequently see (and report) way worse than your chatlog. To be honest when I first read your post I was expecting a chatlog full of \"you fucking r%%%%%s\", and I think that what you said is super mild and definitely does not deserve a ban. And I also think it's really dumb that when evaluating someone's \"toxicity\" it does not take into account the fact that the player you're \"flaming\" may have said way worse things to you before, but that's just my opinion. \n\nI think you could try to send a support ticket and explain your situation, including the personal details. Once again, I don't understand why this got you ban and I see worse than that all the time - and those worse players don't seem to get banned. And while you're at it, show the chatlogs of the people who were toxic to you, maybe you'll get lucky and they'll get banned. \n\nAnd while I don't recommend it in general because I find it a bit sad, maybe you should just \"mute all\" in your future games. And also mute emotes and signals. If you just want to have fun and chill out, it might be better.\n\n**TL;DR : this is one of the least toxic \"I got banned\" chatlogs I've seen here and I think the ban is unwarranted.
