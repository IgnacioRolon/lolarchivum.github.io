I don't know how this happens, but I've lost a game because of that, as I was about to load into the game, because of its lagginess, i don't even know if that a real word,however somehow it crashed and caused me to lose the game because I'm trying to reconnect like 100 times its just not working so then there is a remake that happened, I'm scared that the 3rd or 4th time I get a 20 min leaver buster and that would make me rage quit this game. I'm sorry for my language  or angriness but I've had this issue for a long while and been waiting on your next solution to this since last year's beta launcher update, I miss the old client I hate this new one. Can you please get me a solution to this I beg you!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-23T18:35:12.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry to hear you've lost a game due to this lag, and I highly recommend sticking to custom games for now until resolve.
