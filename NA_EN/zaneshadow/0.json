Swap E and R.  New E (current R) does a burst of damage but doesn&#039;t gain the damage over time until after Lv6, when his R (current E) is unlocked.  Then mushrooms are effectively acting the same as live functionality, though slightly weaker but ramping up with each rank in R to end slightly stronger, as you must max two abilities to get their full strength.  AoE early damage lets him clear Raptors and Wolves easier, while hopefully remaining power neutral with Teemo farming in the top lane and harrasing his opponent.  Mushrooms hould not be learnable until lv 2 to prevent some very difficult situations for opponents.\n\nComment bellow on what you think or your own ideas?  Worship Satan *cough* I mean Teemo as he is?  Wish he'd be deleted?  Share it with others and check out what others have to say besides me.\n\nMain Article\nI go back and forth if Teemo should ever be touched by Riot.  His memeness is unparalleled and ever part of his kit is iconic in some way.  But one thing I will say that I do think of is that teemo is the Swift Scout.  His mushrooms, his invisibility passive, and even his speed boost sound like ganking or Jungle tools.  I know a few people manage to make him work there, but I&#039;d love to see it be a role he split with his top lane performance.  I&#039;m not even saying this is how it should be done but I&#039;m spitballing ideas.  My goal is to make it so that he doesn&#039;t lose any of his iconic abilities while still not breaking him.  Let me know what you think in the comments.\n\nR and E swap proposal\n\nFor those unfamiliar with teemo (Welcome out from underneath your rock) Teemo&#039;s ult is his mushrooms.  They are iconic to his kit.  Everyone knows that feeling of stepping on a mushroom just after you swore you must have hit the last one.   The feeling of pure rage when you run into three concescutive mushrooms trying to gank top lane.\n\nThe proposal is based on the fact Junglers need AoE to clear certain camps early.  Raptors really need AoE damage to be cleared effectively, and their pretty much the bar for if you can jungle.  \n\nSo the first idea is to make all damage-over-time connected to his R (current E).  His mushrooms would simply start as a quick explosion of damage.  However, once his R was unlocked, the Mushrooms would function as their current live functionality.  His auto&#039;s would gain that iconic/evil damage over time effect and potentially another effect on his Q.  Each Rank in R would make the damage over time higher and/or longer, starting out a little weaker than live, but ending slightly stronger at lv 16.  Also, iplacing invisible traps is extremely powerful, and if he can rig a lane with them before the wave, he could clear it a little too easily.  As such, the mushrooms should be locked until lv 2.  He has cleared the first couple waves or killed his first buff, then he gets to start placing them to clear camps or  do other teemo things.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n* Ranged champions always wind up opressive to melee, and teemo&#039;s damage over time means he can poke and run away worse than most.  So waiting to give him that until lv 6 seems like a way to not remove this mechanic but make it a bit more fair.\n* the AoE damage lets him clear Raptors and wolves easier, while also helping Teemo farm in top lane about as well as he currently does.\n* None of those very important &quot;Teemo moments&quot; are lost.  He still behaves almost exactly the same after level 6.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n* Teemo is now in the jungle.  Have fun walking into lane but realizing he&#039;s already there.\n* His intial harrass is slightly lower, meaning he will have to play at least a little more conservatively than he currently does before 6.\n* Invisible traps are dangerous.  While locking them behind lv. 2 does largely solve the problem, it doesn&#039;t guarantee there won&#039;t be unforceen consequences.\n\nAs a closing thought, this isn't designed to be a rework or anything like that.  When you imagine this, think about the Hiemerdinger update or the much more recent Azir updates.  Their small tweaks done outside of a full on rework, designed around changing up numbers and certain ability details.  As no new abilities, passives, or visual effects are being created this has a huge benefit of requiring only the minimum number of resources from Riot.  That may be the actual best part of this design: it's do-able without completely upsetting any previous scheduels Riot has for development on new champions or full Reworks.\n\nWelp, that&#039;s it for me.  WHat idea do you all have?  Like the current one too much?  Want him deleted?  Share them below and look at what other have posted.

This was the first one I came up with where it just felt right and had answers to a lot of his issues.\n\nI mean he’s still gonna be Teemo in the top lane. Poke you with Aery and run away.  Blind you right before you can get the beat down on that smug little face. After 6 he’s almost the exact same, which is still in time for laning and trying to harass for an advantage. But he also has the tools to operate in the jungle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2018-04-20T23:05:33.651+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you swap E and R, which means shrooms WILL HAVE TO BE HARDGATED by either nerfing the damage in half or it's duration to mere seconds, so............\n\n#No.\n\nAlso considering how Riot wants to nerf every mage in existence, this rework could give them an argument for nerfing.

I’ve been waiting for you this entire time!  \n\nI think the fact each mushroom costs 75 Damage and they are only about half effective, if that, before 6 with this idea, they could be balanced.  Their lack of damage means that they don’t hurt champs that much, mostly used to soften waves to last hit or set up two and kite a jungle camp into them.  I mean they’ll hurt, but imagine Jhins traps early in the game, BEFORE he gets a million AD.  That’s what these are until lv 6 unlocks the rest of their damage.\n\nSo I don’t think they’d have to nerf the mushrooms after 6. I mean, yes, pre 6 mushroom damage would be halved, but then bounce up to normal.  \n\n\nAlso, thank you so much for disagreeing. I’ve literally wanted people to poke holes in this just so I can think about them and try to remedy them.","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2018-04-21T15:14:32.452+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want Teemo be able to jungle, just make that his poison from E stacks up to 2/3x (dunno about numbers, just general guess) on jungle camps instead of refreshing on each hit.

This seemed like a more oportunistic way to get around that. \n\nAs for his lack of cc, your right on with that one. I don’t have a good answer unless he goes Glacial Augment Or gets a miracle shroom thrown perfectly to slow them. He could get a slow on q, but that seems like a balancing nightmare for top lane so I avoided it.  I don’t have a good answer, not unless shrooms don’t need arming time, which could also become really broken fast.\n\nI have ideas about It, but none that actually work. I figure preemptive shroom placement that could be used to bounce another one could work, but not reliably enough for a jungler.  I would want to test to see if the mushrooms could work as enough cc, just for the experiment.\n\nEh, I don’t know if these changes would count as a rework. The lux changes being experimented are closer.  And I worked hard to preserve the soul of Teemo with this change. I really believe this would work great.","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2018-04-22T14:25:33.485+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> but riot spoke about using “bonus damage to monsters” abilities and how they try to avoid them\n\nI remember them saying that they will not focus on 1 class above others, or that we'll have diversity and look to where it got us :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ZaneShadow","date":"2018-04-20T00:00:37.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, surprised no one has started screaming Teemo hate or posted “worship Satan Teemo” yet.
