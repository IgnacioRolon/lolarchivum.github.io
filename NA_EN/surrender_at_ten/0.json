Pretty sure they're Essence Farming bots, because of how similarly they play to each other. What're the odds on the bots getting banned any time soon? I'm not gonna introduce any more friends to League if our training games are going to suck this bad.","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-08-08T02:15:43.206+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bots are bad for the game...\n\n...But i absolutely LOVE them when I do missions.  I wish I can get 4 of those bots in my AI game when I do my missions.  Super easy to drag the game out and farm gold/kills/minions/heal/etc. all in one game.  Hard to do with other humans.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-08-08T02:11:52.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are the odds? 100%\n\nIs it going to be within the timeframe you want? Probably not as the punishment is in waves so it makes it harder for the bot developers to know what got them punished.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-08-08T01:00:14.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bots are banned in waves to make it harder to determine how they are detected.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorpinka","date":"2019-08-08T23:37:54.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Banning bots in a AI game mode while allowing AFKs to ruin PvP games with little to no punishment. Brilliant. Truly genius.","replies":[]}]}
