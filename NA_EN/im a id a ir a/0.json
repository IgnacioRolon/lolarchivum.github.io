After some research we found out that this was a bot. However, there was a guy being premade with this bot. He intentionally queued with 2 accounts one being a bot and one played by himself so he can play solo botlane (at least that&#039;s what it looked like he wanted to do) while the bot repeatedly ran down mid.\n\nAfter 21 games of intentional feeding and using a 3rd party program the first account got banned. \n\nhttps://picload.org/image/raparoow/account1.png\n\nHe instantly started using a second account which got banned after 19 games.\n\nhttps://picload.org/image/raparolr/account2.png\n\nAnd the 3rd one followed instantly as well.\n\nhttps://picload.org/image/raparola/account3.png\n\nThe 3rd account stopped at 20 games, i assume it got banned and he has no accounts left as he currently plays without a bot. (yay, reformed!)\n\nThe account he played himself is untouched although everyone knows that he is queuing up with a bot and ruined at least 60 RANKED games like this.\n\nhttps://picload.org/image/raparoll/mainaccount.png\n\nHow can this happen that a player can intentional feed AVERAGE 20 games in a row using a 3rd party program until he gets punished. Why does no one step in and stop this player (His names are well known, wasn&#039;t hard to find out) even tho the case got published at the boards and someone sent a ticket to the Riot support?\n\nI really hope someone from Riot can give a decent explanation here, no Rioter from EU had the spine to even say one word to this.\n\nwith best regards and a happy new year to everyone\n\nIM A ID A IR A\n\n\nEdit: here the link the the discussion on the EU board:\nhttp://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour-en/TsNGYuYJ-riot","replies":[{"poster":"Best Kog NA","date":"2017-01-01T15:00:54.076+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":2,"body":"The real question I have.
