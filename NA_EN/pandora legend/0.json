Run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for the match if you're still having this issue for an overview of what's going wrong.  The results will also provide you with a set of troubleshooting steps specific to your case.  You can test it out in a custom game to prevent penalties.

I'm getting rather frustrated as this feels like the same deal that I had with my first MOBA being Smite.\n\nGame ran perfectly for the longest time after I sunk loads of cash into it for skins and such (In this case it's been champions I wanna play that are so damn expensive and some skins here and there for my main champs) but now it's frustrating that this is suddenly popping up with issues for no reason, rest assured the computer itself runs smoothly and can watch Youtube videos at 720IP to even 1080 and can play flash games or any 3D games on the web just fine. so it's apparently something just circled around LoL right now. I need to really get it fixed ASAP or else really it's gonna be another little under 100$ if not over 100$ money pit of a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-16T21:32:02.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update!  The results of the logreader are super helpful because it helps us pinpoint what's going on.  In this case, it's suggesting that your network is having some big problems maintaining a connection, causing a degradation in your game stability.  Using the HRT to repair won't do much in this case because it will repair game files, not your connection.  For your specific issue, I highly suggest going through each step in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to strengthen your connection or any settings getting in the way.  \n\nAs a heads up, just because you can use the internet for Youtube doesn't mean that your network can't have problems specifically connecting to the game server.

I've followed the many steps that were specifically named like Packet Loss, there were some yellow and red lights but none had the word \"Packet Loss\" or \"Packet Buffering\" in them, I've scoured Google, Youtube, and many sources at this point, and I officially just did an entire uninstall and reinstall. but it's only made some minor improvements, my FPS seems to be the main issue now where it starts off fine, but once minion spawn happens and I get into it, it begins to drop to 12FPS to a horrible 08-09 FPS, I've followed every step to optimize and improve gameplay, lag removal tips, and everything under the sun it feels at this point. \n\nI am at a point of rather frustration/disgust as I've been trying tirelessly at this and when you keep hitting walls and never seeing an inch of improvement or you feel like you're going a step in the right direction it's very tiresome. I suppose the best thing I can do at this point is just take a step back, let it sit for a couple days and come back to it with some more actual inspiration or motivation to try again. I mean as much as I miss the game right now and still have loads of champs I wanna keep pushing mastery's on (Even more worse is the bonus IP weekend I'm gonna entirely miss which I could've grinded to buy an expensive champ or one I wanted) \n\nI don't know if anyone can see this anymore or if anyone is still listening, but for those who may come by this or happen to read it. this is the current status.","replies":[]}]}
