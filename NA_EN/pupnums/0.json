I have ping spikes both through the match.  This will cause my ping to go from my normal 30 to 400. This will just randomly stop.  When I am not lagging, I am able to load youtube videos perfectly while playing league with no ping lag. Then there is the opposite where  I could exit out of every program other than league on my computer  only to lower my ping to 250. There is no in between. \n\nSidenote: This doesnt happen in any other game, at least not to this extent.","replies":[{"poster":"pupnums","date":"2016-08-22T02:29:39.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just tried everything in the troubleshooting and nothing seemed to help, I constantly fluxuate between normal and insanely high throughout the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T17:10:22.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having trouble maintaining a strong connection, and possibly suffering from packet loss.
