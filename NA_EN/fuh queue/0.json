Normally I play mage supports and do the typical sightstone -&gt; full AP as a Brand main. However I ran into the issue of only having 2 supports on this account: Nami and Braum.\n\nI locked Nami and quickly looked into the builds I should be running before the game started. I was actually surprised. I&#039;m obviously not good at league so when I reached mid game with 5 active items to manage and the sole responsibility for protecting my adc, I found it difficult. Eventually we won the game and I managed a 3/4/29 game.\n\nThe thing is that I&#039;ve always built damage items and relied only on my skills and focused on the enemy team. Changing the view into peeling and supporting was alot more challenging than I thought it would be. The gameplay was interactive and it felt rewarding.","replies":[{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2017-06-30T14:08:46.242+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":10,"body":"Support has the highest skill floor out of all positions if you ask me, maybe it's kinda equal to the jungler.\nAutofill supports are SO obvious.","replies":[{"poster":"Dukues","date":"2017-06-30T15:41:05.395+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":30,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KoKoboto,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QmATT08f,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-06-30T14:08:46.242+0000)\n>\n> Support has the highest skill floor out of all positions if you ask me, maybe it&#x27;s kinda equal to the jungler.\n> Autofill supports are SO obvious.\n\nmeh... it's still the easiest role to transition to.

Part of the reason I'm eager to give up that point is because it transitions into discussing the support's role in the macro-strategy of the game. I wish more supports would understand that (and work on it), and I wish more solo laners would be willing to listen to the support's shot-calling.

By removing that entire aspect of the game you allow the person to focus only on interacting with your ADC, your enemy laners and watching the map. As someone mentioned in a thread the other day, one of the biggest things holding people back in lower ranks is not farming well. \n\nFurther, since you're there for the team through your utility it means that getting behind is less frustrating since you can still do something even when behind. Farming is important to learn but it is not something you want to bog down a new player with since it could easily turn them away. If you introduce the more kinetic aspects of the game to them first and they decide they like that then they can move on from there.\n\nThis does not mean that there is not a lot to learn to become a truly great support, far from it, but it is the safest position to have a newbie try out.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fuh Queue","date":"2017-06-30T14:25:07.069+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually agree with that.
