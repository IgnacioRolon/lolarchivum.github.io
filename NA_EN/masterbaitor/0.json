This is software for engineering, farming, architecture, programming, etc. costs so much.  The development cost isn't actually worth as much as they charge, but if it isn't for personal use it and makes someone else money they want in on that profit.  An example is solidworks engineering cad which I used in school.  The student version is about $70 while the professional version is which is nearly identical is almost $1,000.  They only difference between them is that you have the right to make revenue from using the product with the professional version.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2017-06-22T01:43:06.637+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not entirely true, for instance fan games, it doesn't matter if it's going to be for free and uses all original assets, if it's say...  final fantasy's liscensed characters on screen, you can still get your ass sued so hard you'll be owing money after you reincarnate, and the reason you don't hear about it is because 9/10 they have a clause that says if you talk about it you have to pay double :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"ImTheSideKick","date":"2017-06-22T00:49:30.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"good point raised. but I mean a example of some one getting in trouble over using some one elses images as my example was not a valid one","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Paquay","date":"2017-06-22T05:41:31.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best one that I can think of off the top of my head is when Napster got sued.
