On the main I had 1 previous chat ban and that was it.

Do you think that's better? Hint: it isn't. That's why you're the one with a chat restriction and I'm not. You are the one who asked how you triggered the report system, and you are the one who asked if this warrants a chat restriction. Riot doesn't care about \"context\" because there is no justification for behavior like yours.\n\nSo, I repeat: if you keep behaving like this, you will eventually be permabanned, whether you agree with it or not.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/dMm2T8H.gifv","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Arisha the Dark","date":"2019-07-16T16:14:57.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wasted Youth: gg we win u lose\nWasted Youth: ur not even bronze\nWasted Youth: sit down\nWasted Youth: ez\n\nThis IS toxic.
