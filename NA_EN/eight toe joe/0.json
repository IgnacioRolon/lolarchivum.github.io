Typically, random characters before (sometimes after) a first name [ex: x2cGeorgeb]. They always take snowball and ghost, and no mastery.\n\nThey tower dive, over initiate and _play like_ int. feeders. I've been on this account only 4 or 5 months (level 27) and am swarmed by these bots no matter what time of day.\n\nVery annoying. I'm assuming they're people farming accounts for sell? Which is even worse! I report as often as I can - anything else I can do besides level up? I'm Honor level 5 so i don't think I'm in some sort of \"undesirable\" pool?\n\nl8r sk8rs {{summoner:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-24T00:12:24.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, Honor Rank doesn't group you with others of the similar rank! No 'undesirables' here.\n\nThe best thing you can do is exactly what you have been, keep on reporting any bots you might see. They *are* a little more prevalent in lower leveled games, so you should start seeing less of them soon hopefully.","replies":[]}]}
