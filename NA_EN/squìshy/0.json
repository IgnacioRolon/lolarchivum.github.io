It gave me the option to contact a human instead but it already said my ticket was solved so I wasn't sure if it'd even get looked at. So here I am, trying to seek help from _actual_ people.\r\n\r\nSo this started yesterday around 5 pm, I go into an aram game cause I always start off my first games with one. Everything's fine till I go into the loading screen and it says I have 123 ping, I'm thinking \"Okay well that's not too bad I can deal with that\" and it starts going up in the percents then suddenly says I can't connect to the server. I try to reconnect and I can't, every time I've tried to reconnect it won't let me till everyone else has loaded into the match already. Once I'm in the match it'll say I have 500ping and am reconnecting for a few seconds before connecting to the game and start playing. This has happened every single time I've attempted toe play so far, I've tried everything to fix it and I'm not sure if it's my internet, league, or my computer at this point.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if I die or if I stand still for a few seconds it says I'm reconnecting but usually, everything's fine, only a couple times has it actually disconnected me and I have to wait a few seconds to connect. This is incredibly frustrating considering I've been wanting to play some ranked but don't want to if I'm gonna be showing up to lane late every game. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone experience the same problems and better yet, have any solutions? It's so frustrating. I woke up today hoping it'd be fixed by now but nope. \r\n\r\nAlso, I want to add I'm visiting family and they have a data plan for their internet but it wasn't like this the first few days I've been here, could this have something to do with is it? Please let me know, thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-09T23:25:28.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you mentioned your families internet data plan, there's a chance it could be the source of the problem. I definitely don't want to pin it all on that of course, but it's something to keep in mind while we troubleshoot. \n\nIt honestly sounds like this may be an issue with some packet loss. Essentially that means that some of the data being sent from your network to our servers isn't making it all the way. I'd suggest using this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) with the latest game logs that had the ping spikes. Take a screenshot of what it shows, and post it here using something like Gyazo. That way we can know for sure if we're dealing with packet loss, and I'll know where to go from there! ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Squìshy","date":"2017-06-09T23:50:45.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://prntscr.com/fi0pjv This is from a game I just had\n\nWhen I checked another game, it showed me this http://prntscr.com/fi0pun\n\nand the other ones look pretty similar to the second one.

Go ahead and shoot our tech guys a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and attach those logs as well. They'll be able to look over your logs to see if there anything they can help with!","replies":[{"poster":"Squìshy","date":"2017-06-10T01:43:15.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have done that already though and also did it again just now and it gave me the blitzcrank bot and said my ticket was solved when it hasn't been yet. :( Ugh..","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-10T01:56:52.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooooh that's Blitzbot sometimes -_-....\n\nIf you go back into your ticket and read towards the bottom there should be a button called \"Request a Human\" which will send you to an agent.

But when I click the button is shows this: http://prntscr.com/fi1phz =_= And doesn't seem to do anything. The ticket I sent 5 hours I clicked the button like 10 times and it didn't do anything.

It may take a little bit to get a response, but those techies are working through the queue as fast as they can and you should have a response relatively soon!","replies":[{"poster":"Squìshy","date":"2017-06-10T02:24:40.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okie dokie thank you so much! ^_^ You've been super helpful, I can't thank you enough!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-10T02:42:37.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
