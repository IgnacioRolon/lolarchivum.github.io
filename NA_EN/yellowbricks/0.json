Her power is noticeably gated, her poisons may as well be butterflies flittering around enemies for all they do to them. All of her power is top loaded in E, and it has sapped every other spell she possesses of any power and usefulness, aside from a set up for E. A champion should never have a kit that is so focused on setting up for one spell.","replies":[{"poster":"yellowbricks","date":"2014-12-25T00:09:00.022+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=El5pLP6A,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2014-12-25T00:05:27.505+0000)\n>\n> She went from one kind of broken to the other.

She's got really ridiculous damage especially late game with 500 stacks and a rabadon's lol.\n\nI recommend always getting will of the ancients because the sustain she gets completely negates the weakness of having to go in close to fight. The only thing you need is a team supporting you and giving you openings to deal your damage.\n\nIt's obvious her E is her core damage ability, but that's because she is built more around close engaging and exchanges. You can still zone opponents in-lane by making them be more careful of getting poisoned because of your E damage. Whenever they get hit by your Miasma or Noxious blast, head in if you can and unload E's to shred their HP. They'll more than likely think carefully before walking into your poison anymore which allows you to zone just like old cassi did. The only difference is her range is quite a bit smaller. She's a closer range sort of battle-mage now. With a Will of the Ancients, that tends not to even be a problem.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-12-25T00:16:59.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dislike her new style.

It's like a more mechanically intensive variant of Brands W-E caster minion waveclear, but the trade off is you get more mana back for doing so.\n\nThe E amplifying the poison damage by 20% I feel should be removed, it doesn't feel impactful/noticeable at all. They should just change Q to deal bonus damage to champions (like Syndra or Darius Q). She trades poorly early and midgame and trading/harass drains your mana pool hard.\n\nAlso the passive bonuses being gated at checkpoints are just annoying. The bonuses are nice, but they don't feel impactful.","replies":[{"poster":"kanacho","date":"2014-12-25T00:26:06.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Start a doran's ring and you can trade without having to worry about mana (you can earn it all back with CS and E).

I just played Cassi and she is unbelievably broken... I was doing terrible in terms of KDA the entire game, then came to instaexplode everyone on their team late game (in terms of damage, my teammates took a lot of the kills which is all good and everything). The thing is that Cassi is stupid broken if you play her right and ACTUALLY land her poison which you have 2 shots at with 2 different poison abilities, and you have great chase potential with 20% bonus MS on landing Q and her Slow on her W... If you land any poison (which is easy when you ulti stun them), then they are more than likely done. Get a will of the ancient and the 5% bonus CDR from masteries, and you'll be getting 40% CDR at 300 stacks (which is even easier to get to now, and you don't have to spend all your time farming and you get more time to roam and gank with the new updates to her passive). Throw on that ridiculous damage and spell vamp from will of the ancients (and the healing you get from your E with 100 stacks), and your sustain because ABSURD... They literally don't even damage her in a fight unless she gets CCed or focused. Otherwise, she completely single-handedly deal all the damage your team needs to blow up the enemy team. She's got WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY more damage than people might think if you can actually land poison.","replies":[]}]}
