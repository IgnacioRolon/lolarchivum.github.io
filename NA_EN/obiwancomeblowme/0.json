I have checked my purchase history and it says that I was only gifted an icon. I do not own the Riot Kayle skin which is one that I checked for due to it being on the forums and I have never owned it. I was just wondering if it had been changed so you only get an icon or a skin or that maybe the skin does not come up in the purchase history and I would have to search for it. I am not very good at tone in posts so if it seems like I am anything other than questioning and happy that was not my intention.\r\n\r\nFrom a loyal league player,\r\n\r\nApocalypseange1","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-20T05:07:46.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you received the Snow Day Scuttler Icon and the Poro King Icon!
