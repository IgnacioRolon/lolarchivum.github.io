I know there's a reason no one builds her glass cannon - her bad Q ratios. But if you combine the ratios on 5 spiderlings plus spider form on-hit, that's an 80% ratio, and that's on every autoattack spammed by Skittering Frenzy. After you take into account the above average base damage on her Qs, and the fact that their ratios become at least noticible on level 18 squishies, I think she might be a viable assassin. And her poke is good, and with Neurotoxin scaling against frontline champs, plus her 2s stun, I think she can somewhat fulfil the role of a mage as well. She's definitely subpar at both compared to dedicated champions, but I think it may be functional. Her main strength would be versatility, and being able to do different things throughout the game. It also makes a lot more sense with her lore/kit, IMO.\n\nBut here's the thing, Elise rarely gets to spam auto a target. That's why Gunblade would be core, with its 2s 40% slow. The damaging part of its active also helps her spec into burst and AP scaling, and its sustain stacks with her on-hit sustain to give her some much-needed survivability as a melee. And I know she has no actual AD ratios, but it's undeniable that that AD would help her 140% attack speed burst.\n\nSo why don't I try this myself? I seem to have some degree of carpal tunnel, and can't game for awhile. Actually the reason I'm sharing this idea is because I'm worried Elise might get changed or reworked at some point in the future, and something I really like would be lost. I'm not 100% confident my ideas are viable, but just in case I want to at least give this idea a chance in case it actually gives Elise a strong purpose in the game that might otherwise be lost.\n\nSo I'm asking for both:\n- Thoughts if you personally think this is viable\n- Trying it out yourself and letting me know how it went\n\nFeel free to try her jungle, top, mid, and even support if you want.\n\nNotes:\n\n* Keep in mind she's one of the best tower shredders in the game if built AP, because her spiders affect towers and multiply with both Skittering Frenzy and Rabadon's Deathcap. Just try your best to go into spider form just when the turret starts attacking a full health minion, since it prioritizes your spiderlings over minions.\n\n* Due to total spiderling ratios scaling with ult ranks, and Q ratios scaling with enemy base/bonus HP, Elise's ratios take time to scale into lategame. I'm not sure exactly how strong she'll be early-midgame if built AP, but just take into account I've been highlighting her max level damage. You can try playing more passive in lane if you want, and just farm until lategame, with her scaling ratios, poke, and tower shredding.\n\n* You may want to max W first for single-target burst (Skittering Frenzy), once you get Cutlass/Gunblade. Especially in the jungle, for clear.\n\n* When assassinating with Skittering Frenzy, she is vulnerable to being bursted, CCed, or in the case of her spiderlings AoE'd. Like I said she's not as good as true assassins, nor should she be. Just try to keep this in mind and try to play around enemy cooldowns/ranges.\n\n* I recommend getting scaling CDR runes and including Athene's or Morellonomicon in your build. Not only will it make her better at poking, ranged DPSing, and CCing, but she can use Rappel/Zhonya's to work around her cooldowns even better, especially with a 475 gap closer on a ~3.6s cooldown. Also means more spellvamp.\n\nThanks.","replies":[]}
