Other people behaving poorly does not excuse your own poor behavior and besides this case isn't about them it's about you as it was your behavior and actions that caused your account to be unfortunately permabanned. From the [Instant Feedback System FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286): \n\n>**WHY WAS I PUNISHED WHEN THE OTHER PERSON WAS WORSE OR STARTED IT!**\nSimply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other playerâ€™s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game. If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\nReports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nAs for why a permaban it's because you already received a 2-week ban and didn't change your behavior enough to get your account back in good standing. Also from the IFS FAQ: \n\n>**PUNISHMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW A BASIC ESCALATION PATH:**\nFirst Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\nSecond Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\nThird Offense: Two Week Suspension\nFourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\nHowever, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.\n\n>**BUT WHAT IF I REFORM? IS IT POSSIBLE TO GO DOWN THE ESCALATION PATH?**\nYes! Players who show consistent reform or show positive behavior in their games will help heal their accounts reputation.\n\nYou have a few options now: \n\n1) Learn from your mistakes, improve your behavior and avoid being punished again on a new account.\n2) Keep making excuses as to why you think your behavior was justified and go through the IFS process all over again on a new account.\n3) Find another game to play with less strict rules regarding player behavior.\n\nThe choice is up to you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2018-03-18T02:15:17.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you ever had a 14-day ban before this?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-18T01:46:22.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BlackManCrying,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=fkbXuZwE,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-03-18T01:42:06.452+0000)\n>\n> how do I get my chat logs\n\nYour punishment report and/or email has them.

Double jungling isn't necessarily against the rules. And even if it were, another player breaking the rules doesn't make it okay for you to also break the rules. You broke the rules by being rude about it and by telling other people to report her.\n\n- **Fun fact!** Asking other players to report doesn't do any good anyway. As long as you report her, multiple reports won't make any difference. Just one report flags a game for review. Multiple reports don't trigger multiple reviews and even if they did, multiple reviews would all still turn up the same results. Not only does asking for reports go against the rules, it doesn't help.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackManCrying","date":"2018-03-18T01:54:09.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"but why does it deserve a permaban","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2018-03-18T16:47:13.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically instead of playing and reporting, or dodging, you decided to spend the entire game continuing the argument","replies":[]}]}
