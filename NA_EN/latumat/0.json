IMPORTANT","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi riots, im not really sure how to contact your service personnaly so ill write there for now. I didnt play for almost a week for some studying reason. My friend called me and ask me why I was playing at 1 hour of the morning, I said I didnt and I discover that I got hacked. Today, 28/09/2017, I came back on my account and discover that I got suspended for 14 days. I wont say anything about that because I saw the message that the player that was on my account wrote and it was really disrespectfull.\r\n\r\nYou might think that Im saying that because I might not be an honest player but ive been playing for 4 seasons in a row and I never got suspend or disrespect a player so I dont see the reason why it would start now. I didnt click any link that have been send to me for sure so im not really sure how all this happened.\r\n\r\nThe impact that the player or hacker did on my account: \r\n\r\nDisband my club (Pho2g).\r\nUse all my IP (18k)\r\nDemoted (G4 to G5 in promo)\r\nBlock a lot of my friend\r\nAnd, he suspended my account for 14 days and might get my honnor level down.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to be fixed:\r\n\r\nGetting my IP or Blue Essence back and refund all what the player or hacker bought if it has to.\r\nGetting the account unsuspended or unban.\r\nGetting the rank back to G4 0 LP if possible.\r\n\r\nI hope that you guys will trust me.\r\n\r\nThank you for your comprehension.\r\n\r\nLatumat.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-28T22:41:10.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did notice a fair amount of suspicious logins on this account, so go ahead and hit up our account agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) by picking the \"I need help recovering my account\" option.
