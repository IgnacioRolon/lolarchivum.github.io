It turns out that a [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging)  occurred during your series, which counts as a loss.  As a result, your series ended but restarted with your next win.  I hope that helps clear things up, and best of luck in your current series!","replies":[]}]}
