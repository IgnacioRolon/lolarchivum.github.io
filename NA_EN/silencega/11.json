Plus, despite all that, she's easy enough to use that you'll probably to all right even before you're actually good with her.  And if worse comes to worst you can use her to carry when all else fails.\n\nIf you really want to go specialist I'd also recommend Soraka over Blitz, you can damned near ignore the enemies and just focus on your team so it's the single easiest support in the game at the moment.\n\nNone of these are the \"best\" supports (including the ones other people recommend), but the actual best supports require an ADC that's either on the same page as you or in voice chat to pull off their really great combinations (e.g. Leona's infinite stun of doom) so it's best to get used to less friend-dependent ones first while training.","replies":[{"poster":"Silencega","date":"2016-03-26T04:08:18.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tried using Janna, which I made fun of in a previous post, but I must say that in bronze people rarely know what to do with a helpless cced ADC, and just let them fall back down without so much as an auto. And while soraka is nice, she can't carry, no matter how many times I global heal or silence if my team can't execute I'm stuck landing qs left and right. This has led me to the bad habit of maxing q BTW, as I don't trust my ADC to stay alive anymore with or without my help. How do I negate this feeling?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yianiy","date":"2016-03-25T20:57:58.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am by no means a pro, but listen close. Let. Me. Tell.

What I mean by this is: don't just sit on your lead and punish your lane opponent.  You need to ward, try to roam whenever you can and even invade their jungle.  If you're beating your opponent and your jungler is top ping to go into their jungle.  You and your jungler may pick up a kill, take their buff, or just get wards down for the next time he is in his jungle. This helps spread your lead to the rest of your team. This is why I picked up Quinn, her roaming is really second to maybe TF, but more constant.","replies":[{"poster":"Silencega","date":"2016-03-26T03:32:17.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would it be useful to do this even if I wasn't fully ahead?

If your opponent either a) didn't take TP, or b) theirs is down:  You back, use your flight to take yourself to mid or bot and gank (like a second jungler). You can usually help pick up kills, get a dragon and/or a tower. NOW is your next decision. Did your lane opponent use their TP (if they backed) to come bot to help fight. If they did and depending on how the fight goes you finish taking objectives then fly back top or you can tp back top since you used your flight to get to lane. If your mid is pushed in you can fly mid and it's basically the same idea.  Quinn is also the type of champion where if you don't need the AP, Quinn does fairly well in mid as well. Same thought applies, from mid you can fly top and bot very quickly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2016-03-25T20:49:01.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only advice I could give is don't play support.

You play mid play annie/malphite. you play support play taric and soraka, you play top play malphite and garen, you play jungle play yi/malphite. you play adc uninstall jkjk play lucian/jinx/mf and work on the verrrrry basics of the game like farming,playing smart,warding, foresight, ect and work on your own play and you will 100% climb and get better.
