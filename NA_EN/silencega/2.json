if you need a micro mouse to hit q and r you have problems.\nthis is the simplest i could have possibly designed multi unit micro. the two created units are insanely tanky from the jump, and output decent enough damage no one would want to fuck with them in the first place inside of its range. the two units can also be repositioned insanely easily. so you can probably save them from doom easier than anything.\n\nalso the micro mouse people use in dota, those buttons arent for unit control usually, they are for your 6 item slots. the most micro intensive heroes meepo and arc warden, dont even require you to have one, though it will make comboing on arc warden easier. for reference on how easy micro is, i, a bronze 5 baddie, acan successfully pike combo with arcwarden, easily the most brutal and annoying combo in the game when done correctly.\n\nim going to compare my created champs best combo, and compare it to arc wardens longest possible juggle. ready, lets go:\n\ngwastg best combo: qe->r (on top of someone) auto> w on both tops >q> auto>r >auto.\nthat combo is also a bit slow even if you auto cancel all of the autos.\n\n\nin comparison this is arc wardens longest combo, and if done perfectly can kill any hero without a dispel immunity or a bkb. get ready, its explanation time.\nrequires\n1) lightning pike (push back and gives you unlimited range on that target)\n2) blink dagger(long flash on a stick)\n3) rod of atos(stun)\n4) refresher orb, (resets all of your cooldowns, items and abilities)\n5) dagon 5 (nukes the hell out of someone)\n6) manta style (creates 2 clones)\n(note at this point you wouldnt need to do the combo other than to bm someone, you have well over the amount of tools to 2 shot someone with an ability and the dagon)\nq) flux, target hero gets a debuff that damage them while they are lone\nw) arc wardens lightning spirit. a placed ward that attack the nearest enemy after a short delay\ne) magnet field, casues any auo done from the outside of a zone to miss, and makes allies in the zone attack faster\nnow you might be saying, thats a lot of abilities to juggle, but i havent even got to his ult\nt double, he makes a clone of himself with all of his abilities and items, the clone is unliek other illusions, as this clone is a literal exact copy (copies cooldowns too)\n\nnow, for the combo (again, nothing will live even half of this combo. they will probably die after the pike, honestly. and you would have to be either a god, or cheating (using advanced macros to input these fast enough) to do all of this correctly, but it is technically \"doable\". this is just to show the longest possible combo he can do, requiring extreme micro play)\n\ne>q>r (behind enemy)>6>clone-6> set all illusion clones to attack>clone-w>clone-2(behind enemy)>clone e>1(toward clone) auto>w>clone-5>clone-3>clone-q> clone-1 (toward you)>clone auto>>3>5>4>clone-2>2>clone-q>clone-1>clone auto (until they land)>r (new clone, kills old one,just for bm/repositioning)>6>set all illusion clones to attack>clone auto>3>5>1>auto until dead>type \"gg ez\"\n\nthis will leave you having stunned 4 times, nuked with dagon 3 times, refreshered 1 times, proced 3 fluxes, dropped four dodge fields, created 6 clones, and do 1 air juggle and 1 extra push\n\n(do note that you do do portions of this combo normally, like pike bouncing and chaining atos, dagons.)\n\ni can see you needing a micro mouse for that, but you dont need one for this champ.\n\ntl;dr\n\nthis champion involves mechanics that could be written in a guide called \"babies first micro play\". he doesnt even begin to touch the micro involved in heroes like meepo and arc warden, and he surely doesnt need a micro mouse. also, dota 2 is pretty kewl.","replies":[]}]}]}
