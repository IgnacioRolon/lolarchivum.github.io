Obviously vayne lux will stomp her if you go for wall stun everytime, but against sona or soraka for example she can easily maneuver and lock an ADC. Also she trades like a beast, courage plus her passive makes her very hard to successfully whittle, and she stays combat ready with around 100 mana.\r\n\r\nShe has cons but comparing her to riven and jayce is honestly incorrect. Camille has a stupid quick gap close, her shield will be bigger than riven, even if some of it can only block ADC/supp damage. She has built in sustain that has a moving cast, allowing her to evade a large variety of skill shots while trading and escaping, while riven is stationary while she q3s. Also she can do some insanely clutch saves. Mainly coming from the fact you can queue tac sweep while hooking, allowing you to bounce and move back, slowing them a .5 seconds before the stun ends. And she can do this though thick walls if she has vision of the aggressors.\r\n\r\nBack to her cons:\r\nWeaker to cc than most champs (her kit involves second casting a lot)\r\nCan be predictable, and requires creative play to succeed\r\nCan be counter picked easily, don't take her every game unless you know how to win the matchup. Blitz in particular dumps on you\r\nIsn't exceptionally tanky until mid-late game, making her rely on her courage shield more than Ali or naut.\r\nSlow can be hard to land in some matchups, Lucian and ez, but her ADC can follow up if you position right.\r\nI'm not saying it is the best thing ever, but it is much more than a meritless troll pick.\r\nI truly want to see it be played in plat+, so I can point to a good player, rather than myself. (You can check my lolstarz, I'm undefeated with Camille support right now.) \r\n((copy pasted form another post of mine))","replies":[{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2017-01-08T21:11:22.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soraka top is enough to stomp in low elo.","replies":[{"poster":"Silencega","date":"2017-01-08T21:37:44.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dominusx,realm=EUNE,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=ydtpjd7X,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-08T21:11:22.612+0000)\n>\n> Soraka top is enough to stomp in low elo.\n\nhey man, starcall op.","replies":[]}]}]}
