Obviously, clear tentacles\n\n2. Avoid E at all cost. Best tactic is to bait it out. Most illaoi players don't like the tentacles being cleared so that is the best way to bait the E (walking up and stepping away. Hitting once and stepping away) \n\n3. If you are hit by E, you have a few choices, you can defend the vessel, you can run out of range, or you can tank the damage(ignore it); if you defend the vessel make sure not to be hit by her Q (when it hits the vessel AND you you effectively took damage twice). if you run out of range be ready to dodge tentacles and kill them. If you choose to tank the damage be aware that the transfered damage to you is being done as magic, but having armor makes your vessel take less damage over all.\n\n4. Never full engage illaoi after 6, EVEN with a gank. If illaoi pulls a vessel and ults that is 1 extra tentacle spawn from ult, if it's you and your jungler that is 3 tentacles not including any already spawned. IF that vessel dies and it can die easy it instantly starts spawning another tentacle, this is why illaoi has great success being dived\n\n\nThose are the basic ideas to keep in mind while playing against illaoi, while keeping these in mind you need to play proactively against her, this is what she wants she wants you go go go, but instead your strategy is to be proactive and aggressive but dodgy. When you get her to waste an E push your aggression even more but keep an open mind of disengage. The sec she hits ult 100% disengage make her fight you in a completely different area.","replies":[{"poster":"leakinb","date":"2017-12-12T13:10:13.514+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much\nJust want to ask If I deal persistent damage to her, will each hit reduce 1 second of that spirit?","replies":[{"poster":"Craazyface","date":"2017-12-12T20:05:30.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=leakinb,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vnVMnn8E,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-12-12T13:10:13.514+0000)\n>\n> Thank you so much\n> Just want to ask If I deal persistent damage to her, will each hit reduce 1 second of that spirit?\n\nCorrect, I'm not exactly sure on the time but every hit will make the spirit disappear quicker. That's the best way to deal with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-12-12T13:50:00.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=leakinb,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vnVMnn8E,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-12-12T13:10:13.514+0000)\n>\n> Thank you so much\n> Just want to ask If I deal persistent damage to her, will each hit reduce 1 second of that spirit?\n\nYes, this btw is just gonna be a jumble of tips.\n\nMost of what ExaggeratedToast said was great advice but if you run out of range or she kills your spirit just dodge a single tentacle, hit it once and then DON'T MOVE too far away from it.  It will not swing again at you and will not spawn another tentacle unless you approach another wall which doesn't have one.  This works especially well if you are under tower and got hit with her e.  Just let it spawn a tentacle on the tower and then focus on last hitting because that tentacle won't swing at you again.  \n\nHowever this needs to be balanced with how far you run.  DON'T run out of exp range for minions.   Obviously if she is chasing you and you are at risk of being w and slammed again then use other tactics.\n\nLevels 1-2 she is incredibly weak, probably one of the weakest in the game. Even level 3 with all her abilities she is very unlikely to be able to kill your spirit without 2 tentacles especially if you are pressuring her off of it.  If she ever misses e past level 4 same thing.  Incredibly weak and you can punish her for even stepping up close (remember she has no mobility whatsoever).\n\nIf you want a free win and don't want to deal with her much then her biggest counter is swain.  He just fucks her up.  It doesnt even matter if she hits e or not because a good swain player will either harras the fuck out of her before hand or just put his eqw combo on the spirit when she tries to attack it.  Unless the enemy is significantly worse than her she should pretty much never win this 1v1.\n\nYorick is also an amazing counter for pretty much the same reasons. Wall her in (if you get hit by e then wall around spirit), e for minions to jump her and then pound her face in.  Both his ghouls and his ulti block E so as soon as you hit your e she will most likely not be able to hit you.\n\nTryndamere is an extremely hard counter past level 6 but is slighly more of a skill matchup pre 6.  Just walk up and pound her face in, ulti if she does and if you can't kill her in 5 seconds then just e away.  Once you get enough dmg to kill her through your ulti once you pretty much have won the matchup.\n\nJayce and other ranged champions are also good as they just allow for free harrass but the matchup relies more on dodging the E now as she CAN burst them with a flash ulti combo if she hits it.\n\nIf you have any other questions I would be happy to answer. Illaoi is one of my mains so I love talking about her.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Elkington","date":"2017-12-12T15:39:35.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In general, you want to rush armor, HP and play safe, because she tinkers off in effectiveness as the game goes on. If she doesn't get a lead, she's barely even there. Do not fight her in her ult. Even if your jungler comes to gank, do not all in her during her ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhearBunny","date":"2017-12-12T15:00:26.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I pick Nocturne top into her.\nWith fleet footowork.\n\nSpell shield her grab.\nFleet footwork dodge her Q.\nWin.\n\nRun away from her ult.","replies":[]}]}
