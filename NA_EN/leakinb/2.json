You can go see for yourself.\n\nZed q's cooldown at level 1 is 6 seconds. Every 6 second, zed is able to manage to even 1 or 2 cs with his q. If you managed to zone Zed away from the minions, that's even better since now you have a gold advantage. \n\nYou push lane and you go roam. If Zed pings you MIA, you're making enemy bot/top lane play more safe and missing out on CS. You have roaming presence such as Quinn and Aurelion Sol. You don't even have to do an early gank, all you have to do is be missing from lane and you'll be creating a presence.  \n\nAt level 6, a zed cannot kill you in one combo with just ult e combo if you're full health. If a zed manages to hit both shurikens on you, that is your fault for not being able to dodge. His w is a 22 second at rank 1. If he uses it and he combos you, you should be able to finish him off. \n\nIf you would like to talk more, just add me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2018-07-25T16:24:03.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KekKaiax,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VnOY99Gd,comment-id=001c,timestamp=2018-07-25T15:15:18.075+0000)\n>\n> Zed is a lane bully and an assassin.

Not sure why you're bringing up Sol and TF however when both are hardcountered by Zed and when the comment has always been about Zed being way safer than the other assassins with better damage scaling on top. Stop with the bullshit tangents about mages when the comparison has always been between Zed and the other assassins.\n\nYes, Zed can get poked, but he usually goes resolve and 3 pots so the poke is trivialized and by lv3 no mage will try to poke him because all it takes is one WE without even landing a Q and he already comes out with kill potential with electrocute and ignite if he ports in.\n\nHe's like the Vladimir of assassins, way too safe compared to the other assassins who actually have to risk harass to CS and have a bad early laning phase pre-6 to compensate for their strength post 6 in lane. If Ekko and Talon want to avoid harass, they go out of mana in no time; this is an issue Zed never faces.","replies":[{"poster":"Shablagoo","date":"2018-07-26T03:44:54.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mistook the roaming aspect and thought that you meant that all assassins are better roamers which is not true.

He's good into other assassins period. He beats Talon handily as his shadows and ult can pretty much allow him to deny Talon ever proccing his passive before the Zed bursts the Talon down.\n\nZed shits on Katarina, shits on Talon, shits on Ekko, and because his early lane is stronger than Fizz, who should be countering Zed with his E, Zed handily snowballs on Fizz as well.\n\nThe only types that do remotely well against Zed are aftershock Galio in early game before Zed builds lethality, and Garen/Malphite/Sion mid.","replies":[{"poster":"Shablagoo","date":"2018-07-27T00:19:25.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you think that lethality is better?

In fact I can't find any evidence that Zed beats Talon on all the sites they are even, http://na.op.gg/champion/zed/statistics/mid Says here too that Katarina beats zed.
