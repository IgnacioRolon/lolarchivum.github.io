She only displays her 2nd run when on speed pads and such. If this is what her run is now then id like to know so I can except that she will forever look weird on the rift but I&#039;d be very disappointed if this bug wasn&#039;t resolved. Her run is what makes lulu, lulu. It just feels odd playing without it.. please tell me I&#039;m not the only lulu main that is upset about this never ending issue.  {{champion:117}} {{item:1001}} {{item:3158}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-31T17:11:13.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Don't mind the copy pasta from the other post, just raising visibility!*\n\nA fellow QA friend (Riot LoveStrut) help me poke around a bit and it  looks like there was an animation before that played only when Lulu had boots, but now we made it so that animation only plays during her Run_HASTE. He's going to talk to an animator on his team and see what's intended and what needs to be changed. It isn't something you'll see next patch, but something we're actively working on! :)","replies":[]}]}
