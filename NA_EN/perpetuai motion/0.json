I had a previous response, but something caught my eye- it looks like your router is starting off with a higher ping from the start.  Do you have your own router or are you using your ISP's?  If you haven't yet, try restarting your router.  We need to make sure that your router's strength is strong before I'm convinced the issue is being caused elsewhere.  You can also use the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help with that.  Test it out in a custom game and let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"OrangeLambo","date":"2017-02-08T00:57:36.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Multiple people including myself are having this exact issue... how is that not enough evidence that it's an issue with the game? My internet browser works 100% as it should, but the game has been unplayable for the last 2 weeks. I've tried restarting my computer, and even re-installing the whole game.
