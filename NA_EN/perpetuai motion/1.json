Since you've already worked on your local side of things, I'd like to see a traceroute run through [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) so we can see if there are any issues in your routing. After loading up the app, plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field and start the trace. After 5 minutes has gone by, export the results as text and hit me back with them.\n\nIf you run into issues with this, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"PerpetuaI Motion","date":"2017-02-06T04:27:59.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Done.

Once your connection takes that first hop out of your network, your latency skyrockets to **291ms** and continues to spike before reaching our servers. This indicates there are issues with your ISP's network infrastructure, and there may be issues with your modem/router. Reaching out to your ISP's tier 2 technical support with this trace should aid them in resolving this with you.\n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PerpetuaI Motion","date":"2017-02-07T17:52:36.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"its averaging at like 115.. which is ridiculous.
