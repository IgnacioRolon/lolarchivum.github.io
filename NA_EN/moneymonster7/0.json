First of all, the client looks a lot different. It seems that everything should theoretically work the same way, but the face just looks different. However, I am unable to click on any of the 3 buttons in the lower right-hand corner to view them. I see them all flashing as if I have something the game wants me to see, but when I try to click on them, nothing happens. Is anyone else having this problem? Any potential solutions?\r\n\r\nNote: I've restarted the client itself 3 times, and I've restarted my computer twice. I've tried using both a wireless connection and a wired connection to see if that had anything to do with it. I can't think of anything else to try!","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-04T23:17:44.429+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Moneymonster7, \n\nHave you tried repairing the client up in the top right corner before logging in? I would suggest trying that first and if that doesn't seem to work, send in a ticket to Riot. No one needs a poltergeist in their gaming system xD \n\nRiot Support Ticket: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\n{{champion:25}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3157}}","replies":[{"poster":"Moneymonster7","date":"2015-11-05T00:08:12.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: It would appear Riot accidentally put me on the alpha client or something, so when I repaired, everything returned to normal.
