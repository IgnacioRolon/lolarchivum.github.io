I basically got harassed by people in game for banning Kled. I checked and did not see anyone highlighting him. So I banned him and got flamed proceedingly. The gragas, singed, and gangplank (although him to a lesser degree I believe) all harassed me and stated that they were reporting and I would desire to discuss their behavior. They proceeded to attack me verbally in the match lobby stating that one of them was going AD Singed and hoping I&#039;d leave. My response was that I didn&#039;t care I was in it to play and enjoy a non-ranked match. I would like to bring this up with the tribunal. I have the match ID and pressed print screen only to learn that it doesn&#039;t work as intended. I would like their reports voided if they did or would like the prior match record read if possible by someone. It is players like these which make this game hard to enjoy and players like myself a lot less likely to return and desire to continue on again. I was in lane top practicing my Fiora. Anyways please respond if possible such that I may give you the match number. I was also wondering if chats are saved prior to matches as print screen did not work. Apologies and thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"CraftyCohort","date":"2016-10-14T02:45:56.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks all. :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-14T00:56:44.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no tribunal.\n\nReports do exactly nothing at all, unless you actually did something wrong.\nStay silent and let trash cry their way to a ban. best defense you can make.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-10-14T00:53:13.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't worry about people reporting you. All report(s) do is to flag the system to check for toxicity, and if none are present, they system tosses it out.\n\nThis is the reason why asking for reports is considered harassment, cos it does nothing but to promote a negative environment. \n\nThere is also no need to defend yourself against people asking to report you, as the system will defend you by proving you innocent if you did nothing wrong.\n\nHowever, if you were toxic back to them, then you've just validated their reports.\n\nFinally, when they falsey report people, the system would drop their report weight and eventually their reports won't do anything, cos the system ignores their reports.","replies":[]},{"poster":"G4LLOWSC4L1BR4TR","date":"2016-10-14T00:41:47.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you did get reported there's no need to worry, Riot checks reports like these and then throws them out because you did nothing wrong. If you reported them after the game, good, hopefully they'll get banned. That's really all you can do other than trust that the system will weed them out eventually.","replies":[]}]}
