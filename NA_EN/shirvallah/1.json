Made sure my internet was not the issue. Everything in that regard is running smoothly at 48 ms. \r\n\r\nI'm not all that certain what could have caused this, but I just thought I'd attempt to get to the bottom of it or at least make someone aware that it was happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-01T01:52:30.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's most likely a disconnect between your network and our game servers. It's not at all uncommon to have your internet up and running, but still have problems communicating with specific servers due to routing issues from your ISP or simply traffic in your area. I'd suggest checking out your network settings by following the steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), specifically the steps on Port Forwarding and DNS settings.","replies":[]}]}
