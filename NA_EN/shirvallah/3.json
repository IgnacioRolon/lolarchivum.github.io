We&rsquo;ll be getting just ARURF instead.\n\nI had this thought that maybe it&rsquo;ll put some of our woes to rest if we got some stats regarding URF vs ARURF, maybe like how many players played on a consistent basis before URF, how many came just long enough to play URF, how many total people left League after URF, how many people left League after URF that took a short break (or long break? Or even left permanently?), how many of those people were newer players, how many of those people were veteran players, etc.?\n\nMaybe we can get some stats on ARURF too?\n\nMaybe we can &ldquo;for science&rdquo; this and bring back URF once more to gain up to date stats, too? Because it&rsquo;s been how many years, Riot? 5, now?\n\nI&rsquo;m not sure how many people are like me when I say this, but I&rsquo;d be more okay with normal URF never coming back if I was provided factual evidence to back up the claim of people leaving after playing URF. \n\nSide note: I&rsquo;ve met a lot of people IRL who&rsquo;ve played League before who say they&rsquo;d 110% come back to play URF because they miss it so much.\n\nSide note #2: In a thread somewhere, someone suggested that we should be allowed to different URF queues (normal URF and ARURF). Why is this not a thing? If people really complain about seeing the same champions every game, now they&rsquo;ll get the option of playing the same game, but they get to choose whether the champions are all random or not.\n\n&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;\n\nThoughts?","replies":[]}
