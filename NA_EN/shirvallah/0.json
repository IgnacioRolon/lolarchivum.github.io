Is it possible that Lux&#039;s Commando splash and skin would ever be updated and completely reworked like Galio&#039;s? I thoroughly enjoy Galio&#039;s and wish Lux&#039;s looked even half as good as his. I own every Lux skin except that one because I can&#039;t find it in me to pay for a Lux skin that I think is outright hideous and that doesn&#039;t fit our Lady of Luminosity. I know I&#039;d never use it as it currently is, ever. I&#039;d even be willing to pay the full original price if it were redone.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of comparison, here&#039;s Lux&#039;s splash and skin versus Galio&#039;s:\r\n\r\nhttp://riot-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/news/March_2012/2012_03_13_commando/Lux_Commando_Splash.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/--pZOccJO9hU/VhIYxzksn5I/AAAAAAAAG-o/Aso-QNyhjaM/s1600/luxturn.jpg\r\n\r\nhttps://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontpage/apps/prod/rg-galio-update-2017/en_PL/9ef2d997195733ef7110fcd2012d00e4e414e893/assets/img/wp-galio-commando-logo.jpg\r\n\r\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9f5mgli2Y_I/WL8oM8qzyfI/AAAAAAAAfb0/Vp_og4GoVwc0sbJvH50_-ZwOIMj25C9HQCEw/s640/galio3turn.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Riot TreblMuffin","date":"2017-06-09T15:39:02.270+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Commando Lux is specifically the only Lux skin I'll play _because_ it's full derp.

I call it my McDonald's Lux skin. xD \n\nCall me obnoxious, but I swear, just about every game I play with that skin, I always find some odd sense of enjoyment in typing in all caps in /all chat at the beginning of the game, \"WELCOME TO MCDONALD'S!\" Then, the enemies get all confused, and they overthink why I said that and can't focus on the game. Then, I win with my favorite Lady of Lasers.\n\nSPECIAL TACTICS. >:D\n\nAnyhoot, TBH, I probably wouldn't have bought it if I didn't get it in my Hextech chest. The textures aren't too shabby (which is why I gave the skin a chance in the first place). Though, they could use some love, too. \n\nAlso, yeah, I definitely agree on the updated Galio. The art team outdid themselves with that one. Amazing! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arcus Diabolus","date":"2017-06-09T16:09:44.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Commando Lux needs better effects, but I don't know how to do that without making this skin legendary.","replies":[{"poster":"Shirvallah","date":"2017-06-09T17:41:27.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arcus Diabolus,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=yF28p7Ty,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-06-09T16:09:44.087+0000)\n>\n> Commando Lux needs better effects, but I don&#x27;t know how to do that without making this skin legendary.\n\nTBH, I'm fine with the effects/particles being the same as the Lux's classic skin â€” if not, just slightly tweaked, like the Steel Legion skin, which is 975 RP.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JhonTeemon","date":"2017-06-09T09:35:47.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"old commando gailo splash art looked cool.
