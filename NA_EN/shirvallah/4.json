They will typically provide a lot of useful tips while playing and you can often see or hear their decision process and some optimizations  throughout the game.\n\nOff the top of my head, some basic optimizations may be:\n\n* Use hard-CC when the monster camps are about to attack you to cancel that attack and delay their next.\n* Attack Speed is extremely efficient at clearing on most junglers.  I'd recommend using about 15% on champions when you need to speed up their clear even if they don't use the stat much later (with a few exceptions, such as Nidalee and Evelynn).\n* Keep a control ward out (or in your inventory) whenever possible. This is important for every champion, but I thought I should emphasis it. There isn't really a good reason not to.\n\nAs far as ganking is concerned:\n\n* When possible, conserve your gap-closer while ganking.  If you can get to the enemy champion without using your mobility spell(s), then you can save it to catch them after they try to escape (Flash, dash, blink, etc).\n* You should should try to stay between the enemy and their escape route.  You should be trying to move backwards (towards their escape) in-between attacks so that you can body-block them and slow their escape.  This also leaves you closer to them if they try to dash on blink past you.\n* It can be risky to gank top-lane while Dragon is up since the enemy team can just group and take it 4v3.  I'd recommend ganking top-lane early if possible (after your initial clear) and when Dragon is down; that lane can be quite snowbally due to isolation, so you want to get your ally ahead.\n*  Learn to recognize the general times when buff camps spawn during games.  If you see the enemy gank bottom lane while their top-side buff is up, you can go steal it from them.\n*  Watch when top and bottom lane initially go into lane.  If that lane has leashed for their jungler (missing health, mana, or showed up to lane a bit late), then you know where the enemy jungler has likely started and where they will end their clear (where is closest for them to gank).\n*  If you have killed the enemy laner, you can either allow your laner to freeze or shove the lane into the enemy tower.  If you shove the wave under tower and the next minion wave is coming up, it can be helpful to proxy it to ensure that the wave fully resets and the enemy laner misses as much as possible.  This is very situational though and you will have to learn when through experience.\n\nOther tips: \n\n* Whenever possible, walk up to the enemy champion during a gank and save your gap-closer for after they use their escape abilities.\n* Watch the enemy laners when they go into lane.  Whichever lane shows up later and/or missing mana will likely indicate which side of the jungle the enemy jungler started on (which is useful for predicting gank paths and for counter-jungling).\n* Watch the minimap to see when and where the enemy goes to ward, which laners are pushing, which laners are vulnerable\n* Know, roughly, how most laning matchups go so that you can prioritize which lanes are the easiest to gank or require an early gank to decide the matchup.\n* If you have blown an enemy's Flash during a gank but haven't killed them, swing back around immediately after an gank them again.  Many people don't expect it\n* If you've killed an enemy during a previous gank in top lane, kill them again immediately after they return to lane.  They likely won't have wards up yet and a second back-to-back death can be enough to completely crush any chance that opponent has to recover the lane.\n* Top laners rarely bother warding the lane bushes.  As such, lane ganks can be quite surprising and effective.\n* When you kill an enemy laner, shove the minion wave into the tower so they miss gold and experience and so that the minion wave will reset to the middle of the lane.  If you can get away with it, clear the upcoming minion wave as well to ensure the reset and maximum missed minions.\n\nYou will learn a lot through experience, but these tips should help you at the start.","replies":[{"poster":"Romtheguy","date":"2016-11-26T03:34:30.583+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a very good list of tips, actually!

You're so great and so kind! Thank you SO SO SO much for taking the time to write this! I will constantly be referring to this from now on. You've no clue how much this helps me. Love you long time, hehe.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2016-11-26T18:29:04.452+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play fill, and am focusing more and more on jungle recently. I started out playing a lot of support, though, so I can see where you're coming from.\n\nJust to add onto that list, here are some tips/concepts that help me:\n\n1. Limit what you're focusing on so you're not overwhelmed:\n * Pick simple champions if you're just starting out. Jungle is very cerebral, and it becomes even more difficult if you're trying to manage comboing your spells correctly on Lee Sin/Nidalee/Rengar, etc. Playing a simple champion allows you to focus on the map and less on mechanics, etc. Warwick is the default beginner jungler; his innate sustain helps him clear without dying and his ult is basically a timer of when you want to gank. Plus he's incredibly mechanically simple. I mostly play Shyvana, Rammus, and sometimes Vi; other good options are Amumu, Trundle, Volibear, Skarner, Eve, Sejuani, Maokai, Zac, etc.\n * On a similar note, pick 1-2 champions to really learn. You want your mechanics and clear to be second nature so you can focus on the minimap/switch focus constantly; basically good junglers are almost never looking at their character, especially when farming. This is a good tip in general, but more important for junglers for the aforementioned reasons.\n2. Shift focus from supporting your team to trying to win\n * This is true for playing support as well; I'm sure you've met ADCs where no amount of babysitting will ever help them. What you do is mute them and go put your effort towards what will actually help your team win, ie. gank mid lane, ruin the game for their jungler, etc. Same is true for jungling; if you spend all your time focusing on a lane that's just going to start losing again as soon as you leave, you're wasting your effort and could be helping a teammate that will actually carry. This being said, there are some instances where you can't leave a laner alone, for example if the enemy laner is getting dangerously fed and will just steamroll the game. Going there and feeding two kills instead of one isn't going to help, but you can relieve some pressure and stop the bleeding in some other ways, such as just showing up and forcing them back, poking them down, or getting another teammate unreasonably fed so they take over the game faster/shutting down everyone else on their team so it'll be 1v5.\n * Keep in mind that you too need farm and, depending on your champion, can take over a game. It isn't your job to save your teammates from themselves; do what you need to do to win the game. If that means AFK farming on Yi for 30 minutes and then killing everything on the map, do so. Now, that doesn't give you an excuse to ignore your teammates; if you're just AFK farming and the enemy jungler gets their team so far ahead, no amount of farm will save you. This gets into the nuance of decisionmaking that is core to jungling, but the bottom line is to shift mindsets from \"I need to help out [laner]\" to \"ganking/farming here and now will better enable me to win the game.\"\n * To add to that, think of ganks as icing on the cake; farm is where you get a stable income. At really high levels it may be easier to rely on your teammates, but if you spend a lot of time sitting in a bush waiting for a perfect gank, you and your teammate might still end up behind even if the gank is successful. Clear camps whenever you're on the way from one place or another, whenever you're waiting on teammates to get into position, etc.\n3. Be efficient with your time. This folds into a lot of the other points\n * There are a lot of small tips here, such as preparing your back animation and canceling it if you're really waiting for a gank, aforementioned clearing camps on your way to other things, planning your jungle routes based on being able to clear as many camps as possible as you move from one place to another/try to avoid doubling back across dead camps, and so on.\n * Be decisive yet flexible. Stick to your plan; of course you want to adjust as necessary, but don't just drop everything as soon as one lane starts spam pinging you. Similarly, commit to your ganks, but adjust your goals as necessary, don't tunnel on getting a certain kill or any kill if it's no longer feasible. Basically, if you're ganking bot, don't tunnel on the ADC under turret if the support is a free kill, and vice versa.\n * Knowing your laner's matchups help prioritize; for example, if your mid is Vladmir vs. LeBlanc, and you're playing Nunu, you're going to have a really tough time ganking that lane, so you can shift your goal to getting other lanes ahead, or by simply relieving pressure from mid lane instead of trying to get a kill and letting Vladmir outscale, throwing a wrench in LeBlanc's roams, and otherwise being an annoying yeti rider as Rito intended. That being said, know when you have openings to gank, such as when the enemy is really far pushed in, when the enemy's cooldowns are down, etc. This is where the next point is crucial\n4. Map awareness\n * This is the core of jungling, and why playing easy champions really helps. Playing support really helps since you have a better sense of vision and map control than most other laners; it's just about applying this to the map.\n * Get into the enemy jungler's head. Think about what they're trying to accomplish, how the map looks from their perspective, and what you would do in their situation, and how best to counter that. If your laner is really pushed up, you can hang out near them and look to countergank. If you see them walk into the jungle at low health, they might be trying to clear one more camp before backing, so you can invade, kill them quickly, and leave before the enemy can react. This is more advanced, but something to think about as you get comfortable with the basics.\n * Vision control helps; again, you're used to this from playing support, but an advanced tip is to use indirect or non-information as information. Basically, if you ward the enemy's bot side and don't see them, there's a chance they're on top side. If you invade and see that a camp is dead, you know that they were recently there and can begin to piece together their jungle route and predict where they're going next. \n\nBasically, you have a lot of freedom as a jungler, and jungling effectively is about narrowing that freedom down to specific goals and following through. Take things step by step, evaluate your own plays and decisions and learn from them.\n\nI also recommend Nightblue3; his stream is a bit heavy on the memes lately (you can try looking up games from past seasons/his guides on youtube if you want), but he still provides some pretty good insight. Lastshadow9 (or LS) is a coach/analyst and provides a more holistic approach to the game and to jungling (keep in mind he can be a bit extreme, don't take him completely literally; he uses extreme language to get his point across, but getting down the concepts about how he approaches the game really helps)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FlashnFuse","date":"2016-11-26T01:13:06.375+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you learn the general jungle path it gets much easier to spend your focus on enemies and allies.
