I started playing League a few years ago, but I ended up leaving the game briefly after I began because I was flamed too often for \"sucking\" or \"feeding.\" I've been back for not even a month, and I've experienced this tenfold. I already want to quit again, and I hate it because I absolutely enjoy the gameplay. I've been told to kill myself, commit suicide, uninstall League, never play said champ again, and endless colorful insults that I wish to not think about.\r\n\r\nI've had two or three games (one of which happened today) so far this past month (which is the amount of time I've been back) where the abuse was so bad to the point where I actually cried. I was trying out Syndra today in a non-ranked game, and I was laning against someone who clearly REALLY knew how to play Yasuo (quite aggressively at that). I attempted to play passively and farm under turret. The guy doesn't care and still dives. Ended up dying a few times and then was focused by the enemy jungler and mid laner because I was so far behind. I made it clear as day to my teammates that I was learning the champ. I also explained that I'd practiced the champ in bot games, read guides, and wanted to try her out in PVP. But this didn't stop people from acting like complete jerks. I was bashed so often and so early to the point where I was considering leaving the game, because at that point, I would have rather been reported and banned for leaving the game than be bullied anymore. I didn't discover the mute button until after that game, but that's beside the point.\r\n\r\nI do everything I know to do deal with toxicity — report, (now) mute, not adding fuel to the fire, taking breaks, finding other games, or all of those. I don't know how exactly how many players I've reported for bad behavior — maybe ~50 so far. Only 2 have been banned.\r\n\r\nI am aggravated. And sick of this. I don't know how else to deal with it, other than what I'm doing now.\r\n\r\nSide note: I do not play ranked games.","replies":[{"poster":"SeekerofSilence","date":"2016-08-02T01:08:27.043+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":1,"body":"My sister recently started the game and is experiencing some harassment also.

While there is nothing wrong with that, most people won't really mind that and it won't dissuade those who want to be jerks.\n--------------------\nSecond, you should know that the notification that a player you have reported has been punished will only occur if your report was the final one to trigger the punishment.  If they were punished the game after the one they played with you due to another report, you won't get that notification.\n\nIn addition, the system generally looks for patterns of behaviour.  They will likely not be punished if that were a sole or very rare occurrence, but reports will accumulate until they are punished if they continue.\n----------------------\nThird, standard procedure when dealing with harassment is generally:\n\n1. Mute (to spare yourself)\n2. Report (to spare others)\n3.

Snowballing for example, or the fact that last hitting monsters and champions gives you a big extra bonus (a feature traditionally abused by griefers in MMOs and hence uncommon in MMOs today), also the concept of 'meta' and its encouragement or enforcement by the developer which leads to people feeling justified to attack others for not playing the game \"right\" (because there is perceived to be a \"right\" way that people are supposed to play, even if every individual has a different idea about what exactly that is). This game is filled with mechanics that may as well have been designed to frustrate people and make them rage.\n\nObviously the game is also a lot of fun in various ways, otherwise people wouldn't play it. But those dynamics (frustrating + genuinely fun) are a toxic combo in themselves, because people get doubly raged when they are trying to have fun and expecting fun and then find their quest for fun frustrated and unsuccessful.\n\nI just don't buy that somehow this game is a magnet for bad apples. Mechanics within the game itself are what drives the pervasive toxicity.\n\nImagine if champions and teams didn't snowball hard, for example. Would that make pro matches more or less interesting? I'm pretty sure it would make them more interesting, because there would be a lot more opportunities for players to outplay each other and show what they are really capable of, rather than who can get ahead first and then they have a huge advantage with every exchange being unequal and requiring a big mistake for someone to lose once they are ahead. Because of the snowball factor, mistakes in LoL have a huge consequence, which creates an uptight, passive-aggressive style of play and basically encourages negative emotions all around.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TASTE MY DUST","date":"2016-08-03T04:25:47.833+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"just keep playing.  some of the stuff people said bothered me at first, but you get used to it pretty fast.  now it just makes me laugh if anything.\n\nthese days i wouldnt feel right if i didnt get cancer wished on my entire family at least once a week.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GeneralAkiz","date":"2016-08-03T04:22:27.267+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can drag chat off the screen mate,or just reduce the scale to very small.It's not that bad once you get used to focus on game and ignore toxic ppl.I used to feel bad too,but now i laugh when i see someone salty spamming in chat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joker775","date":"2016-08-03T00:26:52.249+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I HATE the community here.I am always the person mute reporting or trying to stop a fight b4 it starts.If you want someone to play with that's nice I don't mind doing a few games.

If you are getting flamed because you're playing poorly, why not mute?  Also, I am assuming you are younger since if getting flamed in an online video game is enough to break you and make you cry, I have some bad news for you about real life.  I would almost suggest that you actually keep getting exposed to this kind of abuse because hopefully it will toughen you up.\n\nWhy?  Because life.  Lifes.  Not.  Fair.  Read that again, make it your mantra, and embrace it.  Your entire life you will be put into situations where you will be given the short stick, or get blamed for something, or somebody is going to be a dick.  And guess what?  Crying when exposed to these things isn't a reaction that is going to help you come out on top.  \n\nI'm not saying that the people who acted like this in game are right; in fact, quite the opposite.  I don't believe that anybody should have to be exposed to this type of stuff.  But again, Riot gives you a way of dealing with it with a mute button.  Stop looking for places where you can be cared about and given a \"safe space\" and start developing resiliency and the ability to solve your own problems.

Sadly some find it more enjoyable to put down others however.\n\nBut the best way to avoid these kinds of people is to play with friends, or even friendly chaps you meet in game, (made some real life connections with people that I met originally from this game in fact). I very rarely play this game alone now because it's just much more fun with friends.\n\nFeel free to add me if anybody is looking for someone  to play with, more than happy to kick it with some chill folk :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aids cuz League","date":"2016-08-02T03:19:26.888+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"No but seriously, if this game is making you cry, take a break and play an MMO or something. Something that doesn't heavily involve PvP. This game makes me so mad that I want to cry so I go to play Tera/Archeage etc,. It's much less stress relieving cause this game never gets better. The people don't want to improve, they don't want to take criticism, they just want to play it like they don't have a team. And ultimately, that is what causes all the toxicity, trolls are something else that's just them being d**ks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-08-01T23:58:14.984+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"that is horrible and no one deserves that kind of harassment. people need to stop being jerks. its a video game people, get over it. every one plays bad. every one goes through learning curves on new champs. this a game to be enjoyed and have fun with. that is the purpose of the game. the fact that you are in a normal game makes it worst. im sorry you have dealt with this. i have came across this just as many others and in the situations where i deal with it , i just either afk in base, dont care if im reported because i refuse to play with people like that. or i afk farm til end of game. i wont feed. but i wont play with team. i know these suggestions dont fix the problem of the toxicity. its just a guess a way to cope.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shima Luan","date":"2016-08-06T07:15:37.896+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's summer time all the kids arent in school yet wait for school to start and play in the moring or at night mid day is when the kiddies come out to play.","replies":[]}]}
