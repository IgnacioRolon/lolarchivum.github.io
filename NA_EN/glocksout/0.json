It is hard to say whether this is some sort of connection issue or a hardware/software display issue where your computer simply isn't able to render Champion Select properly.  Given that a connection issue is much more common, I would like this rule this out first as a possible root cause.  To that end, make sure to complete all of the steps found in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).  There are a lot of steps there, but they are all crucial in hopefully resolving this issue and keep you connected to our PvP.net Servers (the client).\n\nLet me know if nothing seems to help!","replies":[]}]}
