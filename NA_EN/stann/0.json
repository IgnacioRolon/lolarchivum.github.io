Most of the time my FPS is around 100-180, but very frequently is drops to around 5-15 for a few seconds.\r\nMy guess is that this is some settings issue from my laptop. Is there anyone who knows what I can do to prevent this from happening? \r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nStann","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-24T03:19:35.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it's really random like that, I'm actually curious if it's a specific game file or something causing it. Try running a quick repair and test it in a custom game. Also be sure to check for any possible driver updates since you mentioned it being a new laptop.\n\nLet me know if drivers and a repair aren't helping, still a couple other steps we could try.","replies":[{"poster":"Stann","date":"2018-01-24T16:23:34.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, \n\nI tried both but it has not changed anything for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-24T21:25:33.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try checking for any possible DirectX drivers as well, and check to make sure the Game DVR Bar is turned off too. On that note, go ahead and make sure any overlays from things like Discord or other programs like Razr Synapse are turned off as well. If that's not helping our techs might need to take a much closer look for you in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"OrangUtanKÅ‚aus","date":"2018-02-06T22:24:59.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you fix the problem?
