Mouse right click works intermittently","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I've had this problem for about a year now, put it off and been using backup mice... but enough is enough! I want to play on my Corsair Raptor m40 because it has a smoothness only Tony Bennett would wink at.\r\n\r\nSo here it is.. the mouse works perfectly fine in all areas (the ones that a functioning mouse could ask for) besides the right click! It will function about 50-85% of the time, meaning that occasionally the action will not register. I have tried multiple diagnosis' to only have my hopes fizzle out.  So I came to here.. to see if any of the bright minded could perhaps lean in.. yes. \r\n\r\nI had tried reinstalling the mouse driver and turning off the 3rd party bystanders. Angled the possibility of the OS being faulty, but I kinda doubt it since the other mice don't appear to be having the problem. But, in the very least I've spent hours reading forums. This one may not have the answer but HEY, let's give it a shot!","replies":[{"poster":"nRaidBossNasus","date":"2017-05-16T04:45:36.763+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have problems right-clicking only in League, or in other games too?","replies":[{"poster":"Skoon","date":"2017-05-17T01:53:35.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it has the problem in other games too, I tried it on a different computer with Windows 7 OS (just clicking around on the desktop and in the internet browser) and yet no dice.

Are you able to swap with another mouse just to rule out that possibility?  In the meantime, your config could be acting up to and just not responding to your input properly.  I suggest a config reset to otherwise fix this up.\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nLet me know if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Skoon","date":"2017-05-17T02:02:16.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried it out for a look-see and the mouse is still having the problem :P what bugs me is that it partially functions so I mean it probably needs to be reimbursed","replies":[]}]}]}
