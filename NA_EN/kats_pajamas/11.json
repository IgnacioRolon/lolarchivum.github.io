I smart. Told u god real. me able 2 book read means god reel.\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly, I can't wait for the iBible, so it will be easier to lead you people into the concentration camps.\r\nThat and you won't have to carry a whole book of useless quotes for like 20 good ones.\r\n\r\ntl;dr\r\nThe subject is anyone who posts some insane scripture/passage/gospel/chronicle as a 'real' response as evidence for the existence of god should be exterminated.\r\n\r\nFirst off, what you're quoting was not written by god, so you're wasting air thinking you need to repeat it. If I believed even for 2 seconds that god was real, I STILL wouldn't GIVE A FK about what ANOTHER MAN has to say about life. I'm going to do what I know is right and wrong in my heart, and God and I will hash out the details when I get there.","replies":[]}
