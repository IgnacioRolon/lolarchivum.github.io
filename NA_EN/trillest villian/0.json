Ultimately, each player is responsible for their own account and the actions taken on that account. We provide a password and username to each player in order to help maintain security, but if you chose to share these credentials with another person, there isn't anything further we can do, and you are still responsible for their actions on your account.\n\nSadly, I cannot remove this suspension due to the hate-speech observed.\n\nI'm sorry our journey with your account had to end like this, but this is our final word on the matter.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nBorrower\nRiot Games Player Support\n\n\"To heal and protect\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Trillest Villian","date":"2017-06-19T12:57:14.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIOT also unbanned Summoner Jensen so can i please be unbanned , RIOTPhreak even said \"we do eventually unban perma banned players \" please unban me it wasnt even me it was my little brother!!!! its not like im Tyler1 or Gore , so please helpme!","replies":[{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2017-06-19T16:57:11.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jensen got banned from proplay.
