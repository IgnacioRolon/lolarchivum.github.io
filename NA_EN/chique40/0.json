I know they patch him recently, but it was useless. HE DEAL NO DAMAGE. His E need to deal more damage, like 200 magic damage. For his Q, put more damage. Like 150 (+60% of AD). Same thing  for the bonus of magic damage after casting his Q. Put it at 100 magic damage. His ult should stun for 2 second and have like 500 range. The passive is good but it shouldn't deal damage. It could a stun of 1,25 second and he. after, cannot aplly Crystallizing Sting Crystal Venom for 3 second. He also need more mana.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-01-26T20:07:55.815+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He need new mechanics his kit It's boring actually and his E feels very useless with and very easy dodgeable skillshot and non damage\n\nNow my thougths:\n\nW:\n\nSHIELD: 80 / 135 / 190 / 245 / 300 (+ 80% AP) to 60/70/80/90/100 (+ 8/9/10/11/12% of  Skarner's TOTAL Health)** and 15% of tenacity during the shield.**\n\nBase shield value lowered to 60/70/80/90/100 from 80/135/190/245/300\n\nShield now scales on 8/9/10/11/12% of Skarner's TOTAL Health from 80% of his AP.\n\nSkarner now is more oriented to the tank side (after the 2nd rework), and are a very few items that he builds with ap (ICB, Trinity and maybe Abyssal Scepter). So that 80% AP is very useless. I mean he need some reward to build tanky like Sejuani or Nautilus and that \"TOTAL Health\" is the thing that Skarner need in his kit. A huge shield that make him feel like a fast-truck. You are the responsable on the Skarner rework so please change his \"magic\" Shield into a very powerful \"solid\" shield. IMO has more sense the TOTAL Health scaling instead the AP...\n\n\nE.

The damage of his E does not exist. I'll prefer  make a completly new E like the previously showed, It's very fustrating see that ridiculous damage, is like \"nothing\"..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jenova Synthesis","date":"2015-01-11T21:47:12.393+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I personally think Skarner is perfect how he is.
