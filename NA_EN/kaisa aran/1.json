Making the map larger, ditching the &#039;one and a half lane&#039; bullshit &amp; slowing down the game pace slightly would do wonders.\n\nThere&#039;s been a lot of talk and feedback going towards Nexus Blitz recently but I want to take a moment to address my biggest concern with the map: It&#039;s treatment of fighters/brusiers. I&#039;ve already told Riot about this multiple times (including in a survey) but I&#039;ll explain it here just so it can get more coverage and so people can get a better idea of why some toplane players could be complaining. \n\n-----\n\n**Why are Brusiers/Fighters weak?**\n\n**Their inability to duel &amp; split-push.** Without cutting corners the current Nexus Blitz is without a doubt (excluding Howling Abyss) THE WORST MAP that a fighter could ever ask for. The &quot;1 1/2&quot; lane concept fucks over early-game by 1v1s constantly being be turned into 1v2s/1v3s (because let&#039;s make everything cramped and not give laners room, right?), grouping for turrets is essentially mandatory outside of the first two outers &amp; events like Bardle Royale, Push The Cart. King of the Hill &amp; Loot Teemo force even further grouping. See where I&#039;m getting at? **Brusiers (for the most part) are not designed for teamfighting, they&#039;re designed to be in a side lane dueling another top laner or split-pushing. Forcing them into extremely early skirmishes, 1v2 lanes &amp; continuous grouping puts them at a huge disadvantage.** I mean seriously, how is this even fair? The only brusiers that are currently doing well are either ones that can snowball the game out of control with an early lead (Tryndamere, Lee Sin, Aatrox, Renekton, Patheon etc.) or ones that have immense teamfight potential (Yasuo, Rumble, Gnar). Late game brusiers? They don&#039;t stand a chance unless they ride the snowball wave, you can play Jax/Fiora/Irelia/Garen all you want &amp; it won&#039;t matter because their teamfighting is awful without at least being even. \n\nNow, **Devil&#039;s Advocate:** It&#039;s wrong to generalize all brusiers as doing poorly when some aren&#039;t. In addition you can argue that mid-game skirmishes are extremely good opportunities for brusiers &amp; that if they can&#039;t capitalize on those before later teamfights occur then that&#039;s the fault of the player. That&#039;s fair. **However, just because fighters CAN be made to work in Nexus Blitz doesn&#039;t mean that it&#039;s fun compared to Summoners Rift or Twisted Treeline.** Not going to lie - I&#039;m around 50 games in on Nexus Blitz now (all of them on Irelia) and it&#039;s a pain in the ass to constantly be stuck in a 1v2/2v3 laning phase because people other than my main laner are always, ALWAYS coming in and out of the &#039;lane&#039;. All I want is to be able to have a better opportunity to do my job &amp; solo carry through map pressure, not through forced fights to win the game before the enemy Veigar gets 1k AP at 10 minutes because yes, increasing his passive scaling was _totally_ a good idea. \n\n**In other words...Fighters can&#039;t be played properly in this mode due to the small map size &amp; &#039;meshed&#039; lanes which makes them weaker &amp; less enjoyable to play (at least from my viewpoint). **\n\n-----\n\n**How can Brusiers/Fighters be FIXED?**\n\nSimple - MAKE THE BLOODY MAP BIGGER. I&#039;ve been monitoring feedback in the [official Dev Corner thread on Nexus Blitz testing](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/A6uAU8Yl-nexus-blitz-week-1-feedback-and-patch-notes) &amp; a lot of the comments I&#039;ve seen more or less want an increase in map size. It&#039;s cramped and it feels forced, especially to a fighter who doesn&#039;t want that type of map layout in the first place (though you&#039;ll bet your ass early game junglers do - hence why Lee Sin is doing well & why Rengar is having a ball abusing the sheer amount of brush this map has). Pull a Twisted Treeline, separate the mid/botlane or redesign the map entirely so that it&#039;s far more like TTT in its layout (jungle/objectives in the middle, lanes on the far top/bot sides). \n\nIn addition to this it would help if:\n1. Game tempo was slowed down (Why does it even do Sudden Death at 18 minutes, what clever soul thought that _wouldn&#039;t_ trigger my OCD? 20 minutes. 20, not 18. 20.)\n2. Catapult of Champions was nerfed (Because it makes getting around the map way, WAY too easy and the last thing a Fighter needs is for people to be catapulting onto them all the live long day). \n3. Event rewards &amp; Hand of Baron (Rift Herald) were nerfed - Teamfighting &amp; objectives are already strong enough, no need to screw over fighters by having their split-pushing be worthless when a Snowball Fight leads to the enemy team getting 1.2 HP BF Shields. :) \n4. Certain ranged champions were nerfed - In particular Veigar (Revert the buff to his passive scaling, he was fine in ARAM &amp; now he&#039;s broken in NB), Ziggs (turret siege/early lane dominance way too strong), Karthus (Dominates King of the Hill, Bardle Royale and any skirmish that happens in a tight area - which Nexus Blitz has plenty of), Xerath (because he has a mana-based passive for a reason &amp; it&#039;s being negated by the global mana regen aura) &amp; more. \n\nAnd more. \n\n----\n\nThat&#039;s about it. Not a Gameplay+ tier post because it has some (much needed) venting but to be honest I can&#039;t help it after playing this mode for 50+ games. It&#039;s seriously imbalanced in terms of teamfighting necessity versus map awareness and in particular the inability of fighters to do what makes them strong &amp; fun in the first place really drains the experience at least in my case. So please - think of the toplane players who would prefer not to have to go a tank all the time just to be relevant. Improve the map design, make it more spread out &amp; slow the game pace/nerf poke champs while you&#039;re at it. It&#039;ll do wonders, I promise.\n\n**Side Note:** I absolutely hate Snowball Fight currently, not because it&#039;s annoying and it feels like shit to be hit but because it takes up _both_ of your summoner spells. Like seriously what the fuck, either put it in ONE or PUT IT IN THE TRINKET SLOT INSTEAD!","replies":[{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2018-08-18T07:00:27.423+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed that fighters might need some help.

Or tried to use heal reflexively only to realize it's not there anymore? Using summoners is so ingrained into how we play and make decisions that having them replaced by snowballs will never not feel bad. It's the same reason people still accidentally use rift herald when trying to ward.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leto GT","date":"2018-08-18T14:30:37.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish the snowball range would be decreased to be kept vision.

Yasuo for example is doing fine as far as I'm aware, it should be more of the way you helped Tryndamere than it is 'buff all fighters with boosted item stats' if you see what I mean. \n\n> While we're unlikely to increase the size of the map (we like that players are forced together and fight as group of 2, 3, or 5), or slow down the game (we think one of the reasons to play Nexus Blitz in the first place is how fast it is), we have been thinking about other ways to help out duelist champions.\n\nI'd comment more on the map size & game pacing but you've already addressed that and all I can really say is that I hope more people standing up for a larger, slightly slower pace map changes your stance in the future. \n\n> Some of the things we're going to try for 8.17 are adding an early game mini objective to bottom lane that's easier to take with a single person. We're also trying to get a couple new events in that are **more advantageous for lonewolf champs** (one of which is SUPER SUPER FUN).\n\nGreen buff is interesting (and I like that it can be solo'd easier). My only concern is that right now it's basically a copy of blue buff, is it intended to be something different? If you want it to be good for champs that are looking to solo clear it (especially Fighters) then you'd probably want to make it like Elixir of Iron (Tenacity, Bonus HP, Increased champ size etc). Fighters would definitely benefit from having that type of buff.\n\nCan't comment on new events because I have yet to see them - I'll stay tuned on that. \n\n> Longer term we may also need to look at melee starting items to make laning a bit easier for a number of melee champs.\n\nI don't think this is too necessary. In terms of Irelia she can easily get by with Corrupting Potion (though being forced into 1v2s/1v3s makes it harder to get in short trades with the DoT). The enhanced versions of Dorans Blade/Dorans Shield work fine as well. All I would want in this aspect is POTENTIALLY for Corrupting Pot's damage over time to be slightly buffed for melee champs but again, I don't think laning is the problem - having to deal with 3 people in your lane (meaning you lose almost all early on duel potential to snowball with) is. By buffing starting items you help some Fighters that are already fine (Yasuo) & that'll just lead to them being more dominant.\n\n\n> On the bright side, when I say that fighters \"might need some help\", it doesn't mean they're terrible. Our internal data is showing many of them to be hovering around 48-50% winrates, so they're not totally left out to dry compared to other maps like ARAM where some of them get down to sub 40%.\n\nI need to think on this more but the one thing I'm sure of currently is that Brusiers get punished way too hard for trying to front-line or engage in a fight. I can R-Q-Q-Q-W as Irelia and I'll still get annihilated by the sheer amount of damage that's coming my way. Alternatively if I try to go for a prime target (say the main carry) the map is so small and cramped that it'll be extremely easy for the enemy team to turn around and go onto me since things aren't nearly as spaced out.  \n\nThe solution? I'm not sure, but as always I'm up for better rewarding champs who can hit their skillshots (_cough _ Irelia stun duration increase per rank w/ mana cost/cooldown nerf to compensate _cough_ ). \n\nThanks for your response (and I'll take the snowball tips even if I still dislike the mode).\n\n-----\n\n**Side note:** _Oh no_ my personal patch notes slipped, what a disaster oh god it's everywhere take a look:\n\n**Irelia:**\n\nFlawless Duet (E): \n\n* Mana cost increased from 50 to 70 at all ranks.\n\n* Initial blade duration (time to set up a stun) decreased from 3.5 seconds to 3 seconds at all ranks. \n\n* Stun duration increased to 0.8/0.85/0.9/0.5/1 seconds from 0.75 seconds at all ranks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Warmanreaper","date":"2018-08-18T04:01:01.535+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShinodaChan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lzaQf6TY,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-08-18T03:56:59.785+0000)\n>\n> **tl;dr:** Fighters aren&amp;#039;t strong or fun to play in Nexus Blitz because they rarely get the opportunity to do their primary job (Splitpushing/Dueling).
