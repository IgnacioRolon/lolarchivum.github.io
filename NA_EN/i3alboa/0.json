I updated my build of Windows last night/this morning. After punching my creds into the launcher, I got the \"unable to login, check the servers or troubleshoot\" spiel. I went thru the recommended troubleshooting steps from the provided link, then also a support thread called \"Troubleshooting connection\" or something like that. No dice. The only way I was able to fix this was rolling back to the previous build of windows 10. You can do that in the windows update window.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-01T21:12:54.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weeeeeiiiiiiird!
