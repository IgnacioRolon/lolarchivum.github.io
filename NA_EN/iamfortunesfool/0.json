Two of the people that reported me were a duo, our jungler died early and blamed me, our top lane blamed our jungler all game, until the very end and just said &quot;report teemo&quot;\r\n\r\ni finished this game 0/1, it was like a 20 min game where they were calling FF at 5 mins. we lost bot tower 10 minutes in, my team sat mid and died in team fights that were unwinnable.  i took objectives and pushed waves.\r\n\r\nhonestly, Riot Staff, post the team chat of this game.

Reports only flag the game for review, and if nothing of guilt is found then the report is deemed false and it along with the game is thrown out. From [Riot Tantram](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/H67KxUT6-about-chat-restriction?comment=000000000002): \n\n> Actually, Erdrik is correct here.\n\n> A report flags a game for review. They do not establish guilt. The game is then reviewed for harassment, feeding, etc. This is why &#039;troll reporting&#039; or &#039;gang reporting&#039; do not work. False or inaccurate reports are thrown out.\n\n> You cannot ever be punished for saying nothing .. unless of course it&#039;s for something gameplay related like feeding, afking or cheating. But, you can never be punished for offensive language, hate speech or verbal abuse if you said nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"iAmFortunesFool","date":"2017-02-21T19:48:49.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wasn't intentionally feeding, I wasn't cheating, I wasn't afk.

Everyone has their own Reform Cards showing their own chat if they get punished, but making the Reform Cards be this way forces the receiver to focus on and look at their own behavior and not look for ways to try to blame it on others.\n\n> and to be honest, i wasn&#x27;t even engaging in chat with my team.  that was the other team asking me what was happening, and telling my team it was their fault the game was snowballing and that i was playing fine.  something else the entire chat log would show, which they don&#x27;t include.\n\nYes it's true that Reform Cards only show the in-game chat, but there are other ways to be punished without ever using the in-game chat: \n\n* Griefing/gameplay trolling.\n* Intentionally leaving/afking (this includes random useless movements and afk farming as well).\n* Poor behavior in the pre- and/or post-game lobby chat.\n* Using illegal third-party software unauthorized by Riot.\n* Sharing, purchasing and/or selling accounts.\n* Elo boostning.\n\nThere are others but basically aside from the last three doing anything that you know will just serve to tick other people off can get you punished. If you want more info or would just simply like to contest your ban then just file a Support Ticket about it with as much information as possible.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SavageConcordia","date":"2017-02-21T18:52:00.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He did it one game on {{champion:240}} too  \nEdit: He just afk farms every game, even when he has kills he is afk farming","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iAmFortunesFool","date":"2017-02-21T19:01:18.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't at all leave my team to 4v5 and expect to be carried.  but if we're losing, I think it's smarter to farm up, than it is to group against a stronger team.  if my team continually forces bad fights, or doesn't ward and gets engaged, etc, all things we know that happen in games, I shouldn't get called a douche bag for wanting to farm up and get some items.","replies":[{"poster":"SavageConcordia","date":"2017-02-21T19:12:34.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only in 1 of your last 10 games did you not deal the least damage on your team.
