He tried to update league, but every time he opens up the client his entire computer freezes without an error and automatically restarts the computer.\n\nThings he has done\n\n* He tried uninstalling league of legends and he also experiences the same freezing and restarting.\n* He tried re-downloading the installer, still crashes\n* He tried Scanned computer/CCleaner\n* He tried updating drivers (Graphics Card) still nothing\n\nHe said this problem only occurs when launching league of legends and any other application/game is fine, and that also before the windows 10 update, league of legends runs perfectly fine.\n\nMy friend did not want to send a support ticket, but I still want to help him. Any ideas/fix we can try?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-11T15:29:19.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're currently looking into reports about the recent Windows 10 update possibly having issues with the client.
