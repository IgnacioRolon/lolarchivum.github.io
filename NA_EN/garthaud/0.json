We don't store total playtime as a piece of data, but it looks like you've got about 3600 total games played. Each game lasts a different amount of time, but you could calculate your own estimation based off the number of games played.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-10-04T03:50:33.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres been [mention](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012640908) of an emote for people with X hours of total game time when preseason hits, are you sure you guys don't have that number tucked away somewhere? Would be kind of hard to give those emotes out if you don't.\n\n>Are there any other rewards for veterans coming this preseason?\n>\nWe're planning to give out exclusive emotes based on how many hours you've put in since the beginning of League. Playing approximately 500 hours gets you the Defender of the League emote, at around 1,500 hours gets you the Champion of the League emote, and 2,500 hours gets you the ultra-rare Conqueror of the League emote. The cutoff for game hours is August 31, 2017.\n\n(I'm also curious as to my games played and/or gametime.)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T21:21:08.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't, but we have a script ready to accurately calculate that data. It's not incredibly hard to figure out, but real talk, but I'm not about to spend hours doing all this math myself when a computer can do it for me xD.\n\nFor a little clarity, when those icons go out you are more than welcome to write in to us asking about it if you know you got the wrong item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DPG Chr√≠sser","date":"2017-10-04T10:07:32.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have actually just created a discussion in general, because it's my first discussion, so I don't know where to post it xD but, I'm curious if co-op and customs (like tournaments) and featured game modes, count as time played, because I would like to have that conquerer of the league emote, because I have been playing so much :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
