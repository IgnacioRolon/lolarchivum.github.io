I can't really say which one but could be a Nocturne. I'd look at which champions are in the game when it happens. It could be from (off the top my head, may be more) Nocturne, Kindred, Illaoi, Sion. If you want to know for sure, check match history and tell me what champs were in a game you know it happened it. I'll tell you which champion, what ability, and how to counter it. Although you can't turn it off, it's meant to disorientate you or alert you.","replies":[{"poster":"Von Everly","date":"2016-08-25T20:47:47.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main Sion so that probably it\nZion Master Yi lulu Ashe Annie Fiddlesticks Orianna Quin miss fortune Yasou","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-08-28T16:24:31.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are coming after you.\n\nRun.\n\n*RUN*","replies":[]},{"poster":"nosafterburn","date":"2016-08-23T03:50:33.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Yorick is coming back; maybe it's his new ghouls taunting and haunting you.","replies":[]}]}
