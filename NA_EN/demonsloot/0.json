You still can play Teemo and Karthus in OFA, sorry to break your dreams.\n2. I don't see why Riot would ban champions on OFA. I admit, Zed is op, Evelynn is op, and Sona is also op, but these are just a few champs that are mostly play on URF.\n\nThere's plenty of champs that are also played than them. So if we follow what you're talking about, they'd ban like almost half of the champion pool.\n\nOh, also, they said that they'd put URF at least TWICE every year. So they'll maybe put URF again.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-08-13T02:22:32.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Edenn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gV3Vsfpm,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-08-13T02:18:38.143+0000)\n>\n> I stopped reading there.\n> \n> 1.

You couldn't pick them to ban, you couldn't pick them to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Tiddy Fox GF","date":"2016-08-13T02:31:43.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-08-13T02:37:24.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Edenn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gV3Vsfpm,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-13T02:31:43.557+0000)\n>\n> Yes I did.\n> \n> What I mean is that if they do that on URF, it&#x27;s half of the champion pool that would be gone.\n\nIt wouldn't be half, there were a very select few that could create majorly unfair advantages, like Riven being untouchable because of her escape being on no cooldown and Evelynn spamming you to death in seconds with Hate Spike. There are a handful of champs that URF truly broke.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Tiddy Fox GF","date":"2016-08-13T02:44:00.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Deleting posts, cuz I didn't notice you put a post there.\nAnyways\n\nOn URF:\n\nZed is op\nEvelynn is op\nSona is op\nThresh is op\nSinged is op\nMundo is op\nKatarina is op\nShaco is op\n\nAnd more champion are op on URF.

I think there should only be a ban phase like every other rotating mode. If people don't want the same champs, then don't play. Additionally, every mode is the same champs, people will always pick the cheese regardless, so maybe no one should play? URF is by far the best, maybe we could do URF AND rotating so everyone is happy. Just stupid as shit to play Dominion so close together when it was so unplayed it was removed from the game all together when it was offered as a full time option.","replies":[{"poster":"suntzu243","date":"2016-08-13T01:40:44.533+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's a fact.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"suntzu243","date":"2016-08-13T01:25:13.230+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Urf lives matter.
