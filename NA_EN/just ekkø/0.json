You can't trade her she is 1 shoting you and have so much AOE damage. She has stun(2x) her R can activate in river and walls (so broken in hte jg) and she is 1 shoting every adc after second or first item i don't know what to say but just remove her or nerf her ty","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-08-26T15:37:55.062+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's not doing that. It's mathematically impossible for her to kill you at that level from full health. \n\nWhat probably happened is she poked you down with her Q level one, you took bad trades while tanking minions, then she all-in'd you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-26T15:34:36.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno.
