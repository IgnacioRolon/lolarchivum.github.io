When the w was no longer active I could attack the inhibitor again.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-16T21:10:29.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThanks for the report! \n\nIn the future, please report PBE bugs on the [PBE boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/dxVMgVoG-pbe-reporting-bugs-that-occur-on-pbe), as it helps us better keep track of issues occurring on PBE versus live. ^-^","replies":[]}]}
