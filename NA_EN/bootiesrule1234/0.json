Got fed asf? Took the initiative to take objectives and did amazing early-mid game? Well fuck you, because some stupid retard got caught 40 minutes in and now you can&#039;t win 4v5 because this game is fair.\n\nHonestly when I&#039;m 20-1 I should be able to 1v5 the entire enemy team, even if I&#039;m an ADC. I don&#039;t care how butt-hurt it would make everyone, that&#039;s what you get for letting me get fed kek\n\nBut nope, because this is a &quot;team game&quot;, you are constantly at the mercy of your teammates regardless of how well you play. I play an ADC game absolutely amazing, and even though everyone on my team is low they overstay in mid lane next to the enemy bases inhib turrets knowing they can&#039;t take the turret and the enemy team is spawning. Woopsy we fucked up there, looks like that&#039;s free baron. Time to afk in base waiting out that stupid fucking buff. Oh wait, no one on this team has any patience and is gonna try to fight baron. Oh well look at that we got aced what a surprise holy shit GG.\n\nBtw remove baron from the game. You&#039;re gonna tell me in a snowball meta we actually need this middle finger in the top side of the map ready to fuck your team for any mistake they make mid-game (which you have 0 control over)?? Remember when this game came out and playing well actually mattered? I kinda want that back","replies":[]}
