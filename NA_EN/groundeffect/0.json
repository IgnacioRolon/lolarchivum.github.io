At least that&#039;s what parents say. They believe that videogames are something that takes time away from other, \"productive\" things we could be doing. Here&#039;s my side of the story.\n\nI started league back in September 2012. This was the end of season 3. I got hooked on the game immediately, and spammed normal all day to get to level 30. I remember going through Mobafire guides, youtube videos. Anything related to League - I was there. I&#039;d think about league while at school too. Eventually it became to be a bit of a problem. When I was once a straight A student with AP&#039;s and college classes on the side,  I began to fail my classes. I would stay up into the early hours of the morning playing. I then started ranked, and hit bronze 5. I was a typical bronze player, ragey , shitty mechanics, no idea what I was doing. I was addicted to league though. My parents made me stop cold turkey for 4-5 months until I got my shit together. After my hiatus, I came back to league. I still played hard, but made sure my school stuff got done. This is where I began my climb, getting into silver, gold, platinum, diamond.  My parents still thought that League had taken away and wasted a big part of my life. All those nights staying up playing ranked instead of out with friends. I even thought to myself that I had wasted my entire highschool experience. How wrong I was.\n\nOn my EUW account I recently hit Diamond 1, which is a pretty big milestone. Now for lack of time, a lot of this is sped up. It seemed really quick though , right? Bronze 5 to Diamond 1. It took me around 2500 hours of gameplay to get that far. I got into streaming along the way, and started accumulating followers and viewers. I eventually got contacted by boosting companies wanting to hire me, as well as random companies wanting to sponsor me (Eluxy Computers for example). I also heard about League of Legends scholarships, and applied for them. I recently found out I got in, and that I&#039;d be playing for University of Pikeville on a League of Legends scholarship. In my application I put in attention grabbers, avid sponsored streamer , 3rd best vayne NA (statwise), etc. I&#039;m also turning my major (as I&#039;m a college student now) into E-sports management in aims of managing pro teams in the future. \n\nWhy did I post this? And again, I know it seems really sped up. My climb on the solo queue ladder, as well as opportunity wise. It took  a lot of time to get to this point, a lot of time I could have spent having a girlfriend or going out on Fridays. What I&#039;m saying is, League of legends is not just a game. If you put the time in, some of you can make a career out of it. Not everyone&#039;s gonna make it, some just don&#039;t have enough time, some dont have enough potential. But I hope this can inspire you to keep playing and play with a deadest purpose.\n\nEDIT: This was a post I made back in '12 when I was Bronze and ruined my grades, and had all internet usage taken away. Some of you may be in similar situations. http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3470877\n","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-04-03T14:32:51.220+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be honest people are nowadays living in entertainment materials more for a reason.\n\nBecause life is becoming more and more restricting and frankly, boring, making something else more and more appealing.\n\nThese days, if you wanna have fun, good luck getting born in the right place at the right time, otherwise good sodding luck.

However remember people used to be able to do complex calculations and theories with only pens, paper or other simpler tools, you've seen Rome and Pyramids, maps & sailing, the Maxwell, Newton, Gauss etc. Our ancestors competed against megafaunas and survived the ice age. In old times they also studied various interests from diplomatic to strategy, to literature, to history, to martial arts, to medical and applied science just like we do today however their achievements were definitely far greater due to how fast inventions and discoveries progressed and how quick eras passed on one after another.\n\nNowadays in the era where we can literally wipe off a nation from the other side of the globe with a single button press, we can cure diseases and treat severe injuries that were otherwise a death sentence to old timers, we can go anywhere we please within a single day given if we can pay for the traffic, we can also go into space where it's over the Earth's horizon and boundary. But with that much power in hand, why does almost everyone nowadays for their life only accomplish roughly the same as those peasants back in the day who manned the farm land?\n\nThe problem I see is that society is now too needlessly sophisticated and complex, everything has a rule, everything is a boring mini game inside a boring game that you can not quit, pass or win in the way you wish, it's as linear as it goes. while technologies certainly has evolved beyond the imagination of every single person from the old eras, the tools that we can use to our advantage is now used to keep everyone under control, instead of being our swords it is now our leash. More opportunities or not, they are basically the same practically. There is no difference between having no exits or having them but build a wall or toll stop after them.\n\nWe are watched, fed and babysat inside a farm, growing up to be fed to the customers known as economy. The difference is, back in the day the farm was manually watched and was built by wood, while you get butchered quicker you have more space to walk around and you also could certainly make a run for it if you know how. Now the farm is made out of steel, you're fed and watched by high tech robots, and you have less space to walk around in your cage, while you certainly live longer you have nowhere to go, escape is impossible nor would you can or have the will to because you are weighed down by by your own mass after being fed too much steroids forcibly when growing up.\n\nThis is probably not the exact illustration of the idea but I think one should get the point.","replies":[{"poster":"Fosstheboss","date":"2018-01-27T07:55:37.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_**Thank you!**_","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-04-03T12:00:42.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":17,"body":"Please tell me how you got out of Bronze5.

You doing something that you find fun a lot is not an addiction because there is no evidence that you couldn't wish should you stop to enjoy it - sometimes people get bored of what they find fun and just stop playing. Not an addiction.\n\nIt's an addiction when despite no longer getting pleasure from it, you are unable to stop. That is why stuff like the classic \"I'll quit smoking tomorrow\" joke exists - a lot of smokers are entirely aware of the negative impacts of what they do, and get little actual pleasure from their smoking, but continue it because their body cannot handle them stopping. You are not necessarily suffering when addicted, as a smoker may still enjoy their smoking, but when you get to the point where you don't actually like what you're addicted to anymore but can't quit regardless, that's suffering.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2015-04-03T12:50:46.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im pretty sure he means, that addictions are typically things that end up hurting you in some way.

Allow me to give you some advice, free of charge though. Take it as you will.\n\n1. Don't plan on making this a full career. E-sports come and go. It wasn't long ago that SC2 was the hot game to be in. The second LoL slips out of the spotlight, you'll have nothing else. \n\n2. Do NOT go into E-sports management. I've actually talked with my counselor about E-sports. The issue is that being an manager of a gaming team does not look well going into other jobs. People see it as a frivolous thing, as a job with minimal responsibilities. True or not, this is people's perceptions, and it will make a difference. My advice is to go into business management, then branch out from there.\n\n3. More on the personal level here, but just getting a scholarship to a university doesn't mean much. It depends on the scholarship itself, and more importantly, on the university in question. Getting even a partial scholarship to any well known school is infinetly better than getting a full ride through a small no-name private college. Employers aren't going to outright say it, but they're going to be much more inclined to hire a student from a top university than others. \n\n4.

Last year in my last year of middle school, I was gaming all night on League, getting to silver last season. I got all As even though I was wasted.. But when my parents found out they were just angry with me and restricted my computer access by putting passwords...I look up to this post as inspiration...that I will someday be back on the rift with my friends, laughing on skype when we outplay someone or make dumb mistakes. I don't know how I will be able to persuade my parents cause I get good grades but they think the game will destroy my life...I guess I will have to prove to them that I can live my own life while being successful at the same time.
