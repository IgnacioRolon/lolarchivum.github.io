I have tried updating my drivers but it doesn't seem to fix it, and lowering my settings doesn't seem to help either, and I retain good ping and FPS throughout. Is there any solution to the issue shown in the video I linked here?\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-07T23:50:15.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if your network has been having some issues with packet loss which could be causing those strange delays in the fog of war and champion animations delayed. Do me a favor and check for that really quickly by grabbing the network logs from that game if you can and have our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan them. Take a screenshot of what it gives you and post it back here so I can go over it with you.","replies":[{"poster":"Filthy Nathan","date":"2017-11-09T23:05:26.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you see anything?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-10T03:48:41.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry about the long wait on this reply, Preseason blew up the boards and slowed down our responses a bit unfortunately. \n\nYea it looks like there was a pretty bad spike in there that could have been the main problem. Since your ping was pretty stable throughout the match, it's likely this was happening from that packet loss. Essentially, packet loss happens when your connection hits some rough spots on it's way to our servers. If your connection hasn't reached us yet, there's not a lot we can do to help sadly =\\ . \n\nThe good part is that image can be proof that your ISP should look into what's going on. If you need more proof to show them, I'd suggest running a quick traceroute to 104.160.131.1 using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/). I can take a look over that data too to get a better idea, but I would actually suggest hitting up your ISP juuuuust to make sure you cover all your bases.","replies":[{"poster":"Filthy Nathan","date":"2017-11-10T06:35:14.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, thanks for the reply I appreciate your time!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Filthy Nathan","date":"2017-11-08T05:27:02.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://ibb.co/b2ssxb\n\nWasn't sure of the exact game, so I checked a few and this image seems to be pretty common, with the random spikes in packet loss.\nThis is a game from within the past week.","replies":[]}]}]}
