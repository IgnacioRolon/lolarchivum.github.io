The first few times I tried to counter it, I ended up getting hit for the full damage and being silenced. At first I just thought maybe I had missed the activate on it. So I began trying to activate it earlier and earlier trying to get my timing down before realizing that it wasn't me, it was the ability. It wasn't just once, or one in five times, but every single time I used it the full effect of Decisive strike went through to the extent that I could not reactivate counter-strike to stun him because I was silenced. As far as what I have read people have confirmed that Jax should be able to dodge the strike, if I am wrong then this discussion can obviously be disregarded, but until I have somebody else I can fully test it with I don't know if this is an every game problem or if I just somehow went into the game with a one time glitch.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-03-10T00:24:08.499+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeab, that's how it works.
