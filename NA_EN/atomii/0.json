After a while of the loading, a popup comes up that says \"Unable to connect to the server. Please check your internet connection and attempt to reconnect to the game.\" I don't know why, but after I reconnect 1/2/3/4 times, it usually works and I'm able to enter the game.\r\n          BUT sometimes, it doesn't occur and I am able to enter a game fine. Once I was able to play 5 games in a row without the blackscreen, sometimes I'm not able to play any. I don't have it maybe a serious as others, but this is a major inconvenience to League players and is ruining the fun of this game.\r\n\r\nI have tried stopping the IPhelper, disabling my Norton firewall, and mashing the enter/delete/space keys. I'm seriously in a tough situation as it is. Would be delighted for any help.\r\n[RIOT, please help us]","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-09T02:56:56.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Inconsistent connectivity issues can point toward a few different things, typically, either a problem along your network route or an actual problem with your local network settings.
