Also I wouldn't expect Riot to do anything like take Surprise Party Amumu and strip away all the cool particles and leave it a base skin change.

They didn't need to put themselves into such a terrible circumstance to begin with. It's incredibly easy to think of a concept (and colours) that will suit a 750 skin for Syndra with her base spheres. But they didn't. They chose a skin concept that could never NOT clash with her spheres and decided to force it into the 750 RP tier because... why not.\n\nSyndra could get a decent 750 skin. But this is not it. It's just like Marauder Ashe - skin concept for a champion that realistically needs 975 at least (Ashe probably needed 1350 for a voice filter) that's thrown into 750 to look/feel terrible because \"people like cheap skins\". I think Syndra could have a cheap skin and it could be great but it needs to be designed around her spheres not changing colour. The skin team quite clearly made her model this time around with no regard to her spheres, realised it looked awful so added some purple and then threw it out on the PBE hoping for the best.\n\nIt's a mess.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mr SpaceKook","date":"2015-04-30T22:22:09.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I appreciate the responses.

We appreciate the PBE community, as well as players who don't have PBE access, but take a look at 3rd party coverage at the content and leave their thoughts on the live boards. \n\nWe make no promise to change everything that's suggested on the boards.

Will it have new sounds?) When we decide on the scope of the skin, we then allocate resources to it (animators, particle artists). Resources that aren't being allocated to skin A, are then put on other skins (B,C, etc.) This means that if we scope out a skin which we plan to only have a new model/texture, we don't have a particle artist available to create different particles.

It was neither, and it was a perfectly fair question of why the players should spend time and effort on the PBE if feedback of certain categories (seemingly, particles changes, not model/texture changes) will be systematically and routinely ignored because time and resources weren't scheduled to deal with any potential PBE feedback of the sort. It is disingenuous to ask for feedback, without putting up a disclaimer that you are NOT searching for feedback of the types X, Y, and Z, because you don't have resources to change it even if you wanted to.\n\nAnd this is all apart from the fact that Riot has ALWAYS... I cannot emphasize this enough.... ALWAYS been a \"Player-focused\" company that would always say, in response to \"PFE wherE\" threads with \"It will be out when it is ready.\"\n\nThis philosophy of pigeon-holding skins to a specific price tier, to increase the number of champions that have multiple price tier skins, is working against Riot's history of policy. You can't be a player-focused company if you don't act on feedback because of poor scheduling or a disparity of opinion that the 750 skin holds more value than the 975 skin to the community. If you (Riot) believes a 750 skin is worth more, even when almost universal feedback suggests that something as simple as changing the colors of existing particles would make a skin better and more desirable, who is Riot creating content for then?\n\n> \n> PBE is an opportunity for players to get a first hand look at content, try it out, and leave feedback.

I'm sure you've heard them all before from other players, but I'm going to say them again here anyway.\n\nA) \"We only have so many artists\" - This defense is getting stale and honestly quite annoying. I realize it's true, but it's also pretty damn simple to improve. There are thousands of talented aspiring game artists out there who would LOVE the opportunity to work on League of Legends, even at a limited or temporary capacity. Let them do the minor color changes and tweaks that we ask for but you might not have planned to do. That way your main artists can continue to work on the skin pipeline uninterrupted.\n\nB) \"We would have to start testing all over again\" - So? Did we ask you to fix it and still ship it tomorrow? No, not at all. This is the PBE. If you're not willing to delay the things that go out there, then you're not putting the stuff out there soon enough. We're more than willing to test some pretty spectacularly broken stuff for you, and you don't even have to pay us. \n\nC) \"We didn't plan on doing that scope of work on it\" - NO. Unlike the other two, this is not an acceptable excuse AT ALL in my opinion, for a couple reasons. One, you should never plan a skin that changes the core identity of a particle-driven champ and not plan to at least recolor the particles. Marauder Ashe should have had Blackfrost-style or maybe Bloodstone-style arrows. Inquisitor Nautilus should NOT have green nautical particles. Queen of Diamonds Syndra should have particles to match her new identity. We as players would rather spend a bit more on a skin that is actually done right than have a piece of crap shoved down our throats, especially when the idea is so good. \n\nThe other problem I have with this is that you as a company decided, completely without our input, that we players would rather have a cheaper skin than a good one. You made this decision without us at all and then committed so hard to that outcome that when we finally see the result and tell you how incredibly fucking wrong you are, it's too late and we're stuck with crap. That's not a good business model, and it's biting the players and the skin collectors right in the ass pretty frequently lately.\n\nTLDR: These reasons aren't good enough.

In fact, you're not even really speaking to Jacccey's concerns. His complaint is that this particular skin _should never have been 750 in the first place._\n\nLots of skins work great at that tier. In fact, all of the other skins in this set make perfect sense at 750. But not Syndra. I'm not sure you could ever make a 750 Syndra skin that isn't lackluster, because she's so particle-driven. Adding purple to something that shouldn't be purple is not the answer. Giving her matching balls should have been that answer. There used to be a time when Riot would release these sets and there'd almost always be one that was more expensive than the others. I don't know where that Riot went, but they made consistently better skins than the Riot we've got now.\n\nAlso, they should have been diamonds instead of orbs.
