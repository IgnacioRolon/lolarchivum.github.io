Riot really hasn&#039;t made very many mechanically hard juggernaut/tank champions. Most of the really hard champs, Azir, Kalista, etc. are usually in the carry roles, or are carry type top lanes\n\nMost juggernaut champions tend to be brainless hunks of meat that run in and disrupt the enemy team before they die. But it would be kind of interesting to see a tanky champion who actually requires a lot of skill to play.\n\nEDIT: I know a lot of you guys have mentioned champs that take particular skill in certain areas (Energy management, decision making, etc.) What I think the tank class is missing is a champion that has a really high skill cap in terms of simply champion mechanics. No one out there is going to say Shen is harder than Zed, or Tahm Kench is harder than Kalista.\n\nThe only suggestions that I really agree with on the list is probably {{champion:150}}. The others may be hard to master, but not necessarily difficult to play decently well.","replies":[{"poster":"Squidblimp","date":"2015-09-21T02:43:54.655+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:154}} Zac is pretty mechanical dude.\nYou have to land that knockup on as many people as possible, which is actually pretty hard.\nYou have to move around during your ult, making sure to knock people in the CORRECT direction and slow the correct targets.\nYou have to repeatedly pick up your blobs, which is almost like Draven axes but without the time limit, and make sure opponents don't crush them.\nYou have to make sure to use W right when it's up, since the cooldown fluctuates.\nYou have to land your Q to slow as many people as possible.\n\n{{champion:150}} Gnar as well.\nHis rage mechanic is difficult to manage.\nLanding the boomerang over and over is hard, and kiting using your W passive.\nMega Gnar requires clutch ult timing and positioning, and using your W and Q on as many targets as possible, and catching stragglers with Q.","replies":[{"poster":"KarmaWhore","date":"2015-09-21T16:49:59.337+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I brought up Gnar and Reksai as champions for my friend, both of which involve interesting mechanics but are still tanky.

His Q, E and R are fundamentally simple: You attack whatever is directly in front of you / line shot. His W pops in a point blank AoE. That's it.\n\nTake for example Rumble: You have to be mindful of overheating, and your ult requires you to aim your missiles in a spot where you feel the enemy will have no choice but to stand in it for longer than a second, otherwise they won't take much damage from it.\n\nFiora: You have to aim your attacks and lounge at an enemy champion's vital spot, which requires precise positioning. W requires you to predict oncoming attacks (and cc) to be most effective, all while aiming it at the opponent(s) intended direction 0.75 seconds later.\n\nAzir: You have to keep tabs on your soldiers and enemy positions to ensure your Q strikes, and to ensure your E will collide with an enemy - both have high chances of missing as well, but are not simple skill shots like Sion's abilities. His ult makes you decide between juggling enemies against other terrain, comboing with his other abilities to get behind the opponent and shove them into your team/away from their team, or using it simply to peel.\n\nI find Sion's attacks easiest to chain together when unseen from within the brush, after ulting onto someone, or if I have an ally that locks enemies in place first. I only feel smart playing him when I figure out a way to get in position. Otherwise I just ask myself, \"do you see someone you can kill?
