My only point of feedback for you would be to improve the style of the face a bit to make it match the body.  The body is **really **good - I love the detailing!  Making human characters is really hard for me.  I have to turn them to a more chibi style to make them look good.\n\nIf you want to see some of what I've made here are some links. :D\n\nhttps://instagram.com/p/4XgnQMNPFH - Leona \"stained glass\"\nhttps://instagram.com/p/tJ4MBmNPOb - Yasuo\nhttps://instagram.com/p/s9FKDSNPMi - Aang and Katara from Avatar\nhttps://instagram.com/p/rx8lL-tPB6 - WoW Voidwalker, Lulu cupcake, and a poptart\nhttps://instagram.com/p/rlfw39NPG6 - Panda Teemo","replies":[{"poster":"Maratsune","date":"2015-08-11T23:37:13.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"freaking adorable. so bloody adorable.

That was a great catch. \nIf you've done one, then the second one should be slightly easier, no? Experience and such. Also, if you have matching ones then you could hang them up together somewhere pretty! Making stained glass type pieces seems like a lot of fun. I used to do those little kits where you paint over the plastic with translucent paint, but it was hard to make the paint even...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SKrivva","date":"2015-08-11T23:44:56.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback!
