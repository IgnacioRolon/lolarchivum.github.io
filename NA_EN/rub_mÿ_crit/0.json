I don't get the error regularly... just enough for it to have caused me to deal with this issue. Can you please get rid of the penalty somehow? I've now been sitting ehre for 30 minutes and after the repair, it will have taken me an entire hour just to get into a game after being penalized for something i didn't even do nor had ANY control over.
