It sounds like your network is specifically having problems connecting to the game server.  I recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this and find what's causing that block.  That should get you fixed up, but let me know if your issue persists.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkGamingDronze","date":"2016-10-08T20:47:00.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Update**\n\nProblem persists again when i restarted my computer this morning, i guess maybe because of my slow internet or where i am currently (Egypt) Although i usually get 91-134 ms.\n\nThank you for taking the time to comment and help :)\n\nP.S: How about building middle eastern servers (i know that might take a long while but trust me, you will get a fortune out of it as there are many many arabic/middile eastern players)\n\nThanking you once more\n** Dark**","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkGamingDronze","date":"2016-10-08T02:40:31.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Today it suddenly started working perfectly without any problems, I did not do anything specific...
