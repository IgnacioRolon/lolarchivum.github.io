Yasuo doesn&#039;t need 2 new skins before Kled even gets one more. Heck... Lux got 3 New Skins before Shyvana even got one. While Yes im holding out for the year 2024, being the year of the dragon for her to finally get one, Id rather not wait four more years for one. Hell Give Ivern a skin. I dont even play the Freaky bastard, but he needs one... All Im asking is maybe One new skin, for every champion, once every two years. I dont think its that hard, seeing as you release new skins with every patch....","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-19T13:32:21.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is a business.
