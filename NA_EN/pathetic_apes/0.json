May i ask you if the 144hz does have a big difference than 60hz especially in LoL? This is why i haven&#x27;t purchase a monitor yet.\n\nLike the Unicorns said, it makes a massive difference. In any single game that requires a good reaction time for anything, 144hz is 100% better in every scenario. Especially in FPS games, if you play any. The difference between my old monitor (was a 60hz monitor) and my new one (the 144hz monitor) is tremendous when I play Ghost Recon Wildlands, Rainbow Six Siege and CSGO. I would highly recommend going with the 144hz monitor. Doesn't have to be the one I have because of course it is up to the person using it and what they want, but this monitor is excellent for what it costs. If you do decide to get this monitor or one similar, make sure to check and look at what settings the monitor comes with and other customer's reviews because sometimes the monitor will not come with the best picture quality out of the box. For instance the monitor I had needed to be tweaked to have the best picture quality. If you have any more questions, ask away :)","replies":[{"poster":"Pathetic Apes","date":"2018-11-12T23:02:16.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your answer.

I have never used an ultra wide, but I dislike ultra wide monitors so I don't think my opinion matters. If you want to get an ultra wide, go for it, it is your choice. If it helps with League specifically, I am unsure but I wouldn't get one myself, but it is all personal preference. I don't mind answering questions, it makes me feel better knowing people are asking before dropping hundreds of dollars on shit that doesn't match their expectations. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"iPooUnicorns","date":"2018-11-08T14:17:20.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"144 hz makes a huge difference.","replies":[{"poster":"Pathetic Apes","date":"2018-11-08T14:27:07.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that it makes a huge difference but even on LoL though?","replies":[{"poster":"iPooUnicorns","date":"2018-11-08T14:50:45.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, any game where being able to react faster is an advantage makes 144 hz worth it, and League is no exception.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pillar Of SaIt","date":"2018-11-07T22:44:32.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"144","replies":[]}]}
