We tend to not allow naming and shaming on the boards since it opens up players to harassment. Keep this in mind when you post again. Also, make sure to reporting feature after the game ends!\n\nIf you want to talk about the edit, please come visit us in the [boards moderation discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification).
