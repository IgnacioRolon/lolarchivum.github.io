Guys, we've been spoiled. Do you realize how many boards have members of the company that look and comment on the boards nearly EVERY DAY? Next to none would be your answer. Do you know why? Because when people are satisfied they tend to think that nothing else needs to be said, but when people are unsatisfied they raise all sorts of hell. Not many companies have the patience to deal with that! How lucky are we, right? Furthermore, the boards community does not represent the community as a whole! I have many friends that play League and I am the only one who spends time on the boards. I would guesstimate that a small percentage of the community is actually on the boards, not to mention that we are not the only board for this game! Riot has so many other boards to take care of too! \nLastly, I want to point out that people are more inclined to listen to what you are saying  if you are not rude. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if they had a friggin drinking game over how many times Riot is accused of showing favoritism towards a champion. Please, this is not the way to communicate your emotions. Remember, in an argument using \"I\" statements (I.E. \"I feel as if the moveset of Lee Sin makes it comparatively hard for me to jungle effectively with other junglers.\") and not \"You\" statements (I.E. You overloaded Lee Sin's kit to make it completely unfair!\") both statements attempt to communicate the same message but using \"I\" statements make it sound so much less accusatory. Please make an effort to remind yourself that we are one lucky community to have a company that pays as much attention as Riot.\n\nTL; DR: Guys, many gamers would give their left arm to have their game company communicate as much as Riot does, so try to be kind when making a thread.\n\nThanks,\nGigglebytes\n\nEDIT: The drinking game was a joke :p","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Renders","date":"2015-02-10T00:45:21.838+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, let me tell you all how lucky we are to have the support we do from the community.

Not going to name names here, but most game companies don't even know their forums exist, and they ignore support tickets.\n\nMeanwhile, Riot will give free skins to positive players, has instituted a proper ban system, and one of my friends told me Riot coughed up 2 RP when he was at 1298.\n\nRiot gets a lot of flak for balance designs, but, in the end, they probably care about this game more than we do. They at least listen to the community. If it were (again, not naming names) directing League, I don't think they would even bother to listen to the community and respond to suggestions. At least Riot TRIES to rectify poor balance decisions and attempts to appease the community.\n\nKudos to Rito Games for being extremely engaged and in-touch.

Almost nothing is given away that is RP only usually, the Mystery Gift was the first really free thing I've gotten in 4 years of playing, while in Smite I've gotten probably 20 dollars of their RP equivalent just by playing for a few months, and the ability to actually earn their cash currency. Dota is the same situation, and has the huge backing of the Steam Marketplace and a drop system for their game. I have never felt appreciated for being a League player like I have for the other games. League of Legends is the biggest MOBA around, and they don't have to really care about us.\n\nI do agree on the communication front however, and other companies could learn from Riot in talking to the community. Long-time players can definitely point out the deterioration of this though, and the unfortunate side effects of becoming huge.\n\nGive credit where credit is due, but don't ignore the flaws, Riot is not perfect.","replies":[{"poster":"Decaedeus","date":"2015-02-10T23:25:09.617+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I didn't say Riot was the most generous company ever, I said that they gave out free stuff, which is more than 90% of game companies can claim to do.\n\nAlso, they're not P2W.\nUnlike Nexon, PWE, Tencent (Riot's parent company) ugh.

Old GD was a storm of shit posts but at least it was pretty obvious that most of them were not serious. These boards are full of complaint after complaint, and as long as you have a big wall of text with proper grammar and a few charts you automatically get 100 upvotes from the sheep here. It's not hard to see. Go take a look at every \"Nerf x champ/game concept\" thread. I literally cannot fathom what goes through some of these people's heads.\n\nFor example, I see \"nerf lee sin\" threads talking about how \"lee sin dominates every game\" and \"lee sin makes all other jungle picks unviable\", yet these threads were made by silver and gold players. If you are in silver or gold, *I guarantee that you have never, ever seen a lee sin played well*. If you have, it was by a smurf. Every lee sin at that level is incapable of playing the champ. When I see lee sin locked in on the enemy team (I'm gold) I just think \"hey, free win\", and most of the time it is. The majority of people on the forums are complaining just for the sake of complaining. Every front page thread in the gameplay & balance section is just people whining about stuff they don't even care about.\n\nIt's a clear pattern that has been going on for years. People here whine about any champ that the pros play. Piss and moan until Riot nerfs the champ. Then get mad because there isn't much diversity in LCS. You people don't want diversity. If you wanted diversity you wouldn't bitch about every single champ that is actually picked. All you want is something to complain about because you think it makes you look intelligent to have a wall of text talking about how lee sin is \"ruining\" your game experience.\n\nAnd then the circle-jerking really starts with posts like \"If Riot really cares about diversity we'll get a response to this thread\". \"Wow Riot ignoring this thread with 200 upvotes. They don't want to nerf zed because of LC$ Big plays\". People spend all their energy bitching at Riot about stuff that doesn't even matter, and then get mad when Riot doesn't immediately respond to their thread full of \"genius\" ideas for instantly balancing the game. You plebs who constantly complain about balance and diversity think you could do a better job balancing league? Think you could figure out a way to make all 100+ champs and however many items all fit together in perfect harmony? No? Then STFU and quit being 4 yr old cry babies.\n\nI used to love GD because I thought the community was hilarious and funny, and honestly liked the trolls. Now, every time I scroll down the forums my blood curdles, because all I see are whiny piss-babies complaining about what color the sky is, and the other idiots on here actually upvote them.\n\nTL;DR: People who constantly complain about champ balance can just STFU and let Riot work. You are not helping the situation by being whiny scumbags fishing for upvotes. Riot does a pretty good job balancing league, and league is a great game. **If you hate league so much that you have to spend time typing a wall of text complaining about one fucking champ, please just leave.**","replies":[{"poster":"Gigglebytes","date":"2015-02-10T03:05:22.172+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think that you bring up good points in this post, points that I really agree with.

Seriously though, I think plenty of us, especially those from Season 1, have been nice enough already, especially when we've tried to give out the most helpful advice at times and they go completely ignored. A lot of this stuff does matter, because if it didn't, most of us wouldn't be complaining. Perhaps you're just lucky in the games you're in when there's a Lee Sin on the enemy team, because if you'd notice, that enemy Lee Sin is most likely not being played by one of the pros. So again, these \"complaints\" are serious issues that Riot refuses to respond to, positive or negative. It's obvious you're a troll if you think that Riot does a good job at balancing.

The burst is on a long cooldown, and her attack speed is slow enough that she has clearly defined windows of vulnerability, while her short mobility spell is enough to let minor mistakes slide, but not enough for huge mistakes in positioning to go unpunished. She has a low skill cap with her easy farming and poke, but the the skill needed to achieve her best plays is higher than most champions I have seen. \n\nAnd Riot, thank you for not listening to requests for RP bonuses to positive players, but throwing us that bone with the free mystery skin for positive players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Major Sparkles","date":"2015-02-10T01:21:50.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Threads like this need more attention.
