Anybody who's ever done any amount of programming knows that bugfixing is difficult and time intensive, even with really small programs.  In a program less than 50 lines long, people can spend a solid 20 minutes trying to figure out why one specific output isn't working right, only to find out that it's because they're missing a semicolon in a function that another function called.
