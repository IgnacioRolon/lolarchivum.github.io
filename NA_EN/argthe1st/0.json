The reform card just shows you examples of the inappropriate chat that you need to fix; it's not an exhaustive list of every match in which you were reported. When a mild punishment like a chat restriction proves ineffective, the system ramps it up, which is why you can receive a 14-day suspension for behaving like this. If you return after your suspension and continue behaving like this, your next punishment will be a permaban.","replies":[{"poster":"YTmustangcody","date":"2019-09-27T02:47:26.644+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like he edited out some of the stuff he said, Because I doubt he got a 2 week susp for this, their has to be more that he deleted.","replies":[{"poster":"ARGthe1st","date":"2019-09-27T10:47:31.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope I kept everything","replies":[{"poster":"YTmustangcody","date":"2019-09-28T18:06:18.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you take screen shots of the in game client?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PresBushDid711","date":"2019-09-27T22:18:00.679+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm guessing is 14 days because you decided to sell all your items... twice.\nNext time don't make it so easy for the system to pick up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-09-27T06:15:12.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you leave that game early?

If not, file a support ticket and ask them why it was escalated.\n\nIf you did, just for your information, the punishments work on a tiered system. You get a 10 game CR, 25 game CR, and then a 14 day ban, then a permaban. Certain things can escalate a punishment up the tiers, but I dont see anything worthy of that, so I'm assuming you've had previous punishments.","replies":[{"poster":"ARGthe1st","date":"2019-09-26T23:56:39.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I haven't been chat restricted at all","replies":[{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-09-27T00:04:50.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ARGthe1st,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=2FksqAgf,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-09-26T23:56:39.025+0000)\n>\n> I haven't been chat restricted at all\n\nThen yeah, file a support ticket. Idk how long you AFKed for, so that could have something to do with it, as gameplay offenses are punished more harshly than verbal offenses. But if they told you it was for your chat, then the afk would have nothing to do with it. Definitely talk to support. Its possible to get it reduced.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ARGthe1st","date":"2019-09-26T23:34:29.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I mean I thought that for a 14 day suspension you had to type \"kys\" or like racial slurs in 3 different games?","replies":[{"poster":"BladeSteel","date":"2019-09-26T23:40:41.849+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope.
