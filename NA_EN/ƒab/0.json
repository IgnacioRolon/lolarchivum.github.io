For example, the black screen is due to failure to download assets.\n\nThere might be a more local issue that's causing this block in addition to firewall settings you've tried.  Your best bet would be to go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide instead to troubleshoot.  Test it in a custom game, though!","replies":[{"poster":"ƒab","date":"2017-09-12T21:23:03.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yay! I realized McAfee got downloaded on my computer somehow, and the date that it was installed correlated with the date League stopped working. Uninstalled it, and now I'm perfectly loaded into a custom game!\nThanks for the nudge in the right direction :) I appreciate it!! <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"ƒab","date":"2017-09-12T21:07:59.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you  for your response.
