Heroes of storm.\r\n\r\nIn heros, if you are a good player, there are lots of ways to carry the team, you can split push, you can get camps, which is something i think League needs, (camps that act as minions and affect the lanes), Bosses. which again affect lane pushing, and most importantly, the effect XP has on the game, a hero might get lots of kill on your noob teammate, but that doesnt mean hes stacking gold.\r\n\r\nPlease don&#039;t Start trash talking and saying negative stuff, as a previous diamond player i care about how this game moves forward, and if any Devs care, this is a players feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"MohawkBird","date":"2015-07-25T19:00:59.179+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Literal Hitler","date":"2015-07-25T19:01:54.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Elias1724,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=A31IehRs,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-07-25T19:00:59.179+0000)\n>\n> Are you kidding me right now?

That's way more carrying than should ever be allowed in a 10 man game.\n\nHeroes is FAR less geared towards this and it really seems like you haven't played either game very much.  In hots, your team is all locked at the same level and xp is shared.  So if anyone is snowballng, it's your whole team, and if that happens the game will be over within 5 minutes anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-07-25T19:05:41.533+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

Heroes has no in game store, plays with objectives, doesn't have lane postitions just a go where you want, champs that are pretty overpowered, and JUST came out. Dota is a better comparison, because league is based off of it. This is a supposed to be a TEAM game, they want teamwork (which sucks in ranked because trolls and afkers are a thing). I play Heroes when I have time to kill, because those games are like 20 minutes.\n\n Each Moba plays differently.
