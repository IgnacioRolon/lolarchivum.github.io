Like I will click on the store for it to take 5-10 mins to load it. Or it will timeout my ban because it won't let me click on a champion and then i will get timed out. Also lately don't know if its related but it seems to effect my browser to when i go full screen on a video my task bar will flicker at the bottom, and its not even supposed to be showing during a full screen vid. Please any help you can give would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-25T21:15:51.722+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there are a few different issues here, but I'm not sure the recent patch has a role in it. Your long load times in the store and issues in champ select sound like a pretty unstable connection to the servers. As for your fullscreen issue, does this happen in the League client?\n\nFor your connection issue specifically, I'd like you to ensure your local network settings are A-Okay, so I recommend working through the steps in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step. Let me know if those steps helped.","replies":[{"poster":"MrGinger1004","date":"2016-09-25T21:40:10.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well last thing I had happen was I got a RADS error and i looked up a few vids for help and they had me change a few things with the IP v4 settings and that seemed to fix it. Before that I uninstalled the client and reinstalled it which didn't help. As far as my connection Im using a direct connection via Ethernet from my gateway so idk whats caused the issue?","replies":[{"poster":"MrGinger1004","date":"2016-09-25T21:41:31.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also Im running windows 10","replies":[{"poster":"Dadron3","date":"2016-09-25T22:39:40.161+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds you have the same problem I do..

I thought at first it was just my computer but I'm running minecraft, Fallout, World of Warcraft, and a lot of other games completely fine. It's also only the client, where chat lags, clicks take a few seconds to register, and interacting at all with the window has such a delayed reaction that when i clicked the ready check trying to get into a game it never registered. In game I had fps and lag issues until I lowered the graphics settings.","replies":[]}]}
