Kill your opponent if you can. If you cant manipulate the minion wave to be in your favor. also remember. Your jungler is also up at 2:30. He is a mobile ward.

And I expect the enemy jungler to camp. I like to play like a roaming support though. I never want to take kills, I give them to teammates. This being said. There is significantly less risk in ganking top and mid as an early jungle, then screwing up a gank into bot and feeding the adc even one kill. \n\nAs a sion main. I actually generally tell my dear nasus to break out the lube, and get a pillow. Cause im probly gonna be farming as much as possible to reach 6.

Mid has 1 ward, jungler can come from both directions. Top probably needed to ward the buff to avoid an invade. Botlane support warded the bush to manage poke and lane control better. The jungler warded river bush to avoid getting invaded. The adc...\n\nOk, so the adc could maybe ward the river bush. If they can do so safely( remember, if the jungler is there they are likely dead) and the state of the lane allows it. And they didn't ward the second bush (or first bush because wards last only a minute).","replies":[{"poster":"ForFoxSakes","date":"2018-02-13T16:22:47.556+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You should know which side to ward based on which side the jungler starts on if you're mid.
