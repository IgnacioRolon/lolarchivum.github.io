Cassio is gonna use her E to get pressure, but early in the game she will be aaing anyhow so it really doesn't effect her in lane that much. Annie damn well better be using Q for harass otherwise she is fucking bad. And brand wants to fish with his stun to unload his entire kit on you during the lane. But again weaves autos so it doesn't really effect much. Morg is the least likely to use her Q on people because she is always shoved up and she wants to use that combined with black shield to ensure she gets out of ganks alive.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2018-01-25T00:16:20.802+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"??? it dosnt nerf mages mid... unless u play a point and clic champ like annie","replies":[{"poster":"r4ndomkill","date":"2018-01-25T00:23:50.489+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"and both of the champs he listed had point and click spells that would make them worse now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2018-01-25T10:32:37.529+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ryuumoku no koke,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=v2z3IyOP,comment-id=0000000000020000,timestamp=2018-01-25T00:16:20.802+0000)\n>\n> ??? it dosnt nerf mages mid... unless u play a point and clic champ like annie\n\nAnnie is honestly doing real bad atm so she is likely due for a buff anyways regardless of this change. 48% WR on an easy low skill champ is bad, especially when high skill champs are rocking higher WRs than her ATM. All in all it doesn't hurt the majority of mages so buffing 1 isn't a big deal.
