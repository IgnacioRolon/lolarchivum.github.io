I love losing in champion select, real fucking blast.","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-01-25T05:57:34.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support items actually SHOULD be picked up by all champs given their current gold value spike. Gold for missed minions/secure, + 3 wards for 800g is worth more than any other item in the game. On an adc, gives them Bandit for gold, and it's not hard to charge a {{item:3302}} or {{item:3096}} . They've basically become a {{item:1083}} for all characters that also has 3 wards. If you need their slot late game to finish a build, you will have already farmed enough gold to make it worth it.\n\nP.S. Why did you Tier 3 your support item? Now THAT is worthless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-25T02:37:03.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is getting nerfed for ranged, or possibly already did(?)","replies":[]},{"poster":"invisiblecat1","date":"2018-01-25T02:32:37.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I recommend you remake this post, as it does have some valuable information\nThe picture is fine, but this is the place to inform players not to build it, not rage at your teammates who did build it","replies":[]}]}
