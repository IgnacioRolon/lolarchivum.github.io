In the case of the others, they have rather singular existences. If a player wanted to play such a character, I would happily work with them to develop that race, but it isn't common enough to warrant a common race.\n\nAppreciate the input!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jihyobda","date":"2017-04-07T07:39:48.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would advice you to look into the universe section of the lol site, there are a lot of information about lore and stuff, also the lol wikia. \n\nBy the way I do not recommend adding the vastaya as a playable race yet because we don't have many information about them. \n\nThe darkin race I feel is difficult as well because we don't have many information yet.","replies":[{"poster":"THE BIG BROTHER","date":"2017-04-07T08:41:12.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I'm digging through that as well.

If anything, see if you can get the story to revolve around the Darkin or possibly have  one or two appear in the story to battle.\n\nJust remember that Darkin are the weapons.  Aatrox is The Darkin Blade.  As in the sword is aatrox.   The body is a host the parasite attached to.  We could Theorize that Varus's bow might be a Darkin as well.  If that's the case, then you can use him as an example of what happens if one of your players uses a Darkin weapon.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Digielf","date":"2017-04-20T07:35:56.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your primary goal is to gather the races that have legit playable males/females that would be able to equip most of the armor sets and to be easy for their combat animations, for example if you take Volidbear's race you can't even tell who are the males or females so its not worth it, while Vastaya, Yordles etc you can easily make them playable","replies":[]}]}
