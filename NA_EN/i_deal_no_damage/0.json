You'll receive unique ranked rewards for the ranked modes that you participate in. The border in loading screen will change, depending on what mode you're queueing for.\n\nSo for your example, you'd see a Silver border next season when you played Solo/Duo Ranked matches and the Gold border when you queue up for Ranked Flex 5v5.\n\nCheck out our [**Ranked FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ) for more information on how the system works.
