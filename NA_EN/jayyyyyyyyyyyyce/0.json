While Domination/Sorcery gives 12 AD, equal to about 390 gold.\n\n* Grasp: Deal magic damage = to 4% of your max health, Heal 2% of your max health, Perma increase health by 5. Lets say you have 3k health, and you proc'd this about 20 times that game. 3k - 4% = 120 damage you deal which equals 4200 gold in long swords.  3k - 2% = 60 healing which is about 170 gold. 20 x 5 = 100 bonus perma health = 300 gold. 4200 + 300 + 170 = 4670 gold from just the keystone. Aery does 40 damage with a somewhat smaller cooldown, which equals 1400 gold in long swords. Add maybe like 600 gold for the shorter cooldown and we give it a total of 2k gold. Electrocute has a good 220 damage late game, which equals 7700 gold, but its cooldown is super long. By the time you get Electrocute off cooldown, you couldve proc'd Resolves ability 3 times by now. Making Electrocute only worth 7700 / 3 = 2566 gold compared to Grasp. \n**|Grasp = 4670 gold| |Aery = 2000 gold| |Electrocute = 2566 gold|**\n\n* Bone Platting: the next 3 attacks are block 50 damage. 3x50 = 150 health. 150 health = 400 gold Bone Platting = 400 gold. Sudden Impact gives 10 lethality after performing a move, 10 lethality = Dirk(1100) - 25 attack damage(875 Gold) = 225 gold. Sudden Impact = 225 Gold. Sudden impact has a bit of a lower cooldown that Bone platting, but you also have to proc Sudden impact by dashing, leap, teleport, blinking. Sudden impact = about 300 gold due to shorter cooldown but still having to proc. Mana Flow: 250 mana = 350 gold + 1% missing mana regen every 5 seconds. Bone platting = 45 sec cd, 45/5 = 9. 500 mana missing - 9% = 45 mana you regen in 45 seconds. 45 mana = 75 gold. Mana Flow = 425 gold\n**|Bone Platting = 400 Gold| |Sudden Impact = about 300| |Mana Flow = 425 Gold|**\n\n* Conditioning: After 10 min, gain 8 armor/mr, + 5% mr/armor. 8 armor = 160 gold. 8 MR = 144 gold. 304 total gold. The average tankyish/bruiser player has about 200+ armor and 100 mr. 200 + 5% = 10 armor. 100 + 5% = 5 mr. 10 armor = 200 gold. 5 mr 90 gold. 200 + 90 + 304 = 594 gold. Im unsure how id calculate wards, so Ill have to do Eyeball collector. Eyeball collector = 18 Attack damage = 630 gold in longswords. Celerity = +3% movement speed + adaptive damage from bonus movement speed. Base movement speed of Jayce is 335 movement speed. 335 + 45 (Ninja Tabis) = 380 ms. 380 + 3% = 11.4 ms. 11.4 ms = 136 gold. 11.4 + 45 = 56.4 - 4.8% = 2.7 ad or 3 AD. 3 AD = 30 gold. 136 Gold + 30 gold = 164 Gold Total (Note you can get extra movement speed items, so ill bump the gold to 194 gold beens youll probably have 6 bonus ad with all the movement speed boosts from other items).\n**|Conditioning = 594 gold| |Eyeball Collector = 630 gold| |Celerity = 194 gold|**\n\n* Overgrowth. Every 8 minions you gain .2% max health. Average Cs a game = 200-250 (in my elo). 225 / 8 = 28.125 or 28. Average health of a tank/bruiser is about 3k. 28 x .2 = 5.6% bonus max health. 3000 - 5.6% = 168 bonus health. 168 health = 448 gold. OverGrowth = 448 gold. Ravenous Hunter = 15% heal. Deaths Dance = 3500 gold. 80 ad = 2800 gold in longswords. 10% cooldown = 225 gold. Ignores 30% of damage for a few seconds, I dont know how to calculate this so ill just say 100 gold. 2800 + 225 + 100 = 3,125 Gold. 3500 - 3,125 gold = 375 gold. Ravenous Hunter = 375 Gold. Scorch = 60 magic damage. Calculating this would mean 60 magic damage = 60 ap = about 1305 gold in Amplifying Tome Items, which sounds way off but I wouldnt know what else to do for it, so screw it. \n**|OverGrowth = 448 gold| |Ravenous Hunter = 375 gold| |Scorch = 1305 Gold (wut)|**\n\nAdding the total of all these together and you get:\n\nResolve = 6,112 Gold\nDomination = 3,871 Gold\nSorcery = 3,923\n\nEven if my math was off by a bit, this still shows just how much better Resolve is than the other two trees. I didn&#039;t have time to do Precision or Inspiration, but if this post is popular enough then I might add those two. Resolve either needs some nerfs, or the other trees needs some fixing. I was able to get to Diamond 4 playing Resolve on Jayce in the mid lane. Its so crazy how much of an advantage you have using this rune page.\n\nEdit: If you're gonna dislike at least tell me what the flaws are in this lol.

The Zombie wards/Poro should be inspiration tree. And the bounty hunter runes arent that good either. I rarely even notice the healing i get from Ravenous Hunter.\n\nThe bounty hunter trees are actually very good.\n\nRavenous Hunter works well with caster champions. A Vladimir that gets this heals for insane amounts. This is just an example, champions like Illaoi or Kayn (when going Rhaast) could also do well with this rune. I've fount Ravenous Hunter to actually be better for champions which already have healing in their kits, since the healing will get more noticeable.\n\nIngenious Hunter is a godsend for champions that rely on item actives. Vladimir is an example of this and he can use this instead of Ravenous Hunter if, instead of extra healing, you prefer more opportunities to make plays with Hextech Protobelt and Zhonya. Other champions, especially AP assassins like Fizz or LeBlanc, rely on item actives like Zhonya and Hextech items. They love this rune. Oh, this rune is also really good on supports. If you go Domination for the Zombie Ward rune, you can get this too. You will then have extra opportunities to use things like Locket, Redemption, etc.\n\nRelentless Hunter is on my opinion the weakest of all three, but it is still pretty useful. On my opinion, it works best if you plan to roam a lot. Especially on assassins that don't rely on item actives, like Zed. If you are fed and you have this, you roam to help your team get ahead, and this rune helps you at that, especially since you will have a lower chance of losing your tower to the enemy laner. Overall, this rune isn't great, but it is not a terrible rune by any means.\n\nAs for the other runes: Zombie Wards are really good on assassins, especially AD ones, because you get Duskblade (and possibly the red trinket) so you help with warding even more. Poro is just completely outclassed, it has been like that since it was released.\n\nOverall, the Domination tree feels like it is weak when not a primary tree because as a secondary tree it is very situtional. It is only really useful on supports and a few specific champions. It is not like Sorcery, Resolve, or even Inspiration, where you have runes that are useful no matter which champion you are playing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2018-04-29T23:26:40.189+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Moral of the story: {{item:1028}}  is way over priced and the cost should be cut down to 300 as well as everything it builds into being reduced in cost.","replies":[{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2018-04-30T00:10:29.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AlienPrimate,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=y5OLungO,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-04-29T23:26:40.189+0000)\n>\n> Moral of the story: {{item:1028}}  is way over priced and the cost should be cut down to 300 as well as everything it builds into being reduced in cost.\n\ninteresting perspective.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GG Thanks For LP","date":"2018-04-29T23:16:56.924+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lol.

Now if you take this into account, maybe the discrepancy in gold values looks smaller if your ranged.\n\nHe's also assumed that grasp is very easy to proc (you can proc it ~ 3 times for each electrocute proc and the amount of aery procs is around the same as grasp procs), which may not always be true. If your melee, you have to get really close to auto. If your ranged, you don't benefit from grasp fully. A sticky melee champion (Trundle?) probably benefits from this more then say... xerath? The outlier to this I feel is GP who can probably frequently proc with his Q. There are probably other exceptions that I haven't considered either, but I'm not too familiar on grasp users outside of those two.\n\nI think a conclusion I agree with more then is: Grasp is superior to Aery / Electocute, given you can easily proc it and are melee, which doesn't sound so bad right?

What about level 1 and early game in general? The value there is almost non-existent, and it's also the most important part of the game.\n\n- Grasp comparison. Again, you only comment on 3k HP = late game. Early in the game, this isn't as high. Also, the damage output by each keystone has different meaning based on the champion. Zed wouldn't care about doing so much more damage. He only cares about doing enough damage in a short window. You can have 10k damage by Grasp and w/e bonus health and healing from it, but a Zed can have just 4k from Electrocute and still be more important, because that 4k damage were used to kill someone, where yours probably didn't matter at all. You completely ignore context.\n\n\n- Bone plating: Again, late game. it blocks 20-50 damage. Early game, it only blocks 20, and most of the time, you don't get value out of it, because people stop attacking, wait for it to go on CD, and then attack you back. At the same time, most champions who can make use of sudden impact, can do so frequently to proc it after its available again.  Manaflow band is currently weak, but with the amount of mana that people get lately, the mana regen is decent enough. There are times where people have 3k mana, and sit on 1k (for example after using Seraph's shield, or proccing Muramana). The mana refund there is much bigger, and again you only compared it at level 18.\n\n\n- Condition. Again, AFTER 10 MINUTES. By the time you reach that point, you are probably losing because you don't have a rune. Meanwhile, I will abuse my extra MS early to get in some autos while you can't and destroy you in lane, or I'll set up more vision on enemy camps as a jungler and attempt to steal camps or kill the enemy jungler. Much bigger reward.\n\nAnyway, I read the entire post, and in all of it, you only seem to account for full build level 18 situations, completely ignoring level 1, early game and mid game. There are runes that are very strong early and there are others that scale late. Therefore, there isn't really any unfairness. It's just early spike vs late game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2018-04-30T10:29:55.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gold efficiency is simply a guideline for comparisons to similar items (luden's to GLP, frozen heart to thornmail, fiendish codex to aether wisp), and they're calculated arbitrarily around base items. All this says is that ruby crystal is pretty damn cheap, if anything.\n\nLet's make amp tome / longswords double the gold, so that way the offensive trees are worth twice as much now.\n\nA fairer comparison would be how much damage resolve blocks vs. how much damage domination/sorcery gives. And even then it's really hard to compare them because tanking x damage and dealing x damage are two completely different things, as well as how AP/AD are linear/quadratic in scaling while tankiness is closer to logarithmic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VICHEL CHAOS","date":"2018-04-30T00:48:43.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the effort you took, but some of the assumptions are too strong, don't take intended users into account, ignore versatility or simply are not compared fairly. \n\nLet me start with your electrocute/grasp comparison as an example to illustrate my point. You divide the damage by 3 because of the cooldown, but you are not taking into account that precisely that damage may (and in many case is) the determining factor in an assassin killing off an adc. In that case, where is the lost gold in damage by the adc? Burst damage in general is more valuable gold wise than equivalent damage if it is distributed along a period of time. \n\nOh, and although aery rocks lower damage numbers, her ease of proccing and higher versatility (offensive/defensive/poking tool) are not taken into account enough. You add much less value to aery in your calculations than it deserves in my opinion. Aery is also much less conditional than grasp in that you need 4 seconds in combat and a melee (most cases) basic attack to proc it while Aery is available directly on spells/attacks on allies/enemies.\n\nAnother example of this not being accurate is your sudden impact and bone plating comparison. You are comparing the gold value of both directly without taking the drawbacks fairly. Your argument for this is that even though bone plating has a much higher cooldown, sudden impact has a condition to proc. In reality this does not work like this, because sudden impact is only going to be taken on champions that can reliably proc it, hence the drawback is in the vast majority of its users negated in most part (hence they can be assumed to have it available in almost every situation) while every user of bone plating still has no way to deal with the drawbck of the rune being its long cooldown. \n\nOn ocnditioning, eyeball and overgrowth, you are taking their endgame values. You are forgetting that with conditioning you are forfeiting a rune for the majority of the laning phase. Stats at the beginning of the game are worth much more than at the end of the game. \n\nFinally, you are translating the damage to longswords to calculate its worth. Try taking a 200 stacks dark harvest procced 3 times in a fight which is very easy to achieve late game and you would easily reach the conclusion that domination is overpowered as all hell (idk lets say that is 600 damage in longswords which equals a metric ton of gold, 21k if my math is right for 60 longswords).\n\nI am not arguing on wether resolve is strong or not, just that your comparisons are very unfair and completely inaccurate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rexxiee","date":"2018-04-30T21:17:58.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yep they tried to \"nerf\" resolve but they made it even more broken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"T4underbolt","date":"2018-04-30T08:53:15.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well kids and noobs have to get a way to win the game for free and never die so it's obvious the tank tree is the most powerful and can be picked also as secondary by everyone without losing much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omituinen","date":"2018-04-30T06:04:34.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Edit: If you're gonna dislike at least tell me what the flaws are in this lol.\"\n\nWell in several cases you're full-on making up \"gold values\" for things that don't have gold values.
