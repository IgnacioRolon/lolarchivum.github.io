(GTX 1080 TI","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello.\n\nI have had horrible FPS for a very long time, and I'm getting very tired of it. Having spent so much money on my computer, I don't understand why the only game, League of Legends, is performing this badly.\n\nSpecs:\n\n* Asus STRIX 1080 IT OC\n\n* Intel cCore i7-7820x 4.5GHZ\n\n* MSI 299x Tomahawk\n\n* INTEL SSD 500GB x3 RAID\n\n* NZXT Kraken x62\n\n* Seasonic Plat 860watt 80 Plus\n\n* Corsair DDR4 Vengeance DDR4 32GB\n\n\n\nI have tried the following solutions, that have been suggested:\n\n* Maximum perfomance battery.\n\n* Turning off G-Sync. (And tried with on).\n\n* Tried all the various graphic settings ingame. (No change)\n\n* Tried capping my framerate, and enabling v-sync. (No change.)\n\n* Disabling X-BOX game DVR. (No Change)\n\n* I've tried windowed, borderless and fullscreen. (Bordeless performences worse)\n\nI start the game out with 90 FPS, and around 20 minutes ingame I'll drop to 45-30 fps. My framerate is so unstable, that it absolutely hinders my perfomance ingame. The computer described above should be able to push 144fps, if not more, in a non-graphic intensive game like league of legends.\n\nIf anyone have any suggestions, please let me know. This is getting quite frustrating.\n\nThanks in advanced,\nHated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-14T23:28:00.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may wanna check out this article on [**Frame-Skipping**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209010626). I can't really tell what kind of specific issues you're having other than fps dropping (which honestly might be due to corrupted files around the 20 min mark, or simply drops in FPS from teamfights and more going on later in the game).  \n\nTry capping your framerate with that article to see if it helps at all. Other than that, I'd also try repairing the game files through the client options to be sure certain files like come into play around 20 min aren't damaged and causing some issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2018-01-25T20:24:08.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"putting a cap actually made the stuttering/skipping worse for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hated","date":"2018-01-15T20:54:07.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly I have already tried these options, as this is the general response I got last time I attempted to submit a support ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-15T21:11:39.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm well dang okay.

Also having an 1080ti but still have a better framerate than you do. I get about 130-200 which doesnt really satisfy me. I play on a 144hz monitor and I'd expect and want to have 300+ fps permanently. Im really annoyed by the fact that my damn 1080ti cant run this game smoothly in all sitations. I must say that i am really picky and I notice it really fast a soon as i get under 144hz. \n\nYour case sounds even worse tho, makes me wonder if your game is processed by your cpu and not your gpu. Im pretty sure youve already checked that in the Nvidia settings...\n\nYou could try reinstalling your windows if you havent done that already and if youre capable of doing it. {{summoner:13}} \n\nhave you checked your task manager while playing the game? what is your GPU workload while ingame? are there any other processes using alot of the CPUs / GPUs workload? eventually u have some kind of mining software installed? \n\ni dont know how tech savvy you are but you could also try to run the game in a windows VM to make sure that your windows is not the source of the problem... idk trying to help and hoping to find a way to improve my own fps :) \n\ncheers from switzerland{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"KMyL","date":"2018-01-16T08:28:30.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not the first \"that kind of\" topic which I met, so I'll just copy and paste what I wrote somewhere else earlier: \n\nOk.\n\nYour PC is a monster. A MONSTER. And you're telling me, that you must play at very low settings?!\nDUDE! Check this out:\n-my PC was an antic. Or a toaster. Or something similar with potato:\n- Windows 7 32 bit\n- Pentium Dual Core E6300\n- 2 GB Ram DDR2\n- GF 9500 GT\n- I don't have a SSD: typical cheap HDD\n\nAnd with this setup at the lowest settings with Full HD resolution I had problems with frames. Even when LoL was telling me, that I had 37 FPS game was lagging & freezing.\n\nNow I could buy a new & powerful PC but:\n1) for ME there is no sense right NOW,\n2) I'm poor, so my bank account would be reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally thin after that.\n\nSo few days ago I did two things:\n- I bought GF GT 1030 (so cheap!)\n- I checked my system.\n\nWhen you replied I played one 25 min SR game (because I usually play ARAMS) &... Well:\n- I have disabled shadows,\n- environment went at medium\n- effects went at medium\n- characters went at medium\n- AA off\n\nAnd in bigger teamfights I had FPS drops for ~47 but I didn't had any \"unpleasantness\" with that. Usually I have now 60-59-57 FPS.\n\nSo- your situation for me is like trolling or some bad joke \n\nI'm not a specialist or engineer, but IMO there is something wrong with LoL (but IMO we can put that aside, because that's not the topic to tell about it), but looking at your situation there must be something wrong with yous PC.\n\nYou wrote a lot about your hardware, but PC is not only about hardware- it's also about software.\n\nSo- could you please tell more about your software:\n- I assume you're using Windows, so your windows version & are you patching it with windows update?\n- do you use any protection software (antivirus)?\n- do you have some benchmarks, or other games, to give a comparison: is LoL only affected with this problem & how other games works at your PC?","replies":[{"poster":"Hated","date":"2018-01-16T14:31:40.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry yes, could have been more specific.
