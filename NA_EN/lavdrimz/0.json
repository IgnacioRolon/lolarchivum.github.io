When logging back in, I could not acces 'Loot' and I needed to restart my computer and League itself. When I finally got back on, I wanted to open a chest which I had recently received. To my dismay one of my Hextech Keys had been removed from my inventory. Mind you, I am talking about a full key, not a key fragment. I know for sure I had a key in my inventory as I had recently gotten quite a few key fragments. Could someone help me with my problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-13T17:11:52.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, I looked into this for you but I wasn't able to locate any missing keys.  I see your most recent one was on the 8th, which opened a mastery chest for Forsaken Jayce.  Since then you've gained 2 more fragments.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Lavdrimz","date":"2017-10-14T18:54:55.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're completely right. The key fragments I got, were gotten on my second account. I must have confused the two. Thanks for your fast response Porocles!","replies":[]}]}]}
