There&#039;s no escape of getting into tilt! NO ESCAPE!\r\n\r\nAnyway, throughout, I played a lot more normal games and avoid getting into ranked until I&#039;m truly ready. But, I keep getting more losses than wins. And on that, I hit a major relapse. My emotions got me again. By losing so many games, in fact too many games, that too many deaths got me out of control again, and left many games on purpose. And that Leaverbuster system keeps getting me perhaps every time I leave a game on purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd with that, I&#039;ve snapped. Because I hated that system so much, that on those lower priority games, I fed, that&#039;s right, fed on the enemy team on purpose on how much I REALLY hated that Leaverbuster system. I even used those helper cheats to help me get better but that backfired as well. \r\n\r\nI have two goals in my life. One was getting a S on many champs I own so I can get the mastery tokens. And the other, and my main goal, is to reach gold in ranked. But, there&#039;s too much obstacles get in the way of reaching my goals because of those AFKers, trolls, ragers, flamers, and most of all, kill stealers.  Just when I&#039;m on the verge on getting a kill, someone on my team steals my kills at the last second, and I hate that.\r\n\r\nThe straw that broke my back is what happened today. I played 3 ranked games and lost all of them. I get the jungle role on all 3 games. My first ranked game is with {{champion:106}} . I played him the most because I wanted to get a S on him so much. And I got sidetracked, got many deaths, and took way too long of getting my first kill with him. I got so fed up, I left that game, and end up with a loss.\r\n\r\nMy second ranked game is with {{champion:107}} . Same dilemma, but got more kills than last time. Most of my teammates are railroading me, and too much deaths reached my breaking point. Because someone on my team gets more kills than me and took all the credit, so I fed on purpose on that game to see how deeply hurt I am. That ended up with a loss, too.\r\n\r\nMy third and last game is with my top jungler, {{champion:19}} . I was following the same jungle route, just I do with every game I use him. One teammate was already badmouthing and insulted me for not being the best jungler I can be. And those mean comments keep piling up and piling up, that I&#039;m about to scream in anger if this kept going. So I said, &quot;One more mean comment, and I&#039;m leaving.&quot; And then, after I get slain, my teammate still insulted me. So, I stormed out in anger and left the game in total disgust. And of course, this leaverbuster system got me again.\r\n\r\nAnd all this anger and frustration, followed by deep depression, had let me to... an obese and unhealthy state I am in now. I got way out of shape and got very obese. I tried to do some exercises to try to get better at this, but obstacles get in the way, too. And I&#039;m totally sick of it. Why does everything have to be so hard? Why is nothing ever easy. I wish everything is easy so I can get out of this horrible gaming nightmare I&#039;m in.\r\n\r\nThe point is... I need to get better without any effort whatsoever.","replies":[]}
