Got permanently banned. Story goes: was toxic, got 2 week banned (skipped chat restriction somehow). After 2 week ban, play ONE game, gets permanent ban. Yo, I know I&#039;m toxic but no way I&#039;m toxic enough to deserve permanent ban. I didn&#039;t even know you can get permanent banned for being toxic. I thought you have to be extra like intentionally feeding, cheat, afking to even get permanent ban. i&#039;m just saying if I known I would be punished this hard I would not have been toxic that game. This situation escalated way too quickly, 2 week ban before chat restriction, then permanent ban after ONE game? Can I unban please? No lie 100% never toxic again if I get unban. @Riot","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-10-25T14:24:12.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately *any* amount of consistent toxicity can merit a permanent ban. Riot's stance is that toxicity merits a permanent ban, and *excessive* toxicity earns a *faster* permanent ban. It's a common misconception that permanent bans are only for the worst of the worst -- they're something that any toxic player can earn if they don't reform their behavior, because Riot considers repeated toxicity of any time unacceptable.\n\nYou are also warned on your 14-day ban that further violations can result in a permanent ban.\n\n----------------------------\n\nAll that aside, bans are not lifted unless they are in error so, I am sorry to say, the account is lost.","replies":[{"poster":"Błaźe","date":"2018-07-09T02:33:47.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was not.

You should have learned from it that your behaviour is unacceptable, and you should have actually read it. It states on the 14 day ban that the next punishment will be a permanent ban.\n\n---\n\nPermanent bans are never reverted, unless they were given out by mistake.
