Limit them at least somehow, currently they have no resources, no cooldowns and their kits provide too much, it's like something outta DOTA game. \r\n\r\nInb4 \"Ahri is an assasin she's supposed to be able to burst people!!!\"\r\n\r\nLemme ask you : is assassin supposed to have Godly CC? How about her waveclear? And the utility she provides building Rilays? \r\n\r\nPlease Riot, nerf these 2 champions ... They are true cancer of Solo Q, stop looking at competitive, pay attention to Solo Q as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Blade of Justic","date":"2015-01-21T21:04:10.172+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahri is annoying, yes.\n\nBut Riven...
