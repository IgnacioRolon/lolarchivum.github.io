When I go to spectate him it says \"Active game not found\". \r\n\r\nI cannot gift this friend anything because it does not register his new name. On my friends list it shows his proper rank but when I search his name someone took his old name and it shows them as a lower rank. I can search his new name and it'll show his current rank that I see on friends list.\r\n\r\nRiot says they have no fix to this issue and wanted me to post on boards. I don't see how they can't just correct his name on my friend list but I'll do as they ask.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-21T18:05:50.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had issues with a friend's name showing up as 'unknown' rather than their actual IGN. I removed them, and re-added them, and that seemed to fix the issue for me. Keep in mind that if you remove a friend, and re-add them, you'll need to wait 14 days before you can gift them.","replies":[]}]}
