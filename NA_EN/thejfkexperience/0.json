Everytime I'm trying to play League after a minute or so the client says \"trying to reconnect\", my internet connection is stable and fast, I can still for example google stuff and use the internet but just the Client tries to reconnect. it happens if i just have it open, in champ select and in Queue. As soon as I am in a game all is good. I'd really appreciate some help on this topic. I am not sure if it has to do with the patch.","replies":[{"poster":"CarryMeImTired","date":"2017-09-17T23:18:19.860+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i am having the same problem with my client but it just crashes over and over again , its not losing network connection it just keeps crashing . i did a full repair , i uninstalled and reinstalled mutiple times but it still crashes . please help meee this is soo much bs","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkuIIy","date":"2017-03-31T15:18:46.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"My guess it's some sorta of bug within the client causing these disconnects, I have been dealing with a similar problem as well. My Client will randomly disconnect me from game and keep me from reconnecting for a good 10 to 15 mins unless I reset my router. Thing is I use two computers one for music and discord and another for League. The pc I use for music never ends up disconnecting from the internet, where the one I'am playing on freaks out if i try reconnecting. So I know for sure it has something to do with the client. Secondly, when I do reconnect I have to deal with riot's stupid Leaverbuster. So far Support hasn't been much help, telling me that they -themselves have no clue what may be causing these crashes.","replies":[{"poster":"MMilkmann","date":"2018-02-07T08:08:37.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a twenty minute wait time bc of this.
