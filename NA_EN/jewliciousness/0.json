Doesn't sound bad, but instead of commenting nice, clean stuff or anything of value, the people commenting proceeded to look up the poster's match history and began to insult him because it was not an \"amazing\" KDA. This sounds somewhat normal, but the issue here is that this continued for well over 30 comments. The original poster did not really bother to engage in the argument, as it had now turned into, but many other random people that had nothing to do with it did. It turned into about 5 different people arguing over whether or not a 2.something KDA was good and also arguing over whether or not averaging 18 kills a game was a feat. Seriously. Can we just take a moment to think about how ridiculous this is. Multiple people that had nothing better to do with their time decided to join in an argument they had no business being in.

Yeah it's great to have better posts than that to go through, but if it's posted on the front page and you've gone through the stuff you thought was more interesting, then sometimes it's just random discussion time.\n\nAlso if it's the post I'm thinking of it wasn't so much an argument over if a kda was good or not, it was one guy saying that 2 something KDA doesn't make a build good (it's not a super high kda, so it's more important how it impacted stuff, like if it's an assassin play style and you can close the gap and kill 2 carries but die diving them, then the play style is probably viable in higher ranks), and then people saying that the OP was right and it was an awesome kda and justified building that way as effective approach to climbing ranked. My posts prob weren't worded well to indicate it bc I was bored and not paying terribly much attention, but I'd say it's a legit point to note that an okay kda doesn't indicate a strat is good, w/out being able to define why it impacts the game w/out having a really good kda.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2015-06-03T20:31:36.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While the argument about 2.47 KDA was stupid, the initial post in response to mine which started the while thing was along the lines of \"I do good with Darius in my ranked games I average like 14 kills\"\n\nSomewhere in there someone tired to point out to the poor bronze that having a bunch of kills doesn't mean you did well, especially if you on average die 8+ times a game and have less assists than deaths. That mean you are playing for kills and not to win.\n\nThis entire legitimate point was overshadowed by an argument about a KDA number.\n\nAlso, to the people saying just because you're in bronze doesn't mean you don't understand the game - while I don't completely disagree, I have to say if you really understood the game, you wouldn't be in bronze. Just from my brief stint in B1 this season I saw so many godawful mistakes being made that anyone with a decent amount of game knowledge and mediocre mechanics should blast through it easily.\n\nWhat I'm saying is not that you can't have a valid opinion because of your rank, but knowing that you lack the skill to get higher than Bronze makes me much more skeptical of your opinion.\n\nBut back the point I wanted to make - the actual point some people were trying to make is that saying \"I do good with this champion, look how many kills I get per game!\" Doesn't really mean anything. Hell, if you usually get fed but don't usually win, it says to me you're worse than someone who doesn't usually get fed.\n\nThe real problem is the lower ELO mentality of focusing on KDA and sometimes CS to rate performance, and not statistics like damage dealt, damage taken, time spent dead, wards placed, dragons secured, kill participation (k+a / team total kills), gold earned, gold given to enemy team (should be a tracked stat but can still be estimated), towers pushed, locations/timing of persons deaths compared to teammates deaths (you can figure out if someone is over extending constantly by using the full match history), and a lot of other metrics you can use to assess someone's performance.\n\nIf that Darius player had instead said \"look at my match history, I have highest gold on my team, highest kill participation, highest damage taken as the main frontline, but still substantially more damage dealt than taken\" it would be a much more convincing argument. But not only does he not meet those metrics, indicating a mediocre performance at best, but the first metric he cites is not even KDA or KD, but just number of kills.

I imagine Attack speed is awesome on Karma's kit (makes me wonder if an AP/AS build could work with Nashor's Tooth, Lich Bane, Wit's End, and maybe even Devourer Enchantment if you jungler Karma! Throw in a Death Cap and Sorc Shoes and you're ready to go?).\n\nFirst off, establishing credibility: I played 176 ranked Karma games last year, in mid, supp, top, jungle, and apc bot. I've played many more unranked karma games in weirder places. [Source](http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Hyrum+Graff).\n\nHere's the thing about an attack speed Karma build: It's never worth it.\n\n- If you are building AP, more AP and cdr is going to give you more damage, and more shields, than AS.\n  - In this case, I'm assuming you're going R-Q every time, for maximum damage.\n  - It's true that with a Nashors + scaling cdr glyphs for 40% cdr will let you ult more often than just cdr, but the damage/shields/mana regen/MR/Grievous Wounds you lose by going Nashors instead of Morello or Athene's simply isn't worth it.\n  - Like, it's do-able, but honestly just not worth it -- seeing those R-Q's hit for massive damage is *fun,* and if you opt into an AS build, you get to throw out more R-Q's but they're not nearly as satisfying.\n\n\n- If you're building tank, {{item:3027}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3075}}, 40% cdr is enough for you to have your ult up every time your W comes off cooldown, for more healing than mundo. (if you're against a higher AP team, swap out your gauntlet for a locket and your thornmail for a sunfire or randuins).\n\n\n- There is one scenario in which building AS is useful, and it's in top lane with this build:\n{{item:3027}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3172}} {{item:3025}} \nYour job is to sit next to your ad carry, shield them, use everything you have (spells, gauntlet, bork active) to peel for them and tank any skillshot headed their way, while you hit the enemy tanks/bruisers with your bork-empowered autos.\n  - I call it my \"SUPER SUPPORT\" build and you can read more about it (and the aforementioned tank build) [here](http://www.solomid.net/guide/view/132781-karma-build-guide-fighter-by-jdelphiki99). The guide was written for pre-5.10 changes, but works pretty much the same way now. Honestly, now the best karma is the full tank karma build I wrote earlier in this post. Always ult-W, never die.","replies":[{"poster":"Quort","date":"2015-06-04T04:29:54.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response!

With the build I mentioned, you'll be healing nearly as much effective hp as a permanent mundo ulti, while having as 3.5s root every 9 seconds, a speed boost for your adc, and a slow with decent damage if you're hitting squishies.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"XxCatatoniCxX","date":"2015-06-05T09:33:40.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The boards turned into Reddit which is well a giant cancerous circle-jerk where if you disagree, like another team, play off meta, or what ever else you're somehow deserving of receiving a giant shit storm.

Doesn&#039;t sound bad, but instead of commenting nice, clean stuff or anything of value, the people commenting proceeded to look up the poster&#039;s match history and began to insult him because it was not an &quot;amazing&quot; KDA. This sounds somewhat normal, but the issue here is that this continued for well over 30 comments. The original poster did not really bother to engage in the argument, as it had now turned into, but many other random people that had nothing to do with it did. It turned into about 5 different people arguing over whether or not a 2.something KDA was good and also arguing over whether or not averaging 18 kills a game was a feat. Seriously. Can we just take a moment to think about how ridiculous this is. Multiple people that had nothing better to do with their time decided to join in an argument they had no business being in. As the title states, stuff like this has to stopppppp.\n\nI guess i'll bite the bait and reply.\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/bsrUJQPd-full-ad-darius-is-the-scariest-thing-in-league\nthats the thread that you're talking about, and if you take a nice look at it you can see that the very first person to mention number of kills and deaths in the game was in fact the OP in response to someone else stating that the strategy may work in bronze, but people at a higher elo will be smart enough to play around it. \nAt the risk of sounding like an asshole: read the thread before you rant about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"brad","date":"2015-06-03T23:00:13.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"who even cares\n\nthe internet is a shithole and this place is no exception","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doctor Dyment","date":"2015-06-03T21:12:39.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I once made a post a while ago about how I wanted to work for Riot in the Lore department, but I didn't want payment for it.
