While in-game if you go to &quot;B&quot; while using the Riot Girl tristana skin, she does not jump onto her cannon as she should and during her dance her cannon glitches in and out of game. Literally happens every time you press &quot;B&quot; or &quot;/Dance&quot;. Also when using her &quot;W&quot; to escape form a voli toss she cannot manage to escape his claws even while in mid air. So either the hit box is 25 units big, OR it is also glitched out.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-03T20:52:34.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThis is a known issue and we're working on a fix.
