He ended up taking a hit to the tune of around 6% which was harder than we'd intended. The only change we'd made was the damage on w, and was a change made in isolation that we then knew for sure how much it did. Backing out half of the changes was us acknowledging that we'd overshot and were correcting it.\n\nFor Twitch it's a bit less clear cut, but our PTA buffs weren't large enough to warrant the magnitude of the nerf we gave him. We're still talking about whether or not we need to go back a bit on our nerfs from 8.4, but it's much in the same spirit as with Kog. \n\nGenerally we're going to try to be better about immediately correcting changes that went too far (in either direction), since we have a much clearer picture of the magnitude of their impact.","replies":[{"poster":"Daunt","date":"2018-03-01T12:41:11.933+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't think there's a point replying to posts like these.
