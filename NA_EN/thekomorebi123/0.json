I went on the next day to check what had happened and found that i have lost 30lp, (even though i only get 11lp per game for winning) and got a 5 game 20minute long que wait time as I apparently quote unquote 'Quit The Game'. I find this extremely distressful as it just wastes my time for no reason whatsoever as i did not quit and it was the LOL servers that crashed. Besides I was steadily climbing elo and all 3 wins (approximately altogether took 2 hours in length and got me 32 lp) were all wasted for no reason. Is this fair do you think? If anyone can help me out with this issue that would be nice, otherwise this game is not worth my time. League of legends should respect my time given towards the game and take this into account, please help me out here if possible. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-29T16:17:52.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe there were any issues with the server, but any widespread issue would have had enabled loss prevention.  The lower priority queue is a great period to troubleshoot whatever is causing you to leave games and get it resolved before the match starts.  The only way to restore your standing with the [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system is by playing without any continued issues.  I'm happy to help with that, just give me some more detail and we can try to get that fixed up.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"TheKomorebi123","date":"2016-09-29T23:11:32.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok. Thank you for following up on this, I just figured out that my brother was messing around with the router so it wasn't the server that was bad it was my fault, I apologize for this. However he did it unexpectedly without telling me so if possible can i get this lower priority que removed for my account? I assure you it wont happen again.","replies":[]}]}]}
