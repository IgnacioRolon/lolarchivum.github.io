Why are they unavilable? As shown in the attached image, I own Riven and her other three skins are available for purchase, but not her Dragonblade skin. I have also noticed that all the other Lunar Revel skins, including the 2015 skins, which are not supposed to legacy, are also missing from the shop.\n\nEdit: Issue resolved!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-18T06:46:03.838+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're not legacy skins, and shouldn't leave the store.
