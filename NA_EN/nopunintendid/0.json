Considering conventional wards were removed entirely, a support and \"some\" junglers will be the only people who have a possibility of overlapping their trinket wards and a normal ward due to SS purchase, and most if not all supports should be trading their trinket for oracles the second they have SS. The distinction between placement sounds doesn't seem important anymore since it should be obvious what was placed.","replies":[{"poster":"LegendaryLemur","date":"2015-11-14T01:09:27.738+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems to me the sound for a trinket vs a pink is still different, which would apply in plenty of scenarios.","replies":[{"poster":"Wisenheimer","date":"2015-11-14T01:27:44.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I've read though, the sound overlaps between sightstone and Pinkward.  The only reason trinkets had different sounds from what I can tell from Katey's post is that it was due to trinkets have a lower cd/time placed than normal wards (nothing between normal wards and pink wards). Since trinkets are now the only way to place normal wards aside from SS this seems irrelevant.","replies":[{"poster":"LegendaryLemur","date":"2015-11-14T01:30:29.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm not sure i understand what you are saying.  Even if you can't differentiate between a SS ward and a pink, you should still be able to tell btwn a yellow trinket ward and a pink by sound, right?","replies":[{"poster":"Wisenheimer","date":"2015-11-14T01:37:10.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that knowing who placed the ward (ie. support or someone else) should be all the information a person needs to determine the length of the ward.
