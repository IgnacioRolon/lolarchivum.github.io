Most of the time this is a direct result of local network configurations that conflict with League. I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step in troubleshooting this.\n\nLet me know if those steps helped.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AxlRose09","date":"2016-10-06T03:03:43.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having this same issue!

Then I pressed Tab+ Alt to switch windows, and I come back, for a split second you can see the regular loading screen but after a split second, the screen turns black. The game itself still loads but I just have a black screen. It even manages to join the game but I can't see anything except hear the game sounds.","replies":[]}]}
