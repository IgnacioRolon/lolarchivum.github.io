I check in the signup page frequently to see if anything has changed, but it recently started giving me the message ERROR 500. I've tried using Cyberghost to see if it's server side, but still nothing. Anything I can do to fix this?\n\nEDIT: I actually went to my Email for once and discovered that I've already been accepted, I just needed to make an account. Clicking the link in the email netted me the above result. Really could use some guidance here.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-13T23:56:24.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the time being, the [**PBE signups**](http://status.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/#pbe) and account creation pages are down for maintenance.
