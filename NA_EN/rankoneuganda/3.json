I went through 8 priority queues. you know how many more I have to go through. 3. 3 of them bugged out I had the client reset the timer 3 times. I literally had over an hour of queue time and the client just wouldn't put me up to queue.\n\nthe second time I hit decline by accident\n\nThe third time it also did what it did the first time. it just ignored the fact that It just ended and resetted again. \n\n\nOne I forgot happened. but just happaned again.\n\nthe timer randomly resetted at a random time.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/IW8r7\n\n\nI swear I didn't deliberately exit the queue and show you a false timer. It literally resetted 14 minutes in for no obvious reason while I was afk in the background. I have been queueing for 6 hours today.

Your timer only stays the same if you accepted the queue and either someone else declined or left the champion select lobby. If you had over an hour of queue time ticking, something is most likely off. I personally would have canceled it past 2 minutes if nothing connected at all and restarted the queue.
