I am d5 and i was 0 lp and then after the client froze I guess it counts as a dodge and I now have -3 LP. Should I be worried of my MMR?

The next step would otherwise be -10 lp and a longer lower priority queue.  Your MMR really be impacted in minor cases like this.  \n\nRegarding the issue itself, it sounds like you could be having an unstable connection that's cutting you off during champion select.  It's likely the same would happen on the legacy client too.  Using any third party programs can cause this too, so you'll want to shut those off as a first step.  Afterwards, run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your network is in good shape.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2017-03-17T17:21:42.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add to this: If you are using the new client and you're on an older/slower computer, try enabling low-spec mode. A friend of mine was having issues with freezing and not loading into games, which cleared up after he turned on low-spec mode in the new client.","replies":[]}]}]}
