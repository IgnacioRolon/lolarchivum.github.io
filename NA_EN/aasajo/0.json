The only problem is these crazy lag spikes I get, they range from 1,000 to about 4,000 ping and last for up to ten seconds. In multiple games, I've had about five of these spikes before the fifteen minute mark. \r\nAt first I thought it was my connection, but I ruled it out because every other MoBa and every other online multiplayer game doesn't suffer from any spikes.\r\nDota2 - No Lag\r\nCS:GO - No Lag\r\nSmite - Minimal Lag\r\nHoN - No Lag\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else have this problem? If it's a serverside or an update problem that will be patched out I can push through it. But if it's a problem on my side that I can not fix (or something that RIOT is unwilling to fix), I'm not going to put time or money into a game that gives me these problems.\r\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-21T04:54:53.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm unable to find any recorded incidents server-side, so I'm inclined to believe this is caused by poor routing to our servers, as is commonly the case.

Next, plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field, then start the trace. After 5 minutes has passed by, export your results as text and paste them here in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you run into issues taking those steps.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"thesuperpewpew","date":"2016-11-22T00:17:45.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has been happening to myself and many people for a few days now.
