It says \"We're unable to log you in because you may be offline\", when my internet was still working.\r\n\r\nI have tried all of these below, is there anything else to do?\r\n\r\n- Restarted router and computer. \r\n- Tried to add different DNS. \r\n- Tried to Go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config \r\nOpen \"LeagueClientSettings.yaml\" with notepad \r\nFind the line: gameflow-patcher-lock:\r\nBut i didnt have that line. Deleted that file anyway, a new one came up. No difference.\r\nAsked my friend to send his file to me. Tried with and without the \"line\". No succes.\r\n- Reinstalled the game a couple of times.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat else to do? Everything else working on my computer that needs internet (including other games). \r\n\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"DeftQuiver","date":"2017-10-30T16:26:54.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was this ever resolved?
