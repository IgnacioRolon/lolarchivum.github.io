Saying your opening up a conversation is extremely  disengenous if you take even a tiny look at the tone used here.\n\nRealistically, a smarter complaint is that it took a fine-grained system with lots of low-impact choices and replaced it with a system with only a few high impact choices, which left a lot of rough edges -- especially, at first, in some of the choices about what rune stats became champion base stats and which ones didn't. (The newfound extra damage that champions like Leona and Ezreal -- who deal a lot of magic damage but would've never taken mpen -- got from the removal of MR blues, for example, was an obvious initial problem.) \n\nIf I wanted to complain about specific runes, Klepto seems like an easy target to bash because the level of RNG seemed excessive for a competitive game, regardless of how many controls got put on it, and it ultimately only became a top lane+ezreal rune even though it looked like it was supposed to be aimed at supports. \n\nAll that being said, I'm personally glad we got runes reforged (the old runes system required stifling amounts of IP if you wanted optimal setups for multiple champions, and it also made it significantly harder to fill and offrole), but it's definitely less flexible than the old system, more volatile by design, and comes with its own set of problems (and arguably fewer levers to pull to fix them, since there are fewer rune choices now than there used to be rune+mastery choices -- though I imagine not having to hassle about IP refunds every time a rune gets removed or changed is very, very nice).  It was a large transition that was not handled perfectly and still has its issues even now, with a not-insignificant amount of champions stuck with suboptimal keystones, and some utter duds of keystones like Lethal Tempo. Still, the tradeoffs are much better for player QoL in the longterm, once these issues are ironed out. ...The issue is just getting them ironed out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Draehl","date":"2018-04-12T04:51:05.296+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd say Runes Reforged is an amazing system in concept, (I love the UI and how easy it is to swap runes on the fly!) but in reality due to how certain runes and keystones interact with champion kits it tends to pick winners and losers, forcing builds and invalidating others.\n\nI used to play a {{champion:432}} offtank build that feels quite ineffective right now.

There are runes that some champions can't even use at all, further limiting choices. What happened to full AP rune pages or full crit rune pages. What happened to the fun of bringing weird combinations of runes to have 1000HP at level1 or lv 1 60% crit chance? You took a system which could be experimented with and threw it out so we could do what exactly? All have stopwatches for three months? Its not like the zhonyas effect was kept out of AD champions hands and gated behind an 800 gold combined cost for any tempo reasons at all ....  \n\nOr how about how having stronger runes takes focus away from champion strengths and instead pushes the focus on the flat power everyone gets which homogenizes how games play out and detracts from the focus on the champions. \n\nMaybe a problem is that we were told that the choices we made with runes would alter how we play and not just be stat buffs/hidden power which many of them are. The runes system largely turned into a set of cookie cutter builds with little choice which was the exact problem you set out to solve in the first place and for all the dev time spent it doesn't feel like we've made gains in that direction. \n\nAnother problem is that runes now give large amounts of on demand flat power in the early game which covers the weaknesses of late game scaling champions while also hyper-accentuating the oppressiveness of early game snowball champions. This has created a meta where you snowball the laning phase as quickly as possible leaving the enemy team too far behind to contest anything and just watching themselves slowly lose. Even scaling champions take this route because now they are lower risk early while still having high rewards for making it to mid/late game and snowballing the game the way masteries enable means they can hit late game very early. \n\nOf course all of this has been said many times over the past few years, but let's blame the OP for being frustrated that these issues haven't been addressed for years.

It meant that instead of choosing the masteries that could benefit our champions, it was choosing the champions that complimented the masteries since they added that much power and influence to them, while others went that entire 2 year period basically having no answer to those who could abuse their keystone more than they could.  \n\nTurns out I was wrong.  You spent that whole period trying to fix something that was built broken, then you took everything you didn't learn from that update, and made something even worse in season 8 by adding EVEN MORE POWER to the game on top of the abysmal failure of the class updates which added more asinine damage, and then took away our means of defense by combining the runes and masteries into one giant clusterfuck of a bad idea.  Then consider how towers have (not) been changed over time, and we wonder why they're paper mache which leads to shorter lane phases, and we get a mastery for destroying them _faster??_ Gee, I wonder why games are being decided so soon this season.  Surely it's just player perception...\n\nYou think maybe it's because of the runes, the class updates, the gold income buffs, the minion pushing changes, the elemental dragons adding scaling power, the baron minion buffs, the item overhauls, or maybe the introduction of broken items that require constant updates?  Truth be told, it's all of this and more, but the Runes Reforged update is one of the primary reasons people are exploding again just like they were in season 6.  You want to reduce the damage?  Revert everything back to season 5's system, and give our real runes back.  You guys are making things extremely difficult for your balance team by continuing down this path, and it would benefit every party to go back to the system that didn't literally break everyone and everything it touched, and didn't give reasons to nerf specific champions into the ground just because they abused certain masteries, or to that point, masteries just because one champion abused them while their other users suffer because of it.  \n\nThe only problem with this is that you've wasted so much time and resources on this update that I assume going backwards would be heretical to bring up in a meeting.  It would be amusing to see your sycophants 180 and praise you for doing this after 2 and a half seasons of defending keystones though, just like they did when you stopped doing class reworks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ExternalLink","date":"2018-04-12T17:14:12.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maple Nectar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FYIHMWTn,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-04-12T04:05:25.763+0000)\n>\n> Reframing this so that a player, or a rioter could even begin to approach this as a topic would probably do you good. As it is right now there is a lot of opinion stated as facts. Saying your opening up a conversation is extremely  disengenous if you take even a tiny look at the tone used here.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that Runes Reforged is a flashy gimmick.\nThe flaws of the old (Prior to Keystones) Rune-page/Mastery system were blatant, Rune Pages and Runes were expensive, which gated choice and accessibility, especially for new players. There was nothing more painful than having to choose to buy a new Rune Page over a flashy new champion.\n\nThe Benefits of Runes Reforged is that it's completely free - you can edit your runes in champion select (something that people were asking for for years), so being forced to buy new rune pages for champion or build path variation is now a thing of the past.\n\nThe down side is that it's accelerated something that has been fatal to the meta and enjoy-ability of many games - damage creep. \n\nThe final mastery available in the old Rune System's offensive tree was Havoc, which allowed for 3% damage amplification. Compare that to today's Thunderlord, which allows for 50-220 base damage + 50% bonus ad or 30% AP, and it becomes painstakingly easily to see why people on boards are constantly complaining about damage being too high. Especially when you consider that some other Keystones grant as much, if not even more damage depending on the champions kit.\n\nYou could argue that that's offset by the introduction of runes such as Summon Aery and other defensive masteries. But now we've landed in a precarious situation where Runes Reforged now has a sizeable impact on the balance of the game. The old Runes/Masteries were important, yes, but very rarely so important that champions actually had to be balanced around them. Now, however, Riot has to embark on the delicate task of balancing champions, itemisation, and Runes Reforged all at once  - because if one falls out of sync, you end up with things such a pre-nerf Klepto GP top.\nAnother example of this is Bruisers, who fell out of favour massively and required a new Rune to be introduced just for them. (and even then, you can still argue that their needs still aren't being entirely met since, as I'm sure you're aware, the balance of Top Lane is still a much complained about issue)\nOr even champions such as Fiddlesticks who, with the jungle changes and Runes Reforged changes, simply can't function as they once could. He relies on sustain so the universal increase in burst, as well as the fact that there isn't really a rune that he truly synergises with, has left Fiddlesticks mains wanting. \n\nAnd this is just a focus on the Keystones, the secondary Runes are arguably even more of a problem.\nRunes such as Bone Plating, Second Wind, Mana Flow Band and Commencing Stop Watch have really only served to minimise the weaknesses that were imposed on them by the previous balance team while accentuating their strengths, but in turn limiting skill expression. \nFor example, commencing stopwatch had to be nerfed multiple times because it negatively impacted on the meaningful choices that an early game champion, or early game focused role could make. I remember one Korean clip where a fight broke out at level 4 botlane with like 8 people involved,and nearly every single one of them used stop-watch and essentially made the plays made by the other teams meaningless. Similarly, with it, a champion such as Orianna could double-down on her advantage as a notoriously safe-pick, and effectively become immune to the engages of assassins such as Zed or Talon - with a single rune meaningful agency has been taken from them. Meanwhile Mana flow band for some reason allows Mana champions to spam their abilities without hesitation...so Orianna who was once gaited by mana now isn't, and is effectively pseudo-resource-less, now agency has been removed in two ways. Commencing Stopwatch removes the reward of targeting her health pool, while Manaflow band prevents you from fighting with her resource bar. \nI'm not using this as an example to specifically point the finger at Orianna as something that's balanced/imbalanced...but this kind of distortion of what should be meaningful strengths and weaknesses of champions/classes can be seen throughout Runes Reforged, such as certain runes negating the weak early that tanks traditionally should suffer from, which is honestly bad balance since such trends are not only frustrating to play against, but can also require for target nerfing of certain champions or items because they synergise too well, even though they are otherwise balanced.\n\nAs for Kleptomancy, why Riot would introduce an RNG rune when they've historically had trouble balancing other RNG mechanics such as Dodge and Crit (Dodge was rightfully removed, and Crit has been complained about basically since its inception) is beyond me. \n\nI don't want to type anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2018-04-12T05:37:06.237+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The new runes are good, however they leave so, so, so many holes that the old system filled.\nStacking armor, MR, HP, %HP, or my favorite full scaling AD illaoi.
