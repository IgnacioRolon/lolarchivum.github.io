Also sums should be usable by any player regardless of role).  This way even if you dont pick Smite in pregame, you can still jungle. You shouldnt be screwed for the rest of the game because of what you picked/didnt pick in pregame customization. \n\nHey guys, \n\nNow before I talk about Smite , lets talk about summoners in general. These are generic spells which can help ANYONE in ANY role. \n\nCurrently the most used is FLASH. Almost EVERY champ can benefit from this spell in every game regardless of role, champion type etc. \n\nThe other summoners are also pretty generic: IE if an ADC takes Ignite/ghost its not the end of the world. They can still play and have a fun experience (albeit its a little more dangerous). \n\nWhat I&#039;m saying is summoner spells should be useful to anyone regardless of role, elo, etc and not taking a certain summoner shouldn&#039;t cause you to insta-lose, ever. Summoners should be an added spell that can add some utility, not decide if you win or lose games. \n\nSummoners are an added utility/strategy like runes/masteries etc. Having different runes/masteries/summoners shouldn&#039;t make you auto lose ever. Yes there is probably an optimal build (ie 21/9/0 with ignite flash), but going a different build shouldnt put you at THAT much of a disadvantage. \n\nNow Smite: I&#039;ve seen countless threads on these boards complaining about how they lost because they picked jungle and they didnt choose smite. They are asking Rito to warn players to pick smite if jungling etc. Not picking Smite as a jungler is putting you at a HUUUUUGE DISADVANTAGE, and makes jungling almost impossible. Notice this isnt the case for any other summoner spell. \n\nWhat i&#039;m saying is that Smite should not be a summoner spell because it is so VITAL for the jungler role. Notice how the other summoners arent exactly vital / important. You can still play support just fine if you take ghost/barrier/ teleport etc. If I dont pick Flash, I can still probably play a carry. However If I dont have Smite on a Jungler i&#039;m gonna have a VERY rough time. \n\nOnly a few junglers (nunu,warwick etc) can play/jungle without smite. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the new player experience. New players love to try new and different things, such as TP/ignite mids etc. However Smite is a noob trap for new players; it is almost useless to laners, and if a jungler doesnt have Smite they&#039;re pretty fked. \n\nSeems to me that Smite should not be a summoner spell since its so VITAL/IMPORTANT to the core gameplay of junglers. \nSmite seems like the odd one out, among the rest of the summoners. No other summoner is so important to a role. Not ignite, not flash, not TP. No other summoner has such a huge impact on a playstyle such as Smite. \n\nThat being said, I think the SMITE spell is quite useful and shoudlnt be removed from the game. I just think it shoudlnt be a summoner since its so vital to the jungler role. Perhaps adding a lesser version of Smite to jungler items might be a valid compromise. \n\nI dont think Smite should be a summoner spell since its so Vital to junglers. its not a customization, its a MUST HAVE. I believe this defeats the purpose of having pre-game customization. Nothing you do pregame should determine whether you&#039;re fked in game or not. You should be able to even skip pregame customzation and still have an oppurtunity to win the game. This is almost impossible to do without smite. \n\nThis is just my 2 cents after reading so many posts asking Riot to warn players if they dont have Smite selected. No, the players shouldnt be warned for having wrong runes/masteries/summoners/skins etc. These are all customization&#039;s that ideally shouldn&#039;t really have THAT big of an impact your game. \n\nTLDR: Since Smite is so important and MANDATORY for junglers, I think it should NOT be a summoner spell (which are useful, but not mandatory to all players). Instead this should probably be moved to a jungle item. This way even if you dont pick Smite in pregame, you can still jungle. You shouldnt be screwed for the rest of the game because of what you picked/didnt pick in pregame customization. \n\nWhat do you guys think about Smite being a summoner? Do you think it should remain as is? Or do you think that Smite should be moved to the jungle items/ somehwere else.  I just dont see Smite fitting as a summoner spell since its almost mandatory. No sums should be considered mandatory, and techinically it should be possible to play just fine without summs. \n\nCheers thanks for reading this long post.

There is no AD item that grants 60 AD for just 2625 gold, not even close. Runic Echoes is just 2625 for essentially the exact same item as Luden's Echo, just lower stats but the effect is still there and that's what you want.\n\nBecause junglers get less gold than laners they need more powerful mid game spikes earlier than others. These have been nerfed in the past because laners have bought them, even taken Smite in order to use them in lane. But the cost of a summoner spell for this is pretty high, so it's tolerable (and honestly, if Riot just removed Skirmisher's Sabre from the game it would weaken the lane Smite quite a bit as well).\n\nWe can't remove Smite from the game, it allows junglers to have better items than laners.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TTK Dreadnought","date":"2016-08-01T18:19:19.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its fine to have smite as a summoner spell. it allows for things like double smite for extra objective pressure.
