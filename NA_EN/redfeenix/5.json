Solo q is the best way to determine skill accurately. And they want diamonds+ to have solo q for more competitive matches. \n\nBut i&#039;m sure ALL PLAYERS in ALL ELOS would appreciate more competitive games. If solo q is really that important for competitive integrity, why not give it to us plebs too? I would LOVE solo Q even if I&#039;m not Diamond.\n\nThis is a great incentive to get to Diamond next year actually. I can finally play SOLO Q again? Hell fkn yeah I&#039;m gonna spamm rank and hopefully one day I can enjoy SOLO Q again. You know the SOLO Q thats existed since the start of League, and considered the Lifeblood of the game? \n\nSigh very dissapointed that Solo Q is not comming back this year either. I think thats really messed up man.... This reminds me of when runescape removed trading/PVP to combat bots or something. Please dont ruin core aspects of your game which the players love (ie SOLO Q).... not all change is good Riot. \n\nWhat do you guys think about Riot&#039;s ranked post? Do you think lower elos deserve solo q? Or should we just stick with DQ and only reward the top % of the playerbase with fair matches. \n\nPlease post your thoughts below.","replies":[{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2016-08-24T21:01:48.268+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":51,"body":"I don't think it makes a difference before diamond.

I look up ranks before my ranked games and every other game has a huge variance. I hate blaming one person but played a ranked game the other day where I had a gold 2 teammate queue with a silver 5 player on my team. Everyone else on the other team was gold as were we besides or silver 5 jungle. I usually just look at everyone as the same but... honestly this  silver 5 dude just got wrecked. We could have done better as a team but our jungler was like 3-9 and the enemy jungle had double his farm. It was such a huge disadvantage. I was also mad because I had double the enemy adc farm in a 25 min game :(. Enemy adc literally had like 103 cs in over 20 mins with only 2 kills and still got a win.

They are respectively from G1-G4.\nI believe that under this system, you can invite all 4 players under the same premade.\nWith the new tighter restrictions (Same tier only, +1/-1 division max) and limited to first player who invites:\n\nG3 player wants to make a premade. He can invite only G2,3,4 players.\nHe invites a G2 and G4 person. He then extends the invites to them as he has no more people to invite. Both players (G2 and G4) can invite only players who are G2,3 and 4 because they are bound by the same invite rules from the first person. They cannot respectively invite a G5 or G1 players in the same party.\n\nSo the proper 4 man premade is now made out of G2,3,4,3. The average group ELO would be G3 and one solo player from G2-4 (same restrictions as invites) may be put into the group to complete a team.\n\nIf there are 3 people in a premade, it's G2,3,4, That's still G3 ELO. 2 people who fall into G2-4 may be randomed to complete a team.

At that point, a lot of people get to have fun with friends and that works up to a certain point where in order to truly progress, you have to play as an individual.\n\nI also understand your point about smurfing but that is to be solved in another way as smurfing can be done in a solo ladder as well.

I do understand that there are people which want to go ranked with only 1-2-3 friends and will not be able to do so in my scenario but i don't find it fair that these groups have an advantage against me:\n\n-voice communication\n-strategies that i can't put in place with 4 other strangers - especially if i have a premade in my team too \n\nThe worst thing about this season is that i coudn't do shortcalls efficiently as the last year: when i tried without premades everything went as smoothly as one year ago, when i had premades in my team they just ignored or insulted me, running in the enemy jungle to get killed 2/3 v 5. Why? \"bc we're having fun\" ._.\"\"\n\nOfc i do realize that sometime i got carried by premades as well and i truly hate that: i don't want to win a game because i got lucky and found more coordinated premades that stomped my enemy midlaner with permaganking and stuff, i want to climb because i managed to do that by myself, otherwise where is the point in that?\n Last year it was a joy to talk about my wins, how i managed to carry with a right shortcall in the right moment, how i stopped a flaming fest against my poor random supports - who followed me in my calls forever and ever with the rest of the team, ecc. Even talking about my poor performances and losses with friends was good, asking them to watch my replays because i coudn't figure out why i lose that specific game and improving day by day.\n\n>If not to boost someone, to use as a backup account for trolling and griefing or generally playing under your true skill level to intentionally stomp on some people.\n\nYeah, but i find this problem far less \"problematic\" than the other one because this behaviour will lead that account to be banned.

That's just what everyone should strive for. I'd say it's impossible to win more games if everyone is just mechanically decent but the team never acts like a team, the players do random things and never help each other to gain advantages.

When in my team there is a good solo player that does something i usually stick with him and help him carry as much as i can and even if i'm not the best in our team for that specific game i feel like i contributed to the win far more than the first case.\n\n >We've all had the games where you do good in lane but the team starts falling apart when teamfights start happening. \n\nYep but usually you could have done something to sort out the situation before teamfights, for example as a midlaner i usually realize after a loss that i could have helped top/bot more in specific situations so that we could probably have won that game. For sure there are game that you can't win because is not only you playing but communication is far more difficult when you have a premade in your team: for my little experience they just don't listen to you, whether you call an ss or you call for an objective they just want to \"hang out\" with their friends. I have never met yet a good and nice premade that listen to the rest of its team too (ofc i found some solutions to this problem, but this situation it's really unnerving and frustrating).\n\n>As far as smurfs in low ELO go, if they never announce that to us, it's impossible to detect them. Riot may know but unless we can report them for behavior that's violating the SC, they won't get punished.\n\nWell they may  damage low elos ranked although i don't think it's a huge effect because if they are good they  just climb pretty fast again and if they try to troll/flame they'll get banned. But what happens when these smurfs (let's say 3 diamond players using a virgin account level 30 each) join ranked together with their silver friend? They bring him all the way up to diamond/platin and because everybody wants to show how \"good\" they are this effect is far more predominant and problematic than a latent solo smurf in low elo (i know quite a lot of people that \"magically\" climb all their way from silver till plat/gold with this new feature).\nAlso when this silver player will join ranked by himself he will ruin completely the game for the rest of his team (he probably ruins the game also for his opponent because he's much more easier to beat than the rest of diamond players). \n\nPutting a pure SoloQ will totally prevent this, only the worthy ones will climb all up till there unless you pay to get boosted, but that's totally bannable. Instead if that silver player ranked now in plat is getting reported he will not be banned because didn't break any rules (joining ranked with friends + smurfing is legit).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"rescued","date":"2016-08-25T15:51:35.090+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.

Sure they might be more coordinated during ganks/ team fights or map rotations, but I still think I could beat them.\n\nBut the point is that 5 solo players just dont have that lvl of communication. Therefore yes its possible for 5 skilled solo players to beat a team of 5 on comms, but its realistically not a fair game if one team is on comms and the other isnt. \n\nPlus every game I have to get used to my teammates etc, while premades play with the same people all the time. They will naturally develop some synergy over time, while I have to figure out how good my teammates are / their playstyles each game.\n\nI'm not saying its good or bad, but I am saying that at a fundamental level its not really fair for 5 solos to be matched with a full team of 5. \n\nThey should take a page out of blizzards book. You can only be matched with an enemy party within 2 sizes of yours. \n\nIe 5 solo players will only EVER play vs a max of 3 premades. A 5 man premade can at most be matched with a 3 man premade and 2 others (solo or duo).

In my opinion season 7 should be better than season 6. Not a lot will change at lower elos, but they are going to introduce a way players are recognized as solo or dynamic queue. I think Platinum elo at least lower ranks around plat 1-2 could probably benefit from solo queue more as well. But lower elos dynamic queue vs solo queue is not much different. \n\nPeople try and bitch about it at lower elos but I have played 700 ranked games this season and hardly notice the difference. This is on 3  accounts all of which are only gold 4-5 but my climb whether playing solo or dynamic queue is about the same. I do have more fun playing with friends and would like that option to stay, but I have had a lot of success playing solo as well. So if your a lower level (at least gold 4 - bronze 5 as its all i can vouch for) player and say you can't rank up because of dynamic queue then you just need to improve because I have had no problems. And this is on multiple accounts not just one.","replies":[]}]}
