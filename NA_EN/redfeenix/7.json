Currently Cait does it instantly. This process takes a while and its not instant. Hunters cant just arm a trap and hurl it far and hope it will work.\n\nAlso, the range on her traps are huge. She can place them under enemy tower without gettin in tower range. I think the distance of her cast range should be greatly reduced. \n\nIt would make more sense for her to take a knee, spend a second to arm the trap and then place it where she was standing, rather than her just instantly lobbing 3-4 traps under the enemy tower like pokeballs. \n\nBy reducing her cast range, Cait still has the option of placing traps under the tower, however she must now get closer. This will open up some counterplay options instead of just letting her zone you from looong range. Now she has to take a knee and get closer to do the same. \n\nWhat do you guys think about Cait&#039;s traps? Do you think it would make more sense for her to reduce her cast range , or for her to spend more time casting / channeling as she arms her traps. Plus I dont think you can just toss a bear trap like that IRL. You have to carefuly place them on the ground. \n\nLet me know. I think cait is pretty balanced but the distance/speed she can lay traps is a little obnoxious and a little unrealistic. \nI love Cait, but I think she can be a lil oppressive with her traps. Hopefully this makes her more fun to play against. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Renascent","date":"2016-07-24T23:16:20.101+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the distance she places the things, you'd think she'd be lobbing them rather than gently tossing them onto the ground, which is how she looks right now.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-07-25T01:47:11.596+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"but that comes with the concept of {{champion:51}} . being able to do damage from afar. if you make her get \"closer\" to set traps then she is exposed and vulnerable. once {{champion:51}} is close the whole concept of her kit goes out the window. but i dont hear any one bitching about the range of {{champion:17}} shrooms and you cant see the fukers. the shrooms can bonus off the other one and go further. and no one likes {{champion:17}}","replies":[{"poster":"Renascent","date":"2016-07-25T01:53:24.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My comment contains nothing about gameplay, only aesthetic.

That way these traps are pre-placed before a fight, not during a fight. If you get caught in a trap, its because Cait carefuly planned and placed it there when she was at that spot, not because she lobbed a trap halfway across the lane. \n\nYes she is a long range marksman, but her trap is a utility skill. I think it would make sense to place it at her feet, as it makes the skill way more difficult to use. She can still be a long range bully for sure, she just needs some time to get close to place her traps. \n\nThink about how snipers work. They place traps/ safegaurds around their post.

It requires actual set up. It's more similar to a Teemo shroom. Also, Jhin's traps can't zone from tower because they are actually tangible and can be seen from stealth if you place them in tower range.\n\nCaitlyn, however, can just wait for a Blitz hook/Morg snare/Lux snare and toss her traps under them and combo them. Even though the traps that Jhin and Teemo place take a while to arm. As well, Cait can just put a line of traps under enemy tower to zone them, and they can't do anything about them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XeroKimo","date":"2016-07-25T12:27:24.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't want her traps to be placed right on top of her, shortening the trap placement range by like 200 would be fine enough, if you have the traps only being able placed on top of you, that just throws out her lane bully style and be buffed to be compensated as either a hyper carry or mid game adc.

First and fore-most is that is range is not nearly as long, on top of him not having a dash, hard CC, or reliable AoE. On top of that, his traps are 100% disabled by red trinket, and they can be destroyed without setting them off. \n\nHis kit is so weak that he can't do anything reliably outside of split-push top vs melees.
