No wonder Riot's been shady with the actual numbers. \n\nThey will use these rank emblems and other stats to prove to us that we do not need solo q. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?

Dynamic que is an inferior system that judges rank more poorly, but it is here to stay. Why? Because it represents a business decision from Riot to attract a larger crowd to their game, they want MORE money and MORE people playing the game. Runescape, another f2p game, did the exact same thing, pandering to a casual demographic for more $$$. Look at Runescape now, not dead, but far beyond glory days. League is doing the same, we probably havent noticed it as players, but League has slown down, it's certainly not closing to falling over and dieing like other games that have done this yet, but I bet you it will, Riot will do something more incredibly stupid than this, and that will mark the end of League being a mainstream form of culture, and will dilute to into a cliche.

If Riot wants respect from the players, they should show respect to us.\n\nYou guys have been showing your ass ever since Dynamic Queue was released. You have it wrong completely, if you want respect you need to show respect. Riot hasn't disrespected you at all, you've disrespected Riot every inch of the way.\n\nThe reason Riot refuses to comment on ANY, and I do mean ANY Dynamic Queue threads is because in every fucking thread you're all raving and hating on them (And Dynamic Queue) over every single perceived problem with the system. It's quite simply better for them to ignore you from a Public Relations perspective, than risk talking and having you explode on them or argue endlessly. One Rioter actually tried to explain this to you all and you fucking buried him, he hasn't commented since, and he was one of the more liked Rioters too that was rather popular.\n\nIn Riots words, if they said they'd bring something back, but later believed it would destroy the game if they did, they shouldn't be expected to bring it back. Furthermore, they didn't lie. You're lieing as much as they did right now. Want to know how? Because you're saying something without knowing if it's actually true, the same thing Riot did. When they said they were going to bring Solo-Q back, they meant it. That's not a lie. They only decided not to later after multiple staff meetings and brainstorms.\n\nI can't believe what i'm reading. I swear to god you people don't know how a Company works. Not even the faintest idea.\n\nThe reason Riot canceled the return of SoloQ is because they have the stats (Not you, and with how you're acting you wouldn't change your mind even if you did) if the stats were bad, Riot would've already returned to Solo-Q or made crazy adjustments to dynamic Queue. They're very obviously good from a business perspective.\n\nAnd the saddest part about it, RedFeenix. You have 32 games in ranked this Season. You don't even KNOW what you're talking about. You're just complaining. As someone with well over 400 games in Ranked this Season, and the Solo-Badge, I can say with certainty that Dynamic Queue isn't even CLOSE to as bad as you guys think it is, infact most of the problems in Dynamic Queue were in Solo Queue as well. It's the same thing as all those people who want to go back to ELO instead of the Tier system, which is archaic and only meant for 1v1 games, it doesn't even work properly with a team game.\n\nPS: Mods, i'm sorry if I went a bit harsh on this, you can remove the post if I went overboard.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-07-11T03:59:10.910+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":7,"body":"Riot has LIED. CONSTANTLY. They did not have the stats in the first months when they intentionally delayed soloq. They delayed solo so dynamic would have monopoly over ranked market and then they delayed the soloq more and more until they axed it completely instead of allowing natural selection to have its way.\n\nAnd no, Riot wouldnt have changedd shit even if it was bad. Look at Runescape and WOW. Despite how many people left they didnt change anything. You overestimate the inteligence of upper managements.\n\nAlso, decide are soloq wanters are the majority or the minority already! How would bringing back soloq destroy dynamic if we are the minority? Unles peopl would prefer soloq, but that is our point!

One Rioter \"Tried\" to explain. Link to me, because i know that the usual \"explaining\" is just some bullshit that is supportedd by nothing. If you mean in the post where they say soloq is axed then people downvoted because they disagreed and gave pretty good arguments against.\n\nAnd it ddoesnt matter how many times you played in the current system, i stopped playing it because its factually unfair. YOu can look at the system from practical perspective and see logically that it is unfair. The problems that dynamicq has are not that soloq had. Only some of them, and dynamic makes them worse!\n\nThey lied and mislead people constantly, if we are the minority and soloq is useless why didnt they implement it to show us wrong?

If you're like this, then play completely solo in your ranked games and bring your premades to normals/ranked teams if you actually want solo queue and your solo badge.\n\nI realize that, as a purely solo player, you might see the disadvantages of doing this. Angry/untalkative premades on your team that make ranked less fun, coordinated premades on the opposing team (even though they're normally balanced out by a premade on your own team) that seem to crush you, and more. **You'll just have to deal with that then.** Because if you don't, then you'll be forcing other solo players to deal with the exact same crap that you feel other premades put you through as a solo player.
