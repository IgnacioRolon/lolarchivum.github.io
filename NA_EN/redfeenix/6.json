Please feel free to leave your thoughts about the new Yorick below. \n\nEdit: Just remembered that pressing control + 3 on Pentakill Yorick makes him play the guitar (animation), but there is no music/sound. I'm not sure if this is a bug or the sound isnt in game yet, but if I press control+3 on Pentakill yorick and he pulls out his guitar, I'm gonna expect some sort of tune (just like Sona's control+3). He aint about air guitar, this guy is a Pentakill rockstar. \n\nThis is not an in depth analysis or anything, just my initial thoughts after playing him. \n\n1. Unfortunately I have to say Yorick put me to sleep. This starts at his voice over. The low sleepy voice actor makes me drowsy . He has a very soothing voice, but it makes my eyelids heavy. This has nothing to do with his playstyle, its just the champion voice lines. \n\n2. Playstyle: He plays very similary to Nasus. Stay in lane and farm all day. and last hit with q. His q is almost exactly the same: do dmg and heal a bit. \nFirst of all, the q on hit mechanic for next auto is very boring. Talon&#039;s q, Nasus q etc are all the same skill essentially. Its kinda meh. \nSecond, he has a lot more damage than Nasus, for using the same skill. I THink this might be his AD ratios, but yorick packs a punch with his q compared to nasus. \nLike the skill is fine, its just a little boring. Its just a simple auto attack enhancing spell, that we&#039;ve seen in many many champs. The minion summoning aspect of it is cool too, but I&#039;m not sure how thats different than his passive. Its just a little TOO similar to Nasus Q.\nEdit: His q does NOT proc on towers, so his splitpushing is a little stunted. Its too bad, with the short cooldown q, Yorick could probably splitpush and take out towers as fast as nasus. \n\n2. Minions: Love the minions. Its not too OP or opressive, and it has good click zones. These are awesome. \n\n3. W: Great spell and gives Yorick some aoe CC. I liked the spell since I was easily able to trap multiple squishies with it. \n\n4. E: This is a little weird. Having such an interesting targetting shape would make you think this is some sort of cool niche spell. However, in my experience it felt a little lackluster. It does minimal damage but makes your ghouls jump on the target. The skill feels pretty lackluster and its only good to sick your summons on the enemy.\n\nMaybe this can be improved by making the impact feel more awesome, right now the actual animation is meh and the sound isnt too exciting. Making the animation something like this would be cool (some sort of explosion/smoke effect). (he uses the skill at the 5 second mark)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRXz7ySiIl0 \n\nR: was pretty excited about this ultimate but in game its sorta meh. First the avatar sorta just blends into the background. Not as much as project Ash&#039;s ultimate but enough so its not really noticable. Its also not very epic looking. Looks like a random ghost with a sheet. \n\nSecond the avatar attacks random targets. So often its not very helpful. For example, if the avatar locks onto someone far from you, its kinda useless as you have to focus the correct target. I think the correct way to use this skill is cast it close to a tank, and use the bonus hp damage to kill the tank. I wish we could choose the avatar&#039;s targets though, that would probably make it more satsifying to use. \n\nOverall: I found his playstyle very similar to nasus. Last hit with Q. However he was a little boring because thats all you do. Trade with Q or last hit with Q. Wish his other spells were more cohesive to use as a combo. The voice actor was really good, but he made me feel very sleepy, and further made me think of playing yorick as boring. This is probably just me but sounds affect my playstyle a lot, and I hate playing champs with annoying/ weird voices (talia etc). \n\nAnyways just my two cents. Really love his artwork though , in game model and minions look dope. \n\nKudos to the champion update team. So this is League&#039;s version of the Necromancer eh? Pretty good, but a little lackluster compared to the real Necromancer \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC7AdjaAE2o","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-08-23T22:33:30.559+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">but yorick packs a punch with his q compared to nasus.\n\nsomeone sucks at stacking on nasus.","replies":[{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-08-23T22:35:53.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No need to post passive comments friend, its just an observation\n\nYorick Q does significantly more damage than Nasus at almost all stages of the game.

In fact I actively try to go ahead and kill the jungler enemy laner etc early game. \n\nSo Nasus's slow start makes him a little meh for me. \n\nHowever, I do love my Rito Nasus Skin and he does great at higher lvls.
