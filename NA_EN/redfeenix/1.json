Why do we need to ban 10 champs every game? Maybe I want to play a game with all OP champs? \n\nHey guys,\n\nSo they&#039;ve more or less implied that next season their gonna offer 10 bans per game ie 1 ban for each player.\n\nWhile this will make champ select even longer, I think it&#039;s fair for every player to have a way to shape their game in the form of a ban.\n\nHowever I personally enjoy playing against all champions and before I used to always skip my bans. This is because I don&#039;t really think anyone is OP and I enjoy playing against anyone.\n\nExcept fizz fuck that champ.\n\nSo can we make bans optional again? Maybe I don&#039;t wanna ban anyone that game. Maybe I don&#039;t like being forced by riot to ban even though I don&#039;t want to.\n\nI think banning 10 unique champs per game is too much, and  they shouldn&#039;t force everyone to ban a different champ.\n\nWhat do you guys think should bans be optional next season, since evey player will get a ban? Or should we still force everyone to ban champions? Do you think banning 10 unique champions every game is gonna be healthy for the game?\n\nLet me know\n\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2016-08-28T19:25:46.760+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember the old days when you were first pick. You asked for any preferred ban and nobody answer it or just said nah and then you proceed to skip all bans. xD \n\nWhen they confront me about the no bans I will always say, I asked before hand and you said nothing xD Normally people then woudl suggest a champion for the last ban.

Not because I wanted to tilt my teammates pregame, but because honestly I dont think any champion is THAAAT OP that they have to be banned. \n\nThat being said yes I often use bans because some champs are really overtuned ATM.

Can you leave a match in the middle of it to go make a sandwich?  No. Can you dive the enemy 1v5 and die over and over again? No, that's called intentional feeding and if you do it repeatedly you'll get banned.  \n\nLeague is a game with rules, and it's also a team game in which the individual players matter less than the enjoyment of the team as a whole.
