The results will be available in the chat, and the box wont be blocking your screen if you voted already. Great idea ! \n\nEdit: thanks so much for the support !

You can see how many members of your team want, or don't want, to surrender. If after the second \"NO\" vote it closed, then you wouldn't know how many players in your team really want to surrender.\nYou could be the only one to want the surrender (20% of the team); it could be 2 players (40%); or it could be 3 (60%).\nThere's a reason why it doesn't close right after the second \"NO\" vote and what I said might just be that reason.\n\nHowever, I don't think we need the surrender window to be open a full minute after the second \"no\". Instead of a 2 minute surrender window it could be only 1 minute and be reduced to 30 seconds after the 2nd \"no\".\nIt's painful to see that window sitting there while the 5th member doesn't vote either \"yes\" or \"no\" for no reason; I already know that we won't surrender - yet.","replies":[{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-07-15T15:27:13.928+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know what I think that's a totally valid compromise.

What the OP is saying is that the surrender vote should close as soon as there's a 2nd \"no\" vote.\nImagine this:\n- Player 1 wants to surrender.\n- Player 2 and 3 vote \"No\"\n- The surrender window closes because there's already two \"no\" votes.\n- Player 4 and 5 didn't vote \"Yes\" or \"No\" because it wouldn't make a difference to the decision.\n\nDo you understand now what I said? This is what the OP was suggesting. There's a reason why it doesn't close automatically, even tough the \"decision\" is already made. It gives everyone a chance to vote yes or no, regardless of the outcome.\n\nWhat I suggested is that the time window that we have, to vote either yes or no, should be shorter; especially when there's already two \"no\" votes.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2016-07-27T14:33:55.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thx for telling me how it acully works","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-07-16T00:18:01.933+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd prefer they remove it after the player has voted.\n\nI've already weighed in on the decision and I'll see the results in chat afterwards.\n\nI don't need it clogging up the screen in the meantime.","replies":[{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-07-16T00:21:10.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh this is great !

Are you one of thse that likes to surrender? Personally I enjoy fighting till the end\n\nIt isn't a matter of liking to surrender, it's facing reality. In some games, there is a point in which you know for a fact that you have already lost. You see it in every elo, even master/challenger. Something will happen and then one team will just \"open mid\" because they know they lost already and would rather move on to the next game instead of wasting 30 more minutes trying to stall out a losing game. That is because stalling out losing games is simply inefficient. In the time it takes to stall out losing games, you could have easily made more LP by surrendering and playing more games in the long run.\n\nBut that isn't what my post was about. I was simply stating that if 3 people vote yes to surrender and the other 2 people can't even bother to press no, the vote should go through. If they vote no, I have no problem with the vote not going through.","replies":[{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-07-16T19:08:15.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ohhhh so you're saying if its 3-0 click yes , they should surrender.
