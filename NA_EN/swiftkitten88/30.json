Let me put it more simply: Rek'Sai has so much utility in the form of tremor sense that she has to be balanced around this factor for pro play. But for regular players, while it does have it's uses, is not nearly as impactful as it is in coordinated play.\n\n Let's say Rek'Sai has a power budget of 100 that's balanced around the pros. Her tremor sense is 50 when being used at max potential, leaving her other abilities at 50 in total. Well, in solo play since it's extremely difficult to use tremor sense to full potential, let's say its power level is 20. Therefore as a whole she is only at 70/100 because of the discrepancy in the value of tremor sense at pro levels versus regular play. This is the problem right here; that Rek'Sai is balanced around pro play first is what causes issues. \n\nI'm not saying Rek'Sai is a poorly designed champion; she just suffers from being designed to rely too heavily on team coordination, and that leads to the situation where she can't do as well in regular play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nuparu","date":"2016-06-26T04:33:18.059+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"you can make any champ sound weak w/ the way you explained it\n\nrengar is extremely weak, it's a 50/50 they either react and you die a horrible death or you leap in and try and kill the adc, but they can outplay you so you can die anyways. your damaging abilities consist of an autoattack reset, some shit damage in an aoe, and a skillshot that's clunky to land. your ult has such a long cd that if you're not using it optimally then you cant do shit. he's only potent in low elos where you can get away without people seeing your indicator, and even then, you'll still have a chance to fail. \n\nsee?","replies":[{"poster":"MKDkilla","date":"2016-06-26T06:48:24.944+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why are you strawmanning his argument, when he actually makes valid points?
