We feel that the jungle has a lot more room to feel intent-driven, and less like a solvable system with a logical next step. Our overall goal is to make sure that junglers have more elements to interact with, and thus have to make choices about which ones are priorities.\n> \n> Plants\n> \n> When we originally gave camps Smite rewards, we wanted to allow players to decide how they used Smite to secure certain benefits. We think that system was a good start, but over time players broke into two groups: those who have basically “solved” Smiting, and those who haven’t. This makes the whole experience feel pretty deterministic and doesn’t allow for much expression of individual mastery. Moreover, tying that decision making to Smite makes players who take the PvP smite have to budget their smites a bit too much. If you’re setting up for a teamfight, you want to Smite raptors for vision control, the opposing ADC during a teamfight, and maybe dragon afterwards.\n> \n> Enter Plants. We’re introducing interactive plants into the game and spawning them with some degree of variance. These plants should give junglers - and to some degree, other players - impactful decisions to make, without tying those choices to Smite.\n> \n> Camps\n> \n> Jungle optimization is an interesting skill, but right now one of the strongest routes is just going straight through the jungle in order. We want to introduce more variance between the camps, so players can have stronger preferences about which camps to prioritize, rather than merely clearing whatever is nearby and available. When it came down to it, that degree of variance was incompatible with our Smite rewards, which often established clear “best” and “worst” camps.\n>","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-10-12T18:43:53.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, I was referring to the fact that the jungle seems to be greatly changed pretty much every season.","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2016-10-12T18:44:57.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EndlessSorcerer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gp5wtHZk,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-12T18:43:53.379+0000)\n>\n> Actually, I was referring to the fact that the jungle seems to be greatly changed pretty much every season.\n\noh sorry.. my bad... but yeah.. you make a good point there XD","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
