Ki strike refunds a small portion of energy.\n\nQ\n\nVorpal blade: Slim width, medium length line skillshot which penetrates but deals low amount of flat magic damage (scaling with Shen's max hp) to the first target hit, once cast it leaves a spirit sword on its final location.

If the triggering ability successfully affected at least one champion, Ki Barrier's cooldown is reduced by X - X seconds.\n\nActive Spirit Refuge: Shen creates a anti auto attack field for 1.75 seconds at his location.\n\nE \n\nShadow dash: return damage reduction from taunted enemies OR dashing through allies provides them with Ki Barrier shield.\n\nR\n\nStand united: Shen's R scales completely with allied missing HP, meaning it will receive a higher cooldown for higher health targets, giving less shield to higher health targets and having a longer cast time on higher health targets. This would punish Shen for using it offensively and should be buffed slightly for clutch saves. I'd say the punish zone lies within 60% + allies, the regular applies til 30% and allies below 30% net a stronger R than live. I'd say lower CD, slightly stronger shield and -1 second cast time.\n\nThis would encourage Shen to build AS for his passive and Q procs, and push Shen more towards saving his allies instead of using his ult on top of a engage. He still could, but if they don't win that fight Shen pays a hefty price.

It isn't a damage, pick or harass tool. It is a _disabling/disengage_ tool.\n\nIf theoretically we were to change it, this would in no way be anything resembling compensation to any degree.\n\nWhen Veigar's Q was made a skillshot, it compensated him by having him be able to harass and farm with it from a much safer range.\nWhen Taric's E became a skillshot, the benefited him by being AoE.\nWhen Rengar's E became a skillshot, it benefited him by being a much better catch/pick/chasing  tool with the increased range.\nWhen Fiora's Q became a skill shot it benefited her by giving her unconditional mobility.\n\nIf Lulu's Polymorpph was given this as a change, it would devolve it into a longer ranged non-damaging single target slow, so basically an worse version of her current Q.

She would gain meter by dealing damage and taking damage to and by enemy minions, champions and monsters, while also passively and slowly generating meter while below 35% health. Each section would represent 25% of her meter, which she can spend to do either two things, those being enhancing her abilities with \"EX\" versions of her normal abilities or unleashing a super move, otherwise known as her ult. \n\nUsing an EX move costs 25% meter, and EX moves either do more damage or has a very useful quality tacked on. Her ult would be largely unchanged, but cost 50% meter per cast. Whenever or not she would be able to cast her wind slash without blade of the exile has been thought about.\n\nEX moves would be cast most easily, to my knowledge, by binding a double tap of her ability keys to them. For example, hitting Q once uses the ability normally, while quickly hitting QQ would consume 25% meter and use the EX version of the ability instead. If Windslash could be cast without activating Blade of the Exile first, it would be done the same way, but still cost 50% meter. \n\nPossible changes to her abilities for EX versions would need to be worked on by a actual balance team. Whenever or not the base abilities are weaker than how they are currently or the same as they are while the EX moves are either what they currently are or stronger versions might be played with, mix and matching those two ideals as seen fit. My take looks like this:\n\nQ1+2: Unchanged\nEXQ1+2: Increased damage and/or dash range.\n\nQ3: No knockup. Replaced by her old knock back.\nEXQ3: Increased damage and/or dash range. Knockup re-replacing knockback and behaving as it does live.\n\nW: No longer 360 degrees. Hits an area similar in size as her first two Qs in front of her.\nEXW: Full 360 hitbox and increased damage.\n\nE: Unchanged\nEXE: Complete change. Now is a shoulder bash and inflicts damage to the first enemy champion struck. No longer has a shield, but gives Riven a VERY brief moment of untargetability at the very start of the cast.
