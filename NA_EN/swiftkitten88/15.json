She was my main support in climbing and still is my favourite.  I would sustain in lane a little bit by pooling a wave, especially when we needed to shove.  Now that it's only on cannon minions and champs, both of which provide little especially since champs flee your pool pretty quick, you don't last nearly as long in lane which makes it even harder against heal supports or the popular tanky supports of right now.  Given Morgana is basically considered a support champ now with even recommended items saying support, she's not a Jung or common Mid, it stings to see such nerfs to her main role because she was a bit strong in an off meta area.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-03-10T16:57:31.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always though she was supposed to be mainly mid to oppose kayle.","replies":[{"poster":"Jikker","date":"2018-03-10T18:08:36.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Linna Excel,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EcA2hwGs,comment-id=000300010001,timestamp=2018-03-10T16:57:31.245+0000)\n>\n> I always though she was supposed to be mainly mid to oppose kayle.\n\nShe was, but she's now become a support more often than not.

That's why it hit support Morg harder because she wasn't just mass healing, but healing a tiny bit off of everything to keep herself going in lane.  Now she heals a tiny bit off of some things, the majority of which are enemy champs that will just walk away from your pool.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2018-03-10T16:54:31.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they can always buff morg mid and support in healthier ways, so that she cant just sustain through everything but is more powerful in a direct fight, if she needs buffs","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-03-10T14:25:07.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EcA2hwGs,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-03-10T07:53:09.866+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s unlikely.
