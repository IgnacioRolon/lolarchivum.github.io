Suddenlink \"hands off\" at hop 6 to hop 7, at which point it is off the Suddenlink network to Telia. Two hops into Telia's network is fine; however, In hop 9 where Telia hands off to Riot games is where the high ping time occurs:\n \n8 39 ms 39 ms 39 ms dls-b21-link.telia.net [62.115.138.200]\n9 246 ms 244 ms 237 ms riot-ic-315570-dls-b21.c.telia.net [62.115.63.70]\n \nThe trace is showing that the lantecy starts on the link between Telia and Riot, far off of the Suddenlink network. I recommend getting back with Riot and seeing if they can contact Telia to further investigate this for you.\n \nThank you for choosing Suddenlink.  If you have any further questions, you may contact us Monday - Friday 8am to 10pm or 9am to 6pm on Saturday and Sunday via our online chat at http://www.suddenlink.com/contact-us/#tabs-3 or by phone at 1-888-822-5151.

The IP 104.160.131.1 is allocated to Riot according to arin.net. Ignoring the rDNS of hop 9 in Swiftkitten's trace that shows Telia and Riot in one line indicating a direct peer, let's look at the BGP AS path. Telia has a looking glass at looking-glass.telia.net and performing a BGP lookup on 104.160.131.1 shows a single AS path of **AS6507**, which if you also put into arin.net shows up as Riot. An AS (ASN) is an identification for a collection of prefixes under the control of one operator such as Telia (AS1299) or Riot (AS6507). All of these facts prove that Riot directly peers with Telia. Has Riot also reached out to Telia since the trace from Swiftkitten clearly shows the latency starts between hop 8 and 9? \n\nNow, in all fairness, since traces only show one path (from source to destination), the return path from Riot back to Swift could show a completely different picture but since Riot has taken a hard \"it's not us\" stance and has not actually done anything to help, that information appears to be held hostage. \n\n9 246 ms 244 ms 237 ms **riot**-ic-315570-dls-b21.c.**telia**.net [62.115.63.70]","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2016-09-16T00:06:01.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IS17d1078bfb673366dcde2,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=7J60gQP5,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-15T22:22:04.495+0000)\n>\n> Let&#x27;s help Targons Blade do some basic networking since he is having a hard time.
