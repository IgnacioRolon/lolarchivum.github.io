How is that 'shoot out two instead'?  You understand the difference right?  Casting twice to get two projectiles != shoots once to get two projectiles.  It just sounds like you don't have an arguement that you're 'frustrated' it seems (all caps) to ' have to explain'.  It's just an interaction.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wendy MarveI","date":"2018-11-01T05:26:22.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was playing Olaf for the first time and I was right clicking everything just fine, then all of a sudden, I could only right click to move. I could not right click on any enemies, even in the jungle.  I could still use Q, sprint spell, W, and ultimate but I could not hit anything with basic attacks anymore.  Is this a bug or did I hit a different keybind that somehow stops you from right clicking enemies?  Please help. All four of my teammates said nothing despite me being unable to assist them with anything other than Q throws and absorbing Ahri stun.I even tried dying to a jungle monster to see if that would reset my ability to right click enemies, but it didn't work and I had to find a second jungle monster because my Vi decided to come along and kill said first monster without so much as an \"i'm sorry Idk how to help you\" reply. \n\n I am sorry if this forum doesnt like necroposting but this was the first result on Google for Olaf right click bug, so here I am. Thank you in advance for any solutions you come up with for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2018-03-16T00:46:24.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it a bug?  It just seems like it's a cooldown and refund interaction.

How is it a bug if the CDR is long enough?  Where is it said that Olaf can only throw one axe?  It's an axe.  It sits out for a set amount of time.  There's a cooldown and refund.  It's entirely possible with enough CDR to have 2 out.  He wields two axes as well.  How is throwing one of them mean only can throw one or that it shouldn't be possible to throw 2?  7 second cooldown.  Refunds more than half the CD by picking up.  Not sure how that doesn't scream can use 2 at once with skill.","replies":[]}]}]}
