Since you're aware of packet loss already, you may want to first try reaching out to your ISP to see if there are any issues with the nodes they're sending your connection through. Sometimes these issues happen due to one specific node being damaged, and they might be able to help out somehow.\n\nIf you'd like, go ahead and reach out to our tech team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) too. They might be able to look over those network logs you have to see if they can adjust anything on your end to help.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
