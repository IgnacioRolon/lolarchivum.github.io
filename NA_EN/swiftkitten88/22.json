Seeing it tick from 60% to 70% lets you visually know if your game has crashed/frozen or if they're just not loading.\n\nSeeing if one of your teammates has high ping and singling them out for abuse is not useful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-05-14T07:28:44.184+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Loading time isn't even bound in any significant way by ping.

It's impossible to determine that someone's playing from another country by the amount of time it takes them to load, where as you can work this out with ping.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2017-05-14T05:15:32.187+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Wtf why are you playing this game wtih 200 ping everyone report Rengar thanks\"","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2017-05-14T15:10:20.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akali is SO HOT,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ai4Ekbnm,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2017-05-14T05:15:32.187+0000)\n>\n> &quot;Wtf why are you playing this game wtih 200 ping everyone report Rengar thanks&quot;\n\nwell if it was ranked i would report him XD, maybe not on {{champion:107}}  but if he was playing some other ping reliant champs... yeah...\n\nmaybe it becuase i play nidalee and having high ping makes her impossible (your not going to land a spear at that ping)... but right now i dont play ranked because every 5 min or so my ping spikes from 66 to 180 for about 3 seconds... before going back down to 66.\n\nobviously if its unranked thats fine... and certain champs dont really NEED low ping.

You can now ping your ping (hah!) anyway, and I've literally never been in a case where people don't accept it as an answer. At least thus far.\n\nRiot has to handle their playerbase very carefully because a lot of small things can blow up in big ways.
