CC is an arbitrary term which can be any combo of movement and ability impairing, which differs from game to game.  The only impairment that Nearsighted puts on you is the inability to use long ranged skills.  I guess Riot figured that wasn't a big enough category to really consider Nearsighted CC.\n\nQSS does remove it (but nothing else will).  This does seems odd.\n\nYou all can downvote this too.
