Essentially, when a DoT is applied, it's near inhumanly impossible to 'perfectly refresh' it, so that it goes [3 seconds -> 0, ability -> 3 seconds]. More often than not, multiple abilities hit, overlapping, or otherwise refresh without extracting maximum potential damage. You commonly get 4-6 seconds out of most mage rotations, then it drops as all abilities come back.\n\nI wonder, if by allowing regular spells and AoE (but no DoTs, like Brand's Passive or Cassiopeia's Poison) to stack Liandry burn counters, we can overcome this problem. Essentially, DPS mages can repeatedly hit their spells without worrying about wasting Liandry's burn passive (until a point).

It's balanced around its synergy with Rylai's, and it does its job perfectly. It is a niche item for DoT and sustained damage mages who can maintain the passive at all times. The second you buff this item's burn is the second that you need to nerf a good cunk of champions who already gain huge powerspikes from it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2016-03-11T03:43:07.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just increase the damage by 50%. 3% doubling to 6% would be nice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oerba No Naja","date":"2016-03-12T17:07:48.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot cant do it because of this asshole {{champion:63}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"RoodToob","date":"2016-03-12T13:25:24.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just for the record, {{item:3151}} isn't supposed to melt mr stacking full on tanks. Its made to melt those  who stack health without getting much resistances.

If it had 8% current HP shred then I would agree and Dusk's primary use is against carries. \n\nTorment is at a decent spot with the buff that it desperately needed. Just like BotRK, it's primary functions are used against tanks and it works fine just as that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MyTeamIsAwsome","date":"2016-03-12T12:02:31.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I knew praple loved teemo.
