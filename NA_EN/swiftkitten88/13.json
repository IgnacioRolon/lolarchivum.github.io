(another bad sign for champ select)\n\nand my team was so awful anyways it wouldn't have mattered who they picked we would have lost anyways.\n\nthe fact that they even tried to pikc a full AP count and outside of the GP thier team built almost no MR and we got lost was becuase they were TERRIBLE\n\ni mean we had viktor support and teemo ADC\n\nthat game we were going to lose anyways, being a full AP really had nothing to do with it. but what it did do was made me think that if we had a decent team but the enemy itemized properly against us we still would have been screwed. and that's what this thread was about","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Colton147","date":"2018-09-11T06:08:25.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rip {{champion:42}} ADC. {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-09-11T01:52:24.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is the point of this thread?
