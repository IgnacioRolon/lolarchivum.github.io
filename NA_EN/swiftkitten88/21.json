That's pretty close to half the champion pool. I've been playing for around 3-4 years and have about 80 champs or so to accomplish this feat. So I'd say to earn EVERY chest you'd probably have to be playing for about 2 1/2 years, and you'd have to by a miracle of chance be good at ALL the cheapest champs on your own skill.
