(and u know my dad didn't like that)\r\n\r\nand also becuase my dad has his own enterprise bridge... i am having trouble googling anything about it.. and since i my dad has it passworded i cant even look at the settings... i do know it is AC  and i am pretty sure its on on 5GHz but my dad said \"channel 7\"  (which confuses me becuase i thought channels 1-11 were only for 2.4 GHz so?? \r\n\r\nagain my dad is the networking guy but he is being a slow pain in the ass to fix it.. because it \"isn't affecting him\".\r\n\r\nso anything that i can tell him to narrow down the fix to make it \"faster\" might get him to fix it sooner. ( i have already had to get an entire month with no league{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}  i want to play!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"elduris","date":"2017-04-23T18:40:14.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds hardware related and if your dad is the only one that can make changes, you will need to have his help.

Some of us here could probably get a good idea of what needs to be done if we're able to see some of those settings, but I definitely would rather not steer you down the wrong path either. \n\nIf you want to try a little one on one troubleshooting to see if we can narrow down what you could change, hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Keep in mind though, that they will most likely need to be able to see what the settings currently are before they'll be able to help. All in all, we're going to need your dad's permission as well xD","replies":[]}]}]}]}
