Since you've used the [Connection Log Reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader), I'll assume you've already worked through the basic networking steps listed in our [Connection Troubleshooting Guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nTo find where the core issues lies, I'd like you to run a few separate logs during a period where you're experiencing the high latency. The first log is a [netalyzr](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674#wq1), which gives an in-depth analysis of your network conditions at that exact moment. Don't post the results here, as the log shows your **real IP address** at the top. Simply copy and paste the abnormality notes at the top to a reply here.\n\nThe second log is a traceroute, which you can run using the [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net) application. After you start the app, plug in the IP 104.160.131.1 and run a trace for 5 minutes. After you've reached that time, export the results as a text and paste them here. This log doesn't list your real IP address, so nothing to worry about here. Let me know if you have any questions, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2016-08-24T20:36:18.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=0htFTM6e,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-15T16:20:26.832+0000)\n>\n> Hey SwiftKitten88,\n> \n> First off, *fistbump* for doing your research into this issue and understanding the basics of how your connection is routed to the League servers and where issues may lie.

There are definitely some issues along your route to the server.
