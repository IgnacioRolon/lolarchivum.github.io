(better infact that figuring out why my pbe account has lower ping)\n\nbut since i doubt we can do that without access to the router. i am just curoius to know why PBE has half the ping of main account..\n\n(and yes i am using my sister's pbe account because she quit league two years ago and i have been trying to get into pbe for three years to no avail so i finally asked her if i can use hers and it still works...)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-21T22:31:50.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm you should be getting about the same ping on normal and PBE servers, but it doesn't mean that you'll always have the same ping.
