Naturally you are still going to lose in this scenario because scripting won't help with your macro play. You can never get hit by anything and lose your turret.\n\nThey were probably testing the software to see if it worked or were trying to get used to using it, or maybe they just don't like ranked and take normals seriously.\n\nLuckily Riot is pretty good at detecting cheating programs and banning them, so that person will be gone before too long.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thuban","date":"2018-07-04T06:04:37.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You must not play Twisted Treeline.
