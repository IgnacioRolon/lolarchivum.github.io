Have not yet played a game. I get to character selection and load out - then the game does not load in and immediately shows the client screen with a 'Reconnect' button - when pressed, nothing happens. Used the repair tool and it checked for corruption, but it did not fix the problem. No bug screens are popping up.","replies":[{"poster":"r33fs","date":"2017-09-26T02:16:01.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once again cannot load into games again after the load-out. Looks like I'm going to have to un-install and re-install again? Not sure what the problem is as I'm not receiving any bugs or error pop ups. Is there any way this can still be looked into for me? Seems like it may end up being a recurring issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T21:50:35.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mentioned you had just installed and hadn't played any games, but this account is already level 15, that's odd. It almost sounds like someone had been on that account already when you logged in and they were in a game, which could mean this account is compromised and someone else is playing games on it. Hit up our account recovery agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to verify that you created this account and we can make sure nobody else is playing on it.","replies":[{"poster":"r33fs","date":"2017-09-25T22:21:06.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have not yet played a game since having came back over 5 years ago* - I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling and it fixed it and was able to play.
