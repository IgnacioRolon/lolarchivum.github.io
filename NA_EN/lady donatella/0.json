As for waveclear, a Q can hit a cluster of minions and prep them for free E on-demand much more effectively than the (as you said) long cooldown W, as long as you time it properly and use your autoattacks to control the health of groups of minions. Using W to farm minions is easier, because the longer duration gives you a bigger window for E resets, but Q is more efficient, because you'll spam it less prepping any last hits that do end up outside of your W than you will using it for poke. As soon as you have 900 max mana, 3 E kills will out-sustain one rank 1 Q. An unstacked Tear and a Dark Seal will get you there at level 5 with no mana runes. Flat mana runes will improve your early game considerably. Cass needs to be patient. Spamming is the wrong choice...at least until you're a late game face-melting monster.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2015-11-13T20:22:18.144+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SoMNia,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wcHGVTFT,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-11-13T20:09:38.106+0000)\n>\n> How many threads...?\n\nNot enough, I tell you what.
