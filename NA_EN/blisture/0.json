Yes, that's certainly possible. Reports are not a limited resource. Any time someone believes that another player violated LoL's behavioral standards, they can report that player. Punishments are similarly not limited: if more than one player in a game merits a punishment, they can both get a punishment. This can happen even if the players in question were antagonizing each other. The IFS doesn't need to weigh the severity of all reported players' actions and then \"award\" the \"winner\" with a punishment; it's not a contest.\n\nThink of it like dealing with a noisy person in a library: ask them to keep it down, and then notify library staff and move to another area if that doesn't work. If you get into a shouting match with them, you're just as likely to be removed, even if you weren't shouting _quite_ as loudly as they were. The goal is a quiet library.\n\nIn a perfect and just world, everyone who deserved a punishment would get one. In reality, it is possible for some punishable behavior to go unpunished. First, punishments in LoL can only occur after a valid report. Second, punishments take into account the consistency and severity of the punished player's misbehavior: if two players in a match break the same rule in the same way, one who consistently misbehaves in this way might get a punishment while the other who almost never does so gets away without a punishment (this time). At the end of the day, though, all this does is explain how differences in player behavior over many games can produce different results for equivalent behavior within a single game. It doesn't excuse poor behavior. One person having a rare bad day doesn't give a consistently toxic player the right to join in. The only behavior that matters in your punishment is your own... and a good thing, too: how would you feel if you behaved yourself but got punished anyway just because all your teammates were spectacularly friendly, communicative, and positive?\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025054153-Understanding-Your-Temporary-Account-Ban):\n\n> We can not discuss other playersâ€™ actions with you but you can always report them at end of game and mute them when in game. There is no excuse for raging back or responding to people trying to get you to tilt. You are the only one responsible for your actions and your words which is what we are trying to address with these bans.\n\nUsually, one transgression by itself wouldn't be enough to bring such a punishment to an otherwise clean account, but the IFS works on an escalating punishment system. Breaking a minor rule, like engaging the team in useless arguments, has a minor punishment: a chat restriction. Breaking that same rule over and over again, however, doesn't prompt an endless series of chat restrictions. The severity of the punishment ramps up over time, because the goal is to eliminate the punished player's willingness to break the game's rules. If two chat restrictions don't stop the useless arguments, the system will increase the punishment to a 14-day suspension and deliver a very clear message that the continued rule-breaking is becoming a serious issue and any further instances will result in a permaban. Again, the point is to put a stop to this misbehavior. If a player is more interested in repeatedly breaking the rules than in maintaining access to their account, they'll lose access to their account.\n\nOf course, it's possible to break major rules, like cheating, threatening people, or using chat for hate speech, and skip punishment tiers so that a clean account ends up with a 14-day suspension or even a permaban.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> **PUNISHMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW A BASIC ESCALATION PATH:**\n> \n> * First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n> * Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n> \n> However, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.\n\nDid you find something in Riot's store [allowing you to break the ToS](https://i.imgur.com/AvDSnZF.png)? No, because such a service is not offered. Regardless of how much money you spend, you are required to follow the same rules as everyone else. If the IFS determines that you've been validly reported in violation of those rules, you'll be punished according to those rules. If you wanted to avoid a punishment, you should've followed the rules.\n\nI'm sorry you've seen worse, but the system wants your behavior to be _acceptable_, not just _less unacceptable_ than what you have seen in others.\n\nNone of Tyler1's accounts were unbanned. He was in the unusual situation of what's called an \"ID ban\" (not IP ban). This means that Riot employees would watch his stream and manually ban any account he was seen to use. It's a very rare punishment that's usually used only on high-visibility players (like streamers) with ongoing toxic behavior which viewers are encouraged (either explicitly or implicitly) to mimic. ID bans may be reversed if the player meets a variety of special conditions, which Tyler1 eventually managed, and his ID ban was reversed. He is now able to play LoL on stream once again. However, once again, none of his individual accounts were unbanned. He has never had a permaban revoked.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Cat Pooch","date":"2019-08-11T18:56:12.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That library analogy was top tier.
