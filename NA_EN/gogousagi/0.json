Regarding the music - we really wanted to capture both the Demacian and the Yordle aspects of Poppy. We ended up really liking the contrast of the low brass representing the strength and seriousness of her Demacian side and the playful flute for her Yordle roots. The first few theme ideas ended up sounding too solemn, but when I experimented with playing a lighter, more uplifting (Dorian), sprightly variation of Demacia Rising on flute, the piece fell into place. There is also the element of the flute not fully fitting with the low brass and the rest of the orchestra which I believe to be very fitting for a Yordle in Demacia.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ashtana","date":"2015-12-03T19:42:07.946+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Great job on this rework!

The game would be boring if every ultimate was something you could readily, or easily shrug off. I think the new ulti is great because it allows for some really big plays, but doesn't do so much damage that it oppressive.\n\nIt also falls inline with the spirit of her original ult \"dive in and remove someone from the fight\" but in a much more visual, fun, and less toxic way. And sells the \"disproportionate power\" aspect riot wanted to convey. Much better than Diplomatic Immunity, which was \"let me click a button and wipe out your adc, and then your team with my ridiculous burst, and only your support can do anything about it (if they're lucky).\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Solash","date":"2015-12-03T19:04:14.177+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"So while creating the new Poppy, did you guys come up with or conceptualize any cool ideas for a future skin?
