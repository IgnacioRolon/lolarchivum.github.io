Her early to midgame is already very weak but her lategame isn't even good enough to compensate for what she's going through. Bear in mind, an average game only lasts 25 minutes now.\n\nShe barely hits a 50% winrate after 40 minutes and still fails to come close to actual marksmen in terms of damage output or sustain. [Even AP supports ala Brand and Zyra go as far to deal TWICE as much damage as her while staying strong throughout the game](http://i.imgur.com/oRdEwtB) while also having far better powercurves (57/58% to 50% from early to late). Meanwhile Cassio's powercurve is set between 39% and 50%. This is objectively unfair and anything but satisfying for a supposed hypercarry, she's in dire need of some buffs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moobeat","date":"2016-01-09T02:07:49.017+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are you hoping is the result of such an early communication?

Trying a slightly different approach here where we walk about work substantially in advance to see how that goes.\n\nHey Meddler,\n\nI love that you're talking more about your future plans, talking about things that aren't set in stone. Even if we can't know the exact roster of the update, it gives us a subject to provide focused feedback (err, opinions) on.\n\nHowever, I'm also worried about giving dates, because if it takes longer than you expect, people will feel angry and perhaps betrayed. This provides you a strong incentive to stick to the timetable. But, I'd rather see you do the best job you can than rush something out to hit the deadline.\n\nIf I might make a suggestion. I'd like to see 2-3 dates:\n\n- Definitely won't be until [Late May]\n- Hopefully done by [Mid June]\n- Definitely done by [End of July]\n\nIt's super nice to have a concrete date for a release instead of SOON (TM). It also gives you some wiggle room to avoid the pressure trap or \"breaking promises.\" The first part isn't strictly necessary, but it might help to stave off some \"maGE UpDaTE wHEn?!!\" posts until close to the estimated deadline.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2016-01-14T16:16:19.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea but I'd revise it to \"Probably done by\" because the moment Riot says 'definitely' the masses take it as a set in stone promise and when it's about something that far off that's pretty risky.\n\nFor all we know there'll be an earthquake in California before then that causes issues and delays thing.

While most people would probably consider an earthquake a good reason for a delay there are a lot of other great reasons it could take longer than planned that people wouldn't accept.\n\nThe idea is the they ARE making a promise for that last one. \n\nThe difference between that abs what's happened in the past is that this promise gives a lot more wiggle room. Let me add a bullet punt and it'll make sense:\n\n- Definitely won't be until [Late May]\n- When we're planning on being done by [June 1]\n- Hopefully done by [Mid June]\n- Definitely done by [End of July]\n\nThe point is that (even if we don't know it) they're giving themselves an extra 2 months to delay if things go wrong while also making a promise, because as a player, I like when Riot naked promises, as long as they're reasonable ones that can get delivered on.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2016-01-15T18:29:42.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really don't like those hard promises. They don't actually do any good. The people who want them the most don't need them for anything and don't even get the peace of being assured of something they imagine they'll get because a promise is still just words and not some kind of money back guarantee.\n\nIf they give themselves a bunch of extra room they look silly a lot and it becomes really obvious that's what they're doing. Which makes it all the worse when something goes horribly wrong and they don't fulfill one promise. It just feeds the 'gotcha' armchair designer attitude so many people have. It's also really hard to estimate how long it will take to do the kinds of projects that generate the most excitement. Stuff like hextech crafting, or the new client, take a long time, are filled with unexpected problems and delays, and are what often leave people salivating in excitement or fuming at issues over.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2016-01-14T16:18:54.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was legit confused by your typo until I read your post like 4 times. xD I was like, \"is he trolling?\" Now I'm imagining everyone at Riot just walking around a bunch and pretending like that's somehow helpful.

I can literally be the key to victory, literally almost killing a champ, CC-ing well, dealing \"Tons of Damage\" (that one was for you phreak), but walk away from an enemy when an ally is near by so they get the kill, and rarely do i get a ty for giving a kill.\n\nNow the new Season will be starting soon, i will try to get into Gold, but im sure with my luck, i wont XD. I get very, very unlucky. I got quite a few main champs, and two-three roles i feel very comfortable with. Got several back up champs i can fall back on.\n\nI try to play safe and/or smart. Try to push leads, if possible or not risky (and when i get away with it, i try to deny as much cs as i can).\n\nSo i think i got what it takes.
