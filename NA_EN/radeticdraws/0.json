Remove the current client and make a whole new interface in-game from which it would be way easier to start games and stuff as it is almost all pre loaded once you log in\n\nThis would also be a great chance to make it like Wild Rift both interface, graphics and model wise.\nOr just wait until Wild Rift comes out and port most of the stuff from it to PC.\nJust like the rest of your games that you are going to make which all have their own in-game interfaces and not their own clients. \nLegends of Runeterra is a great example, ant i was in beta phase and from what I saw, had no bugs at all.\n\nJust please do something, I am sick and tired of finally finding the time to play only to be greeted with this misfortune 2 days in a row.","replies":[]}
