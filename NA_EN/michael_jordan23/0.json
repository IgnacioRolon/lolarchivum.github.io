For the US, and I think Canada, it's +1. Then just plug in your phone number with area code in the next entry. I had to have a friend explain this to me.\n\nThey did a god-awful job with that particular screen. It's confusing as fuck since people most people are unaware that a nation code is a thing, and furthermore, the phone number entry form has \"1234567890,\" which is 10 digits long, where most US phone numbers are 9 digits, including the area code. If Riot had typed out an explanation about the forms, that would have helped a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"JAAAAAAAAAAAAYCE","date":"2018-04-14T07:09:07.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.
