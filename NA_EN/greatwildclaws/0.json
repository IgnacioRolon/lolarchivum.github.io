Before jumping to any conclusions, grab some of your recent network logs and let our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan them. That tool can tell us what your connection was like after leaving your network, so grab a screenshot and post it here for me to look over.","replies":[{"poster":"GreatWildClaws","date":"2017-09-18T03:15:27.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://prntscr.com/gmfsmn\n\ni dont have problem after i log in but every time i log in takes me 10 min","replies":[]}]}]}
