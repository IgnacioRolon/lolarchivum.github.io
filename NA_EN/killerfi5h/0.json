He pretty much has utility on all of his abilities. I don't see a ton of scaling on his kit, but at the same time, his utility isn't reliant on such scaling, making him item independent. \n\nWhich certainly explains why he might be a good support. Though I think his kit makes him a better Jungler, as his passive would simply be underutilized. But if I did see Ivern support, I would have bot side jungle heavily warded, as I would half expect him to counter jungle me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lost R","date":"2016-10-27T04:36:43.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easily counterjungled? Maybe you're missing the part where he can smite a whole camp to evacuate them instantly?\n\nIf you're talking about getting into a fight with enemy junglers, then yeah, he's not very good, but he's a support. He amplifies the menace of his team. He's not supposed to zip around and one shot enemy champions like an assassin.\n\nThe problem with supports in general is your allies have to know what the support does and be ready to make full use of the buffs they provide, and Ivern is no different. And in this current environment of League, where even the most basic knowledge is being lost, supports in general are seriously hurting.","replies":[{"poster":"maxaroni118","date":"2016-10-27T04:57:17.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can i say amen brother lmao\n\nthis cannot be more true\n\nivern is good and it makes your team play around the jungle more, not really having ivern carry but have him be a menace to the lanes and not fight in a 1v1 but draw your team to objectives and save allies or initiate fights","replies":[{"poster":"Lost R","date":"2016-10-27T05:19:47.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And people in this community are too selfish and kill-centric to consider any champion that can't rack up all the pentakills the fastest.
