While that may be a possibility, he will not get his banned accounts back. He as a player is banned, and if unbanned he'll be allowed to make new ones, but those other accounts are gone for good.","replies":[{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-05-17T02:16:23.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm curious.

Deleting them destroys any possibility of that, so they don't do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paquay","date":"2017-05-17T02:19:16.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot renames them and sells them to LoLSmurfs. :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-05-17T02:19:39.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, every account is permanent unless you specifically request it to be deleted.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZombieLegion","date":"2017-05-17T02:18:55.657+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"last time i appeal'd was 9 months ago and i understand why they didnt unban me but now ive took some time 2 reflect on my actions as an adult and im ready for a second chance ;D riot should understand i have read over the rule book so yes my behavior has improved alot THANKS FOR COMMENT !","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-05-17T02:27:22.971+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Typically you'll hear from even Riot that they *never* repeal a legitimate permaban for toxic behavior, but once in a blue moon player support may be sympathetic towards a player that shows genuine reform.
