What's the reasoning behind the narrow fixed width? The left-hand column that lets us jump between subcommunities is incredibly useful, but it eats up a ton of space that was previously filled with content on previous forums. Because the content is restricted to a 620px column (down from 740 on the old site) it feels like there's a lot more vertical stretch. \n\n2. This is definitely more feedback than a question, but what drove the heavy use of italic text for the timestamp and topic fields of the Red Tracker? It ends up making it very hard to read, and at least for the particular way I use the Red Tracker, obfuscates the most important pieces of information (the topic where the post is being made). \n\n3. The scroll bar in the preview window  behaves somewhat inconsistently when making a post, and the real-time preview will often end up not tracking the cursor at all. Would it be possible to ensure that when data is being entered in the editing field, the new data is always visible? [Replication case - enter a longer post like this one, then scroll midway (such that you've made a change to where you're viewing, but the new content will be visible). Keep typing, and the new text in the preview window will scroll out rather than following what you're typing.]\n\nThanks for putting this together and answering our questions. It's always a pleasure seeing the extent of your interaction with the community.","replies":[{"poster":"moltovcarrot","date":"2013-09-17T20:39:13.174+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Wodin,\n\n  1. Fixed width is likely a stop-gap solution that gets the new community platform matched with the rest of the site theme. However, we are exploring a number of responsive solutions and you will likely see changes to the layout over time as we study usage and experiment. If you have a great idea, feel free to start a new discussion.\n  2. We went back and forth with the treatment of that. We want to make sure that the metadata on a post is visually distinct from the actual comment contents. However, I am very sensitive to readability issues, so if you are seeing a problem I would love to take a look. Do you mind posting a screenshot of what the italics look like on your system?\n  3.

I don't have any easy solve, it was just a very jarring transition and I personally do much better with horizontal content than heavily verticals. \n\nWith regard to #2, here's a screenshot (http://i.imgur.com/V01B8Ea.png) of what it looks like for me. The particularly jarring bits are the two different sizes of italic font right next to each other [the timestamp and the subject) and the fact that the subject is lighter than the timestamp, so my eyes are drawn to the timestamp first despite it being subjectively a much less important piece of information. \n\nMy personal preference would promote the subject up into the space currently occupied by Show Parent so there was a clear, visually delineated space where the subject was always going to be, and then using a darker, bolded font.
