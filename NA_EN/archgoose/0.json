It seems to me that this item has become fairly problematic especially on some Champions (Jax, Yi, J4, etc., heck I even saw a Diana with a Rageblade that roflstomped in team fights) I suspect maybe because of the new Masteries setups; unless someone else can explain why it&#039;s suddenly become so strong?  I know Rageblade hasn&#039;t exactly really been all that popular in awhile, and I suspect it&#039;s strong right now to try and get more people to use it, but there needs to be better balance here.  As it stands it is incredibly frustrating when you&#039;re against someone like Jax with a Rageblade and you have to focus them in team fights because they have a Rageblade and if you don&#039;t burst them down fast enough they&#039;re basically just going to solo your entire team, and that&#039;s exactly what they want you to do because it means the rest of their team gets to engage at leisure.  Once they get a Rageblade and a Guardian&#039;s Angel it&#039;s basically impossible to actually stop them from killing at least one member of your team.  As it stands Rageblade disincentivizes team fights (or just any straight up fights for that matter) because nobody other than those with Rageblades actually want to engage.  I&#039;m not a big meta theorist, so I have no actual suggestions on how to better balance this item, I just feel that given my perceptions of it in the last several games I&#039;ve played it has way too high an impact for a single item.","replies":[{"poster":"Social Justice 1","date":"2015-11-23T01:06:49.961+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please use your enter key.\n\nAnyway Rageblade is broken because it gives too many stats once you charge it.
