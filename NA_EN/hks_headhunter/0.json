The Tribunal, as mentioned above, already had low participation rates before it got iceboxed, and you're suggesting that it only be in use during the latter-half of the year?\n\nMost people tend to only reach Honor Level 5 around August to September, meaning that until even a sizeable handful of players reaches that point, the proposed Tribunal would be effectively unused - and, consequently, pointless to have.\n\n> ...first off the honor system will count for something other than a pretty color on your screen...\n\nIgnoring end-of-season Bonus Honor rewards, Clash/end-of-season reward eligibility, and the Honor 5 rewards themselves.\n\n> ...it would mean that riot see's the way that people respect your play style and will use that as a way to handle the constant reports that seem to go unresolved.\n\nHaving a high Honor Level does not automatically mean that a player isn't toxic, or that the community by and large respects the player, or even that the player in question would be a remotely good judge for Tribunal cases. There's no relation between high Honor and aptitude for having good/fair judgement.\n\nAnd, again; the Tribunal was iceboxed because of a mixture of low participation rate and the fact that trying to assuage that low participation rate led to the system being abused. The IFS handles many more reports, and much faster, than the Tribunal ever could.\n\n> ...if players see a honor level 7 player in the lobby thay might not be so fast to flame as thay might be the one to judge the behavior thay are witness to.\n\nThis is implying that Honor Level 5 players would be able to issue punishments of their own accord - that people would check themselves for _fear_ of that punishment. That invalidates the point of the Tribunal, which is the due process of peer review and the joint decision of the reviewers to punish or pardon the person whose case they're tackling.\n\nSo, what is it - are you asking for the Tribunal, or for Honor Level 5 players to be able to punish other players at their own discretion?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-09-02T13:49:12.836+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm honor 5.

Those volunteers would then vote on whether to punish or pardon the reported player's case. This system's main flaw was that it simply took far too long due to LoL's huge playerbase. Participants would often be reviewing chat logs that were several months old, with a growing backlog. In addition to that, not every participant took the task seriously: some would spam the same verdict for every case without even reading the chat log, or even invert their verdicts on purpose.\n\nThe current system, called the Instant Feedback System, or IFS, is automated software that uses machine learning to determine what behavior should be punishable and when a player's behavior should be punished. It started with data from the Tribunal, and has been learning and adapting for years. It operates on the same basic principles as a spam filter: get a corpus of data (emails/chat logs), have humans categorize each item as acceptable or unacceptable, find patterns within each category, and then finally look for those patterns to automatically categorize new items without direct human evaluation. Each report is like clicking the \"spam\" button. When a new pattern starts to get lots of reports, the IFS recognizes it as a new form of toxicity.\n\nThe IFS is efficient and unbiased. The Tribunal was not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HKS headhunter","date":"2019-09-02T17:36:31.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no one ever said as thing about forced jury duty..it would be offered not forced.   and it would be 12 people to decide not one  if all didnt agree then the ban would not be placed.  I did  make  a mistake at saying honor 7 as there is only 5.  also i did not imply that we do away with the automated system as there are to many to handle by people alone, that being said I dont belive a learning machine can ever replace  a human responce flawed as it might be thats why it would take more than one persons view. i dont claim to have all the answers but should i be belittled for trying to find a soulution?  after all isnt this what the community chat is for?","replies":[]}]}
