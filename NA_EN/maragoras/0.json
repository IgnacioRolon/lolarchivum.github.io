Before going to bed I set my PC to install updates. After updating to Windows 10 Version 1607, I can no longer join games. I get through the launcher client just fine, and champ select works as it should, but as soon as the game tries to connect, I get a black screen and BugSplat asks me to report an error. I have tried repairing my game files, and outright reinstalling, and it hasn't worked. All of my Graphics drivers are up-to-date.\r\n\r\nIf anyone at Riot could help me get the game back to working order, I would greatly appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T21:21:23.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried rolling back the update? I suspect this may be caused by any number of features in the update. Two of the most notable that have been causing issues are updates made to the [SmartScreen filter](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/930168) and the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html). Clicking on either name will give you a guide that walks you through disabling the feature so we can see if either are problematic for you.\n\nLet me know if this issue persists.","replies":[]}]}
