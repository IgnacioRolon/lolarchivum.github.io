As the animation of Blitz pull is pulling Ezreal to him (he is caught ) Ezreal can escape from the pull with his blink. Not only does he escape the blink takes him a few feet from he was originally pull--meaning he has blinked away not a regular blink distance, but from the original positioned he was pulled. There have been times I have pulled him from maxed distance and have him almost too me, the he blinks back to that maxes distance and then some.  This is repeatable as Ezreal is the only adc that doesn&#039;t need to fear of being pulled by Blitz.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2016-04-01T09:23:39.182+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"In this specific interaction, it is functioning as intended\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/1M7U5VkZ-blitzcrank-pull-nullified-by-ezreal-arcane-shift?comment=0002","replies":[{"poster":"SeekÃªr","date":"2016-04-01T09:29:58.327+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this not working as intended with shaco then?

As of his arcane shifts rules the packets that connect to the client.  He is like the neo to blitz agent smith.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Professor Ward","date":"2016-04-04T12:46:11.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Exgeniar,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=1J67WEWW,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-04-01T09:23:39.182+0000)\n>\n> In this specific interaction, it is functioning as intended\n> http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/1M7U5VkZ-blitzcrank-pull-nullified-by-ezreal-arcane-shift?comment=0002\n\nwhy doesnt flash function this way?","replies":[{"poster":"cystium","date":"2016-04-04T12:55:34.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"flash has no cast time unlike arcane shift (or trist rocket jump)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blakstone","date":"2016-04-04T12:43:10.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Exgeniar,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=1J67WEWW,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-04-01T09:23:39.182+0000)\n>\n> In this specific interaction, it is functioning as intended\n> http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/1M7U5VkZ-blitzcrank-pull-nullified-by-ezreal-arcane-shift?comment=0002\n\nCould you elaborate? I mean I have seen the animation when ezreal almost right next to me after the successful pull, but if he \"arcane shifts\" before the animation is over - it's like he was never pulled and he is futher away.\n\n\n Now let me say I understand he is supposed be able to blink out of the journey during the transitionional location from where he was grabbed to blitz. I understand that however, where should his location be when he exits the grab --should he not be near the original location of the pull, but between blitz and the original location? It look like he blinks 10 yards versus a few feet.\n\nSo please clarify if his escape , is as intended with him reverting further out of the original location, or is he supposed to escape somewhere between.  Again I understand he is suppose to escape I am just questioning \"the landing\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RoakOriginal","date":"2016-04-01T12:36:25.752+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Blakstone,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=1J67WEWW,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-04-01T05:50:48.387+0000)\n>\n> .

I haven't seen the animation where I grab Tristana and she jumps out in mid transport.  It's not a bad \"rubber banding\" as it is with ezreal. The adc you mentioned, haven't shown like they \"stretched\" blitz arm or they do a nightcrawler further from where he has grabbed. The animation make it look like an escape. Ezreal just looks like David Copperfield or Hugh Jackman in the Prestige.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-04-02T10:44:23.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a point at the beginning of Rocket Jump's cast where she can still be pulled, but once she's actually off the ground, she's managed her escape (or engage).","replies":[]}]}]}
