Sometimes you&#039;ll see another red or blue instead of a yellow. It&#039;s NOT ENOUGH. Vision is important.\r\n\r\nI main support, but lately I&#039;ve been branching out and jumping into every other role. Whenever I do, I&#039;m stuck with the &quot;I shouldn&#039;t have to build sightstone&quot; supports who ALWAYS argue that vision is a whole team effort. You know, while it certainly IS a whole team effort, I can only place so much vision when I have red trinket and can only put out control wards, and even then, DENYING vision from the enemy is my contribution to the team effort. Even if I start yellow, I swap out to red at level 9 because even if my team doesn&#039;t ward, the enemy sure as hell ALWAYS does.\r\n\r\nUnless you&#039;re playing in the lowest of low elo, you shouldn&#039;t really be in a situation where your entire team still has yellow trinket come late game. Your carry can&#039;t be walking up to bushes to ward, so they should DEFINITELY have a blue. Support should have sightstone, and thus should have red. Jungler should have red as well for too many reasons (counter jungling, ganks, etc). So that leaves your top laner and MAYBE your mid laner who would want to keep yellow trinket. It just isn&#039;t enough.\r\n\r\nYeah it won&#039;t always end up with trinkets looking how I listed them above, but if your whole team keeps yellows while the team builds a variety you&#039;re at a disadvantage imo. \r\n\r\nI might have missed a few points or been wrong about a couple of things (If I AM wrong about anything, feel free to let me know) but it&#039;s just a thought I had after more games with an &quot;I don&#039;t need sightstone&quot; supp.","replies":[{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2017-05-18T13:56:21.129+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't really get why some people get so defensive when asked to buy a sightstone; it's only 800 gold and it opens up safer opportunities for early drakes while also protecting you from a 4 man clown fiesta.

People have gotten an unhealthy misconception that they get to decide what items the secondary bot-laner (or support if you must) builds, what champion they pick, how they play, etc.  These kind of choices are up to the individual player, no matter what role they queue for. \n\nTrying to force the support to play a tank or a healer is no more acceptable than trying to force the jungler to play a tank or the mid laner to play a mage.  People can ask their teammates to play a different class to fit a desired composition or build a certain way, but there is no obligation to comply.\n\nAlso, people who think that sightstone must always be rushed don't even understand the intricacies of the role.  In my opinion, sightstone should usually be bought when you're ready to start roaming and it's better to rely on trinkets up until then.  So if my roaming gets delayed for whatever reason, then I might not end up getting a sightstone until mid-game.  Sightstone really doesn't provide much benefit over trinkets alone if you're pinned down under your turret.  Also, I've been pioneering Shaco support for a couple seasons now and his boxes + trinket are more than sufficient until you start roaming a lot.\n\nEssentially, people ought to realize that the \"support\" is not the team slave.  The support is another player who makes his or her own decisions pertaining to playstyle and build.  Also, people ought to realize that the meta is not a law and is not protected by the rules of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Hemulen Magi","date":"2017-05-20T00:31:10.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the way, I like the Sabaton music you posted too.","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2017-05-20T04:14:14.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess my point was:\n\nGetting 4-manned is usually an event that is very telegraphed.

I guarantee every single one of us in this thread has died to so many ganks that were seen coming in advance. A good jungler actually will pursue his gank in a means that will compensate for if they have wards. I literally do this by walking at a 45 degree angle between where they are and where I expect them to go. It works out plenty, even when they obviously saw me coming. It's happened to me plenty on the reverse side of the situation as well. To sit here and claim that the vision would have prevented the deaths as though it's some kind of magic guarantee kind of makes you sound like a newer player to me. In my opinion, if you care that much about vision you should learn to read the minimap and situations in order to figure out where the enemies are without having vision. It's not that hard, there are only so many paths to places. You go ahead and call people scrubs and be hateful though. I'm just going to continue living my life following zero of these \"rules of the game\" and still having 20+ more wins than losses in any given que at any given time. At the end of the season I'll autoburst my way up to the rank I want like I usually do. I'll continue to skip tiers every time I reach promos, and I'll continue to maintain that elo (if not improve it) while only building sightstone half the time as support which is my main role, and choosing to trust myself over doing the things I \"have to do\". :) Sure does feel good to be an individual rather than a sheep.
