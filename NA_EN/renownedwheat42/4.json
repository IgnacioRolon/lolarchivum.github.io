Armor shred q and attack speed steroid e for your ADC to go to town. W should give you a fair amount of tankiness. QE combo for some tasty hard CC (even if it&#039;s typically going to be once per fight), huge gap closer/maker, and ult is good for some serious lockdown. Does he work here? Is he not able to function with such low income?\r\n\r\n{{champion:32}} should theoretically work with an AP bot, something like {{champion:268}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:115}} which I&#039;m seeing a lot of. Q to initiate, passive for increased magic damage? Ult hits hard and is good too. But while I feel like Amumu&#039;s passive could REALLY help out an AP bot lane, is it even worth it to bring him? Does his passive + q and ult justify bringing him or is that not enough to work with the low income?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nNote: I&#039;ve had AP carries in bot with me numerous times and it&#039;s always worked out, but in those matchups I always went with Alistar.","replies":[{"poster":"Cyndercat","date":"2017-07-05T07:38:52.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive seen jarvan support work but if you dont snowball he becomes useless late game when you have little/no peel for adc, as with most unconventional supports. \n\nDont know why you would pick amumu when {{champion:89}} has similar skillset but better suited to role, and her engage can go through minions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-07-05T07:21:53.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First thing I think of when considering them are J4's low mana pool, especially if using his W a lot, and that Amumu would be very outclassed by Morgana in the same role.\n\nI could be wrong though, and would love to be proved wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"RenownedWheat42","date":"2017-07-05T07:28:04.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think mana pools are less of an issue when in supp than vs solo laning/jungling. It's what I've found with Maokai and Kench at least.\n\nAmumu is vastly more situational and considerably harder to defend, but I guess it's a tank vs poke scenario in its simplest comparison.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-07-05T07:40:04.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On J4, usually that is the case due to being able to hang on to your spells longer when you don't have blue buff. However, I think that J4's is just that bad if you are using W when you engage. That thing costs a lot of mana.\n\nAgain, I could be wrong.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
