Lee can ward hop from any wall, Zac has HUGE range, Kha&#039;zix will go invisible if he doesn&#039;t jump on you first, etc. Think about the jungler you&#039;re up against and consider their possible pathing when you ward. Get control wards as much as possible to increase the chances that you&#039;ll be well-defended. If you can, get wards up in the enemy jungle (when it seems like a good idea. Don&#039;t go on a suicide mission for one ward) so you know where they&#039;re farming. \r\n\r\nHere are some typical warding locations we see:\r\nTop: http://imgur.com/dEPwuhw\r\nMid: http://imgur.com/0kjrGKs\r\nBot: http://imgur.com/NBzhRqe\r\n\r\nThese are basic locations that cover the river and alert you to standard ganks, especially those that happen early or on less mobile junglers. Here are some areas to consider if you&#039;re up against a more mobile champ, or you&#039;re in top or bot where blast cones are more gank-friendly:\r\n\r\nTop: http://imgur.com/u4354s8\r\nMid: http://imgur.com/fN0wClU\r\nBot: http://imgur.com/q3MS1xB\r\n\r\nScuttle is, of course, VERY obvious, but having the area next to blast cones warded prevents the surprise of them being used. Raptors in mid also alert you to the possibility of Lee, Zac, or Khazix coming to eat your face.\r\n\r\nOther helpful areas to ward:\r\nhttp://imgur.com/hNuLPeG\r\nhttp://imgur.com/flKkoPI\r\nhttp://imgur.com/yN5xh4p\r\n\r\nDeep wards grant you the best vision. You&#039;ll want control wards up often and, if you can, wards on enemy buffs. Dragon and Baron are obvious points to contest as well, but early-game especially, you&#039;ll want to know where that enemy jungler is at all times.\r\n\r\nIf you know any other helpful tips, drop &#039;em below! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-04-17T16:12:38.368+0000","up_votes":92,"down_votes":1,"body":"A gameplay post that actually helps people rather than complain about balance?","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-04-17T18:51:55.528+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":2,"body":"BLASPHEMY!

Maybe pick up a sweeper and pop it any time you feel like your opponent is playing a little too aggressive, as it might be preparation for a gank.

Even if you walk into mid lane, drop it in one of the side bushes and the jungler walks right up and kills it instantly, you still gained a lot of information, certainly 75g worth. That being said, you do want to maximize you ward efficiency. This usually means you want to wait for lane control. \n\nSo, for example in bot lane, let's say you want to ward tri-bush and you are on blue side. If they just pushed the minion wave to your tower you shouldn't walk up and place the ward right away since they will probably have the tribush warded if they are pushing up and they will just walk over and clear it as a duo. Your adc won't be able to help you contest since they are focusing on minions meaning your ward will go to waste. Instead, wait for the lane to push back to the middle or towards them before dropping a ward. You will probably be able to clear a ward they had (making your ward even more efficient since you make back 30g). \n\nThis goes for mid lane too. If you have 0 pressure and are constantly getting shoved in, you can't really just drop a control ward in the side bushes whenever you want. Often you can bait yourself doing this. For example if you're Ziggs and you drop a ward against Zed, he will go to clear it and if you contest he will take the opportunity to all-in you. \n\nThe best way to avoid getting your ward killed if you are under pressure is to ward low-traffic spots for your respective lane. For mid this is river in the little bush, or the entrance to your jungle from river (or that push on the outside of redbuff). For bot this can be the bush behind your tower (by krugs on blue side or by gromp on red side) or (again) the bush on the outside of red buff by river.\n\nTLDR: Yes, the 75g is almost always worth it, but if you want to maximize your warding efficiency, wait for lane-control to place your wards OR ward spots where they are less likely to get destroyed if you have no pressure.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-04-18T03:42:37.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally bookmarking this.
