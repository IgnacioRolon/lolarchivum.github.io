To put it straight, yordles/strange furry creatures were happily living (Gnar as leader?), when the Watchers or some form of Ice Creatures attacked, freezing the clan of yordles/furry creatures along with Gnar. Now that he has gotten out, I think he is pretty pissed and has a good reason to be since his family is most likely dead and he was frozen for many years.","replies":[]}]}]}
