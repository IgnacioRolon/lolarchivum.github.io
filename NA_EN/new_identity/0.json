Every 2 games (literally) my client crashes ( in the champ select of the 2nd game)  whenever i try to change my rune/masteries and i either get a bugsplat or a \"failed to create dump file\". After i log back in, i can't do anything until the game has started. It's getting really frustrating since i start the game with a huge disadvantage. \r\n\r\nAlso, there is a bug with the chat in the end game screen. Here is a pic showing it: https://gyazo.com/9c2c06fd45dd9e376842fab5f694dd93  \r\nIt doesn't happens every time but it's still a pain.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-17T20:25:01.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, sorry that's happening to you.  Based on all this information, it sounds like you might have some bad game files that's failing to render and properly load settings and assets.

It's really important to test this in custom games afterwards, though, to prevent any penalties!
