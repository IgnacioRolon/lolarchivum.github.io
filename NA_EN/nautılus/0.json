Or if you don't want to add legs, then why not dial back the non-hook changes to the model so it looked enough like Blitzcrank a floating animation could be used?\n\nThe existing walk animation is unacceptable with the model that's in game. I'm extremely disappointed these skins are going live like this, since it shows a drastic drop in quality, literally going Quantity over Quality. I understand when the Skins team neglects feedback that would make something go from Good to Great due to exceeding intended price, but these skins are not meeting 1350 quality as they stand.","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-11-09T08:48:03.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"there's another post by the same rioter, he said they tried adding legs but it was worse :(\nhttps://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/UGxGnxIJ-pbe-bugs-feedback-thread-lancer-rogue-lancer-paragon-blitzcrank?show=nested&comment=0001000200020000","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-11-09T15:13:32.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then it would seem the non-hook changes, such as the massive shoulder fins, needed to be dialed back so it read more like Blitzcrank.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nautılus","date":"2017-11-10T21:01:20.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=VUbj4jQz,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-11-08T23:01:15.370+0000)\n>\n> Hey CÅT - \n> \n> The animator who worked on this pair of skins [commented on the PBE boards](https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/UGxGnxIJ-pbe-bugs-feedback-thread-lancer-rogue-lancer-paragon-blitzcrank?show=flat&amp;comment=00010002) when they were still in development to provide context on the reasoning behind not changing the run. \n> \n> From the boards thread: \n> \n> *Hey guys*\n> \n> *I&#x27;m an animator that worked on Lancer Rogue/Paragon Blitzcrank and wanted to give some additional insight into this topic.
