It always happens in champ select, and has caused me to get 30 min penalties everytime it crashes. I've also lost LP because of this and it'll probably get to the point where I'll even start getting penalized more severely and perhaps even drop in honor level from this new update which'll lead to me getting fewer key fragments because of something I have zero control over. Is this a problem which many people have come across? Is it a bug in the client, or is something wrong with my PC?{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-01T21:40:57.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That dump file was trying to be created to let you know what kind of error happened when the game crashed, and if the dump file itself bugged out then we probably need to look into that as well. In order to fix that dump file error I'd suggest running a quick repair through the client, but we do still need to address why the error happened in champ select. \n\nMost of the time problems in champ select can be narrowed down to some kind of awkward connection issue, but it's hard to be sure without an error report. Let's start by double checking your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), but let me know if nothing seems to help.","replies":[{"poster":"Ox Zpl√¢sh","date":"2017-07-12T17:46:03.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same problem. \nI repaired the client, but it is still happening... i just got a 20min restriction...

So basically when you start a queue, don't click on loot or shop, but if you do so then restart the client.Hope this help :)","replies":[]}]}
