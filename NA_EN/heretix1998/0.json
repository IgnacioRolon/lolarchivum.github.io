Anyways I logged in, bought kled, and created a game. Crashed as soon champ select was over. So I did what any reasonable person would do and completely wipe my computer with a fresh reset. I've always been able to play on this computer and all of a sudden I can't? Even tried doing a normal match but it still crashed and I didn't wanted to risk getting banned. I've done everything before ultimately resetting my pc. Rename/delete Logitech files, compatibility mode, deleted razor cortex, fix game files and nothing. And no I've never ever had lolreplay. So that's not a possible fix.\r\n\r\nMy specs:\r\nModel: g752VL\r\nProcessor: intel(R) core(TM) i7-6700HQ\r\nCPU @ 2.60GHz 2.59GHz\r\nRAM: 12GB\r\n64 bit OS\r\n\r\nAny advice is greatly appreciated- &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-30T16:39:22.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this happen during the loading screen or after you've passed the loading screen?
