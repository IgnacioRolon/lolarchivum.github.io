Then the client kicked me out saying that I am unable to join because I declined yet; other times the game locks in the choice even though you did not close the client. So I'm a bit confused; if you do not choose it kicks you out? I thought that if you didn't choose at all it kicks for afk. Does it affect my queue after this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-18T21:50:18.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do have to lock-in your champ otherwise you'll be kicked for potentially being AFK, you're correct about that. You didn't get punished if it was only your first or second time, but multiple leaves in a short amount of time could get you placed in low priority queues. Just be sure to lock-in once you've decided and you'll be perfect ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"SoulEvan","date":"2018-01-31T01:51:47.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, thank you.
