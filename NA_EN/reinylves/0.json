However, I did lose my promotions to G5 from S1 once. I was told, after getting back to promos for G5, that I would get a free win. I ended up getting 2 wins, and realized I didn't get my win to G5 like anticipated because I didn't get \"my free win\". So, I'm curious, does this not work for division promotions?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-19T21:44:35.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Promo Helper works when you lose your promos but make it back into the series.
