I have played for over a decade and when I tried to log-in today I was informed that my account has been permanently banned for cheating?\r\n\r\nI have never cheated in a game in my life. One of my biggest pet peeves is cheating in games. Plus, I don't even know how to cheat League? The fact that I got banned is ridiculous? I have a ticket open with Riot, but I haven't yet got a reply. \r\n\r\nAnd honestly, IF I was cheating... I would sure hope that I would be good enough at cheating to get out of Bronze. Look at my match history. It's not like I've suddenly been winning all of thes amazing games? Like I said, I haven't played in months?\r\n\r\nUltimately, I need someone to clear this up for me and give me a good reason as to why I'm banned? And if they don't unban me, I want a refund for the HUNDREDS of dollars I've spent on this game over the years. And Riot, if this is your banning bot screwing up... fix your shit. This is stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"Pyrosan","date":"2019-12-22T23:26:36.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You most likely got hacked, your account sold on Ebay for like 5 dollars then they used scripts on your account then got permabanned, you can get unbanned if you're able to prove it wasn't you with the support team","replies":[{"poster":"Created New","date":"2019-12-22T23:29:59.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How long does it typically take for them to reply?","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-12-22T23:32:54.292+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually it's a few days, but given that it's Christmas time it could be a little bit longer. \n\n If you do file the ticket, don't bump it (update or add to it in any way after you file it) because it'll move the ticket to the back of the queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Created New","date":"2019-12-23T00:05:04.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, that's a pain in the ass.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-12-23T02:50:43.751+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I want a refund for the HUNDREDS of dollars I've spent on this game over the years.\n\nAnd here's a tip - be **nice** to whoever helps you. Being outraged at Riot is not going to help you get your account back. The support rep that ends up helping you doesn't make the rules, didn't ban you, and has their own rules to follow. Riot bans accounts like this to protect the account owner...you. Work with them to prove the account is yours and was compromised, and you'll get it back. **BE NICE**.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-23T01:38:35.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could be worse....\n\n(points to a pile of dirty toys in the corner)\n\n...those guys never looked for help and ended up covered in -~~redacted~~-","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pyrosan","date":"2019-12-22T23:37:38.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's usually two days but once they've responded it can range between an hour to 3 in my experience, they're generally pretty good but don't multi-post or whatever or it'll send your ticket to the back of the queue","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-12-22T23:31:45.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I just tried to log-in to League after months of not playing.

You can file a support ticket [**right here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to contest the ban and explain the situation. Generally speaking they're pretty understanding about these situations if you can reliably prove it wasn't you on the account.
