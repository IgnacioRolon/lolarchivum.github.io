I&#039;m the ADC on red side here, the minion wave is shoved up *almost* to our turret, but not quite. Their support is in the (possibly unwarded) bush, such that if I try to cs, I&#039;m vulnerable to poke from both the enemy bot laners. I usually just wait until they shove the wave into tower, but this almost always results in missing a ton of cs, since the minions are usually at pretty awkward health values after battling my own minions. The problem is, the wave doesn&#039;t reset after that, it just gets locked up in the same position again the next wave, so it&#039;s a perpetual loop of being zoned out of cs without ever being able to push back.\r\n\r\nHalp.","replies":[]}
