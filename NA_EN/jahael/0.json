It's even more ridiculous that you expect that it's all fine and dandy to tell people to kill themselves. On the 14 day ban reform card you were told it was your last chance.\n\n> After THOUSANDS of hours, and HUNDREDS of dollars, Thats all gone now.\n\nIf you plan on investing alot of money and time into something, you also have to make sure you wont get banned from doing said thing. The rules are EXTREMELY easy to follow, you can't 'accidentally' flame and get banned for it. It's a choice you have to make.\n\n> Zero incentive to regain 740k mastery points on my main champ and try to start climbing again.\n\nThat's point. Riot doesn't want you to play anymore, but they can't stop you. If you continue flaming again on a new account it'll just get banned aswell.\n\n> Is there no way to ban appeal this????\n\nNope.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jahael","date":"2018-04-18T05:38:37.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":11,"body":"I forget that these days that you cant have any banter anymore, you used to be able to tell a dude to off himself and go on with your lives.

No, what you did was straight up harassment and being an asshole, and that is not allowed.\n\n> you used to be able to tell a dude to off himself and go on with your lives\n\nAs a side note, when was this ever allowed? Granted, I myself am pretty young and haven't been apart of online gaming for as long as many others, but I'm fairly certain that telling someone to commit suicide has **_never_** been acceptable, whether it's online gaming or in the real world.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2018-04-18T05:54:52.330+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> you used to be able to tell a dude to off himself and go on with your lives.\n\nThat's what made League so toxic back in the days.

It's not even about this game or games in general, it's just something you don't do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2018-04-18T15:56:46.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Jahael: kys %%%%%%\n\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"banter\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\n>you used to be able to tell a dude to off himself and go on with your lives.\n\nIn communities that don't care what you say.
