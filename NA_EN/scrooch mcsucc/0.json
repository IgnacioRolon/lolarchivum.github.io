Thank You Riot for your support.\n\nIn my most recent of games (today and yesterday) my commands have not been able to be properly input. This appears to be gradually getting worse and no one I have spoken to understands why. I have run CC cleaner and lowered the video settings but still receive issues. Both my fps and my ms indicate on-screen that they are stable but it becomes evident that they are not as I play. The issues I face tend to be from most to least frequent:\n-Not moving upon right-clicking. This does not mean the movement is delayed, this means my champion will not move despite the movement indicator \n being faithfully represented as I right-click my desired location.\n-Abilities not activating properly. They don't go on cooldown or display their skill shot cursor if available.\n-Skillshots not firing if I left-click while their cursor is displayed.\n-The \"Attempting to Reconnect\" banner flashing across my screen despite my ms indicating that it is normal.\n-Not being able to purchase items after either double left-clicking, right-clicking or clicking the \"Buy\" button in the shop.\n-Not being able to sell items or undo purchases.\n\nMore often than not the situations described above both aren't input correctly into the game or do so with a delay. Roughly, it is a 3:1 ratio of the command not being properly input vs. being delayed. Either case is frustrating as you can imagine. These issues do not occur in any other online game I have played today. In fact, there appears to be no performance issues with those games but these past few games of League of Legends have been quite problematic. \n\nI would like to seek your assistance in seeing what I can do to combat these issues. It doesn't seem to bother any of the other players in-game and no one I have spoken to personally knows how to resolve the issue nor why it occurs. Please, if you need to know something that could assist either of us or you have an idea let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-17T20:49:25.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm I'm curious if this problem is more related to a hiccup in your connection rather than your inputs not working. If your connection has issues with packet loss it can sometimes seem like champions are ignoring commands. Seeing that attempting to reconnect message as well is a pretty good signal of packet loss too. Hit up our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) with your network logs for a good way to check for it!","replies":[{"poster":"1 800 MID LANE","date":"2017-07-17T22:39:55.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep. Looked at 3 games I played yesterday through early this morning and 2 of them had high packet loss. One was something like 1.2% and another way 1.65%.\n\nThe problem is, this never happened until Kayn came out and doesn't happen in any other game I've been playing. (Battlefiend 1 and WoW mostly.)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-17T22:53:24.469+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of when it started or what other games are affected, packet loss to our servers is going to cause some major issues.

Literally the day Kayn came out, I started having these issues with League only. I'm currently running a full repair hoping that'll help. I've done HRT, but for whatever reason, that crashes every time I try to force a repatch, so that's apparently not a thing. (Freshly downloaded, too.)\n\nEDIT: I'd like to point out that I don't get the reconnect issue, though. Just the input commands failing. Sometimes it's just a split second where other times, it's quite a long time. I counted up to about 5 seconds at one point.","replies":[]}]}
