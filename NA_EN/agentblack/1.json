Good luck farming under tower, or while shoving the lane.  You know what, good luck farming\n- Projectile looks as lame and weak as it is, zero impact.  Isn&#039;t Xerath a god or something???  I can make flashier electricity humping my carpet\n\nIt's like being Annie without the easyfarm Q.\n\nXerath rocks, and he&#039;s not weak or anything, and hardly anyone plays him (haven&#039;t seen one besides me in probably 100 games), but can myself and the two other Xerath mains of the world just get this one as a favor?  Laning as Xerath sucksss because autoattack farming is such a chore, and he can&#039;t rely on his spells to farm until 2+ items.  Please Rito, a quality of life buff to Xerath&#039;s autoattack.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2017-04-14T00:21:53.530+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:34}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:50}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2017-04-14T00:27:15.728+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karthus auto isn't bad.\n\nYeah, it can miss, but it also does AoE damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Viktor Von Lazer","date":"2017-04-14T00:50:19.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mecha MaIphite,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NL4QjRoJ,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2017-04-14T00:27:15.728+0000)\n>\n> Karthus auto isn&#x27;t bad.\n> \n> Yeah, it can miss, but it also does AoE damage.\n\nlmaooooooo... this is perfect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MissingKayo","date":"2017-04-14T00:37:49.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-04-14T01:16:17.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anivia's auto speed and animation were improved I think.\nKarthus uses Q as Mecha Malphite said.\nSwain's auto does suck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Euthenaasia","date":"2017-04-14T01:46:57.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Karthus' auto attack is alright after it being fixed\nSwain's auto actually does more damage than most mages if i'm not wrong.
