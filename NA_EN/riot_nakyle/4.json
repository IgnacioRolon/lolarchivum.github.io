I've always enjoyed talking about design problems with you guys.\n\nI understand what this fix is supposed to do. It's supposed to get you out of games where the game's been lost from the get-go. Level 1 double kill bottom lane, first turret, first dragon, and three turrets all before ten minutes? Yeah, get me out, man. However, I don't think this is _the_ solution to the problem we're having in-game. This is a good addition to the game, at least in theory, since it will help those games that are just lost. This is going to exacerbate a lot of issues, such as people forcing others to surrender, players giving up, etc.^ I'm also understanding that this is in response to **demand**. A lot of players wanted this feature! They want it, because they're frustrated and disgruntled. I don't think they feel this way, because there's a game that's a house burning down. I think this boils down to the quality of time we invest in a match. I'd say it's safe to say that most players aren't happy with game quality right now.  So, onto the actual question:\n\n* Do you think that the fifteen minute surrender time will fix either problem?\n* Why did you choose OCE for your QA testing?\n* Is this a band-aid fix to get players out of games with negative behavior in it?\n\n\n^\n\nNot saying that this is your fault nor in anyway can you guys fix this, because behavior is on the players. Punishments will only go so far to deter negative behavior.\n\nEDIT:\n\nyooo, totally forgot to ask\n\nWhat would make you think that this is working as intended?
