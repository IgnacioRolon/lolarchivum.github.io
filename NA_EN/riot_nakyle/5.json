We're back online after having to go down earlier. I've updated the list with some issues, some of which were able to be solved server-side (no patch required). Thanks for the patience.\n\nWe&rsquo;re sharing a list of known issues with new champ select to consolidate feedback and bug reports. Like all other features, we&rsquo;re taking an iterative approach to new champ select, and will be building on the feature in the months to come. If you see anything outside these issues, post here! We&rsquo;re planning to fix all of these issues over the next few patches. \n\n* Unable to purchase skins in new champ select.\n* Unable to select chromas in new champ select.\n* Unable to select ward skins in new champ select.\n* Unable to disable animations in new champ select.\n* Champion ability details do not show on mouse hover.\n* The &ldquo;See more stats&rdquo; button in the Leagues tab of the Profile page has been disabled for both individuals and teams.\n* TRIAGE: An issue with MMR-clamping at high-tiers of play was causing exceptionally high queue times. This was improved on 1/14 and again on 1/15 \n* SOLVED: An error on our end allowed for an exploit of the tier restriction to be bypassed in Ranked Draft. That has been fully resolved.\n* SOLVED: A matchmaking bug caused premade 5's to match against groups of solo players too often. This fix is now implemented\n* SOLVED: A matchmaking bug causing lopsided games was solved, expect slightly longer queue times because of this.\n\nKeep an eye on the patch notes and here for updates!","replies":[{"poster":"Myrmiron","date":"2016-01-14T19:08:42.642+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":53,"body":"> LOCK IT IN Bans and picks must be locked in.

As I enter champion select for any game mode, I proceed to choose the correct rune page I need based on my champion.

This is becoming increasingly annoying, especially during ranked games where I do not have the proper runes even though I clearly picked them in the champ select. To try to figure the exact problem, I deleted all my rune pages. Still, when I go to champ select and click on an empty rune page, my champion will still receive stats for some reason, albeit with the wrong bonuses, let alone on a page with no runes at all.
