Just to be super clear, we don't. If a player used asking for reports as a leaping off point for actual harassment, that's when we'd blow the whistle. When we think about updates to Instant Feedback, we think about solving problems that really distract you from what matters: Winning the game. And this issue just doesn't chart that high. \r\n\r\nTo give a bit more detail, we don't need to penalize for this because Instant Feedback is quite good at filtering out BS reports, and really only needs one to accurately decide whether or not penalties are warranted. If you're looking to make an impact on the community, the absolute best thing you can do is submit earnest, thorough reports when you see some shit you don't want in your game.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2020-01-27T09:21:41.685+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in media, it is not the case for old forum threads.

I don't specifically work on the team that deals with reports, but hopefully I can provide some clarity.\n\n>To address point one of the OP - Calling for others to report a player is a punishable offense. It is a form of bullying and as such is against the summoner code. It should always be a personal decision for each player as to whether or not they feel another player warrants a report. In fact, do feel free to tell your team mates that \"report calling\" in itself counts as harassment. Flaming and bullying a player will never help them to improve their game mechanics, communication etc. Take five minutes to add someone and talk to them after game. Perhaps do some customs to help them learn a champion, or how to gank or how to use vision.\n\n>To the second point of the OP - Don't worry about how many reports a player receives at the end of a given game. What's important is that if you feel a player truly deserves to be reported, that you do so. Don't feel pressured in to doing something by your team mates asking you to report a player.

Anyway, your post doesn't change the facts of what I said.\n\nI don't think you got my point: It does not matter what _you_ deem subjective. This is Riot's game; they set the rules. When Riot says don't be like this and that, that's exactly what it means in their terms. If you cannot, for whatever reason, fattom what they mean by \"don't be like this\" then that is solely your own problem. Listing every single type of behavior that falls under such a category (assuming you have no thought of your own) is extremely impractical, unless you're willing to read, I don't know, 10000000 pages of behavioral descriptions.\n\nScientific discourse has moved away from relativism a long time ago. Read Kant and his likes if you're interested. Relativism today is what you use when you've ran out of decent arguements. I'm pretty sure no one would have any issues understanding what is, and what is not acceptable behavior. In case that is not clear to a person for whatever reason, then said person should research, in this case, american or western behavior. \n\nI do not need a babysit guide to understand a sign that says \"do not sit here\". Using your logic I could simply say \"hey, sitting is subjective, my parents taught me that sitting is a term that only accounts for grown-ups, we children have another term, so that must mean I can sit here\". This type of fallacy is exactly what relativism brings with itself, and this is literally the point of view that you're arguing for. Obviously this does not strike you as completely absurd, so go figure why you're still using such a train of thought. This is known as subjectivist fallacy. Feel free to google it. I'm surprised to see a person that claims to have knowledge of certain things to apply fallacy to angle an arguement towards the unreasonable. \n\n**I AM NOT SAYING THAT REPORT-CALLING ISN'T HARASSMENT, WHICH I THINK IT IS.

Perhaps in this example scenario, our Player A doesn't know this; they just know everyone is calling them a troll, saying they're going to report him and whatnot. How do you think Player A is going to feel? Not good about themselves, that's for sure. \n\nBest case scenario, Player A starts to feel pressured to do better -- and perhaps they were already feeling pressured because they're having a bad game -- but now it's _extreme_ pressure; maybe they also feel harassed, or angry. After all, Player A was never intending to 'troll' or 'feed', they genuinely just like Ivern top and realized using smite makes it easier to steal camps away from the enemy.\n\n_Maybe_, Player A gets frustrated so much on being called out for reports by everyone, that their playing gets _worse_; after all, has anyone ever done _better_ in League after having someone else harass them about their poor performance? No.\n\n_Maybe_, the other teammates on Player A's team start chiming in with how 'Player A is such a troll, wow. GG you feeder'; now you have other players being toxic and/or griefing.\n\nSo here we have an example where, according to Riot now, Teammate Player B faces _no punishment_ for (in this case falsely) report calling, **even though they've visibly made the game experience worse for Player A.** Additionally, they've created a witchhunt against Player A and other players in the game have started chiming in with their own negativity. Awesome, so the _whole team_ is now possibly punished (minus Player A), for the _illegitimate report calling from one person_.\n\nNow multiply this kind of scenario across thousands of games, and how many players are negatively affected/impacted by false reports/report calling _when the reported player in question genuinely and objectively has done nothing wrong_. \n\nStill think 'report calling' is a 'minuscule issue' and not worthy of punishment...?\n\n\n\nP.S. if you read the entire comment, congratulations.

I've had my time with Riot Games; I will preface this by saying that I am no longer member of their staff. I don't care if I get reprimanded for this by the staff because this needs to be said. You all need to get your collective heads out of your arses and actually come together and create a stance on this that is UNIVERSAL AND APPLIES TO ALL LEVELS AND LOCALS FOR THIS GAME. \n\nIt should be pretty clear cut by the language in the TOS. All of player support should have to know a lot about the TOS, I know this because it's basically the player support bible for how to deal with situations of PLAYER A reporting PLAYER B for whatever action they were taking in game. I know support gets bombarded with player requests for bans to take place for actions and the system should be much more clear cut and transparent as to when bans are handed down or not. The biggest problem with how this has been handled is that the language in the TOS is ambiguous at best and it really shouldn't be that open ended in this case.\n\nI suggested that a system be put into place when I was there. It might sound familiar to you:\n\nA player calling out into chat for another player to get \"reported\" should always be classified as player harassment for two reasons:\n\n1) **IT IS HARASSMENT regardless of the content of the message**. It is harassing to the targeted player and to the other team to have another player disrupt the flow of the game with negative chat like this in the ALL CHAT. Even if what they said was not offensive to the player, ALL CHATTING \"REPORT PLAYER X\" is distracting and can even change the way players are acting in the game (i.e., cause a team to target player X because they now know the harassing player will not support them). Regardless of the content of the message it still shows a clear cut lack of unity on the teams behalf and CAN AND WILL ALWAYS effect the game, regardless of the fact that the messages content is or is not defamatory.\n\n2) **IT IS NOT NECESSARY for more than one player in the game to report another player for any reportable offense.** The Instant Feedback system was designed to automatically detect if a report was needed or not and as you yourself stated: **ONLY NEEDS ONE PLAYER TO REPORT ANOTHER PLAYER FOR IT TO KICK INTO ACTION**. The act of calling out another player to be reported is not necessary in any way shape or form for this to happen, therefore the act of doing this should be classified as negative and defamatory behavior regardless of the nature of the message be it \"Report PLAYER X, they AFK'ed\" or \"Report PLAYER X, they're a (FILL IN RACISIT/DEROGATORY TERM HERE).\"\n\nHarassment of another player should always be taken as a punishable offense, regardless of how slight it is; a lightly toxic offense allowed, leads players into being more toxic in nature in the future and should be squashed at the start, not when it gets bad enough to ban them for it. Riot should be more willing to issue chat restrictions to get their point across on this and the complete lack of action in attempting to usurp this type of behavior is appalling. It should be that they take action on these lower offenses with lower punishments to make the player understand that they are being watched and that this type of thing, **WHILE NOT BANNABLE** can result in action being taken against them. This was discussed at length in the past while such an issue had come up and we had decided that this should be the stance, but it was never approved by anyone as an official standpoint (**BUT SHOULD HAVE BEEN**). This is why Riot Husker had made the comment that he had made because that was intended to be the stance across the board and it just wasn't put into place. \n\nAnd I am sorry, \n\n> When we think about updates to Instant Feedback, we think about solving problems that really distract you from what matters: Winning the game. And this issue just doesn't chart that high.\n\nIt's very clearly understood that this effects the low tiered levels of game at its very core. All games where this happens it effects the outcome almost 100% of the time and I don't think I could possibly sit here (being locked into bronze as I am) and watch a member of the player support team come onto the forums and try to tell me that it doesn't effect the game when it is very clearly known throughout all of the support staff (and the player base) that it does. There wouldn't have been need to comment on this (by Riot Husker) if it didn't. \n\nI have honestly off and on seen this behavior in game and warned people about doing this because it's a distraction and negatively effects team unity 100% of the time that it happens. Players can attempt to try to fix the issue and solve the problem in game **BUT EVEN THAT IS A DISTRACTION FROM WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO: WIN THE GAME**, and you can not say that it is not harder to CS as an ADC when you have to chat to your team to get them to stop flame warring each other. It is a distraction 100% of the time, and it should be reportable 100% of the time. \n\nWe had even discussed ways to warn players about these sorts of things; the in game pop up box that warns players that their actions had been reviewed and action had been taken against their account, should be good enough. Most times players that see that go \"oh shite\" and stop acting this way. Players also receive a box to let them know when a report has had action taken upon those whom they had reported, which is good feedback for the people who are reporting these kinds of behaviors to let them know, \"Hey, we actually do care that you care about this too.\" I know that the new client doesn't have this feature working (from what I understood) and it needs to be a higher priority because the feedback system needs to let the community know when it's actually doing work for them.\n\nI am sorry if I come across rude or pissed off about this (honestly I actually am kind of pissed off about this) but there needs to be a single statement by Riot Games in regards to this. Not a forum post by a somewhat misleading Riot Staff member that hadn't bothered to research the topic or to look over what their own co-workers had previously stated in the past. This comment makes Riot Husker (whom I have great respect for) look like he was talking out of his ass. It shows a very clear cut lack of a unified approach to player support and only serves to make Riot Games as a whole look bad to the community. You guys need to get your act together. Honestly if I were Riot NaKyle's supervisor I would advise him to delete this post and possibly tell him never to post on the topic again unless told to by the higher ups. All you've served to do here is make yourself look like you don't know what you are talking about OR at best, make Riot Husker look like he didn't know what he was talking about. Get your act together and finally address the issue with a well thought out and clear cut answer. Make it **THE RIOT GAMES OFFICIAL STANDPOINT** and go from there. And someone, please revoke Riot Draggles's posting rights. He basically trolled on another staff members post and didn't actually bother to add anything useful or insightful to the conversation besides calling the community \"Sheep\".

He did not make that at all clear in the original post.\n\nHis argument seems to be that it is a less toxic behavior and that people should not really be punished over it. Is Riot's Instant Feedback System being overwhelmed with reports and cutting down on the reports for asking for reports will allow it to sort through more serious reports better? I don't know, and that would be the only reason I would support Riot on this issue, if it were true. If they're doing it because some players are complaining that the IFS is too harsh, then I don't support this move at all, because we already have a reputation for an extremely toxic community and I think the IFS should have as many reasonable tools as possible to punish toxic behavior.
