You are actively reducing the number of vehicles on the roads, meaning there will be less traffic congestion (faster transit for everyone) and less pollution. This is something that is somewhat commendable, and is rewarded for being so. Premading is an entirely selfish endeavor. You premade so that YOU personally can have more fun, and/or YOU personally can have a better chance at winning. Why should people be rewarded for doing something selfish? Now, we can debate the meaning of that word, \"selfish\" but I'm using it to mean any action that is self-benefiting, and NOT done for the common good. Not that premading is an evil thing (in ranked it kind of is) but it's clearly not something that you do for the good of others. You do it because you enjoy it, ergo, it's selfish.\n\n>Also know a challenger that got their with a 50.01% winrate.\n\nGood to know. Based on your own numbers, that means he probably had roughly a 55 or 56% win ratio last season. And honestly, stats are really quite unnecessary here.

Actually, it really isn't, but no one here in their right mind would attempt to validate the merits of boosting via smurf account. That's just disgusting. And rewarding premades with extra key frags, more ip, etc IS unfair, because not everyone has access to these rewards. I don't have a lot of friends that play this game. So I can't take advantage of that. And if we are being completely honest, the complaints about key fragments and other premade rewards are really just icing on the cake for us. If it were just these things, we solo players probably wouldn't really care.

If anything, Dynamic Queue should have been a replacement for ranked teams, not solo queue. The only way to do it is to completely overhaul it so that you cannot group with other people. The moment you hit the three player mark, they now form a majority of the team. At lower tiers, it is possible to have four man premades and it greatly distorts the estimated MMR/elo rating because it can't account for teamwork. It can only account for wins/losses.\n\nOn top of that, Dynamic Queue prioritized shortening queue times over providing a quality match up. At lower tiers you might be able to get into a game within a few minutes, but the problem is that the games are highly imbalanced with mid Gold players being matched up against mid Silver players. A full tier difference in skill is already too great of a range.
