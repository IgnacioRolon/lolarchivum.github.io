What is this...","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I like to call myself a league of legends enthusiast (I'm actually just obsessed). I started at the end of season 6 and got placed in bronze. \r\nThis season, I played around 1000 games of ranked and climbed from bronze to eventually platinum V. I've had very rough moments along the way and improved a lot. Playing ranked solo que literally changed me as a person as I became more resilient and less toxic. (still toxic though) \r\n\r\nToday I logged in and found an inactivity notification that told me that I have 9 days till my LP starts to decay. This is weird because I've sat on Gold V 0lp for the longest time ever- like 3-4 months (I wasn't living in America) and only started playing when I moved here recently (which is around a month or two ago) It's only been a few weeks since I played in solo que (I accidentally played two ranked games thinking it was norms)  \r\n\r\nWhat is this notification and what does it mean? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-25T21:38:22.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You never saw these [**decay warnings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760#h3q1) since this is your first time hitting Plat, congratz on making it this far! Now that's you're in Plat, you need to play a game in that queue once every 28 days or you risk losing LP. Once you've dropped to 0 LP you can be demoted from inactivity. This is mainly to keep the ranked leaderboards alive, otherwise, people could hit plat or higher and then coast out the rest of the season.","replies":[{"poster":"Real Sexy Yoona","date":"2017-10-25T22:16:50.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh that makes perfect sense.
