(Xeraths does probably about the same ONLY when he gets maximum rank, after he receives a 5th barrage, disregarding the slow, and it&#039;s certainly not as powerful as Jhins when it comes to wave-clear)\r\n\r\nJhins ultimate, again, like Xeraths, has several shots.\r\n\r\nWhat I don&#039;t like, (and it&#039;s not even the rambling I&#039;ve put above, that&#039;s not even the main concern here), and it&#039;s been **IRKING** me since forever now, is the fact that Jhins ultimate refunds some (sometimes, a lot) of its cool-down if not all of the shots are used, whereby if you use even a _SINGLE_ Rite Of The Arcane Barrage, it instantly gets put on full cool-down.\r\n\r\n(this also applies to Xerath being displaced, or stunned, it gets put on full cool-down, EVEN if no shot is fired. However if Jhin receives the same treatment, stun-locked, killed, e.t.c, Jhin STILL has his ultimate refunded some of its cool-down depending on the amount of shots fired.\r\n\r\nNo, I am not asking for a damage buff, Nor am I asking for a direct cool-down reduction, but since you are _technically_ (that&#039;s why you have ultimates, to finish them off, right?) having to kill them with your ultimate, I think a refund on cool-down depending on how many shots have been fired should be implemented.\r\n\r\nIt is **EXACTLY** the same type of ability (an execute from range, if you will, and not only that, Xeraths ultimate actually has a higher cool-down than Jhins anyway)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it is simply imbalanced and not structured properly, given that the same type of ability has distinct advantages over the other.","replies":[{"poster":"Alüe","date":"2016-07-09T06:08:45.812+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Amazingly, I've made this point many times before...

They are NOT the same type of ability. Jhin's ultimate is meant to execute because of the missing health scaling. Xerath's ultimate is just super artillery mode. It can be used as a finisher, aye, but it's also equally viable to use just for the damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordOfTheLeague","date":"2016-07-09T18:52:02.233+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xerath Ultimate is such a deception for me..","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustMonika13","date":"2016-07-09T14:04:24.982+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing is Xerath has WAY more consistent poke, and long ranged poke at that. Sure Jhin has his high damage medium ranged Q and his long-ish cooldown W for poke, but he can't exploit them from the range Xerath can. Xerath also suffers less from mana problems, especially in the early game, due to his passive. Xerath doesn't have to rely on his team for his CC, and it's a stun at that. Sure, Jhin can auto into W a target, but it's often better to have a teammate auto instead, and it's just a snare at that; anyone that has some sort of ranged ability, as well as ranged champions can retaliate still. \n\nAlso, Xerath can say fuck you to the front line in a team fight and go straight for a squishy with his ult (will it kill them I dunno), while Jhin's ultimate shots stop at the first champion hit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"arrowhead21k","date":"2016-07-09T10:49:21.620+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"The reason is because Xerath's ult is just plain better. you can use Xerath's ult in any direction and it can be used for more than just finishing your enemies.

Sure, it slows a target, but in the middle of a teamfight, that's not really relevant since everyone is fighting anyways. Which means it won't do as much damage unless he uses it as a finisher.

You're also a sitting duck regardless.\n\nDirection doesn't matter. It's not that hard to turn around / face where you want to aim. Jhin's ult can 100-0 in two or three hits.
