That&#039;s because while people might agree with those threads, they wouldn&#039;t get any quality upvotes which mean they will fade into oblivion once people stopped commenting (which can happen pretty fast in those threads)\n\nMaybe this inspires people to up their game a bit and put more effort into their threads.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nEdit: I realised that the “quality“ vote might be a bit loose and requires more fine tuning. Will keep thinking on the matter. ","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-12-12T03:30:10.931+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've actually asked about similar things in the past.

You only have the ability to use the tools and systems that are available to you, not to create new ones. Boards have to rely on behavioral solutions, not technological ones.\n\nOn this particular topic, even Stack Overflow, an actively-developed site with very specific voting guidelines, has trouble with this sort of thing. Maybe a better comparison to this thread's suggestion would be something like Yelp or Facebook, where you can mark a variety of reactions to a post or review.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Madjack01","date":"2018-12-12T14:13:59.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Djinn,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=MF5s5ooc,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-12-12T03:30:10.931+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;ve actually asked about similar things in the past.

Other (non-Riot) examples suggest a multiple-independent rating system would probably result in *some* [significant] gain (of information).\n\nIt's a different question to what extent that information can (and would) even be understood (i.e., by simply glancing at the two scores for a collection of unrelated posts, or some more complicated method) by players visiting the forums, and by Riot (if Riot even bothers with it, which I don't really believe they do yet).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Madmacx","date":"2018-12-12T01:22:07.801+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pika Fox,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=MF5s5ooc,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-12-11T22:20:34.824+0000)\n>\n> Likely adding complexity for no gain.
