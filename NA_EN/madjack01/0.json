So I thought people might be interested in some insights (this thread does not nearly cover all there is to say, but I hope that what I included will be helpful for some people).\n\nSwearing is something that carries a lot of meaning and is an important tool for expressing oneself. Like most tools however, some boundaries need to be respected so that this tool doesn&#039;t destroy more than it builds.\n\nOne of the most important uses of swearing is to express emotion. It is actually believed that people who swear sometimes are considered more trustworthy and likeable than people who don&#039;t swear. \n\nThat has several reasons. People who swear give a strong statement as to where their moral inclinations lie and also show that things can affect them enough to inspire an emotional response. This creates a little moment of intimacy where a spectator/ reader gets to know the swearing person a bit better. It is also useful for getting the reader to feel something about a topic as well.\n\nIt simply serves as a very honest expression of emotion.\n\nThis is also a bit problematic. While a bit emotion can get people to sympathize with you, improper use of swearing can feel like too much emotion for readers. Especially in an anonymous online environment, people generally don&#039;t want to be burdened by the negative emotions of someone else.\n\nAnother problem is that emotion and rationality often are considered to be opposites. This is especially of importance when one tries to discuss something. Swearing can undermine how rational or well thought out your opinion/thread sounds. This means that if you actually care about getting a discussion going (instead of just to vent), you must chose wisely how and whether you want to swear. There are actually very fine lines here, but a general rule of thumb is that swearing works better for this purpose if it is kept basic.\n\nFor example:\n\n&ldquo;For f.ucks sake, these Vayne buffs are bad&ldquo;.\n\nvs\n\n&ldquo;These Vayne buffs are f.ucking r.etarded&ldquo;.\n\nBoth phrases show how the author feels but the second goes a step further by making a very illogical connection between &ldquo;buffs&ldquo; and &ldquo;r.etarded&ldquo;. While this may make sense emotionally, logic dictates that such a connection is impossible which makes the author come across as unreasonable. Being believed to be unreasonable is the death of most discussions.\n\nIt is not uncommon for people to think that the author must have been aware of the relationship between swearing and being considered rational. So swearing despite this knowledge can be seen as not caring about having a discussion in the first place. This is why swearing better works if it&#039;s used sparingly and with a specific purpose in mind.\n\nSomething which derives from this, is that excessive swearing works better on people who already agree with you (since they are share a similar emotional mindset), while people who disagree or have no opinion will feel rather inclined to distance themselves from you. This is not what you want for a discussion.\n\nAnother important aspect of swearing is that in general, it is considered offensive and forbidden. This matters in multiple ways. Knowing that it might offend people and still using it, is a powerful sign of disrespect. This can be averted to an extent though by the use of untargeted swear words.The use of f.uck for example is open and non descriptive for any groups.The use of b.itch or the n-word however indirectly targets specific groups, even if they were meant to describe for example the vayne buffs.\n\nHowever, the offensive and taboo character can also be used as powerful tools to underline your point. Swearing is in many cultures akin to breaking the rules, if you do it anyways and you do it smartly, you express the notion that you think that your opinion was worth breaking the rules for. Which is a strong and clear signal to any reader.\n\nOne additional point that leads to awkward situations sometimes is that swearing can be used amicably for teasing or as a joke. This expresses very strongly that you like someone or something. However, swearing in jest is mostly done between friends. Outside that condition it will most likely not be well received and should be avoided in the first place.\n\nI hope some of this was useful to you and if there is enough demand I might expand about the topic some more.\n\nLet me know what your own thoughts are about the matter!\n\nSigned by: \na passionate swearer","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2018-12-17T06:42:28.574+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:267}} I fucking love a good swear.\n\nYour post highlights the difficulties with it however, considering it can make people pay less attention to what you are saying or put less stock in your opinion in general.\n\nWe wont moderate swearing outside of excessiveness (ie a post spamming fuck nonstop, graphic use of sexual language etc) or harassing, offensive, pejorative or hateful language directed at others on the general subboards.

Mods always use that word whenever they remove something from a post and usually get mass downvoted for it.\n> Just curious.\n\nI think it is safe to assume that an important difference between general swearing and pejorative language is that pejorative language often specifically targets people, groups or things and is thus more used to hurt or look down on people.\n\nThis can be done directly by insulting someone or indirectly by using a term which describes a group with a very negative connotation. An example for the latter would be: \"These Vayne buffs are a.utistic.\" While you don't directly insult anyone, you use a term which describes actual people negatively and thus have a higher chance of being perceived as hurtful. \n\nNeedless to say I think the mods also use the term because it gives some breathing room for interpretation, which gives them some flexibility to adapt to changing habits when it comes to the use of pejorative language.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2018-12-17T14:35:53.039+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Evangele,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=vGRG3aGQ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-12-17T06:42:28.574+0000)\n>\n\n> \n> I don't remember where I read it but the use of swearing oftentimes can indicate a higher than average intelligence level of the swearer :^)\n\nPretty sure that you just imagined that last part.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2018-12-17T17:00:02.470+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=True Garen,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=vGRG3aGQ,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2018-12-17T14:35:53.039+0000)\n>\n> Pretty sure that you just imagined that last part.\n\n[Lots of evidence that swearing is good for you](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/health-benefits-of-swearing_n_5a5e44a8e4b0106b7f65b3a6).  :D","replies":[{"poster":"rayzo","date":"2018-12-18T02:52:34.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ulanopo,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=vGRG3aGQ,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2018-12-17T17:00:02.470+0000)\n>\n> [Lots of evidence that swearing is good for you](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/health-benefits-of-swearing_n_5a5e44a8e4b0106b7f65b3a6).  :D\n\nI haven't read a single accurate article from that website to be fair.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2018-12-18T05:05:10.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might try the links.","replies":[{"poster":"rayzo","date":"2018-12-18T06:32:30.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ulanopo,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=vGRG3aGQ,comment-id=00000001000000000000,timestamp=2018-12-18T05:05:10.406+0000)\n>\n> You might try the links.\n\nI was viewing it on my mobile browser and for some reason they didn't show up as links but they do on my PC.

Weird.\n\nThe \"reason\" is that mobile browsers are **_SHIT_**. First, mobile devices have tiny screens, often with ridiculously high resolution, making sizing a hassle right off the bat. Then you'll be making your pretty little page with a whopping few dozen fucking lines of HTML and CSS, and someone tries it on their iPad and says it doesn't work and you look into it and find that e.g. \"position: fixed;\" ISN'T SUPPORTED, and the workarounds don't work, and you end up just saying \"I hate telephones\" and slapping the page's calculated result into an alert() for devices with a touchscreen.\n\nAnd you're checking for a touchscreen because there's no correct way to detect mobile devices. You either check for touch points (which is concise, but doesn't account for the niche cases of a desktop machine with a touchscreen) or you sniff the userAgent (which is a terrible, terrible way to do it). But of course the way that a mobile browser implements \"use desktop site\" is by _spoofing the userAgent_, or possibly inspecting the device's DPI maybe, if it feels like it, who knows, so if you're not detecting mobile in a horrible way, there'll be no way for, say, someone on a Surface to request the _good_ version of your webpage.\n\nAnd that, boys and girls, is why \"there's an app for that.\" Remember when the World Wide Web was all the rage? You could even check your email in a browser, without installing Eudora (remember that?) or Thunderbird. But now mobile is popular, and mobile browsers are garbage, so we're back to installing dozens of standalone programs for the simplest shit.","replies":[{"poster":"rayzo","date":"2018-12-26T16:29:51.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao thanks for the in-depth reply\ni agree with all of this btw","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Leaf on Bush","date":"2018-12-25T18:29:06.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Your post highlights the difficulties with it however, considering it can make people pay less attention to what you are saying or put less stock in your opinion in general.\n\nNot if the reader has a brain and is able and willing to focus on the important parts.

Perception is rarely a good argument, but there is a probability calculation here where certain traits are linked with things like 'state of mind', 'subjectiveness' and 'general knowledge' about a matter. This is especially true for an online environment. So if you are invested in getting your point across instead of just screaming in a room, you better put some thought in the words you use. \nThis is a simple fact.\n\nThink about it like this. When you swear and curse and damn the world in your post, you express strong emotional attachment to your words/point. This is a very human thing to do.

The irony is just that you don't get it.\n\nYour point is lacking nuance, which might be easier to get behind for you, but ultimately comes short when applied in practice. You see, it is nice and well for you that you can properly filter these threads. Good job! Though if you had grasped the meaning of my thread, you would have understood that my point is about having to filter threads in the first place.\n\nLet me explain with an analogy:\n\nEven if David by Michelangelo was covered in mud and dirt, I would still be able see that it is one frickin great sculpture. That  doesn't take away that I have to look past the dirt in the first place. As Michelangelo, I would want people to see the beauty of my sculpture without any noise hindering a clear view. That being said a bit a of dirt on the sculpture can give it a much more life like appearance and is in the end a positive thing.\n\nThat is exactly what use of swearing is about. Swearing is dirt, it either clouds your point or enhances it if used properly. \n\nThe thing in an online environment is that you have hundreds of these sculptures next to each other and the viewers usually are not as invested in looking behind the dirt. \n\nDon't just place the entire choice on the reader when the writer clearly has power to give certain impressions.
