Very often they even use a similar tone of an old person, telling dem youngsters about the glory days of old when towers were quality pieces built to last and baron was an opponent feared by the masses because there were no cheap damage or other slacker tools back then.\r\n\r\nThis is not critique, just an observation.\r\n\r\nIt is also a little bit funny because these posts remind me of League&#039;s starting period. While most of it is blurry, I still chuckle today when I think of Gankplank&#039;s magic crits one shotting people, Katarina&#039;s release breaking the community&#039;s spirits due to the insane dmg on her ult  and Master Yi stomping on noobs (with people complaining about it).\r\n\r\nMaybe some of these sound familiar to you. Maybe I&#039;m a teensy bit insinuating that we tend to forget about chronocentrism.\r\nNone of that matters though. I just wonder what the newest members think about the &#039;state of the game&#039;, after all, they are not biased regarding bygone meta&#039;s and playstyles.","replies":[]}
