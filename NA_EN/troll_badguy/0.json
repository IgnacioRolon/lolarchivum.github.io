But seeing how some threads already ask for it, I hope it&#039;s ok to make yet another thread about it. Otherwise, please spare me!!! Here&#039;s an Ahri {{champion:103}} to make you feel good _(hope this is the right board too, I don&#039;t see a suggestions board)_\n\nAnyways, I would really love the option to select the in-game sounds/voices whilst retaining the UI Language, and changing the UI (for the second language English people who may prefer their more native language). Watching some of the professional games in China/Korea made me feel like I want to switch the sounds over just to get a feel of it myself. I also can understand some Chinese (I primarily speak Cantonese) so it&#039;ll just be kind of cool to hear something else. And if my parents (who speaks and understands both) come over it&#039;ll be amusing to turn my game up and let the game scream out various things in Chinese haha\n\nPlease consider this to be an enhancement in future versions of the game. I understand I can modify the in-game files/folders to enable this or download 3rd party tools, but I was hoping for it to become a potential feature.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Eno","date":"2015-04-27T16:54:48.325+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sound FX are the same for all regions - so that wouldn't change. Also, having the ability to have all region's languages available would mean q super huge patch containing *ALL* the VO for *ALL* the languages. \n\nAlthough, I agree this would be a REALLY cool feature for people that would want to opt-in to that experience, so long as they understand the extra download required.\n\nWe try to never say never, so, who knows?! =)\n\nThanks for the suggestion!","replies":[{"poster":"Troll Badguy","date":"2015-04-27T20:35:22.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your time in reading and response. I was always under the impression that all the sounds were already included in the game, but I think I was mislead into thinking that because the folder:\n\n> A:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\0.0.1.140\\deploy\\assets\\sounds\n\ncontains what I thought to be all the languages (the folder names gave me that impression). However upon checking some of the files out, it seems only the other language folders contains the champion select sound for that champion, rather than the entire bunch of sound files. My bad! \n\nCheers again, hope this feedback will show up in future meetings and eventually a release. {{summoner:31}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-04-27T18:29:54.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you could just slowly sneak it in one patch at a time. Like include just one regions worth of VO per patch (or less) each patch and just don't make the option available until all the VO has been patched over.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akeydel","date":"2015-04-27T17:23:51.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a 3rd party app which will pretty easily change your VO files for a different language. \nIf you're interested you can find it [here](http://lexwah.com/lvoc/).","replies":[{"poster":"Troll Badguy","date":"2015-04-27T20:37:19.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I'll make some room somewhere and backup my current game folder and give this a try as well.

The prospect of it changing the in-game text isn't so good for me yet, I can't read anything else! But if my parents wants to play for whatever reason, it's... an option! :)","replies":[]}]}]}
