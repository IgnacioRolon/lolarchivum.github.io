I have logged on to my account 3 days ago and first thing i can see that my RP are missing i had around 5500 left (not 100% sure) after buying 50 euro amount and now i have 224 (-.-). First i send message to riot support thinking it must be some bug because of the patch or something. They answer me saying, that they cant help me, that i am responsible for my account. After that i checked my purches history and thanks god everything was fine. And now i see Gifting History, i open it, and wow what can i see someone got on my account, gifted lots skins to account named **DJurogg** . So i send to riot dates of my RP buying history my real buying stuff history , asking them to give me back whats mine and that is my RP. so they can just refund his gifted skins  and give me back what i paid for. They again answer with saying they cant help me. I am really  dissapointed in riot right now, because i tought this game is safe, so i paid for it. \r\n\r\n\r\nSoo whattt??  Should i know how someone hacked mee?!?!? Should i explain you guys how to help your customers?\r\n\r\nthank you guys for reading this i just wanted to let you know what will heppen if someone once hack your account and spend your all RP.\r\nYou will need to buy new RP. Why? Because riot dont care about us who are good behavior, dont rage and also pay  for that game. :/\r\n\r\nEUNE name: **MakeitQuick**\r\nThats all from me, have a good day everyone!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T00:48:30.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've gone ahead and looked over the ticket you sent and your account history as well. When an account is hacked or compromised, there are several signs we can look for to see when it happened and confirm that another person was in the account. From the looks of it, it doesn't seem like anyone was able to login to your account from anywhere out of the ordinary, so it could be that someone in your household was able to sign in. \n\nIf you're still confident that something out of your control happened, feel free to shoot us another ticket and explain what might have happened.","replies":[{"poster":"Make it Quick","date":"2017-07-15T14:15:24.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for you answer, i was thinking all day what could heppen. So im thinking right now if had my old password from the day i made my account, wich i had. What if someone that i know maybe saw me entering my password and rememberd it  so he can come on my account while i have RP. Thats only left solution i can think of. It can heppen coz i have logged on to many diffrent pc of my new friends of my old friends, i was also on many events about league of legends in my town Zagreb. So what do you think of that i mean i was always trying to hide while im entering my pass so no one could see it. I was also searching on that guys acc Match history to see if he have played with any of my friends and i couldnt find any. i founded some account names he have played alot, added them ingame so they can help me out to find out who is that guy who got on my account. I also asked my friends wich i ussualy play with, do they know any of those account names he have played with. Also i added a girl he played with a few games and she is also from my country but i dont know who is she but she know that guys she have his facebook and she dont want to give to me bcoz she is proud on him what he have done to me. So im thinking again it cant be any of my friends in RL, it must be someone on some event that saw my password that he rememberd it and just waited to scam me. So please if you find this helpfull what i have said, Help me :/","replies":[{"poster":"Make it Quick","date":"2017-07-15T23:50:48.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can i get answer?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
