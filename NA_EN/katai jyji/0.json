I may be wrong and as such would gladly receive good criticism about it. I&#039;m not forcing anyone to follow me or my opinion on this champion, I&#039;m just providing feedback due to my personal experience as a Zyra main for multiple years / seasons.\n\nI&#039;m only a Plat Zyra main playing since S3 (and maining her since then) in both support and mid so I may not have the best hindsight on her but I judge myself having enough experience with her to speak.\n\nLet me begin by saying this, knowing a lot of people are rejecting the idea of an update because the WR of a champion is &quot;balanced&quot; : \n\nYes she can be really strong if you play her well enough( she&#039;s regularly around ~50% WR), I&#039;m personally between 58% to 66% WR every season with her so far, but **this update is not about making her stronger but making her kit better**. Her kit is imo extremely frustrating to play with and against, feels really outdated ( I will explain myself later ) and not really fitting her theme ( will explain later), and as such I really think a Zyra update / rework is necessary. \n\n\n_**&gt;1. What aspect is most core or sacred to Zyra&#039;s identity?**_\n\nNow, here is what I think is the most important about Zyra and should be kept through this update:\n\n 1.**Plants and nature interactions**. It should be the core of her theme/kit, because it feels underwhelming atm ( will explain later )\n\n 2.**Huge teamfighting / AOE ability**. \n\n 3.**Weak when not playing around her strenght** (plants) .\n\n 4.**Mage but with a kit oriented towards utility and control** (traps if we follow the lore). Zyra shouldn&#039;t be designed for support but for midlane, a lot of midlaners can find their way in the botlane, Zyra as an utility mage should easily find her place here ( or even in jungle), but it doesn&#039;t mean that we have to design her solely for the botlane. She&#039;s a midlane mage first and foremost. \n\n\n_**&gt;2. What issue bothers you the most when playing Zyra?**_\n\nTo be honest, a lot of things. Obviously everyone has a different opinion on this matter, I will try to explain my thinking:\n\n**As a whole :** \n\nZyra seems to be in a really bad spot, I&#039;m not talking about win rate or raw power, but about enjoyable gameplay and counter play. She&#039;s the slowest character in the game, it&#039;s been 2 seasons since we began to focus deeply on speed and fast paced games with a lot of new characters with dashes, with tanky stats, speed buffs on items, speed buff on dragon, and _Zyra is the one benefiting the least of these things_ due to her movespeed and survivability. _Every spell of her has a specific amount of time ( delay )_ requiring her to stand still, she has the worst ( or nearly the worst ) resistances in the game, her design isn&#039;t good due to her having to burst enemies or die because she has to be closer in order to use her abilities ( especially since the range nerfs ) and plants correctly. And her gameplay easily appears as slow and predictible. \n\nNow, let&#039;s face it, _Zyra is a burst oriented mage_ ( canon glass mage), no matter how you want to present it, most games come down to either bursting their carries to death (even as a support ) or you dying in an instant, most people will say &quot;But she&#039;s balanced ! You die or they die !&quot; because of her obvious lack of mobility and survivability, if the only &quot;counterplay&quot; she has is &quot;destroy her in an instant because she&#039;s weak af&quot; well that&#039;s honestly a poor definition of counterplay here, just showing it&#039;s a poor design. It also brings a lot of problems, because if you&#039;re falling behind, well, you won&#039;t be able to do much given your own survivability, but if you&#039;re ahead, well, you can insta 3 or more enemies at once due to her massive AOE spells. Remember now what Riot began and did with other Burst oriented mages and Assassins, they&#039;re generally totally useless ( hi Akali ), or totally OP, or turned into easier to balance Mages ( Hi Ahri ). If we follow this trend, Zyra should get the same treatment and get revisited as a more balanced mage, because atm her kit is really outdated and a pain to balance, especially when most of these champions do possess some kind of skill-based gameplay, Zyra isn&#039;t really like that, she&#039;s more like &quot;FIIIIIREEEEEEE ALL AT ONCE&quot; and see how it goes afterwards. Sure she can be played differently with a Landry / Rylai / FQC combo, but it comes down to being dependant on items too much instead of the champions&#039; strenghts, furthermore the most effective way is just to be a secondary AP carry for your team and bursting carries down. \n\nI get it that her lore displays her as a _fragile individual_, and that her amazing teamfighting ability are supposed to explain her really underwhelming fragile state, but it doesn&#039;t make sense anymore with all these changes appearing every season pushing her even more into oblivion and the comparison with other champions ( orianna ) showing that they don&#039;t really have to bear a weakness like that, and _her lore should really be considered for an update_ because atm it doesn&#039;t translate well into her gameplay. Win rate isn&#039;t everything, she&#039;s also one of the least picked champions, so mostly mains are playing her and newcomers or players are often surprised by her burst, but that&#039;s all. Why ? Because she&#039;s _frustrating to play as AND against_, AND _there&#039;s almost ALWAYS a better and more enjoyable option_ in every field Zyra covers. \n\nNow let&#039;s tackle point by point Zyra&#039;s abilities and design.\n\n* **Passive**: The most obvious flaw in her design. An ability that has to be used when dead ( thus useless when you do not die ) and that takes a while to throw due to a long delay(2sec) before being fully transformed into a plant and ready to fire. Anyway, this passive is the sole example of why Zyra is considered as frustrating, she&#039;s the slowest and squishiest character of the game, and as such will die a lot without being able to do anything, Riot knowing that they gave her an obvious passive to use after death in case her burst didn&#039;t go off fast enough in the hope of you trading kills at least. You&#039;re doomed to die from the start. This design of &quot;burst of die&quot; _shouldn&#039;t exist to begin with_, look at all the most common burst mages and assassins ( Zed, Leblanc, Fizz, Lux, Viktor, Brand, Anivia etc... ) they all have ways to protect themselves with mobility, high resistances, cc, no delays on spells, passives etc... or play around their spells in order to lure the enemy, Zyra doesn&#039;t have that. That&#039;s literally &quot;fire everything brainlessly and hope that you kill, oh and take that passive for extra chances&quot;.[ And it has sometimes a bug firing the missile on its own depending on your last skills combo ] \n\n*  **Q**: Generic AOE mana-hungry spell main source of damage with a plant skin on it, I don&#039;t really see how you can explain it otherwise. See Brand&#039;s W ? Add less range, less damages, more mana-costs, oh, but with a 1 second less CD. That&#039;s basically that. I fail to see how that&#039;s really distinctive of any plant-related theme to be honest.\n\n*  **W**: Another arguable spell. Allowing you to place seeds on the map for a limited period of time, showing you a bit of vision in the fow. Triggered by Q or E, seeds transform into different plants, thorn spitter (damage + high range) or vine lasher (30% slow + low range). The thing is that on paper it seems good so far, however this concept is severely hindered by several things : \n1- _Still a wonky AI_, despite the fix attempts ( that also turned out to be a sligh nerf), that sometimes will make your plants not attack for 1 or 2 seconds, or messing with the priority, thus making your vine lasher totally useless ( hence making a TS + rylai the better choice). \n2- _The low resistances these plants get_. Atm these plants are good to use in laning and early teamfights because everyone is lacking items / damages / protection, however your plants don&#039;t scale that much with you and will as such begin to be irrelevant in late teamfights, easily killable in an aoe teamfight ( auras like sunfire etc.. ) they don&#039;t even last more 0.5 sec, by minute 30 usually the only utility they have is to proc Rylai / Liandry (Relying on items).  \n3-  They also require you, the slowest and squishiest mage of the game to go into close range in order to manipulate them correctly because you need to &quot;mark&quot; your enemy by auto-attacking him. As such they will rarely be used effectively in lategame teamfights. Too much cons for few pros.  \n4- It also takes one spell spot for just a seed that you will have to trigger with another spell. That and the fact that E is almost always better to save due to Zyra&#039;s poor survivability or engage potential, you&#039;re mostly juggling with one spell all game, it can&#039;t be more predictible. \n\n* ** E**: The spell that is the most iconic of Zyra&#039;s kit but also the weirdest ever. You have a snare going in line lasting 0.75 seconds to 1.75 seconds, not that bad, but not that good either. HOWEVER _you have a 0.5 sec DELAY ( cast time)_  on it forcing you to stand still, thus completely hindering 30 to 70% of your snare depending on the levels and the distance between you and the opponent, that&#039;s also the reason why this spell isn&#039;t good as a defensive one and is mostly used as an offensive one in order to catch targets for your teammates or your 0.2+ sec burst, because you will never be able to escape anything due to you having to stop for almost your entire snare duration in early levels while being the slowest character in the game. Furthermore, again, for several seasons the overall speed of champions and the games have been raised, however the E projectile hasn&#039;t, and is atm one of the slowest projectiles in the game ( more than half the speed of most cc spells like Syndra&#039;s E, Xerath&#039;s E etc..), and as such is one of the easiest to dodge, hence why this spell is mostly used to catch enemies offguard or to aim at carries not paying attention to their placement in teamfights.\n\n* **R**: Another one of her spells that you can&#039;t really rely on. Plants-interaction wise, it&#039;s poor, only buffing their attack speed and their size, thus they&#039;re going off as fast as ever, hence this utility is mostly useful in laning and early fights. Spell-wise, that&#039;s basically a huge short range AOE burst damage and will be used as such most of the times ( E[W]Q[W]R is usually the way to go ),  however, because of that, when you&#039;re behind, this spell will almost become useless because the only other effect it has is a 1sec bump after a 2 seconds delay. Again, this delay is huge, especially when we consider again all the mobility boosts, that you have to commit in order to use it etc... Even a teamfight can be decided before 2 seconds if one of the members gets taken down. Anyway that&#039;s a spell that is mostly used as a burst oriented spell on carries ( otherwise they will most likely dodge the damages knowing it takes a while to expand ) or a utility oriented spell when you caught the enemies / are ahead / used FQC/Rylai ( again, relying on items ), otherwise, it&#039;s pretty weak and difficult to rely on. \n\n**TL;DR of the faults in her design :**\n\n \n*  She&#039;s never the &quot;first choice&quot; because she has too much cons for few pros.\n*   Her playstyle is frustrating, &quot;burst or die&quot;, most effective way at least.\n*   Gameplay not really focused on plants and nature like it should be. She&#039;s more like a &quot;normal mage but with a plants based skin&quot; at the moment.\n*   Plants AI is still wonky despite the fix attempts and plants are too easily destroyed in teamfights. Plants are mostly about early agression in lane but fall off in late really fast.\n*   Plants variety. The melee plant (E) is rarely used because of its limitations, it&#039;s nearly always better to use the Q plants because of damages / range + a rylai proc.\n*   She&#039;s too squishy despite being the slowest character in the game, hence every season she falls even more behind with all the mobility buffs, tanky champions or champions with dashes, and you can never get out of a situation if the opponents do not misplay.\n*   Delay on every single one of her spells where she&#039;s forced to stand still ( especially E knowing it pretty much nullifies 0.5 sec of the root )\n*   Passive needs to go. Forcing you to die or useless if you don&#039;t die, and it&#039;s not like you can capitalize a lot on your death due to its limitations in comparison to Karthus or even Kog Maw.\n*   Rely heavily on items to be effective. Nerf, remove or tweak these items and she will fall harder into oblivion than ever, proof that her kit needs to be updated.\n\nHere is a question that I&#039;m adding : \n\n_**3. Ideas on how should she be changed ?**_\n\n*  Give her a new passive, one where she eventually can gather/grow plants in the forest or bushes, or even increase her limits for example. And where she could maybe use &quot;photosyntesis&quot; by absorbing one of her plants in order to counter her mana/sustain issues.\n*  Give her a more &quot;strategic&quot; playstyle centered around her plants, where she should cover a specific area and place them with care in order make use of them.\n*   Additional work on plants AI and variety, 3 types with different strenghts would be great.\n*   Some spells should be reworked ( Q / R )\n*   Allow her to cast some spells while moving ( especially E ) or Allow her to be faster than my grandma.\n*   Tweak resistances in order to fit the change of playstyle, maybe make her adapted for longer fights with plants sustain etc..\n*   Allow the seed placements to maybe interact with her spells ? Allowing her to extend the R area for example etc..\n*   Take some of her burst and place it into her plants in order to turn her into a more reliable source of damages, tweak the ratios.\n\nThe way I see it : We don&#039;t really have a &quot;zoning/strategic&quot; mage atm, but if we follow Zyra&#039;s lore, she&#039;s most likely the one deserving this title, with all the plants, thorns, traps she should be able to set up as a &quot;predator&quot;. She should be rewarded for placing plants correctly and making use of them to engage / counter engage etc.. She could also benefit from fighting in the forest more than any other champion due to her nature as a plant-related champion ( it could also make her jungle role easier and ultimately introduce a real carry mage into the jungle ).  \n\nTo conclude, TL;DR: Zyra is atm by essence a pure burst oriented mage, focused around her spells but with sidekicks known as seeds and plants which is honestly degrading when we consider the possibilities of the champion. She&#039;s the result of an old way to design champions and because of that is one of the most &quot;left behind&quot; mages with every new patch etc... She&#039;s not that bad ATM because of 2 things : good synergy with some items ( rylai / liandry ) and bursting carries, but other than that, she doesn&#039;t have anything going for her and is the one who&#039;s being left behind with every meta change. \n\nHere are my thoughts about her, I know that it&#039;s solely **my** opinion and lots of you won&#039;t agree with me, but I think that&#039;s a good base to start a discussion and eventually discuss with/help the team to update her. Thanks for reading up until now for those who survived :p \n\nPS: Sorry about my poor english skills, not a native english speaker\nPS2: Still waiting for a crystal/snow/Sakura based Zyra skin RIOT\n\n\n_**EDIT: Seeing how many misinterpreted my opinion R I will try to clarify my thoughts. I DO NOT WISH FOR IT TO GET REMOVED nor reworked in a big way. The thing is that I find her ult atm unreliable mostly because of the meta changes these past few years increasing the global speed of the game, 2 seconds is extremely long and you can't just assume perfectly everybody's position 2 seconds later, thus at this point it's more of a gamble relying on your teammates and enemies than your own skill. **_\n\n_**Look at similar AOE ults, Amumu ? Instant. Janna ? Instant. Viktor ? Instant. Orianna ? Instant. Galio ? Instant. Nunu ? You're the one controlling when to stop etc... Zyra is the only one having a huge barrier on her ult like a several seconds gap to expand her damages and before finishing on an utility oriented touch. **_\n\n_**I wouldn't like  to lose it, but I would honestly like it if it became more reliable and dependant of your own skill rather than completely unknown factors, for example choosing when to \"close the trap\" etc.. It would make it a more reliable threat rather than a predictable spell.**_","replies":[{"poster":"mynameisskii","date":"2016-01-26T18:34:26.779+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like how much work you put into this and how engaging you are with topic about her rework.

Zyra shouldn&#039;t be designed for support but for midlane, a lot of midlaners can find their way in the botlane, Zyra as an utility mage should easily find her place here ( or even in jungle), but it doesn&#039;t mean that we have to design her solely for the botlane. She&#039;s a midlane mage first and foremost. \n\nSee here's the thing,role doesn't have too much to do with thematic identity,a mage can go bot and feel like a mage,a support can go mid and feel like a support,I definitely think mid zyra should be a focus,but the biggest focus should always be the playerbase,and even identity should bend if that's what the playerbase is interested in,otherwise you're just taking the morderkaiser approach here.\n\nIf most of zyra's playerbase is as support,then the support role should be the biggest focus,that's all there is to it.\n\n*Mind you it's feasible that support zyra cannot be made to work(cause the meta went places),but that's a completely different argument,and only up for riot to decide if that is the case.\n\n> Zyra seems to be in a really bad spot, I&#039;m not talking about win rate or raw power\n\nOk I'm suspecting you just didn't want to piss off winrate-sheep here,I'm gonna reply to it anyway.\nTake competitive for example-competitive games tend to snowball out of control very fast and people play to win,so the fact she either does very well or very poorly should fit fine here,why has she then been ignored competitively for so long?\n\nThe way I see it,her vulnerability is too easy to punish by properly played aggressive bot lanes and ganks just destroy her,properly played out teamfights are decided before she has the time to influence them meaningfully,but in solo q people will often dance around your plants for no reason,and do very silly engages which are drawn out in which they are shredded by her plants and cced by her ult,and here's the problem: Zyra _needs_ her opponents to play poorly to work(results in a pretty good winrate in solo q),but even so there are still people who do play properly,resulting in a very frustrating experience for zyra as she simply lacks the tools the fight opponents who know what they are doing,now due to the competitive nature of players,people don't want to sacrifice fights against good opponents for a good winrate capitalizing on their weaker ones(at least when it's not katarina and then you go 20/0 against the weaker ones),so I'd say zyra's current problem can be summarized into : \"She's not a competitive pick in a game with a competitive mindset.\",which leads me to my next point:\n\n>Take some of her burst and place it into her plants in order to turn her into a more reliable source of damages, tweak the ratios.\n\nSee here's the thing,although this is thematic and all,this is also the big problem with zyra,her plants actually are a very strong part of her current kit(...in solo q) but by nature the better your opponents plays the less effective they become,I fear that putting more power into them(even if it's definitely thematic) risks making her current problems even worse,it's not just that,due to their current behavior,I'm not sure if zyra's playerbase is even particularly attached to them,I'm(personally) more attached to her aoe cc,the thing I like most about her plants is that they block skillshots(well,and also slow),their damage just seems like something which isn't as effective against good players as it is against bad ones,and I feel that it's holding her back.","replies":[{"poster":"Katai Jyji","date":"2016-01-26T18:21:48.737+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> identity should bend if that's what the playerbase is interested in,otherwise you're just taking the morderkaiser approach here.\n\nI don't think it's the same situation here at all. The thing is that Zyra has always been considered and designed as a midlane mage. She's still considered as such by RIOT knowing her primary role still states mage and support is only her secondary in game.  If she got away from midlane despite of that and mostly went for support, that's because she got multiple nerfs in a row that ended up turning her into a way less reliable carry due to her cons overcoming her pros, however her utility nature still stayed intact ( for the most part ), that with the burst oriented gameplay it allows her to be played more like a secondary carry threat botlane rather than a pure support. Riot aknowledged that by never buffing her up until this update announcement and IIRC in the previous thread statikk declared that they would also focus on Zyra mid.\n\n>why has she then been ignored competitively for so long?\n\nAs I said, she's the mage who's been benefiting the least from all the changes in meta and such for more than 2 years. How do you build a team centered around speed and rotations with the slowest and squishiest mage ever that can't do anything on its own ?

The thing is that Zyra has always been considered and designed as a midlane mage.\n\nI think people severely overestimate this,this is actually a completely worthless detail.\nBlitz was originaly designed as a top laner,should we send him back there then? Leona was originally created as a solo laner too,should we send her top as well? \nWhy is it that for these cases it's obvious \"no\" because that's just a \"fuck you\" to their playerbase for no reason,but zyra is somehow different?\nThis is exactly the problem with the graves or morde reworks,you don't send a champion somewhere else just because of original vision or new vision,the highest priority should be the playerbase,then it's gamehealth,what the champion was originally designed for is completely worthless if that's not where the players take it.\n\n>She's still considered as such by RIOT knowing her primary role still states mage and support is only her secondary in game.\n\nNot really,in fact if you followed red posts on the matter it has been made very clear that riot sees her mostly as support,with her mid lane being second priority.\n\n>If she got away from midlane despite of that and mostly went for support, that's because she got multiple nerfs in a row that ended up turning her into a way less reliable carry due to her cons overcoming her pros, however her utility nature still stayed intact ( for the most part ), that with the burst oriented gameplay it allows her to be played more like a secondary carry threat botlane rather than a pure support.\n\nSee let's face it,zyra as she is right now is balanced purely around winrates,definitely not player perception,definitely not by competitive play,and her winrate on support and mid are more or less the same,and as it currently is mid and support zyra pretty much both have the same issues.\n\n\n>Riot aknowledged that by never buffing her up until this update announcement and IIRC in the previous thread statikk declared that they would also focus on Zyra mid.\n\nOf course they would,why wouldn't they? Saying \"fuck you\" to 21% of the playerbase isn't a good idea,and even I said mid zyra should be a priority,but support zyra is just the bigger priority,because if it comes down to it,better say fuck you to 21% of her playerbase than to 79% due to something as stupid as original/new design,it's almost as stupid as reworking blitz to top plane,and as reworking morde into adc.\n \n> As I said, she's the mage who's been benefiting the least from all the changes in meta and such for more than 2 years.

If the target is killed during the snare, by plants, allies or ignite etc then Zyra regrows from the corpse with health rapidly regening (making her vulnerable to an immediate attack when regrowing).\n \nPassive option 2#: Zyra in empowered by her plants gaining (resistances or MS or regen etc) when in range of plants while also boosting them (represented by a network of roots running between her and her plants in range) increasing with the number of plants in range. Medium range (ie. around 400units) giving her a tactical choice, when ganked for example, to retreat or stand and fight with plants or in team fights to drop her plants and fall back or risk standing in the team fight.\n \nOne of the main ‘weaknesses’ with Zyra’s kit is the passive nature of her plants, while adding significant damage once placed they are not interactive. One idea would be to change how they spawn.\n \nW: now places a ready grown plant (no seeds) which is a melee vine with a range between the two current varieties. When not interacting with Q or E abilities they do less damage then the current varieties.\n \nQ: Similar in design and use but when in range of a plant will cause a small knock-up which draws enemies hit towards the plant (similar to Diana’s E). Enrages the plant increasing it’s attack speed making it focus the target.\n \nE: Similar in design and use but when in range of a plant will cause the plant to fire a tether slowing the enemy by small amount, for a period while it is in range of the plant. Enrages the plant increasing it’s attack speed making it focus the target.\n \nR: Same range and size however there is no knock-up or damage on cast. Instead Zyra burrows to the centre of the ability and can lash out with 3-4 vines within the area over 5 seconds damaging and knocking enemies up. Enrages plants as it currently does.\n \n \nWhile all of the above would likely be an overloaded kit I was just thinking of ways that the interaction with the plants could be improved and would move her closer to a zone control mage.\n\nTl;dr -Zyra needs more interaction with her plants to stop them from being passive damage amplifiers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"runedara","date":"2016-01-27T04:21:56.384+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always found it weird they called her a zoning Mage give all the others do it way better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SSShutTheDuckUp","date":"2016-01-26T20:39:32.699+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi mate!

The reason she is played as a support now and not as a mid mage was because of riots changes to her E. when Zyra first came out her E had max hold time at lvl one and allowed for a lot more early game lane control. in the end Zyra became an opressive mid lane mage. She was a close ranged lux without the need to aim her hold cause it could cast through creeps and people find it to easy to lock down the lane with her at that time. the moment Riot changed Zyra's E to scale with lvl was the moment Zyra abandoned mid for bot lane. The reason was withouth the early CC Zyra had no chance of getting in any real harrass, or any real escape from ganks outside of flash when those changes took effect. If i remember correctly at one point riot said zyra's kit at that time and season was much like evelyns where changes no matter how small either sent her into op or broke her down into unplayable. thats where i think the rework shouodl focus.  Zyra should have a kit that doesnt feel like its a make or break skill set that makes riot nervous the moment they think about tweaking her in anyway.( a place i feel she is and has been for a long time now).","replies":[]},{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2016-01-26T16:43:16.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like a lot of our points. I think this could be quite useful to Riot. \n\nOne point though. Since Veigar I have been sceptical of claims of non standard cast times, so I watched a video of a pre-season Zyra game. The cast time of her E looked to be the same as for Q and the same as every other champion's cast time for every spell in that game (except for Lee's ultimate).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sidewayzz","date":"2016-01-27T16:45:23.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah Illaoi's kit would've worked great with Zyra...I think Riot missed the mark with that one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TehomCD","date":"2016-01-27T04:34:49.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I pretty much agree with you. I've loved Zyra support for years, but the 'burst or die' playstyle could be pretty frustrating. I would really love her stupid passive to go and then get something based around brush/jungle control to play up her zone-control aspects and give her more of a strategic niche there. It'd just make sense if she's the immobile mage you'd want most when fighting around objectives in the jungle. The simplest solution to me would be replacing her passive with a new one that just says her seeds in brush have infinite duration, and plants spawned from them similarly have no maximum duration, then reduce her recharge on her W while in brushes or the jungle. That'd let you slowly build up massive numbers of plants/seeds that could be easily cleared out, but could be hideously powerful in specific areas.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Bee Man","date":"2016-03-21T02:30:30.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:143}} I personally  would not like to have a passive for Zyra like that. It would feel too much like another champion \"Illaoi\". But I don't like her current passive. I like the way where you can place your plants as is right now, because it has to do with where the player wants the plants location to be at, not where the game puts it. But, for one thing, a certain buff would be to have the plants be untargetable when you use your ult. Similar to Illaoi, but it would really help considering your plants just get one shot from many of sources. Rumble q, singed poison, Mundo w, ect. I don't like the mini-game champions that are all coming out. Zyra, being my favorite champion, I would hate for this to happen to her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YZYisX7mYr","date":"2016-03-15T14:02:07.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow!
