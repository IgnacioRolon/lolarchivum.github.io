Thus giving purpose to customizing item sets, for easy access to starter items. The hold at spawn, definitely makes it so everyone can start at a fair and even time, but it takes away from the fast/pro quick start strategies that I believed in as a player. This patch is all about adding more strategy to the game, but this hold hinders some solo que player plays. Say the blitz placing that one deep ward before enemy gets to the bush ect.  Sure the spawn animation is nice, maybe it can spawn all of us simultaneously int he very beginning? \r\n\r\nRegardless, I have never felt motivated/confident enough as to comment here, but this hold at spawn is really bothering me personally, and hinders on some early plays I like to do. This isn't dominion, keep the hold at spawn a dominion feature please, where it makes sense. On the normal games, I believe it is a hinderance, and disliked by the vast majority of the community. \r\n\r\nThere might be a very important reason that I don't see to have this, but I simply do not see it.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2014-11-20T09:51:53.553+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"There are some computers  that have different problems that are most pronounced at the start of the game.\nThere's up to a few second window for most players for just initially seeing the platform.\nFor some, there's a couple second delay the first time they open the item shop or the first time they purchase.\n\nPlayers also need time to change into their customized recommended items, to make sure their keybindings were reset correctly (especially if they're playing in a PC Cafe), and many other small things that can just cut into the first few moments.\n\nWe don't really consider these first 15 seconds in the realms of skill so much as prep.","replies":[{"poster":"Naropian","date":"2014-11-20T14:48:24.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks for the reply. I understand some computers get on the rift at different times, but I still think 15 seconds at spawn is overkill, even with the speed boost you get first leaving spawn.

This was to consume smite their blue while the enemy is leashing, and flashing away for safety. I used to always get there since I bought items quickly and was attentive at the start, but now enemies are always there to see me because even the least attentive enemy mid/jungler would have the same start as the eager to get this early advantage me.","replies":[{"poster":"Eotw","date":"2014-11-21T20:18:49.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And this is one of the reasons why they should have made the change.\n\nIt's unfair for people to be at such a huge disadvantage right from the start just because the shop lagged.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Huang Shaotian","date":"2014-11-20T10:44:05.197+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":15,"body":"> We don't really consider these first 15 seconds in the realms of skill so much as prep.\n\nIt's easy to justify any argument really, prep work is part of skill. Or you might as-well pause the game every time some one needs to shop or skill up in case they haven't played that character before and need to Google the build order.\n\nThis is basically just another change in a long line of changes to cater towards casuals. See jungle timers, reduced last hitting gold, increased passive gold generation, removal of elo in favor of something more ambiguous, removal of ability to look at normal queue elo, tower warning sounds..

After you've spent the same time with the new changes as you did with the old or for new players coming in I'm sure it'll be easier.\n\nBy everyone's logic why not just lock everyone into the base until minions spawn then people with toasters or who accidentally dc wont have to worry at all.\n\nPersonally I don't care about the change, but to deny riot is making this game easier is just silly. They've admitted themselves they made it easier by increasing readability etc. Now this is a good thing for 99% of the player base because they never learn t strategies around the old methods. But for example* anyone who spent countless hours learning and practicing being able to efficiently keep track of a monsters hp* either by tracking its hp from the bar or reading the numbers by clicking on it.. well that person just got a skill taken away from them. Now everyone can do it no skill required.\n\nOnce again I like the new changes but don't pretend its anything other than making it easier for casuals.","replies":[{"poster":"Eotw","date":"2014-11-21T20:16:47.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd hardly call taking 5 seconds longer to buy your starting items casual.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2014-11-20T12:50:33.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You must be very anxious to beat the minions to your lane, and have no patience whatsoever....

You can still take advantage of people's toasters by placing it before they get there. If you believe the enemy's toaster should always make them take longer to get there, then I'm sure you can still do that. I think you grew up learning the wrong things. \"it takes away from the fast/pro quick strategies\". Just....no. I don't think Diamonds used their computer being so much faster as an advantage in the first second of the game. I think that's just your own \"strategy\".\n \n> disliked by the vast majority of the community. \n\nNope. I don't dislike it at all. I have no problems with it. I'm not that anxious to get to my lane and wait 2 whole boring minutes until minions get there. Go top lane and take Teleport. Use your Teleport in the first few seconds of the game. You'll get to where you want much faster.","replies":[{"poster":"Naropian","date":"2014-11-20T15:45:38.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"**Nope. I don't dislike it at all.

Yes, in professional gams I enjoy seeing how the two teams rush out of their base to gain vision, and how they respond to each other. Above all making one person burn a flash is an early game advantage that has a big effect during lane phase.","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2014-11-21T02:02:29.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Perhaps **at your level** it is a boring two minutes, but there in **higher level** games\n\n\"at my level\".

While it has kind of screwed over your strategy it has made this game much more playable for many people in the early game. Or at least being there for their team in the early.","replies":[]}]}]}
