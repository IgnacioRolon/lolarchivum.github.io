I honestly hate buying Ruby because that overall it doesn't really do anything major for me, it feels like an upgrade that's just sort of tacked on so we can say we have something else to build, so we largely ignore it in favor of items that will help us.\n\nThere is a case to be made on whether upgrading sightstones are a good thing to encourage (To maintain distance from the ward bot archetype) but i feel there's also a case to be made about endgame items fulfilling their purposes, or at least having items of the same tier being some sort of significant upgrade (I.E.  Upgrading a B.F. Sword to an IE, ER, BT, etc.) When you upgrade nearly every other item to its fullest point you feel like you have gained the most out of that slot based on the strength of that item, but Ruby Sightstone does very little to make itself distinct or even necessary past the original. The lack of a proper upgrade to fulfill an endgame fantasy for our sightstones ends up in a position wherein we still basically operate on 5 items (Which we kind of always have). Sightstone is very powerful yes, but at this point i feel Supports are almost pigeonholed into it so we can have our wards maintained, but even then in prolonged stays Sightstone quickly loses its effectiveness as fights relocate around the map and your vision requirements become further and further from where you originally needed them, leading to the loss of so many wards due to the 3 ward cap (I don't hate this, just saying a good 70% of my wards are killed by me to maintain combat vision).\n\nI like that supports are encouraged to buy more items i really do, but since Sightstone is core to our build path, I do kind of wish that it had a better endgame fantasy like almost every other item of its calibur.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ipols","date":"2015-08-15T20:47:34.595+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"IF, only IF, Riot thinks that us not upgrading sightstone is an Issue, I'd say that I don't do it because I don't feel the need to have more charges, I'd much rather have 100 extra hp than the extra charges, or anything.\nwhy: Early game the charges are used just to check Dragon an keypoints, so 3 are enough and I'd place the 4th if we were to teamfight inside a brush.\n\nLate-game I don't need more charges because I'd use them to avoid face-checking, but the cast range isn't enough and It'd be dangerous anyway","replies":[]},{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2015-08-15T20:52:35.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HuH2KHRA,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-08-15T20:33:02.467+0000)\n>\n> First off, I'm pretty disappointed that I did a ctrl+f \"Taric\" and found no good jokes in this thread.\n> \n> To the actual suggestion, the idea of having several Sightstone enchantments is interesting, though I do wonder how much it could really serve to address the problem you're seeking to solve.

Have the upgraded Sightstones give different variants to the Exhaust Spell, like increased duration, or armor/MR shred, or better slow, or on a stretch, targeting an ally to buff them with similar stats as those normally taken away. (And make people unable to gain both Exhaust and Smite upgrades together as a precaution.) This concept would definitely make a Sightstone worth upgrading at all. Possibly not first, but early enough, methinks.","replies":[{"poster":"Delioth","date":"2015-08-15T23:25:30.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm...

But assuming every Spell is linked to one Item, we have to consider that if we don't want a specific role getting a specific buffed spell. (Like the laners taking the various Smite Enchants.)\n\nSay you have an enchant that buffs Ignite's range; we couldn't put that enchant on an item like Bloodthirster or ADCs would grab it every game, and then Mages would no longer use it, and swap to, say Barrier.\n\nAnother tangent would be to have a few items (say one core item per champion class) enchants designated to different spells. Taking back Sightstone, one could buff Exhaust, and another for each of Heal, Barrier and Clairvoyance. Or just have all items buff one Spell each and prevent stacking, this way people can customize Spells via their builds.\n\nPlenty of potential. I'd still rather just see Sightstone removed, vision transferred to trinkets entirely, and Spells can still become buffed via itemization.","replies":[{"poster":"Delioth","date":"2015-08-16T00:42:58.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've actually written a whole thing up on this at one point or another, but yeah, the idea was that a set of items would get enhancements for a set of spells- maybe thematic sets (I.E. items that give more gold value to AP or AD enhance ignite, items that have a sizable utility passive enhance clairvoyance, clarity, and exhaust; items that give defensive stats more than anything enhance heal and barrier-- Alternatively, reverse it so that offensive items buff the defensive spells and defensive items buff the offensive spells (This would be better for balance)) or sets that attempt to appeal to champion archetypes (I.E. lifesteal items make ignite heal a bit of the damage dealt, while AP items cause ignite's damage for the first 3 ticks to double and halves the remainder. Definitely choices within the sets, though- like 3 enchants that can be taken on any items that can enhance ignite, and these add an extra enchant.)\n\nI personally like the ammendment on the first idea best; so defensive items (all of them, but you're limited to enchanting ONE) enhance ignite and exhaust, so an adc or mage can pick between either getting the stats they want or making the summoner spell more potent (therefore theoretically giving them a higher total power level, but a much longer window between power, as the spell would have to get a significant jump in strength to even make it an option, but it still has the 2-5 minute cooldown where you'd be weaker against your opponent.). It would also give most everybody the chance to enhance their summoner spell, as even adc's should be getting one defensive item and a tank without any offense whatsoever probably can't do their job right (there's no threat, so they aren't worth focusing. Nautilus with an Echo, however... that at least will do some significant damage through a fight, and can thus be an effective threat to shift focus to.)\n\nEither way, it definitely needs refining before Riot could even consider revealing any tidbit to us about it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DELI MEATS","date":"2015-08-15T20:44:42.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would love another reason beyond the current extra ward/little hp to get ruby ss.

They are always the champions who are itemizing for what fits that specific moment in that specific game.  ADC's are almost completely static in their itemization, and mid mages and assassins aren't far behind.  They build these items in this order and only detour if they absolutely have to because they NEED QSS or Zhonya's or whatever.  Tanks and Bruisers aren't a whole lot better.  Bruisers build either Triforce or BorK, depending more on the champion than the game, and then go straight into tank stats.  They might even go tank stats first, and the tank will go straight to tank stats.  Their only real consideration is whether they need armor or MR first.\n\nSupport, however, just builds Sightstone, fairly quickly.  After that, they look at what is needed for that game.  Giving them more options makes the role more interesting.  They don't get to build as many items, so each item feels more meaningful, and having options makes them feel like they have a greater contribution to the game from a role that always feels underpowered by a little.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-08-16T12:04:14.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HuH2KHRA,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-08-15T20:33:02.467+0000)\n>\n> First off, I'm pretty disappointed that I did a ctrl+f \"Taric\" and found no good jokes in this thread.\n> \n> To the actual suggestion, the idea of having several sightstone enchantments is interesting, though I do wonder how much it could really serve to address the problem you're seeking to solve.

If the ruby sightstone was adding something special and fun to the support gameplay, I think we'll see a lot more support players.\n\nWhy not giving a buff of every others possessed items ? or something more original which could add a new dimension to LoL like the jungle buffs from S5 ? :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"The MechE","date":"2015-08-16T00:04:16.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HuH2KHRA,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-08-15T20:33:02.467+0000)\n>\n> First off, I'm pretty disappointed that I did a ctrl+f \"Taric\" and found no good jokes in this thread.\n> \n> To the actual suggestion, the idea of having several sightstone enchantments is interesting, though I do wonder how much it could really serve to address the problem you're seeking to solve. If I had to guess, I'd say that the reason it's not commonly upgraded until later in the game is due to the fact that it doesn't add a ton of combat stats. However, it may also be that it's because it doesn't really add a new unique passive, which is essentially what your suggestion does. That said, I do wonder if spending gold on a non-combat passive would also lack appeal.\n> \n> I'd also ask, is people not upgrading their Sightstones until very late in the game even an issue? Would players actually be more interested in Sightstone if they felt compelled to upgrade it before buying their Mikael's, Locket, Righteous Glory, etc.?\n\nIt might not be an issue, but in my opinion, sight stone is a very boring yet essential item as of right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sp441","date":"2015-08-15T23:55:53.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say it is because what Ruby Sightstone is right is just an extra Ward before coming back to base, and +250 Health, which isn't really all that great at that point in the game, and the only reason why it's bought at all is because people eventually run out of things to buy on very long games.\n\nEnchanting it to improve it's warding capability would be a good way for you to double dip on your map control game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2015-08-15T23:43:19.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simply offering different stats would be enough.\n\nNot every support is looking to spend another 800 gold just for the measly 250 health, even if the extra ward slot is pretty convenient.

In bot lane, as a support, sometimes you get behind and you have to go straight utility. I have been a Sona with Mikeal's, Harbinger, Twin shadows, Sightstone before. They all have stats yes, but I needed their utility more than the stats. Often times, the best way to come back in a game is through vision. Yes, the trinkets are nice, but once I get the sightstone I swap my trinket for either red or blue depending on what is needed from my team. For those who are behind but need a substantial buy for vision, these upgrades would be helpful. Especially Topaz, cause with the mastery and that, you can plant wards more safely and get the vision while avoiding combat. With the sightstone already taking up a spot in the inventory, might as well make it adhere to any situation the support needs it to. Though, instead of Ruby holding 5 charges, maybe make it so you can have a max of 4 wards out on the field?
