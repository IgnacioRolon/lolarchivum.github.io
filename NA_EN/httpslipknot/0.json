Perhaps because we haven't accumulated enough CS or such parameters. It's disappointing when we've overwhelmingly won a game but none in the team even got an S- because we killed the nexus really quick. \n\nShouldn't all of the parameters (taken into consideration) be based on rates/percentages or based according to particular time (i.e. 7, 20mins marks) in the game?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nicorus ","date":"2016-08-29T00:01:04.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fairly recently you guys said you would change the way supports were graded.
