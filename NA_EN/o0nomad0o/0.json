Let's try updating a few of your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) in case something there isn't configured in the best way for League to run.

I can't use any of those packet loss or buffering sites linked. Though I did try other sites and no packet loss issues. Also configured the dns and flushed it.  Don't have peer downloading for windows 10. I don't have access to get into my modem/router to do port forwarding. Tried disabling firewall. My game ping is usually around 100ms due to my less than awesome internet and distance from NA server but like I said I NEVER had this problem on the old client and I don't have any problems when I'm actually in a match.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-05T20:41:06.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm I'm not sure why that packet loss site wouldn't work in Chrome, since that's what I use here and just pulled it up myself =\\ . Those disconnects could actually be some packet loss.
