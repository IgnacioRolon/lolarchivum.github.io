I was amongst all the people concerned when Jayce got released with his first lore; I was amongst people worried that shallowing him will happen again with the new Zaun-Piltover lore change. \r\n\r\nWithout further ado - new Viktor bio is up. And... _it&#039;s perfect._ I have nothing more to add.\r\n\r\nThis thread is meant to say thank you to the writers responsible for it. You&#039;ve managed to grasp his character&#039;s very essence; all the traits which made Viktor -_ Viktor_, which made us love the character; and gave him long awaited justice.","replies":[{"poster":"Dinopawz","date":"2017-01-26T23:10:04.925+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers, glad you like it!","replies":[{"poster":"Reset213","date":"2017-01-27T04:30:17.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"RIOTS GONNA MESS UP VIKTOR111\"\n\n\"Thank you riot\"\n\noh how i hate people sometimes, so darn impatient","replies":[{"poster":"Arcyvilk","date":"2017-01-27T04:44:03.656+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we weren't vocal at the time, we would be stuck to the release Jayce lore and it would suck. Also, given the choices of some words in the story, I am sure the new lore got at least _a bit_ influenced by our feedback.\n\nI am an author of one of the big worry threads which flooded boards just after the new Jayce lore came out. Now, when I got Viktor's lore and I like it, I decided to thank Riot for their great work. It seems like a thing that a decent human being should do after being granded for what one asked with such passion. Do you have a problem with that?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baron Von Bangin","date":"2017-01-27T23:04:54.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not even a matter of being patient. Riot has a history of lousing up Viktor's character... especially when Jayce is concerned. \n\nWhen Jayce was released almost 5 years ago his story painted Viktor up as a hypocritical villain. It wasn't until players voiced their dissatisfaction did Riot edit the story. \n\nIt's not wholly unbelievable that when Riot released another Jayce story that paints up Viktor up as a mustache twirling villain that fans think they're taking the character another direction. It's not like Riot is above retcon.\n\nThat being said, I haven't played League in going on a year but I'm glad to see Riot did a FANTASTIC job with my favorite champion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-01-27T23:10:11.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dinopawz,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=91pEJbAd,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-01-26T23:10:04.925+0000)\n>\n> Cheers, glad you like it!\n\nNow please fix Zac's.
