I'm going to need a little extra information to try to understand what might be going on better. :]\n\nDo you happen to know which of these wards you're seeing problems with? The Banner of the Horse, Lantern of the Serpent, Banner of the Serpent, Gong, or Firecracker ward?\n\nAre you able to select the ward skin in the Ward Skins tab in the Store? \n\nDo you not see the ward skin at all in Champion Select--like you're not able to find it or click on it at all? \n\nDid you make any recent ward skin purchases? The icon for the ward may have also just shifted in the Ward Skin Selection window that pops up when you press the button in Champ Select.\n\nThanks. :]","replies":[{"poster":"Thunderspam","date":"2016-08-12T02:36:56.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The lantern of the serpent ward, Aka loot_name_ward_skin_rental_16\nwas unavailable for both champ select(by this I mean it just wasn't an option to select) and I also had a shard for the ward skin and it was unlockable( possibly because I owned it but idk what was wrong) \nAlso as a side note, what are all of these loot_name_ ward_skin things?

Thanks for the info. :]\n\nWe looked into your account and found that you have never purchased a ward skin nor received one as a gift before, so it looks like you might have used the Lantern of the Serpent ward while it was free during either the 2013 or 2014 Lunar Revel events when the wards were free to select during the duration of the event. \n\nIf you were able to successfully equip the ward and use it in game outside these events and now you aren't able to, then I think you should [hit up the awesome player support peeps](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with your issue. They will be better able to help you out!","replies":[{"poster":"Enrique the ADC","date":"2016-08-09T23:38:48.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same problem has happened to me and idk where it went.
