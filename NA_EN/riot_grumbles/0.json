Everything is so laggy. I'm at a 15 minute penalty and the games I've gotten into were things of miracles. Banning aatrox and smashing my left click on the back button over and over asking my friend if it went through and then fifteen seconds later it would appear on my screen.

This by itself could cause users to report instead that it's slow, buggy, lagging, etc You should be aware of that.\n\nThis problem could make the client unusable for many people who have PCs that are not for gaming, or are really kind of humble or old PCs. It could cost Riot some users.\n\nThe developers should look into this to see if there is some process running that shouldn't have to or they came make it more efficient. The client is just open, not playing a game or anything. Even while client is idle, it takes up CPU, makes it heat up, PC turns on fan to high speed.  Some PCs will just shut down to protect the CPU, that could cause some file corruption and if you're in game you go AFK and get penalized. It has happened to me.\n\nOf course, as time passes PC performance in general increases and people want more software features and that requires more code and powerful machines. However, not everybody has them and it could be a sizable number of users that you could leave behind. That's Riot's business decision. However, it seems there must be some processes running on the client when they don't have to or there is some inefficiency. If the client is logged in, but idle, it shouldn't take up 25%+ of an i5 CPU's time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cibreca","date":"2016-11-21T15:10:24.031+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no itemsets... that's big problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PACIFlC MALL","date":"2016-11-27T00:32:45.966+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3070}}{{item:3070}}{{item:3070}}Alpha client is way to laggy to be functional for people with slower laptops, I usually run league just fine at max settings on my lenovo y40, i7 5500u, 8gb ram, and AMD M275x dedicated GPU, which is by no means underpowered, but my laptop can't even run this client without huge 30 second lag spikes making champion select and pick and ban very frustrating, I got the 5 min low priority queue a few times because I lagged out and couldn't lock in a ban or pick. Now I haven't tested it, but I'm sure my $2500 desktop should run this no problem if riot decides to not fix the lag, however, not everyone has the same hardware as me and I prefer playing league on my laptop anyways. Riot, you will lose players if this goes on. One of the reason why league has so many players may be the fact that low end computers can run it, if you take away the low system requirements, people will leave your game. The old client may look dated, but it worked, and it did its job well, why don't you just refine how it looks instead of completely overhauling a functional client. You should overhaul things gradually so people have time to get used to changes, not instantly shove down something completely different, its frustrating for us to learn from scratch riot, why take the hard way when you don't have to. You listened to us then you brought back solo queue, now please prove that wasn't a fluke and listen to us about the client. {{item:3070}}{{item:3070}}{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Grumbles","date":"2016-11-30T22:22:56.436+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey wipe away those tears and turn them into Manamune. We're making major improvements to performance with 6.24. Performance is our number one priority and we want to make sure everyone who can run League can run the updated client smoothly. \n\n Some of these are:\n\n-We've patched up our audio and UI components to make the entire client run faster\n-We made champ select run more smoothly and fixed some issues affecting the champ grid UI\n-Weâ€™ve added audio and visual changes to champ select to make key decision moments more noticeable\n-We've improved responsiveness and stability for important transition moments like the jump from the play button to the lobby, the ready check pop-up, and the champ select load-in experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Moeuguudes","date":"2016-12-15T22:46:03.559+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"-Still get kicked out of match because client takes too long to register a lock in for a pick or ban\n-Character slot in champ select frequently disappears during champ select (cosmetic issue)\n-Unable to access masteries for tweaking (as in the actual mastery trees, not the drop down list) after changing to a mastery (uncommon but still happens\n-Client failing to notify of changes in champ select (frequent. I get that people shouldn't be alt tabbed anyways, but if you're going to have a feature that forces the client to place itself above other windows when it's the player's turn to pick, you're basically telling them it's ok to Alt tab)\n-Consistent disconnect bug (This has been around even in legacy client, but it happens nearly every game in new client. Am aware that this is being tracked, but that's not why I listed it anyways)\n-Client fails to place player in the lobby for group matchmaking, still allows the host to que up as if the the player were there, obviously player doesn't get placed in champ select, but instead a new player is (meaning the client failed to update itself to place the joining player in the host's lobby, and made a mistake in showing the host that the joining player was in the lobby when they actually were not)\n\nSure, tons of improvements to performance.\n\nI understand that it's a beta for the client, but you guys need to understand that beta's shouldn't be made the default until they're actually stable enough. I would not consider this to be anywhere near stable enough (not for default anyways). You did right in allowing us to go back to legacy, but having to repatch the game for the same patch twice just to go back to legacy is pretty annoying. Legacy should still be the default client, and you should have made a separate update button for players that wanted to transition to the new client.\n\nAlso, not sure if it's client related or not, but a *lot* of users are suffering from some weird delay while in the actual game. The level of delay varies, but I know that it's typically between 2 and 5 seconds. I just played a game with it myself; it's like the game is ping spiking, but the ping indicator is only showing a very very very slight change (52-55 or 55-56ms ping). I'd imagine it's not client related since it takes place in game, but who knows.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XxBroKenxLotusxX","date":"2017-06-16T17:00:19.420+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about you just remove this client n stop messing with things cuz I got an old pc just enough to run it so I need the legacy cuz I cant even download the upgrade","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Remerak","date":"2016-11-16T22:08:56.322+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just asking I may be blind, but where is the item set/build page in the beta client? {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Grumbles","date":"2016-11-16T22:53:30.998+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Item set builder is not in the updated client but your existing item sets still work.

At least I often only notice it ftom the sound that I have just a few seconds left. ->Maybe some visuals and noticable sounds when it is your turn.\n\n2)The old habbit of typing \"mage\" or \"marksman\" in the searchbox when I want to see every champ of this class. It does not work. Be it championselect or in my Collection. These little Buttons to choose that exist in championselect are nice too have but I always typed it in and i do not see a reason why this shouldn't work.-> Honestly why does this not work? To further specify the search? That's totaly fine but i do not see the reason we can't have both options; Typing on OR clicking the pictures.\n\n3) The friendlist is not visible when you are in championselect.\n\nFriendlist:\n1) It is a reeeaally strange feeling that the friendlist is always visible. That kind of destroys the design for me.\n\n2)  It would be nice if you could \"hide\" the friends that are using the mobile client from your friendlist. I mean, you are not able to play with them anyways. nice that you can contact them and know that they are using the client but it is kind of confusing seeing them there all the time.\n\n3) I am missing the feature to \"unfold\" the recently-played-with-list below my actual friends. I know that I can still see it when I click on \"Add Friend\" but it was nice stalking someones profile from the friendlist .\n\nChat:\n1) The chat is just one window. Probably just takes some time getting used to that there is this one big window which is suddenly in the right corner, but it would be nice if you would be able to create a seperate window for one or more people, just like you can create Folders in your friendlist.\n\nGeneral:\n1) The client is still lagging. I believe this is the smallest issue, because it is still just the beta and this is understandable.\n\n\nThis probably sounded very harsh, but as i mentioned it is my opinion. In general I like the desing of the client. It nicely arranged and I will probably soon be able to find everything just as fast as before.
