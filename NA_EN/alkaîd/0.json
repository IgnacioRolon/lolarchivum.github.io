And the kicker: they stack unlike other forms of CC.\r\n\r\nLooking at other problematic factors of knock-ups, they are buggy as all hell. We've seen the highlights on youtube, or the LCS plays where a champion will suddenly disappear into the sky because they were doing a movement ability when smacked in the face by some knock-up (lee sin Q sending him into orbit is a good example) which just goes further into how unbalanced they are in the eyes of other CC where if you stack them it's less significant because of tenacity and the way stuns/snares/etc work.\r\n\r\nWould be really great if we could see some change to knock-ups/airborne/displacements in the future (or very soon) because it's just getting out of hand how little counter play there is to them (besides don't get hit).","replies":[{"poster":"GonahtanuGepardi","date":"2019-02-27T12:46:21.914+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":4,"body":">And the kicker: they stack unlike other forms of CC.\n\nThey do not stack any differently from stuns for example.

Knock ups have a duration based on how high the champ is (in a sense), they don't suddenly fall faster when they get knocked up twice as high.\n\nAnd that still doesn't look at the fact that knock ups are a buggy interaction that we've seen be buggy countless times.","replies":[{"poster":"GonahtanuGepardi","date":"2019-02-27T17:20:17.657+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":">Knock ups have a duration based on how high the champ is (in a sense), they don't suddenly fall faster when they get knocked up twice as high.\n\nThat's not true though. Knock-ups have a duration just like stuns do and you will fall faster if you get knocked up higher. As an example, look at malph ult. It doesn't exactly knock the enemy higher than some other abilities but the enemy still stays longer in the air. They basically \"hover\" in the air so technically the falling is slowed down in malph ult, while some other effects have them fall faster.\n\nMy point still stands that they do not stack any differently. Pretty pointless to bring bugs into this discussion though as it's something we can't argue about.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Naalith","date":"2019-02-27T21:38:41.113+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's... not true lmao.
