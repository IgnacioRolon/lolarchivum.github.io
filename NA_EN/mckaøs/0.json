Text and cursors too small even at max ui scaling","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recently got a laptop which has 4K resolution, playing League is fine on it but the ui is not optimized for it. It can be scaled up to 100% size, but now 90% of my screen is the HUD and map. And even scaling up the HUD and map does not scale up the text size, health bars, or cursor size. Also to add maxing out the size of the chat is still ridiculously small.\n\nI'd like to suggest making the scale range of all ui and HUD options much greater, with the addition of text size scale, and adding chat, mouse cursor size and health bars to the overall ui scaling.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-03T23:08:56.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"4K isn't totally supported currently, so you may run into issues especially if exceeding 1920x1080.
