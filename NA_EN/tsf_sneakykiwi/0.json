I have been playing other games for sometime, I think I am ready to take League's stress. I know that my account is permanent suspended. But I have proof of Riot lifting permanent bans, and making them temporary 14-days. I would like myself to be treated that way as a last chance. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2019-02-25T20:37:34.843+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"What proof do you have?\n\nThey did this briefly several months ago as an experiment, but itâ€™s very much not their usual practice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-25T21:22:02.106+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no second 14-day suspension to skip. You get one of those with a warning that it's your last opportunity to reform, and then, if you still don't reform, it's a perma. The unbanning experiment ended a long time ago, and I don't think it was a success (people got banned again).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-02-25T21:55:46.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would love to see the proof of riot unbanning accounts. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Anomander","date":"2019-02-26T17:10:45.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There have been a few EXTREME occasions.  \n\nOne was a 5 man premade that all came forward and said it was a joke report,  another was a borderline case where a rioter stepped in when a person received a 14 day ban while in a game then got reported again and was perma banned by that game before they could get the 14 warning.\n\nThere have also been 2-3 off meta bans like singe and nunu there were overturned.\n\nOther then those I can't think of any.    In all of these cases it was either a error due to a extremely rare case of off meta or a error in the system.

Even then, it is solely up to support whether they think you've earned another chance or they don't want you to be part of the league community anymore.","replies":[]}]}
