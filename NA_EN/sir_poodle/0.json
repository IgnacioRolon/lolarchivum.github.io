Whatever good Mundo had accomplished in his last attempt at a cure was suddenly undone. To Mundo&rsquo;s utter confusion, the child scurried away, utterly uncured. \r\n\r\nBut I&#039;m pretty sure that people aside from Ekko don&#039;t percieve him reversing time, only the final result. In the Chronbreak comic, the wounded guy keeps saying the same things, the whistling man expresses no confusion. Same thing in Ekko&#039;s story with his parents. And I&#039;m pretty sure that in the Ekko Q&amp;A, Rioters confirmed that.\r\n\r\nSo how does Mundo understand what&#039;s happening?

It was mildly amusing the first few times I saw entirely different Rioters give the response, but considering this is a hook I would actually love to see explored, I'm beginning to feel disappointed when this question is repeatedly met with \"Mundo because he is Mundo\". I know this is not done with any malice in heart, I just wish we could see something reminiscent of a real response, perhaps a \"Mundo's story in relation to his ability to perceive the manipulation of time shall be explained as he pleases\". Apologies if this comes across as crass, merely wanted to express my woes as they were.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SolarisCorvus","date":"2017-02-01T08:27:59.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mundo might have a case of super sanity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DwarvenGiant","date":"2017-01-31T20:45:49.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a theory that says Mundo could've been born in Icathia and affected by the Void, which would explain him being able to understand that Ekko is messing with time and easily grasp upon the idea:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/zEHiQiLm-i-just-realized-just-what-dr-mundo-is\n\nI'm usually not a fan of those \"THEY'RE FROM THE VOID/A DARKIN\", but this one would actually be a unique and interesting direction for a Zaunite character.","replies":[]}]}
