I'm Jason, I'm 20 and I've found the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. Soon into our relationship, we decided to try playing League of Legends together. Needless to say, we loved it. It became one of our biggest hobbies, and to this day we still play together almost every day and talk about upcoming updates/the professional scene. League has been a great way of bonding in our free time, we love not only the game, but playing it together. So much so that I want to make my proposal to her special and unexpected, and to do that, I need your help. I have this idea to make my own \"champion\" lore, to include my love for her, our life experiences and future, and at the end propose to her. But that's not all, to make it really hit home, I would love for a Riot employee to post it as a thread that I can show to her as a \"huge update\" while we're just casually sitting together. I know its not the most romantic way, but to us, I know it'd be perfect. So please, if you could keep this thread alive and try to help me get Riot's attention, that's all I can ask for. Thank you so much for reading this and being a part of my life that I would never have predicted :)","replies":[]}
