For any reason almost everyone, if not actually everyone, has left at least 1 game. Be it because there was a power outage, network fail or other issues. It has also happened to me to leave some games now and then for reasons, though never intentionally. But, you know, if you leave one game you dont get a leaverbuster, at least the last time it happened to me i didnt get. If you keep starting games, knowing you have a network issue, and leave cause internet shuts down, its 100% your fault. And seriously, you expect RIOT to allow you to ruin the game for other people simply because you cant understand that you should fix the problem instead of blaming others for giving you what you deserve, especially cause, seemingly you dont intend to accept your mistakes?\n\nPlus, this is their game, aka their rules and you agreed to those rules. You cant blame them for enforcing them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solicitude","date":"2018-03-26T20:24:24.179+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have a network error then its your problem. Riot cant do anything about it nor they can ask every single person that leaves the game why they left it. Since you have that problem you shouldnt play until is solved.

Your teammates deserves to have someone who can actually be there to contribute.\n\nTake some time to find out what's going on with your internet connection and if you can fix it. If it's something that you can't fix, it would be better to wait until you have a more stable connection if you don't want to be hit by leavebuster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eunson","date":"2018-03-26T22:07:19.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"When a game lasts 15-20 minutes yes... 5-10 minutes is a long time and should be perma banned imo.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-03-26T20:35:04.385+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a lot of steps to ensuring that players have a solid connection prior to entering the game. There's queue time, the clicks you have to do before entering lobby, banning a champion, and picking your champion. So they already have checkpoints prior to you entering the game. If you have connection problems, I'd recommend going over to [Help & Support](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/osqw6G4M), writing a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and/or heading over to the[ Lag Report](https://lagreport.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#).\n\nPlaying on a shitty connection sucks, as does Leaver Buster, and having a 4v5 in game. Hopefully you get this resolved. If you're unsure about your connection, queue up bots before trying out normals/ranked.
