There is a ladder of punishments, and this was the next step. Normally this game might get a chat restriction, but since you've had those before (or other prior punishments) and that did not significantly alter your behavior, a permanent ban was placed. \n\nIf you had a 2-week suspension on 5/6/19, then this was not enough games nor time to have reformed from your 2-week ban.\n\nAt any rate, you can contact [Support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com) if you wish to dispute your punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arngrim31","date":"2019-06-15T00:57:15.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=God Angol,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=bEEIkM0B,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2019-06-14T01:22:42.506+0000)\n>\n>  iv had a riot employee tell me each case is taken individually\n\nDo you have proof of this?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-06-14T01:20:22.917+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=God Angol,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=bEEIkM0B,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-06-14T01:16:34.862+0000)\n>\n> that dosent mater each case is taken individualy and in this case i did nothing wrong.. dident call names.. dident insult nothing\n\nThe punishment assigned to you **is** based on your previous history. It says as much when you're given a 14-day ban (that your next punishment may be a permanent one).\n\nYou spent a lot of time insulting jhin, his behavior, calling for people to report him, and gloating over your belief that he would be punished.\n\nThem insulting you first or behaving worse does not absolve you of your responsibility over your own behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"God Angol","date":"2019-06-14T01:29:44.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Julevi","date":"2019-06-14T01:34:04.164+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You wanna get a punishment here on the boards aswell?

You got a punishment because you broke the rules of behavior in one or more recent games, one of which was shown to you in the log. That punishment was a permaban because the temporary punishments you'd previously gotten didn't stop you from breaking those rules of behavior on an ongoing basis, and this is Riot's last resort to get you to cut it out. Now you can no longer break the rules on this account.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"jchapman","date":"2019-06-14T04:19:39.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"HecateHigurashi","date":"2019-06-14T04:21:25.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"agree","replies":[]}]}]}
