Believe me.\n\n\nBut anyway, if I had to make a really uneducated guess I'd say she'd probably be in her early-mid 20's. I think of her as akin to Katniss from the Hunger Games, but Katniss is like.. 16 I think. That's a bit too young-adult-fictiony, but Quinn could be be in the 18-24 range I think, depending on what we'd do with developing her story.","replies":[{"poster":"Liracy","date":"2014-11-09T08:54:40.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, still learning how these forums work. v.v; Just saw that you responded!
