Janna is already hard enough to catch out, but being able to throw out shields while maintaining 115 ms from {{item:3117}} and 25/50/75 ms from Cloud Drake just makes it even easier to dodge skillshots and spend minimal time in a risky range.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-03-03T20:45:09.120+0000","up_votes":99,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd love if we could make a universal change to what being \"out of combat\"/\"in combat\" means.

It would definitely make changes like the suggestion here - which I think is actually quite good - much more feasible.\n> \n> Nice suggestion op.\n\nHey, considering the topic of shields/heals. Has the design team considered reducing the duration of shields from enchanter champion? I feel like on of the problems with shields in general is that they last too long. It makes enchanters extremely easy to play because you aren't encouraged to actually shield damage. It's a drop and forget spell. Plus champions like Janna and Lulu have long duration shields on a fairly short cool down so they end up with 75-80% uptime (not sure the exact numbers atm as I am on my phone) even karma's shield is fairly long duration. \n\nI feel like it would be alot more fun to play against these champs if shields lasted like 1.5-2 seconds compared to 4-5 seconds. That would allow for supports actually looking good when they drop shields at the right time as well as giving opponents counterplay for actually damaging the shielded target without having to burn through the entire shield just to have it reapplied directly afterward. \n\nAlso shields should grant more cool things as the game progresses and more champions are updated/released. (right now we have on hit damage lulu- ad janna- ms karma- and armor/mr Ori) but what if shields granted stuff like tenacity similar to garen w or refreshes the next non ultimate spell cooldown or your next auto attack/spell briefly disrupts the attacked target. More ways for shields to effect the game aside from damage / defense. \n\n(Speaking entirely of enchanter/mage shields. Not the plethora of other shields in the game)","replies":[{"poster":"Steelflame","date":"2018-03-03T21:53:44.089+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Several of them end up with 100% uptime when they max CDR.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-03-03T22:22:01.213+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Steelflame,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fxjNuorg,comment-id=001600010001,timestamp=2018-03-03T21:53:44.089+0000)\n>\n> Several of them end up with 100% uptime when they max CDR.\n\nI could be wrong but I think that Janna is the closest with a 5 second shield and a 6.5 second cooldown.

I'm pretty sure Daisy hitting someone puts him in combat, though I'm not exactly sure.\n\n{{champion:37}} Q poke and passive which will put her in combat, which she usually wants to use to benefit her team with its aura.\n\n{{champion:16}} wants to constantly hit Q so she can sustain her self enough to heal and E is very important to her impact without her heal and it puts her in combat. \n\n{{champion:267}} Q will put her in combat, and her W which she sometimes doesn't have a lot of control of herself (it relies on ally and enemy positioning, more so than hers a lot of the time) if it bounces to an enemy will put her in combat, if an ally hits an enemy with her E I'm pretty sure it puts her in combat too (not sure about that one). \n\n{{champion:432}} Will Q to stun and his heal isn't that great and is mostly used out of combat, which means if someone uses it even though he's not in combat it would put him in combat even though he isn't.\n\n{{champion:497}} Uses his E mostly for mobility but he's very short ranged for an echanter mage so he's usually in combat anyways.\n\n{{champion:44}} Mostly the same instance (except mobility obviously) as Rakan, short ranged and his stun puts him in combat.\n\nA lot of these champions are already in combat when they shield, and will cast spells that hit enemies even when they are themselves are on the run. I don't think this will really change much, but having it in wouldn't really hurt anyone except maybe Bard since he puts shrines down for his allies to use around the map.\n\nMost of the champions in the game aren't going to be spamming their shield/heal without interacting with the enemy, they're not going to sit back and just do that, they will often also be using their other abilities while autoing. \n\nAlso apologies for grammar errors, I'm tired and sick atm lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ahferroin7","date":"2018-03-03T23:58:05.874+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This wouldn't change anything about Warmogs.
