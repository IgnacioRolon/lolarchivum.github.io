Because atm he excels in both.  He has a very strong shield with 90%AP scaling and a second cast which deals ok damage.  His W can be both an execute nuke (180 +55%AP or 270+82.5% if below 40%) and a huge self heal (190+35%AP or 285+52.5%AP if he is below 40%)\n\nLarge heals + large shields + large damage tend to make the champ problematic, as every time you think you have them, they mitigate you burst and heal back to full while chunking you.  For me personally, I'd like to see power taken from W+E and added to his Q","replies":[{"poster":"Ahris","date":"2019-02-13T22:08:44.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is a melee that uses mana who cannot build tanky and has no escapes.

I can assure you, he has plenty of mobility to invoke an escape. Ekko doesn't have 'sustain' until level 6. I don't think any AP assassins have any kit/non-ult healing right now, except Sylas if we call him an assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"Steelflame","date":"2019-02-14T20:40:16.698+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sylas only has mobility INTO a fight other than a very small E dash away.

This way Sylas would need to carefully balance his build between damage, survivability, and mana more so then he does currently. This way just building something like a Ludens echo would get him mana and damage but his heal and shield would be lacking... ensuring he will die just as quickly as he can kill. Building something like a proto belt would give him a better heal with some dmg a bit earlier mind you but he wont be able to stick around thanks to needing mana. The best way to get all these would be a rod of ages, and that ensures he wont be such an issue for the 5 or so minutes it takes to start getting efficient.\n Point being he would need to decide what's more important early on and perhaps they could even adjust him to be stronger overall for it.
