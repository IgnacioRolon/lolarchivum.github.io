The game seemed fine at first but as it progressed things got worse. I noticed my last hitting felt a little off, then there was a clearly visible delay between my button presses and what was happening in the game. Eventually it got to the point where there was a 3 minute delay between my actions and what happened ingame including chat. Near the end it was beyond 5 and my game was completely desynced to the point where what other players and minions were doing was basically incompehensible.  Multiple attempts to restart the game did not fix the issue. Once I got into post game chat the delay was completely gone.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-14T16:22:08.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be experiencing packet loss in your game which is causing these input delays.
