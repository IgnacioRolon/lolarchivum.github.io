His hook damage went down along with the flay active damage and AD ratio on his flay AA. His mana costs went up. His lantern shield got about a 10% increase but made only work on 2 people. His ult went from 1 wall 100% damage and 4 walls 50% damage to 1 wall 100% damage. Talk about favored by Riot am i rite? They have even said his problem is he has massive utility to bring to the table and the only way you can remove that is by completely reworking him and guess what that means. He will just turn up stronger because his ult is in a really bad state against most champs (99% slow is nice and all but most champs use dashes and such now.\n\nBut oh its perfectly okay to have Morgana or Leona in bot lane being almost nearly as bad as him because they aren't Thresh. Leona is the reason Thresh is allowed to be as strong as he is. She has so much stupid stick potential that people like Thresh have to be able to peel and infinite CC (honestly her ult range needs to be dropped, its a fucking sniper CC ability with low CD on a tank meant to stick to people for years). And Morgana just does well because she has a 100% ratio on her Q which also roots for 3s and a spell shield that you can't break as long as you don't have significant magic damage. Braum I am fine with being strong because he has his risks and they keep purposely making him weaker at engaging (because he is meant to peel) and often dies for saving his team due to the CC absorption.\n\nAnd no I do not hate any of these champs. But when people start and try and complain about their supports not being viable I have to be honest and point out where the problems stem from. I do not hate any of these champs, but they all pose problems to balance save Braum (he does his role and he does it well and doesn't do other roles that well).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"magic pole","date":"2015-08-08T23:57:35.038+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"flat 50%. the most balanced champ of all time {{champion:26}}","replies":[{"poster":"ViashinoWizard","date":"2015-08-09T01:42:17.536+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"of all time\"\n\nAhhhhhhh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fashion Mage","date":"2015-08-09T19:53:20.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, his win rate is 47.4~%, and he has the second worst popularity in the game. #BuffZilean","replies":[{"poster":"magic pole","date":"2015-08-12T15:35:38.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree, i love zil but haven't played him as much recently.
