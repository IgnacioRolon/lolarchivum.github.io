This seriously cripples his first clear. The blue buff monsters all popped my shield with 1 AA a piece.

Either way, the health scaling nerf hit him very hard, because even with very defensive runes and masteries, it will still only shield him for about 65 - 75 health (again, depending on level and your health bonus), which breaks instantly to Raptors, Wolves (until level 3), Krugs, Gromp, Red, and Blue. Unless you put ranks into it almost immediately (like W>Q>W>E>Q>Q...) your clear really suffers along with your sustain putting that second point in at level 3 would allow it to not break on first hit when fighting Wolves, Gromp, *maybe* Raptors (not quite sure), and *maybe* Krugs.
