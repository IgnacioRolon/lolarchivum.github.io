Kai'Sa's earlygame was just like Gangplank's. Farm and wait to scale up and then trash anyone who gets in your way once they HAVE scaled up\n\nKai'Sa didn't work in botlane because of her scaling like how ADCs used to scale\n\nBefore Riot made gold-value changes to ADC items(and other buffs), ADCs wouldn't be useful until around the 30-minute mark when they had 3-4 items\n\nDelaying an ADCs \"core\" to 30 minutes is what ADCs are supposed to DO. Riot initially thought this and supported this\n\nADC2K17 was brought about because the elemental drakes weren't a thing, so it was just dragon. Dragon gave global gold(a lot of it) and gave buffs for every time you killed a dragon. This made 4-5 man diving parties at botlane popular because it was impossible to defend against as just an ADC+Support\n\nAfter getting a free kill against an enemy ADC+Support, the dragon would also be free to take because enemy teams wouldn't have the manpower/damage to contest\n\nIf a team didn't use this strategy against a team that DID use this strategy, the team that didn't use this strategy would lose. **_GUARUNTEED_**\n\n\nADCs being almost useless until 30 minutes and 3-4 items in was a part of League's main draw to being an ADC. Sure you'd have to wait a while BUT then you become unstoppable afterwards(assuming team is grouped up and peeling properly)\n\nAs of right now, there is no phase in the game where an ADC is weak. ADCs get to deal as much damage as AND Melee champs' earlygame, more damage midgame with an RNG change to deal even MORE damage, and then lategame ADCs get to consistently run over any Melee champ that wanted to have fun\n\nMelee champs have a slightly good earlygame, a great midgame, and generally a worse midgame than any ADC ever will have\n\nI'll have you know that NOBODY is asking for Riot to make marksmen unplayable. NOBODY!!!\n\nwhat people are asking for is for Marksmen to have an actual weak earlygame if their lategame is supposed to be where they shine(generically speaking)\n\nOutliers like Lucian, Corki, Vayne, and now Kai'Sa are able to abuse most champs in the earlygame while proceeding to outscale most champs in the lategame. This leaves these few champs with 1 \"weak\" point in the entire game, and that's the midgame\n\nThe midgame is really just a point in the game where ADCs have a small chance to be shut down. A point in time that, if missed, will result in a loss for whichever side doesn't have the lead(assuming two teams are equally skilled)\n\nThere are Mages and Fighters that are in a similar position. Veigar won't ever have a really good early-midgame(even if he farmed Q perfectly) without an enemy messing up horridly and dying to him a lot. That would make it the fault of the enemy\n\nJax's early-midgame are famously exploitable for how easily he can be shut down at those times. Until the 30 minute mark when Jax has 3-4 items, he isn't very useful\n\nKarthus's early-midgame is only good against melee champs, and even then he's extremely vulnerable to any jungle pressure and/or mobility.

Scores of players were directly telling Rioters to be cautious, that players need time to learn her better, and to buff her conservatively with regards to how she evolves in the game's meta. The response? A perfunctory comment telling us that post-release balance changes are always done with extreme caution, that Riot wouldn't do anything of the sort if they didn't strongly believe that those buffs were warranted, and that balance changes go through a rigorous vetting process before they even hit the PBE. Fast forward to now, and Kai'Sa has a 52.8% win rate and a 20.8% play rate at Plat and above. She has been _way_ overbuffed, and so in a manner players have critiqued repeatedly before those buffs were even made known to us. We don't need more blanket post-release buffs, we need Riot to give new champions time to adjust so that their true potential can be properly assessed.\n\nWhat's more is that Riot has also said that they'd be unwilling to revert these buffs, because whichever direction they'd take her following nerfs would somehow make her even healthier than immediately following her release. Riot needs to listen, and they need to change their balancing strategy with respect to new and overhauled champions. If they tell us again that they're implementing a post-release buff in absolute certainty, Kai'Sa will be but one of many examples that show that they've gone down that exact same path before, and are most likely to cause the same problems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-03-30T21:01:42.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Ummm they didnt.
