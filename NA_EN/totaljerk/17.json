It actually increases your AD and AP ratios by 8% when calculating damage against champions. This means it does nothing for your clearing or objective taking, and that champions with lower ratios and core items with less raw AP/AD receive less benefit from it. Supports and full tanks in particular gain almost nothing from Infernal Drake. It&#039;s even _worse_ when you&#039;re dealing with a spell that uses bonus AD scaling instead of total AD. Here&#039;s a little something I just posted on Reddit:\n\n>A Zed with Ghostblade and Cleaver deals 309 damage with Q at max rank. Infernal drake bumps that up to 316.92. This means Infernal Drake effectively added 7.92 damage to Zed&#039;s Q. If it did a flat 8% more damage, he would&#039;ve gained 24.72 damage, well over triple that.\n\nI&#039;m definitely not saying that Infernal drake is bad, more damage can always be appreciated, and the global exp is nothing to scoff at.

This can be more than 8% damage, if you're an AA heavy champ who buys a lot of crit your damage will increase by more than 8%, if you're a mage who uses entirely spells it will be far less than 8% because you rely on bases as much as ratios.\n\nI soloed an Infernal as Xin then went back and bought an Amp tome, gaining 22 AP rather than 20 because of the 8% bonus AP, I also have 5 extra AD from the Infernal.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/yhA4VVG.jpg\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wVX2hnI.jpg\n\nWhat this means is that Infernal Drake makes you stronger VS Baron, Dragon, Minions, Champions and Towers.

You can never get above an 8% damage boost from the dragon by being an autoattacker, because no matter how much crit and attack speed you have, your autoattack damage will always increase by exactly 8% with each dragon buff (unless you have some form of ability damage on your autos like Vayne). I can prove this with an example.\n\nSay we have 100 AD, 1 attack per second and 50% crit chance (this numbers are obviously fake, but they're just for simplicity's sake). Over 4 attacks, you would expect to do 600 damage (2 hits for 100, 2 crits for 200). 8% of 600 is 48. If you had 8 bonus AD from the dragon, you would expect to do 648 damage (2 hits for 108, 2 crits for 216). So, you have an increase in autoattack damage of exactly 8%. You can do this with any values for AD, crit and attack speed, and I promise you that the increase to autoattack dps from a dragon will always equal 8%, unless you have an on-hit effect like Varus W (the dragon will not increase the base damage of the on-hit, so Varus will get less than an 8% increase).\n\nSo, basically, the more damage you get from autoattacks and from bonus AD/AP scaling, and the less you get from ability base damage, the closer to an 8% damage boost you will get from a dragon. That's actually a good way to determine exactly how ham you should go for the infernal drake, and exactly how many of your team it is worth abandoning to guarantee that nice juicy fire dragon damage.","replies":[{"poster":"CeexSett","date":"2016-06-20T11:18:54.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, Varus's W scales with AP, so if you had some AP before, you will get a bit more AP, technically increasing the damage by 8%.\n\nStill agree with everything else.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2016-06-20T11:30:31.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">technically increasing the damage by 8%.\n\nIt won't be an increase of 8% to his autoattack damage, because it won't boost the base damage of the W.

I can work out an equation to prove this if you like.\n\nNo ability that has a base damage will have its damage increased by 8%.
