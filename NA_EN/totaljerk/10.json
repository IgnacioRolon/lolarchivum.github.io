Q cooldown starting from the time of its first cast means she can keep it on an effective 1 second cooldown and harass forever because she's manaless.\n\nHer shield is on a similarly absurd cooldown and lets her take 2-3 tower shots. Keep in mind {{champion:78}} had her shield nerfed dramatically because it was \"free,\" in conjunction with courage of the colossus, which later got nerfed itself, leaving her just plain fucking weaker than before the mastery was introduced. But Riven? Nah let's let her get an empowered auto attack attached to a dash and a shield for no mana cost and on a 10 second cooldown. We'll also let this defensiveoffensive skill scale with ONE HUNDRED PERCENT bonus AD so she doesn't even have to build defensively to make the most of it. Oh and it goes down to a 6 second cooldown with rank.\n\nWe'll also give her a knockup to invalidate tenacity, and a stun that can be linked from that knockup before it finishes so her opponent has no way of countering the followup R slash. And that stun will also scale with ONE HUNDRED PERCENT bonus AD.\n\n\n\nIt's honestly disgusting. Being a manaless character should come with drawbacks in either phase-specific damage gating, longer cooldowns, vulnerable downtime on missed skills, or fragility. Instead Riven is a lane bully and a hypercarry simultaneously, has virtually nonexistent cooldowns, escape options for days if she mispositions, and a reliable, repeatable shield on top of otherwise still average defenses.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GGLineaR","date":"2017-10-18T15:15:19.816+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if you do play the Role often, it still feels that way.\n\nThen again, I main {{champion:83}} , so it's not like I shouldn't expect it.","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2017-10-18T15:23:13.572+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.
