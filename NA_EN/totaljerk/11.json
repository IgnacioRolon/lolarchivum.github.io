Jarvan got nerfed 3 patches later, reducing the number of meta junglers to 3.\n**6.1:** Was basically ADCs in every lane all the time. ADCs were relevant at every stage, having strong early, mid, AND lategames.\n**7.1:** Camile, Leblanc, and Rengar were on permaban status.\n\nI wasn't around for previous preseasons, but I doubt they were any better. We'll probably get around 5 or 6 patches in before the game is actually balanced, then Riot will knock everything on its head again with midseason changes or a major class update.","replies":[{"poster":"Abibyama","date":"2018-01-02T13:17:54.030+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least they wonâ€™t do any class reworks anymore\n\nTheir mid season patch is probably gonna be some AP items rework or something similar","replies":[{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2018-01-04T03:54:03.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They've done that two mid seasons in a row already (Season 5 and 6).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Void Baboon RF","date":"2018-01-02T17:14:48.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only people who thought this were the shills on reddit they gave riot stickers to to pretend riot's 1 patch a month preseason work schedule was going to do absolutely anything \n\nI actually love how people, especially riot, are already talking about how they can't work anymore cause they're waiting for mid season.  god damn i wish i worked at riot.  or not worked, cause they don't work, more like loafed at riot.  must be the dream getting paid to take 1 ad off teemo and calling top lane fixed.  i don't even need to be good at the game, that's the amazing thing, i can literally be a gold shitter and i'd already be more qualifed than their entire balance team.  yo riot hook me up i can pretend to be working while really doing nothing as good as the best of them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2018-01-03T07:07:20.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah it won't be a class update that fucks everything up. It'll be Worlds. Its always the worlds patch. Riot will finally get the game in a decent state and then buff all the hyper-cancer #LCSBIGPLAYS champions while nerfing a bunch of champs who are already struggling (I don't even know why they bother buffing Cassiopeia).","replies":[]}]}
