Use time as a factor only, because bringing Win % in means time is now irrelevant because now time as a factor now becomes COMPLETELY arbitrary.\n\nSay a new Champ comes out, do we ban it for the first week then release it no matter what? Do we keep it banned if it's Win % goes up in Normals? When do you start taking into account their Win % in Ranked? If they dip back under X range do they get auto banned again for just being terrible Champions?\n\nEither do it a flat time based (1st week ban) or don't do a ban at all, which... really... there's no reason there should be a ban on new Champions at all. If players wish to take a brand new Champion they have little to no experience into Ranked that's their prerogative, it's part of how the game (and competitive games in general) work.\n\nBut don't try and bring Win % in as a factor that really means anything because we've seen both sides.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zigzagtiger","date":"2015-07-12T08:44:14.184+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:245}}","replies":[{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2015-07-12T11:00:49.396+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zigzagtiger,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pAEsJlAZ,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2015-07-12T08:44:14.184+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:245}}\n\nThe only time you see decent win rates on a new champ that champ is broken.
