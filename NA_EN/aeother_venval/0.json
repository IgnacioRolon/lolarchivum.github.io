Now i don&#039;t know about you but when ever i played with Shyvana I always enjoyed fighting dragon on dragon and with these elemental dragons I occurred to me. What if we made an ultimate skin that changes based on what elemental dragon she slays. Udyr and Sona already have different forms based of stance or music they are in so it wouldn&#039;t be a stretch if Shyvana gets involved in slaying a dragon she can change into that form with a magic gem she acquired on her adventures with Demaica or revisiting her people to avenge her father\r\n\r\nInfernal: Not to much i can think of would change with this as she is already fire. Perhaps her fire grows more wild with her on Q,W, and E.  Ultimate R her dragon form would take more of an appearance of the infernal drake as her Q she growls ready to sink her teeth into her target, W fire rips out from the ground as her E would be the same sadly i don&#039;t have an idea for that.\r\n&quot;They will all burn for what they did&quot; Quote for slaying\r\n\r\nEasier stuff because its not fire lol\r\nMountain: Her armor becomes more stone perhaps with a touch of vines or moss covering it. Her Q would be like a hard punch being covered completely in stone. W she would rip the stone from the ground and surround her (sort of like {{champion:163}} Q) E she shoots out a stone brick. R As before with Infernal she would take shape like the Mountain Drake, her scales being covered with the earth having a protective shell around her. Ultimate Q: Again her Q holds a growl but echos more with the stone body as caves usually echo. W she rips up the earth in her trail causing a trail of spikes to go up. E She shoots out earth shards that crash into the ground as a mountain drake breath attack did.\r\n&quot;Mountains will quiver before me..hahaha&quot; Quote for slaying\r\n\r\nOcean: Her red armor because tinted with a sea blue and gold replaced with a silver. Her Q would be water surrounding her fists as water crashing against people or even an ice effect (little cheating with that one) W the tides of the water would surround her, E shoots out a ball of water. Ultimate: She takes the form of ocean drake like the others or maybe even more of sea serpent. As she goes into flight a wave of water follows behind her. Ult Q: Unlike the other where she could growl instead let it more of a song of a siren to call out as to the calm before a storm of Shyvana would come. Ult W: her trail would rip open an abyss that would damage enemies. Ult E: Shoots out a larger water blast\r\n&quot;No sea is safe is for the enemies of Demica&quot; Quote for slaying\r\n\r\nWind: Her armor becomes a cloudy blue or blueish white. Her Q would form mini tornadoes around her gauntlets, W would be a wind storm around her maybe throw in little buildings (or mini teemos because they are evil) to be trapped in the wind or heck even minions that die in burnout shrink down and get trapped there for that one spell. E Shoots out a burst of wind or a cloud. Ultimate: She flies out a large cloud with the winds pushing eneimes back. Ult Q: Howling wind blows as she bites her enemy, W the destruction of the storm lays behind her maybe with some lightning trail behind her. Ult E: Shoots out a three bursts of wind.\r\n&quot;The winds will not stand against the flags of Demica&quot; Quote for slaying\r\n\r\nElder: Completely silver with sharp spikes coming from her shoulders. This form I was thinking would have wings weither she is in her half form or in her dragon form sadly like Inferal I don&#039;t know all the can really be done but switching her dragon form to look like elder and her flames to be switched a blue flame just like the elder dragon. As stated with inferal hard to think of idea when it already uses fire. \r\n&quot;No more will anyone stand in my way!&quot; Quote for slaying\r\n\r\nOnce Shyvana has slain two of these drakes she is allowed to swap between forms with Ctrl 6 and when swapping forms she may repeat her slaying quote.","replies":[{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2016-06-10T00:12:58.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dragons","replies":[]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2016-06-09T03:59:24.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea but I don't like that you gotta slays the drakes to get it.
