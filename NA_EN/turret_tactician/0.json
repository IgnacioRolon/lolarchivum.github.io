This account is the owner of the club since I was on this account when clubs opened up, but I use the tag on a different account.\r\n\r\nI wanted to start leveling this account and use the tag here too, but the client (Legacy and Beta) both show that this account isn't in any clubs when I log in on it. This account still shows as owner to other people in the club though.\r\n\r\nThis kind of sucks, because I can't use the tag on this account and I can't invite people to the club. Any tips?","replies":[{"poster":"Xydines","date":"2017-07-11T06:14:23.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm experiencing the same issue!\n\nSummoner name: Xydines\nClub: suhhh dude\ntag: TQULA","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-29T22:47:33.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I pushed a button from our end that may have resolved the issue for you.\n\nLet me know if you're still experiencing it, though. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"LosingLikeVegeta","date":"2017-02-01T03:23:22.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same problem where it shows me as the leader of my club on all my friends accounts but it dose not appear in my client anywhere.\nmy account club is ¤Hakuna Matata¤ with the tag !G0D! any help would be greatly appreciated can't fins a solution anywhere","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-01T03:35:06.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hit the same button for your account.
