This only started yesterday, and it looks like the error has something to do with memory or something along those lines? I've tried to reinstall the game, and updated my graphics driver but it doesn't look like it helps. I'm still not sure whether or not this is an issue that the client is having or if it is my computer. Any help would be appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-13T19:01:00.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This can be pretty scary to see, and it might be due to hardware failure.
