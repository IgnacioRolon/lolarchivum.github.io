I will get a \"Check your internet connection prompt.\"\r\n\r\nI used to fix this by just closing everything and restarting the client. Sometimes I would have to repair corrupted files etc.\r\n\r\nNow what happens is after the game closes (For any reason, through task manager, standard close), the game will not reopen and I'll have to restart my computer.\r\n\r\nI've tried repairing the client and reinstalling the game and am not sure where to proceed from here.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-03T22:23:25.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What may be happening is that your client loses its ability to maintain a good connection to our servers, thus cannot even connect to the patching servers to start up again.
