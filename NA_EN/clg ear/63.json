She&#039;s a demacian, but the only demacian champion with this accent. Lux, Garen, Poppy, Shyvana, etc. don&#039;t have French accents. So, where did hers come from? Even more confusing is house du Couteau. Obviously a french derived name, Katarina and Cassiopeia were born to this house; but they are Noxian and reside in Noxus; a sworn enemy of Demacia. In ancient times was there a split between French--accented tribes and some went to where Noxus is now and a smaller contingent went to what is now Demacia? Makes no sense. \r\n\r\nSame with Caitlyn and Camille of Piltover. They have thicc british accents, but no other Piltover champions do. Is it because of their nobility during their upbringing? Maybe richer persons living in Piltover have british accents compared to the lower classes, but again where do these accents come from? The United Kingdom doesn&#039;t exist in this universe. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/kaTXexm.jpg[]","replies":[]}
