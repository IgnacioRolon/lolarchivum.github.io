I made a reference to today's generation of parents not being as responsible for their offspring, like not vaccinating their children; and she said she wouldn't vaccinate her kids. \r\n\r\nI was like what. \r\n\r\nShe said she wasn't going to have them go to public school. I said ok they can still get sick and die though. She just shook her head like it wouldn't happen\r\n\r\nShe said that her sister, who has a kid, was all happy and vibrant, but the day after he got his vaccinations he was the complete opposite. I asked how long ago that was because it didn't just happen yesterday did it. She didn't answer; but she said that her sister is a teacher at an inner city school and the people on medicaid/foodstamps their children got \"a bad batch\" of vaccines but her sister who had insurance did not. I said wtf does that have to do with you making sure your kids get vaccinated so they don't get encephalitis from the measles and die.\r\n\r\nThen she went on this tangent about doctors giving black people shots to make them unable to have kids. I started to say this wasn't 1920 and doctors aren't part of some world wide conspiracy to poison people; but i knew i wasn't going to get through to her no matter how many facts I presented. \r\n\r\nshit","replies":[]}
