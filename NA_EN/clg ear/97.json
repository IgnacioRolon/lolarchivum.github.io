Yet, she can lift, let alone run around and steadily fire, a full size machine gun as well as an automatic rocket launcher. An m134 minigun weighs about 85 pounds. With a bunch of 7.62x51mm ammo it&#039;s most likely over 100 pounds, and odds are jinx&#039;s machine gun does not shoot those rounds. More than likely it&#039;s a 20mm cannon, and the m61 vulcan weighs around 250 pounds without ammunition. With ammo it&#039;s gotta be over 300 pounds. With that and her rocket launcher and a couple hundred rockets, she&#039;s carrying around 500 pounds of gear. And, who knows how heavy a super mega death rocket is. The AGM-65 Maverick tactical air-to-ground missile would probably fit the role of a &quot;super mega death rocket&quot; but one weighs 460-600 pounds, so I doubt she uses that. \r\n\r\nAlso, she his highly intelligent and cunning; much like the Joker. Just because she is insane, doesn&#039;t mean she&#039;s stupid. They make it a point in Caitlyn&#039;s lore that the sheriff of piltover is able to solve almost all crimes in piltover and keep the crime rate impressively low, yet both Caitlyn and Vi constantly fail to capture Jinx; despite the Al&#039;Qaeda levels of destruction this single 110 pound girl manages to create. So much so that Caitlyn had to declare a state of emergency and issue a city wide manhunt to find this girl. They never did. \r\n\r\nI believe that Jinx was subjected to some sort of experimentation during her time in Zaun, and the different serums that she was subjected to granted her super strength, speed, and intelligence; but warped her mind, driving her insane. \r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tCjg3AB.jpg","replies":[]}
