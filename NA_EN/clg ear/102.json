Now she&#039;s got blood all over her appendage and that blood will leave a trail. That&#039;s the last thing you want as a killer assassin who wants to remain secret. \r\n\r\nAlso, walking or running wouldn&#039;t that dull the tip of the blade and cause horrible imbalance? The girl from Kingsman, her legs are designed to be able to walk and keep balance. A little tip wouldn&#039;t be able to carry the weight of a thicc lady I don&#039;t think. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t think she was of sound mind when deciding to turn her legs into swords","replies":[]}
