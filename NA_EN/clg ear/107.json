He got banned for his words to a feeding malphite, and the malphite probably is still playing the game because Riot doesn&#039;t care that idiots ruin games as long as they don&#039;t cuss at their team. \r\n\r\nAFKs and trolls are a major issue and cause more problems and headaches in game than some kid saying the F-word to his team, yet Riot only focuses on chat because it&#039;s easier to prove that someone used naughty words in all chat than a player intentionally feeding during a match. There&#039;s also the issue of games starting when they clearly shouldn&#039;t because a player is only at 20% load; but clearly some guy telling his team to fuck off is a bigger problem than starting a losing match because you&#039;re down one player.","replies":[]}
