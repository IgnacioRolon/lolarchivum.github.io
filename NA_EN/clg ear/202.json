Cloud9 looks really good right now, but I think Immortals will take a game off of them. P1 will steamroll Envy I think. As for TSM vs Liquid, that could go either way. Dig will streamroll Echo Fox since they&#039;re dead last. \n\nAlso someone else will have to do the LCS thread tomorrow because I wont be here :( \n\ntwitch stream IMT vs C9 / TSM vs Liquid : https://www.twitch.tv/nalcs1\n\ntwitch stream P1 vs Envy / EF vs Dig : https://www.twitch.tv/nalcs2\n\nyoutube lcs1 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ExokQ6GCO8\n\nyoutube lcs2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozHgiPUPxfc\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HoQ2zNv.jpg","replies":[]}
