Leo has swords which are for slashing and piercing and Raphael has Sais which are stabbing and piercing. Obviously for a kids&#039; movie they couldn&#039;t have the heroes stabbing and chopping peoples&#039; heads off. \r\n\r\nAlso in the 2nd movie they didn&#039;t fight Super Shredder. Super Shredder collapsed the pier he was under and got crushed, even though in the 1st movie normal Shredder survived getting crushed by a trash compactor. \r\n\r\nAlso the 3rd movie was bad.","replies":[]}
