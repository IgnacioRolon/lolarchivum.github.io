The Honor FAQ does state \"youâ€™ll unlock even more rewards at the end of the season\", so at this point, it looks like you'll be eligible for extra rewards depending on your Honor Level. \n\nWith that being said, Honor is still a relatively new system of course. There's still a chance for End of Season Ranked Rewards to be rewarded based on your Honor Rank.","replies":[{"poster":"Siegfriedx1","date":"2017-07-14T03:14:36.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey broporo, can you answer me why i don't receive answers to my recent post asking for help?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-14T03:45:23.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopping on over there now!
