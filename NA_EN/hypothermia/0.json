I average 190 cs at 20 on zed, 120 cs at 20 on ahri, and 160 cs at 20 on yasuo. I have played game after game trying to be the nicest person possible. I call my preferred position and if it's taken I pick whatever isn't. I can't get a single game where a player doesn't afk, feed, or put everyone down. I honestly don't know what to do at this point. I got placed bronze IV and got demoted to bronze V and then got back into bronze VI and then promoted to bronze III and then demoted all the way back to bronze V and then back to bronze VI and now back to bronze V again and this just continues to repeat itself over and over and over again. I understand that I make mistakes and I should analyze them, but how is it possible that league can give me such shit luck in human beings to play with. I'm about ready to make another account and just attempt to place higher because this doesn't feel possible right now.","replies":[]}
