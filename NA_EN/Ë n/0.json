I was browsing the forums to try and understand this issue and most people are absolutely livid about afk&#039;s in ranked. I think the punishment for afk&#039;ing in ranked is so forgiving and down right stupid (if they get punished at all). Why doesn&#039;t riot treat this matter much harsher so it insentivises people to NEVER AFK IN RANKED. *Like can we get a 24 hour ban if they afk in ranked or something drastic that forces people to sit through their games and play and not ruin ranked for their whole team*. I get it life happens and sometimes you need to stop playing and &quot;that&#039;s fine&quot; but you should have a harsh penalty regardless of what your reasons for leaving whether legit or not (because its not your reasons for leaving but what you cause by afk&#039;ing that matters). \r\n\r\n              For example lets say someone is a parent and their kid is acting up and requires the parents attention while they are playing a ranked game. Now obviously your child is more important than a online game however it&#039;s not for the rest of your team, meaning THEY should not suffer because YOU have a problem that needs attending. I&#039;m not saying to never afk because sometimes you need to in extreme circumstances but you should expect a harsh consequence and maybe not play ranked if you have obligations that would take you away from the game. The point I&#039;m trying to make is right now its not even a big deal or a problem to afk in a ranked game because its &quot;just a game&quot;. Ranked shouldn&#039;t be an environment of casually playing a game and leaving if you need to but a serious environment where you are focused on the game and not anything else. I don&#039;t think that reporting an afk after a game does ANYTHING WHAT SO EVER. \r\n\r\n               I&#039;m going to stop now because I might be ranting a bit but PLEASE make it so people THINK TWICE about afk&#039;ing in a ranked game by making it something that should rarely if ever happen and** heavily convince players that they shouldn&#039;t be playing ranked if they may need to afk.\r\n**\r\n\r\n_**p.s.**_ I&#039;m not trying to tell anyone that a game is more important that anything else and that you should never afk. Life is more important than a game but you can&#039;t make 4 other people suffer for it. If you need to afk do it but you should also accept that it&#039;s not ok for ranked games and you should be blocked from playing to prevent more afk&#039;ing. (I have seen crazy suggestions like perma bans for afk&#039;s that are rediculous but it should be HARSH something to stop the player from playing ranked for a while that is noticeable enough)\r\n\r\nIf I am incorrect and you think that afk&#039;ing is dealt with fine please explain because I really believe the system for the issue isn&#039;t working at all. thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-08-20T02:05:27.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you report them? A lot of afker's will sit there and click to move around so that leaverbuster wont catch them as easily. If someone is doing this then the only real way they will get caught is if you report them for afk/leaving. Unfortunately most people don't do this, which is why so many people are able to afk without getting caught.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Itankyou","date":"2016-08-20T01:55:40.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People afk normally when they feel that their team can't come back from a game, they do this because int feeding is an instant 14 day ban. So, afk-ing is a safer alternative for trolls and it shouldn't be that way. I agree with harsher punishments imo it is worse than int.","replies":[]}]}
