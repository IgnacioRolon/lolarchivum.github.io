As a first step though, I suggest instead running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) in case there are other or local issues.  The reader will yield results about your increased ping, as well as instructions specific to your case for a resolution.  Hopefully, that should get you back in game without issue!","replies":[]}]}
