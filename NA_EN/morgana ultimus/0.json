I&#039;ve decided to not talk at all in the game.  I use pings and emotes frequently.   \n\nUsually I play support and I roam quite a bit.  I ping where I&#039;m going.  If bot lane is losing hard I may just entirely roam.  I&#039;ll always end up with at least an A- in every game.  So it's not like I'm feeding or doing poorly.   \n\nWin or lose, without fail, somebody in post game chat begs for my report for toxicity.  Which I find amusing because I literally say nothing at all.   Can I still get in trouble?  I immediately report people who beg for my reports and say in the comments that they&#039;re harassing me by begging for reports in post game chat.  \n\nHonestly, I&#039;m not sure how to be a part of the LoL community.  If you talk a lot you will just get in trouble.  If you don&#039;t talk... well you still piss people off.  \nIt&#039;s really some special snowflake stuff.  \n\nSo can I get in trouble if my chat logs are literally empty?","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2018-02-19T05:30:51.333+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"refusing to communicate is not a report option\n\neven when it was years ago, it was just a placebo report that doesn't really go anywhere","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-02-19T05:05:11.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"no","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mama Soraka","date":"2018-02-21T04:26:38.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm that's odd. I also play support and use pings and emotes way more than I use chat but I usually end up with a bunch of honors instead of people asking to report me. I feel like there is something missing from your description of how you play, like maybe -- total shot in the dark here -- you could be using emotes or pings to try and tilt your fellow players.\n\nI dunno, just a thought.\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"afmghost","date":"2018-02-19T22:08:26.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.

Being reported \"enough\" really has nothing to do with it alltogether.\n\nIt's technically true that it's safer to just never speak... Just like it's safest in terms of traffic accidents to just never cross a street. The question is: Is the original risk so high that it warrants such an extreme response, rather than just being careful?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"swordofsun","date":"2018-02-19T18:05:23.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're not doing anything worthy of being punished then you won't be punished.
