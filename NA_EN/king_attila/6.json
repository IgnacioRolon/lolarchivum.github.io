Either from premade \"abuser\" or someone else. \nBut i'm no \"omg premades holdingme back toget out of bronze\". Currently i am again in plat 3 and i've already been to plat 1 with 60 points playing with and against diamond V and IV and since i don't drop back to gold or something i'd say i'm a rather good player but what bothers me most is the amount of boosted players in this region. \nLook at my last 3 GP games. The last 2 were with 3 premades in my team. At first i thought easy win but oh boy. A frickin gold 1 graves in jungle with 3/10 in this elo. His other two premades naut and lucian also both died TWICE the times i did. Over 10 deaths in plat 2 elo is something which should nothappen (yes i had some 10 deaths games too mostly thanks to premades towerdiving me over and over again). In the last game, just look at vayne and naut dmg (both premades as well with alistar). 75% KP, 4,00 KDA, most dmg. I really tried, i really did. \nBut those two 3 men premades are in this elo but should never be. They die too often, their CS is HORRIBLE with 4 cs/min or 5cs/min. They don't know how to apply pressure or which objective is worth to take at a certain point in the game and they won't listen to a player who got mostly in this elo by good game understanding and teamfighting/presence bc premades. \nThey drag down my elo, i suddenly lose 20-21 points even though i mostly lost 15-17 because i play against players way below my elo and lose. \nHow is it even remotely balanced or fair to match me with a gold 1? As a plat 2? That's a tier difference. He couldn't land a single W or Q properly against the wall when he ganked. Counterjungling did not exist and eve is weak as hell in the beginning (feast or famine). \nI'm literally sick of these boosted players. This system ruins my elo, my fun and the fun of several others. Our noc last game got so tilted by these bad premades, that he just ulted 1v5 because they refused to surrender. \nSo i'm really noone who blames everyone else when he loses, i lsot lane against a diamond already and i lost it pretty hard even though i played pretty safe but i received no flame from solos, they did their best to win their lanes and let me farm up with splitpushing so we eventually won the game. I can acknowledge better players. But doing quadra kills, mostdmgs overall, 50-75% KP, best farm and you are still not able to carry 3 premades who clearly shouldn't be in this elo at all makes me sick and i have to stop ranked at the moment. It just tilts me so hard and if riot doesn'tstart to finally balance the game out and put solos against solos i will have to quit league.\n\nTL;DR: \nI'm sick of playing with premades and also against premades who should never be in my elo. I'm sick of losing a ton of LP/MMR because we have some goldie in our team thanks to premades and i play against people 2 divisions below me. \nYes, i know there are pretty bad games (KDA wise) in my latest games. But the last three GP games should've been one with EASE but i just can't carry a smite twitch, vayne top who died 50 times to maokai,not evne witha quadra. A vayne with 10k dmg in a 41 min game.
