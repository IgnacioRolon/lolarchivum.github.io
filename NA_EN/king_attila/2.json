Since if this skin was canon to Runeterra Lore Nightmare Tryndamere would be from the Shadow Isles and the black mist is sort of that trademark. You could have the mists swirl around him and he would disappear or he would float upwards with the mist swirling around.","replies":[{"poster":"KING ATTILA","date":"2015-06-05T23:48:36.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excellent!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KING ATTILA","date":"2015-06-01T19:01:38.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm...I'd be satisfied with anything.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-06-01T16:32:01.133+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nope.
