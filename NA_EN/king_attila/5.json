Quite a number of premades include one player who either mains support or 'bites the bullet' and learns the role so that they and their friends can have a faster queue time; without these 'premade supports', queue times would be even longer than previous solo queue- entirely dependent on the bottleneck, which is always support players. Every so often there'd be a spike of 'new support players'- AKA players who queued support for the instant queue- and they'd be terrible at the role because they only picked it secondary to actually get in a game.\n\nLike it or not, new champ select relies on the queueing decisions that premades instigate. So, since I know you're almost certainly a hyper-toxic top, mid, or ADC main that wants the game to be 100% all about your SOLO skill- pick one. Old solo queue, old champ select? Or Dynamic queue, with new champ select? The one other option is double-triple your current queue time and every other support you have being utterly worthless.","replies":[{"poster":"Thunder Dreamss","date":"2016-07-01T01:54:13.079+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"You, good sir, don't understand how matchmaking systems work.\n\nBasically a matchmaking system is trying to get 10 players into a game so they can play.  If there are no restrictions it can do this instantly because there's always enough Bronze players to fill out a group of 10 for that 1 Diamond player in queue.\n\nHowever, just getting thrown in with anyone sucks so you want to add restrictions to the matchmaking formula.  Every restriction comes at a cost of longer queue times, however.  Why?\n\nLook at it like this: If we have no restrictions we can get instant queues because there's always at least 10 people wanting to play the game.  Now we add a restriction that all 10 players must be within 1 rank of each other.  Now queue time takes longer because there may not be that many players close to you queueing up right now.  Wait a bit and they may show up.\n\nSo now we add another consideration.  Everybody gets to pick their roll.  Now you can't just grab any 10 people from the same skill level, you need the right 10 people.  No supports?  Well looks like you're waiting until two of them who are your same skill level show up.\n\nBut you say, premades bring in more supports?  They might, who knows, but what they definitely do is add another thing the system is trying to match.  You've got a three man in queue and seven solos so nobody gets a game until another three man of the same skill level and seven more solos come in and all those new players better be exactly the one's needed to fill out the rolls that are lacking...\n\n\"But,\" you say, \"if matchmaking worked like that it would take forever to get in a game!\"  True, I simplified a bit.  The longer you're in queue the greater the variance the queue will accept in each category.  Been waiting for two minutes?  Well now players can be two ranked apart.  Been waiting for five minutes?  Now your five man can fight five solo players.  These matches won't be as fair but it's better then waiting for a hour to play a 40 minute game.\n\nPremades are particularly bad for queue times and match quality because they introduce elements that are much harder for the matchmaking algorithm to work with.  Firstly you cannot ever put two three man premades on the same team.  It's obvious but it means there is no amount of time and sloppy matchmaking that can build a team from certain combinations of players in queue.  Second, it's much harder to properly gage the skill/ranking of a player in a group then it is a lone player.  Some premades are just a bunch of random people who play together but don't use VoIP or any other advantage.  Their no better then a group of solos.  Other groups are coordinated and ruthless with persuasion rotations and players filling in for each others weaknesses.  These groups perform much much better then five randoms.  If the matchmaking formula assumes premades will be like the former then the later get to stomp every game while assuming the later advantage means the former gets their face caved in every match.  So most likely you assume some level of advantage in the middle and both effects happen to a lesser degree.  Yah, such balanced games!\n\nEven if premades provided enough supports that they completely balanced out the other roles (they don't) the system would still need to make teams of 1 of each roll and account for premades which will take longer then just accounting for 1 of each roll.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-07-01T16:34:19.384+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Premades have a pretty negligible impact on queue timers, at least up to Plat.

And even this kind of problem is not really serious, since you have to cover 3 lanes with a Duo, 4 lanes with a Trio. That means any random Trio can be matched with any random Duo with a 40% chance probability (assuming equal distribution of lanes).\n\nBut beyond the technical details, the message I want to make clear is this: People asking for DynQ removal because of the queue timers are wrong. If we keep the New Champ Select (and everyone wants to keep it, that the only thing everyone agrees on), even in SoloQ, the timers would be sensibly the same, because the main factor driving the timers up is the lack of Support, not the complexity of matching premade groups.\n\nThere are a few debatable reasons to bring SoloQ back, but this one is not debatable at all, it's just wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Thunder Dreamss","date":"2016-07-01T20:30:19.973+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For your 80% scenario to work you need just the right balance of duo and trio groups or you just wind up with duos being the new support.  \n\nBut as to your main point...

Very few want support relative to the other roles.  That leaves few options, all of them not so good.  \n\nYou either wait for a qualified support to become available with the parameters sufficient for the ranks allowed increasing queue times.\nor \nYou relax the rules of match making compromising fair play so as not to increase queue times.  \nor\nyou force people into a role they don't want with a system that randomly chooses people to fill the role even though they don't want it and well it stinks to be you.  Too bad.  \nor\nYou do a combination of these.  \n\nGoing back to solo q doesn't solve the problems because nobody is going to magically want to play support in solo that didn't in dynamic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-07-01T16:43:23.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> I'm honestly perplexed why Riot chose to scrap Solo Queue, Team Ranked, Dominion, and Team Builder just for Dynamic Queue...\n\nWell, you better be perplexed. That's not why they scrapped all of that.\n\n* Team Ranked was scrapped because they couldn't manage to get the match-making right because of wildly different goals among the player base. They hope it will be better with the new Scheduled Team Ranked by bringing more people playing at the same time and by narrowing the player base to people with similar objectives.\n* Dominion was scrapped because the player-base was too small.\n* Team-builder was scrapped because the queue timers were horrible, and because the New Champ Select in the Normal Draft queue solve most of the original issues that Team-builder intended to solve. (Not perfectly, but still, most of them, and with Queue Timers 2 to 3 times lower, at least.)\n* That leaves only Solo Queue which was indeed scrapped in favor of Dynamic Queue. To switch the skills being tested in the ladder and put more emphasize on team-work compared to solo carrying, and to please people who wanted to play (competitively) with their friends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-07-01T16:12:03.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Because Dynamic Queue allows people to play competitively with their friends.\nIn a team game that is much better than playing with solos.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Feed Daddy","date":"2016-07-01T03:32:57.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"Dynamic queue isn't that bad","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tobias Brackner","date":"2016-07-01T01:08:20.130+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":11,"body":"I really don't understand the hate for Dynamic Queue.
