With premades likely having better synergy and communication, the Solo team feels cheated that they are forced into a disadvantage before the game even began. For 2-4 man premades, the 1-3 Solo players forced to team up with them would feel like outcasts and little to no communication between them and the premades, plus trolling/griefing/verbally abusing is likely to happen against the Solo players, especially if it is a 3-4 man premade. If the Solo(s) make even the smallest mistake, chances are the entire premade will bitch at them.\n\nIts like 5 random UFC fighters forced to fight an entire football team at the same time.\n\nWhat Riot is trying to do with Dynamic Q is trying to put wolves(Premades) and lions(Solos) together and forcing them to be friends.\n\nBack then, the only premades you would get are Duos. They were tolerable at best.\n\nWhat SoloQ could fix(if Riot tries) with some adjustments, is the entire removal of premades, giving the queue the same new champion select system as DQ, while keeping the later around for premades AND solo's(who prefer the challenge). With the support problem, Riot could follow World of Warcraft's example and make the least desirable roles more rewarding via bonus ip, higher chance for hextech items, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Parceval","date":"2016-03-28T05:31:22.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KnKitsune,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9TTYIrcJ,comment-id=00230000,timestamp=2016-03-27T00:03:20.286+0000)\n>\n> The main problem with DQ is that many Solo players HATE playing against premades\n\n> [{quoted}](name=GayFluffyUnicorn,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9TTYIrcJ,comment-id=00230001,timestamp=2016-03-27T01:18:27.567+0000)\n> Either u have 5 solos vs 3+2 premades which happens very often in my case, 90% of time leading to a lose. \n\nThis argument has been refuted mutiple times by Riot and it is both within their power and their explicit intention to not allow a random consortium to face a premade.\n\nInstead, the design intention (and what I have experienced personally) is that premades face premades. \n\nYes, it's possible that every 1 out of 80 (that's their current rate) game is imbalanced, but generally it's just not true.

I've been camped by premades where someone just sits in the lane doing nothing ... I'm not pushed or over extended, their ganks don't result in any burnt summons or deaths so the only thing they are there for is making sure I CS under tower with the looming threat of being tower dived.\n* Toxicity- It becomes FAAAAR easier to let loose the inner PoS when you know you have at least 1 other person in this small group that has your back. I played a game recently against the Croc and Poppy. Bad start cause my champ that I play into him was banned and I don't know this match up. I died, come back to lane and he forces a 2nd fight that I almost win. Our Stabby Kitty JG is in the area at half health and sees how close it was so he runs in after and gives the Croc a 3rd kill. He then screams at me in chat, I tell him his death was his own fault. He and his buddy Fizz try to get the enemy team to report me for being Toxic. He then blames me for him being half our team's level because \"I can't safely farm the JG anymore\".\n* Just ****ing around!- I had a game with a 4 men premade and we were doing so well. But ... they got cocky and refused to push any objectives after winning team fights. They would just go back to farming and I had to push mid solo. So the game dragged on, slowly but surely the enemy team's Jax went from something I could delete to being on par with me to being able to 1v5 us and solo our base. We could have won that game 3 times by the time we lost. They wasted my time with their refusal to help me finish the game and we didn't even get a win.\n* Personal crap- I had a premade that went on and on about some one not in the game talking about them behind their back. I would LOVE to mute them all but I fear that something important could be missed in chat if I do that (not sure if you get a notice that you've been muted so they may not know to ping)\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cerbearus","date":"2016-03-26T23:55:02.199+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":10,"body":"No ty","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2016-03-27T01:22:09.533+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"afraid of not getting carried anymore?","replies":[{"poster":"Cerbearus","date":"2016-03-27T18:17:37.930+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I play 100% solo.

Ideally teams are matched against teams with equal size pre-mades, but this will not always be the case so as to prevent absurd queue times.\n* This advantage creates an unfair match-up when compared to a team of solo-players. This can be adjusted for by matching pre-made groups up against higher skill players, but this leads to the sense that \"team\" players are of a higher rank than \"solo\" players. A solo player probably put in a lot of hard work to reach their rank, yet a team player reaches the same elo despite lower skill simply by taking advantage of the benefits of team play.\n* Lastly, since players are significantly less likely to be unpleasant towards people they actually know, rather than random strangers on the internet, there is the accusation that pre-mades are more toxic. Having one or two players on your team that are \"on your side\" makes it much easier to blame a poor game on that random stranger.\n---\n_*Well, friends argue about things all the time, but not so about a game in progress._","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Urgonnalearn2day","date":"2016-03-28T15:23:18.651+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I WANT SOLO QUEUE!","replies":[]}]}
