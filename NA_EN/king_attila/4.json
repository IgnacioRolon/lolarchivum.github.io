Players tend to make the player experience worse than learning the actual game does.\n\nAt worst, the in-game issues of League involve the burden of knowledge. You have to know what an archetype is, how a champion scales, and what items help which types of champions. At the very least, you have to know a build for a champion.\n\nIn HotS, you don't have any burden of knowledge; it's all learned as you play, because **it is vastly simpler by design.** Not worse or less fun, but simpler. You can focus on learning mechanics without worrying about literally anything that is important in League; you don't even need to last-hit anything. You quite literally get kills for being *involved* in the fights, and gain full minion XP bonuses for being near them when they die. You can even take a monster camp without actually being the one that killed them.\n\nHotS takes out almost every single important element of MOBAs. The only ones that remain are objective control (half of which, again, are not based on being able to actually kill things) and pushing lanes (the whole thing about MOBAs being siege-focused RTS games).\n\nAgain, that's not necessarily a bad thing.

I dislike PVP in general, and it is not part of what draws me to the games at all. I /try/ PVP periodically after doing a week worth of research to make sure I have items and runes matched up, then realize I don't have the IP for the runes I need, so just focus on the items, try it out, spend 45 minutes stressing out, then go back to vsAI\n\n2) Toxicity is not game specific. I've had to deal with the same type of jerks/rudeness in both games (LoL and HotS)\n\n3) I prefer HotS's mechanics, and I prefer some of the champions/variety LoL provides.\n\nLoL is, in my meaningless opinion, over-complex. Yes, I recognize that is why it has grown as it has, and why it is taken seriously enough for esports to start being taken as a 'sport' for coverage, etc. I just also believe that spoils a lot of the 'fun' directly for that pay-off of 'taken more seriously'.\n\nHotS is more fun to play for me, and I strongly disagree with the opinions that you 'don't feel like you did anything'. Very frequently, it's clear that I or me and my wife carried the game for the team because we focus the objectives properly and push our lane to force the other team into defense and then defeat. Timing and familiarity with each map AND your own champion are rewarded, and in a far more reasonable time-frame than LoL.\n\nLoL is a long-term investment if you want to /feel/ the payoff. That is likely TOO LONG for many players. HotS can give you that sensation within a single game.\n\nYes, HotS is far simpler, and I am grateful for that fact.

The only reason why HotS has a decent new player experience is because it's a new game. All games start off as this 'AMAZING' thing because everyone fricken sucks at it. No one knows what they're doing outside of basic stuff. To make it worse though is that HotS doesn't have much of a 'meta' and blind pick chooses between different maps, which your champ may or may not suck ungodly bad at that map. Like, say, if you get a team with limited wave clear on the spider maps or a team that doesn't synergize well heroes-wise on the raising golems map. You can get heavily boned and with the game being brand new, barely a couple months old, everyone SUCKS at it so no one can really judge. Last time I played, just before they released it out of beta, there wasn't even an ALL chat, which removes a huge level of toxicity since the enemies can't patronize some one for sucking either. With an All chat, people have access to 9 different people insulting them. Without it, there's only 4 others. \n\nLeague used to be very welcoming to noobs back in S1 and early S2. S2 worlds put LoL into a whole new level of playing field though. Popularity shot up so much that there was a flux of people watching e-sports and deciding to play the game, which also came with people making new accounts because of being stuck under 1300 ELO because they flunked their first 10 games in ranked, or they got temp banned for being toxic, etc. Players with some understanding end up at the bottom and berating their teammates while the game's popularity attracts the disgusting crowd. Just give HotS a year or two when it really hits the competitive playing field and actually has a nicely sized roster of heroes with more unique abilities. It'll attract the crowd that everyone hates in League and it'll become to new popular thing because the damn thing is stupid proof. Just look at the system. You have 3 abilities by level 1, which makes people happy since there's no wind up time except on the ultimates. Then there's the fact there's no items or skill points, you just choose specific boosts to certain abilities or a clicky. It's all cookie cutter stuff with very limited variety in what you can do, which will be its downfall.\n\nGames that are too easy will end up failing. In Mists of Pandaria, when Blizzard took an already very easy game, they made it even EASIER and they ended up losing about 5mil subscribers in just that expansion alone. Easy games attract a certain kind of crowd that can turn incredibly toxic in an instant. The one thing I can say about DotA 2 is that it doesn't have the toxicity League has, because it's not as simplistic or user friendly, so the toxic baddies who think they're Billy Badass are usually scared away, though it makes elitists more common. League is complex and user friendly, so it has elitists and it has Billy Badass wanna-bes, which makes for an awkward form of toxicity. HotS will soon get the ones who like the overly easy games and with how poor the matchmaking is, the community it doomed unless Blizzard works quick. Through my own experience with Blizz? They're not known to work quickly. They're slower than Riot. Hell, they make Valve's work on Half Life 3 look quick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-08-01T20:10:41.243+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":21,"body":"That's like introducing a child to Dark Souls instead of Mario... the \"problem\" is actually intentional and not a problem at all.

A difficult hero with great potential and fun new mechanics to spice up the MOBA genre. Thats half the reason to play HOTS and thats because it loves to break the normal LoL rules with it's characters. People can outrange towers and can interact globally, like Abathur.\nSure, if you choose to play simple characters when you are a hardcore MOBA fam, you might get bored. Just bump up the character difficulty and you might think differently about HOTS.","replies":[]}]}
