Where as a wu or a shaco you see the clone or the \"poof\" warning you. Camo is good, don't get me wrong, but it works for eve or rengar where if you see them maybe you can stun or flash away in advance, with twitch he's going to pop out out of his reveal zone so the stealth indicator doesn't achieve much. Am I suggesting turn him invis? No, that would make the issue worse, but his camo either needs a bigger warning radius to make up for range or a shorter duration so like wu or shaco, you can see him preping in advance.\n\nWhat I'm comparing is, twitch is safe enough with his camo to the point you don't get a camo warning and it might as well be invis, and because of its longer duration, he can prep it a far distance away unlike wu or shaco that makes seeing it coming in the first place even harder.
