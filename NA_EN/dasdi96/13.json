He loses 1v1 against most meta midlaners, can't split push at all, and against aggressive roamers like Khazix/Rengar/Xinzhao/Lee Sin he risks a lot when he roams. Not to mention that currently Zed, Ekko, and Talon are incredibly busted as well (and Fizz will be too come 8.15) and they all shit on him in lane, and in the case of Ekko/Talon can match his roams and kill him in the jungle (Zed can too once he gets 1-2 full items as his clear is also strong).\n\nHe's not strong himself, he just caters to a snowball meta where getting a bot fed early is all that matters.

Some may say that Zoe is too Disney but personally I find that it adds a great use of colour design and shows the new side of league  that we havenât really seen before with a ton of other champions.\n\n Secondly Zoe is actually a pretty hard character to master.  Zoe has some really great comboâs that are quite different from other champions.  Letâs start with her q.  Her qycan be redirected in many different directions which basically gives you so many different options to skill shot someone.  Her W straight up takes everything you know about league and destroys it.  I find this a spell to be really cool because you can use any spell that the enemy champions use which pretty much is basically every time an enemy uses something you use it to.  Itâs pretty much like clapping back at them basically saying that oh you wanted to use this well I could use it to then. Her e is pretty similar to a lot of other champions but the one difference between her e is that it actually causes the person to not be able to use any of their attacks which is super powerful.  Leslie her or is different than any champion in the game that weâve ever seen before.  Where are has the shortest cool down in the game of 10 seconds but this is because it is in an attack itâs a blank and blank back through portal of a short distance.  Combine this with her Q and her e this causes is some crazy skill shots in different patterns to trick and confuse your enemies.\n\nSo pretty much Zoe is a breath of fresh air. if you donât like her you donât have to player she was not a total screwup considering that she is super fun to play uses super different cool other types of attacks that  no the champion really has in the game and she just has so much colour and fun to the game if you donât want to use this character  thatâs fine but she clearly was not a mistake. RIOT intentionally decided to make this character super fun and that made her around the design aspect and less about the attacks. even though her attacks are super original I wouldnât say that they screwed her up I would say that she is one of my favourite characters in the entire game and changes the game completely","replies":[]}]}
