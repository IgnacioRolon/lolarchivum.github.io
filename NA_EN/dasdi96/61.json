Tahm kench auto wins every melee matchup just by spamming q on cooldown because of how overstat it is. Dodge it? Doesn't matter it's up again before you could get a 2nd cs. Try to fight him? He just auto you 3 times, eat you, and throw you far away and you taking % max hp damage. So if you are against this guy in top lane, you are 100% reliant on your team because you can't do SHIT. You have to hope your adc is decent enough to take him down when the game goes past 25-30 minutes. This is the 4th patch he is doing this and there are no changes on the pbe. Riot doesn't have a single top lane player on their balance, so they don't know how unfun it is to play melee top against tahm top. Yhis is even worse than playing against ranged champions, at least you can have them push and call your jungler for a gank, and snowball if you get a lead.","replies":[{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-06-16T01:57:48.524+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":3,"body":" https://img.pngio.com/park-bench-png-hd-png-mart-bench-png-2576_1932.png","replies":[{"poster":"EthreainAmbusher","date":"2019-06-16T03:22:41.447+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"bench\nthe\nkench?","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2019-06-16T12:46:18.372+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"chair\nthe\nair","replies":[{"poster":"Radiant Seraph","date":"2019-06-16T13:35:08.014+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"buff\nthe\npuff","replies":[{"poster":"jocomotion","date":"2019-06-17T00:50:00.656+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Inhibit\nThe\nRibbit","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Luther King Jr V","date":"2019-06-16T10:55:09.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what's the origin of this meme?","replies":[{"poster":"Pyrosan","date":"2019-06-16T11:25:51.341+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Luther King Jr V,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Qi0eZPHJ,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2019-06-16T10:55:09.475+0000)\n>\n> what's the origin of this meme?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5T28qpuCQcg","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AMADEUSdotEXE","date":"2019-06-16T09:23:59.536+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"You forgot about it being 900 range 2 seconds at 40% cdr and a 1.5 second stun on proc.\" {{champion:268}} (*laughs in reflection*)","replies":[]},{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2019-06-16T16:37:15.249+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Boards 3 months ago: Oh Tahm isn't an issue.

Your inability to adapt is whats fucking you. NOt every matchup is a \" I MUST RUN AT U AND FIGHT U\" matchup. some match ups you just farm and scale for late and do teamfights. Tahm Kench is a lane bully and is strongest during the laning phase 1v1 vs melee. He falls off after that. IF you are fighting him during laning phase you arent playing the matchup correctly. If Tahm is broken then so is Pantheon, Kennen, Vlad, Jayce... all these champs need to be nerfed for the same reason-- that reason being that the laning phase you cant do anything to them. He is only performing so well because people are mindlessly walking at him to fight him knowing they wont win in laning phase but doing it anyways and feeding him. Its basically a cheese strat... like what pink ward does with his boxes in top lane. He waits for people to completely disrespect him and die to him even tho, THEY SEE clips online they know he baits people into boxes but they keep repeating the same mistakes and feeding him for no reason. Just dont fight him during the laning phase, shaco invalidates laning phase fighting when played the way pink ward plays him. people will never learn tho.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2019-06-16T01:34:13.642+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":7,"body":"Vayne and Quinn perform well against him.
