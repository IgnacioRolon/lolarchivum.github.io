I wanted to address the whole first pick top laner thing, and this isn't to you specifically but I just started reading some of the replies here.\n\nFirst pick doesn't give you an excuse to ignore team composition. You don't even need an excuse to do that because it isn't against the rules and sometimes composition doesn't even matter. In close games it does.\n\n**If you're going top lane, always use pick intent.** If you're below the support or jungler in the pick order, how will they know what to pick? I'm a support main, and I'm more than willing to attempt to fill out what we're missing, but you also need to remember two important things about the support role.\n\nWe are normally 3-4 levels behind everyone else, no matter how well we do, and our income is by far the smallest and with must-buy support items. We are inferior to laning tanks in terms of sustain, but we do bring the lock down. If jungle and top lane are both picking something like Rengar top and Teemo top, you still need to be extra cautious when team fighting comes around, especially if one or more of you lost lane.\n\nNot only that, but I'm supposed to get my ADC through their laning phase. Bot lane is so deadly early game now, so I'm not going to be picking Leona (the tank I play) into something like Miss Fortune and Zilean if I can help it. If we die, the enemy ADC snowballs quickly.\n\nI also see a lot of people making excuses for playing squishy picks top. Own it. There are many proper tanks that do so well in this meta like Illaoi and Nasus, and then there are fighters that are still great picks like Irelia, Renekton, and Darius. If you're going to play Yasuo, Kennen, and Teemo top then just own it. You aren't doing anything wrong, but don't complain about no tanks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SennaMain Bun","date":"2016-11-05T03:35:54.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate that when people tell me what to play\n\"tank support please\"\n\nI don't get into games and say \n\" don't play ezreal please, don't play twitch please\" smh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Japan","date":"2016-11-05T15:46:28.953+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Baby Ghoul,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OYixlovs,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2016-11-04T23:22:08.174+0000)\n>\n> Teemo is a pretty crappy pick if we&#x27;re being honest guys.\n> \n> His laning phase is deadly for certain champions, but after that?
