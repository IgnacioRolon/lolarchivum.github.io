Tanks had one job, which was to protect their Marksman. The game required skill and some minimal thought process, and the best Marksman was usually the winner. \n\nBut Riot saw that Marksmen still had a huge advantage in teamfights. Hence... Assassins. Assassins balanced the game (though thanks to the \"pro\" players, Zed was kept broken for a whole season), and skill became even more important.\n\nThen S4 came.

Tanks should lack damage against single targets, but with good levels of wave management, I can turn trades into my favor with the minion wave, without necessarily having better dueling power. \n\nTanks are buy and large ability reliant. Inherently their CC is tied to abilities, often in an AoE form paired with a little bit of damage. If built with a little bit of damage, I'm almost inclined to think of Tanks as Melee mages. \n\nAlso for that reason, I feel like the whole ADC dueling Tank argument, is some what Missleading. Because the Tanks are ability reliant, their damage will come in the form of Burst, not DPS. (If you want DPS, try a Juggernaut) Chances are, it's more on an edge between the tank getting a kill on a single rotation.
