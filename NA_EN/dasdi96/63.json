He has better innate offense than defense, but both his offense and defense rely heavily on scaling for effectiveness. This leads to the catch-22 of either not building enough defense to survive in a fight *or* lacking the offensive power to be much of a threat for any reason other than kicking someone into his team. The only teams against which either situation plays into Lee's favor is when the enemy team--each player individually, as well as the group--is worse than the Lee and his team.\n\nPut shortly, Lee Sin's effectiveness late game is reliant on his opponents picking poorly and being bad at the game. You can make as many flashy plays as you want, but in the end, if the team knows how Lee Sin works, they're not going to let him be more than an annoyance.\n---\nAnd yes, there's a reason I'm silver. Because I've played barely more than 50 ranked games in 6 years. As opposed to 3k+ games on just Summoner's Rift, at least a thousand more in the various other modes combined...**It's because I play Ranked less than 1% of the time.**\n\nI have no real compulsion to consistently play Ranked.

elo players always get so offended when you call them out on their elo. its like you might even be right, but it doesnt matter anymore because all you do is throw around insults and complaints. i enjoy it.\n\nLee sins lategame doesnt fall off at all because he has very high base damage, very high scaling combined with %missing health damage, aoe slows and the strongest cc in the game. \n\nsure he does get outscaled many things by many champions and so his relative effectiveness falls off but his power doesnt. he doesnt suddenly stop scaling (like, for example, elise does because of her lack of an ultimate) and he has many valid build paths to be a high threat while being very tanky. also, the most important point about lee sin is his kick which simply never falls off. if you kick a key target into your team, ofcourse thats very good and it can end a game at any point. but even if you dont kick him into your team but simply away from your team or over a wall, thats allready winning fights.  if lee sin kicks a tank through your team, that also ends fights. he has many options to kick and his ultimate remains game-deciding no matter how long the game goes. even if he builds almost full tank you cant simply ignore him because of how dangerous his kick is. \n\nif you build more damage on him, his assassination potential on squishies doesnt fall off either because of how insanely high his scaling numbers are.  the only thing that falls off is his dueling potential but since he can always kick you, he cant be killed in a duel either.\nand this argument \"vs good players this doesnt work\" is a silver player saying vs good players HE COULDNT pull it off. in a realistic scenario, good players usually play vs other good players so that equalizes and the only thing that remains is if it is physically possible for lee sin to reach a target and kick it. andyes, it is absolutely physically possible to do it from the design of his kit and to prevent it, resources must be used on him either to cc him or to kill him. this means he is infact a threat and even tho the threat is not purely damage, it sometimes is much greater a threat than damage.\n\nthat said, lee sin doesnt fall off.\n\ncompare him to elise: her damage falls off because she has no ultimate and her mid to lategame damage is not burst but DPS which, if she builds squishy, has no way of dealing while if she builds tanky, is simply too low. elises mid to lategame is still impactfull but can not be compared to her earlygame or other champions mid to lategame. thats why it can be said that she doesnt only fall off compared to other champions but also compared to her own power of impact during the game.\nthis does not apply to lee sin, thus it can be said he doesnt fall off.\n\nlee sins main power is not that his physical constitution is extremely strong. his main power is that he has immense pressure due to the combination of mobility, utility and damage. this pressure stays the same all game long or against some teamcomps, even rises.\n\n\n\nPS: about the rank thing - it is theoretically possible to know things about the game as a low elo player that a higher elo player doesnt know, especially if the higher elo player is a yasuo main, but generally speaking, league of legends doesnt use mechanical skills. its 99% knowledge and experience and only 1% mechanics. faker doesnt actually have insane mechanics (they are super high class elite, thats for sure, but he isnt the only one or better than every other pro at this), but he simply knows his shit much better. he simply knows the damage he can deal and take very well and  he knows the in-fight options of players very well.\nits knowledge and experience that makes good players seem good, not their ability to press 3 buttons in fast succession. everyone can do that.\n\nin league, a general concept is \"if you know it, you can do it\" but knowing needs alot of experience. for example, i played alot of warcraft 3 tft and i was very good at it. in warcraft, you needed alot more mechanics than in league and also alot more strategic knowledge but since the game was so much more complex and involved many more units and factors than league, you didnt have to know the specifics to be a good player.\n\nthis means, you could actually have a session with a player where you teach him everything you know in theory and then let him play and he will be able to apply a certain amount of things you taught him just from telling him. in league tho, it is possible to only teach very basic concepts in theory alone and most things must be learned from practicing because of how much more this game relies on experience. you either know from experience that you can win this duel with 20 hp left or you dont know it. no matter how many lessons you learned, you will not do the math before dueling so you simply have to experience it plus you gotta have a good feeling for it.\n\nthis leads to the conclusion that purely theoretical experience, even though valuable in some areas, is very unreliable in league of legends in general. especially when talking about champion power and balance. \na player with many more games than another player generally should have more experience, regardless of rank. but a player who played, say, 1000 games in diamond is inclined to know more about the same thing than a player who played 1000 games in silver. this is due to the circumstances in which either player made their experiences.\nthe diamond player simply had a much harsher environment in which mistakes are punished more precisely and more commonly. this means, higher level experience is closer to facts than lower level experience.\n\nfor example: champ X against champ Y matchup in toplane. who wins? you say champ X because mobafire said so. i say champ Y because i main champ Y and i played 300 games against champ X and i know the limits of champ X because i played against people who were able to use champ X to its limit.\neven if you played the same amount of games in this matchup, chances are your opponents didnt use as much power of champ X as my opponents and you didnt use as much power of champ Y as me because if you did, you'd be in diamond too.\n\ndoes that make sense to you? if a challenger player, who is CURRENTLY CHALLENGER (not these people who had 5 accounts in top 10 challenger but are now plat 2) comes to me and explains me some things about jungling, i will surely listen and be thankful to get the chance to improve myself. even tho they are not neccessarily better at everything, they will have with 100% certainy at least one area of knowledge where they surpass me and i can learn from it.\n\n\ni just feel like writing more, so another example i got for you: my manager is gold something and he knows alot about the game for a gold player, i must say.  he always complains about how stupid his allies are and how he knows everything better and he should play with diamonds too. in fact, he very much belongs in gold and not in diamond. he knows many things that other golds dont but he also lacks alot of knowledge a plat potentially has. he lacks experience and definitely awareness.\nalso, an interesting concept about knowledge is that one information alone can be worthless and its value only shows when combining it with other information.\nlets say you got information A, B and C and you feel like you know alot. now sadly, all those informations dont do shit for you unless you got information Q aswell.\nsince most scenarios in league consist of many many MANY variables, generalizing scenarios is very hard and you either need ALOT of practice experience or you need to understand which fundamental basics have the most value and in exactly this last point, lower level players tend to understand much less (or they wouldnt be lower level). \nthis is just tendencies, so you could be the most knowledgeable player in the world even tho you are silver. chances are pretty slim tho and if you want someone who is higher level to respect your knowledge, you gotta actually drop knowledge and back it up.\n\ni know its hard and i have probably never seen a lower elo player drop respectable knowledge except once some diamond midlaner was able to completely own and destroy every challenger midlaner and explain to them how midlane works and they were like \"eh wtf new world order\" but that aside, silvers fail to impress.

Relative to their archetype, they are on the low end of the graph in late-game power.\n\nThis is also what people mean when they say Yasuo's late-game falls off. No, it's not weak, but it's weaker than other melee (and regular) carries without optimal setup.\n\nI thought that was common language on the boards, but I guess having to point out the exact meaning of the phrase in that context is a simpler misunderstanding to correct, especially since you already said it yourself.\n\nIn short; \"Falls off late-game\" is not the same as \"Strong early game, weak late game.\"\n> and this argument \"vs good players this doesnt work\" is a silver player saying vs good players HE COULDNT pull it off. in a realistic scenario, good players usually play vs other good players so that equalizes and the only thing that remains is if it is physically possible for lee sin to reach a target and kick it. and yes, it is absolutely physically possible to do it from the design of his kit and to prevent it, resources must be used on him either to cc him or to kill him. this means he is infact a threat and even tho the threat is not purely damage, it sometimes is much greater a threat than damage.\n\nCorrection; this is a basically unranked player who has done his research from the ground up saying that Lee Sin's power is relative to his knowledge and mechanics vs. his opponents' knowledge and mechanics. Across. The. Board.\n\nYes, ideally, matchmaking puts players of equal skill against each other, but what quantifies \"equal skill\" in League of Legends is only a machine's mathematical approximation.\n\nI already pointed out that Lee Sin can still kick someone into his team.

Anyway, regarding \"my Gold boss,\" the concept of every piece of information being crucial to success, scenarios having too many variables to be over-generalized...\n\nI have not *once* said anything about \"deserving\" a higher rank. All I've stated is that I haven't been playing the game for rank, and that is why the ranking I have is low.\n\nYes, information is all-important, and all of the information is important. As dumb as that sentence may sound, it's the core truth of this game, and even life itself. You can't go into a situation without knowing what's going on and expect to come out on top of things.\n\nYes, scenarios can have many variables that change the whole dynamic of the situation. They took Cleanse instead of Ignite. They invaded the jungle instead of starting on their side. They swapped mid- and top-lane, changing the match-up entirely. It can even come down to something as small as a specific champ walking at a different angle than you expected. **This means that a scenario theory needs to be vague, in order to handle multiple contingencies.** And it obviously won't be perfect, because the variables present allow for vastly different scenarios.\n> its funny how low elo players always get so offended when you call them out on their elo. its like you might even be right, but it doesnt matter anymore because all you do is throw around insults and complaints. i enjoy it.\n\nIf anything, I'm only offended that you use my rank as a means to patronize me, disregard what I say, and pretend you're \"teaching\" me things that I don't already know.","replies":[{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-12-06T13:14:41.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ill try to keep it shorter this time:\n1. \"falls off lategame\" means \"is less useful lategame than before that\", which simply doesnt apply to lee sin. \"falls off\" is a term used when talking about curves and as long as his power curve does not go down with time passing in the game, i dont understand where you can imply that it falls off. \n\n2. from what i see, people use the term \"falls off lategame\" equivalent to \"does not scale as good\". as i said, elise falls off lategame because her impact is lower in the lategame than in the earlygame while lee sin always stays the same (or even increases) due to his kick. this is what i understand when i say \"falls off\".\n\n3. i dont mean to \"teach\" you anything. its more like this is a forum and we just post whatever we think about a certain topic and if someone saith something that we deem wrong or right or augmentable, we give our opinion. \ni dont mean to teach you personally, else i'd offer you coaching and let myself get paid for it, but simply give a diamond players insight on the game.\n\n4. from my own experience i can say, rank matters alot when it comes to game knowledge. if you dont think so, you can simply value this argument lower. for example, when i say \"champ X is pretty weak\" and someone saith \"but palyer Y is high challenger with it so it cant be that weak\" then that definitely is evidence but i value it so low that i can leave it out of any calculation. if you value rank-evidence low, you can just do that for yourself and let others value it high.\n\nthat being said, im not talking at you for being low/unranked, im just reminding everyone that everything you say is from a certain perspective and everything i say is from another perspective not only influenced by us being different people but also by our ranks. \nagain, if you think that argument has no value, simply dont consider it. what im saying is not based on my rank and i dont use my rank as an argument, i simply back it up with my rank. from my own opinion, this backup is relatively strong but if it isnt from yours, thats fine too.\n\ni remember there was a discussion about pantheon jungle on the thread and as one of the highest ranked pantheon players on EUW (even higher before) i gave my opinion on that topic. then a discussion broke out about how meaningless my rank and my thousand pantheon games are and that all the silver players who \"main\" pantheon for 30 games have an equally valuable opinion.\n\nyou see, you can make of it what ever you want.","replies":[{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-12-07T06:08:02.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AyRe CoNteMpT,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ulwxqm9H,comment-id=000000010001000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-06T13:14:41.641+0000)\n>\n> 1) \"falls off lategame\" means \"is less useful lategame than before that\", which simply doesnt apply to lee sin. \"falls off\" is a term used when talking about curves and as long as his power curve does not go down with time passing in the game, i dont understand where you can imply that it falls off. \n\nUsing that definition, there literally is no champion that \"falls off\" late-game, because there is no champion that gets *worse* late-game than early-game.\n\nWhen a champion's power falls off late-game, it doesn't mean their power curve goes on a decline; it means that it doesn't keep going up as fast. An example would be Yasuo, whose damage output spikes up quickly between 5-30 minutes, but slows down after that point both in relation to his own power scaling and in relation to other melee carries. His power isn't going *down,* but it's not going up as fast as it was earlier.\n> 2) from what i see, people use the term \"falls off lategame\" equivalent to \"does not scale as good\". as i said, elise falls off lategame because her impact is lower in the lategame than in the earlygame while lee sin always stays the same (or even increases) due to his kick. this is what i understand when i say \"falls off\".\n\nThe funny thing is that Lee Sin has a similar situation to Elise. Not nearly as pronounced, thanks to his ultimate, but his kit pretty heavily relies on being able to deal DPS. However, he can't buy enough of both damage *and* defense in order to keep up his DPS in the middle of a fight, and his only defensive tool is his W, which is *far* more often used to engage/escape than purely for defense.\n\nYou can keep disregarding that opinion, but I want you to consider something very important. **When does Lee Sin become popular?**\n\nThink about this for a moment. Lee Sin only jumps to the top of popularity when the average match is less than 35 minutes. It's also interesting to note that the average gold gained in a 30-minute match is 11k, which is enough to buy 2-3 completed items, depending on how much you invest in boots. *So when the end-game is during his mid-game, Lee Sin becomes much more popular. Why is that?*\n> 3) i dont mean to \"teach\" you anything. its more like this is a forum and we just post whatever we think about a certain topic and if someone saith something that we deem wrong or right or augmentable, we give our opinion. \n> i dont mean to teach you personally, else i'd offer you coaching and let myself get paid for it, but simply give a diamond players insight on the game.\n\nYou've definitely phrased it as if you're trying to teach. Unless English isn't your first language, you'd have to be a special kind of person to not realize why I drew that conclusion.\n> 4) from my own experience i can say, rank matters alot when it comes to game knowledge. if you dont think so, you can simply value this argument lower. for example, when i say \"champ X is pretty weak\" and someone saith \"but player Y is high challenger with it so it cant be that weak\" then that definitely is evidence but i value it so low that i can leave it out of any calculation. if you value rank-evidence low, you can just do that for yourself and let others value it high.\n>\n> that being said, im not talking at you for being low/unranked, im just reminding everyone that everything you say is from a certain perspective and everything i say is from another perspective not only influenced by us being different people but also by our ranks. \n> again, if you think that argument has no value, simply dont consider it. **what im saying is not based on my rank and i dont use my rank as an argument, i simply back it up with my rank**. from my own opinion, this backup is relatively strong but if it isnt from yours, thats fine too.\n\nIn the years that I've been around this game, I've seen pretty much every possible combination of rank and player intelligence. Only thing I haven't seen is Master rank players on the forums, and they're either too busy smurfing for fun or playing high-level matches to bother with the forums. \n\nThis leads me to one truth: you cannot base someone's understanding of the game on rank. Their rank will, at best, accurately note their experience and **ability to apply** game knowledge, as well as their teamwork skills beyond Silver.\n\nRank does not usually matter in a discussion. What matters is the player knowing the subject well enough to base their opinions/arguments on facts, and being able to trade debate points. If someone is high rank *and* knowledgeable on the subject, it definitely solidifies my respect for their opinions, but it's not a requirement for me to consider it valid.\n\nAlso, when it conflicts what other players of similar rank have said, I tend to see it as one man's opinion against the rest. They could be right, but more players are saying they're wrong for reasons X, Y and Zed, and none of their counter-points are dispelling the facts laid out.\n> i remember there was a discussion about pantheon jungle on the thread and as one of the highest ranked pantheon players on EUW (even higher before) i gave my opinion on that topic. then a discussion broke out about how meaningless my rank and my thousand pantheon games are and that all the silver players who \"main\" pantheon for 30 games have an equally valuable opinion.\n> \n> you see, you can make of it what ever you want.\n\nI don't recall that thread, but then again, it could have been not on the NA forum or drowned out by other topics. Or possibly something I skimmed past, as it may have happened before I was really into jungling.\n\nIn any event, the discussion subject would be more important than the ranking of those in the discussion, *but it's true that your extensive experience would lend your words far more weight than the average player.* Again, I regard individual intelligence over the game's mechanical approximation of a player's skill, but this is a case where, logically and statistically, that information actually grants leverage.\n\nRanking may not be necessary to validate game knowledge, but it verifies experience. Chances are that I'd probably agree with you on the Pantheon discussion. Main reason why we're even disagreeing on Lee Sin is because what you say is going against so many other facts and opinions.","replies":[{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-12-07T08:21:52.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, we are kinda agreeing on many things here.\n\ntho if i recall correctly, it was mainly about lee sin and the term \"falls off\", right?\n\nso you are saying  no champion \"falls off\" from how i understand that phrase because no champion loses power? well not exactly. no champion becomes a weaker version of himself but  many champions lose impact over the course of the game. the best example really is elise because not only drops the power-growth of her kit so drastically past 6 that her impact simply FALLS OFF but her abilities are also designed in a way that it is very hard to itemize to properly use them past, i say, the jungle item.\n\nalso, every single one of her abilities is designed to be low-impact and only the combination makes her strong. this means, later on in the game she has no abilitiy to singlehandedly impact a fight except her stun which can only reliably used to peel. her impact on the fights/game is very low right now.\n\nlee sin ofcourse suffers from the same things and you are absolutely right about his abilities and his buildpath BUT the ultimate becomes more and more impactful the longer the game goes (respawn timers, health items on frontliners etc) and keeps his power curve stable. he doesnt fall off as his impact doesnt decrease. he simply stays as impactful as ever or even grows slightly.\n\nthere are many champions who fall off lategame but its true, with the short gametimes we have right now that applies to less champions than before.\n\n\nalso the second thing you say is that lee sin is popular with short gametimes. that is correlating for sure but i felt like its much more the other way around. when season 6 came around i tested almost all junglers extensively (because im a jungler, makes sense) and i found that three champions in particular have a very sick early power and, due to the new season, are way more impactful than before. these three are lee sin, kindred and rexai.\n\nthe new jungle does a few things for junglers.\n1. it gives more experience the more you fall behind, so the less you farm, the faster you catch up which basically frees up time you can \"fuck around\" and still get back, which benefits junglers who like to spend their time ganking and fucking around.\n\n2. it gives less gold so the junglers looking to farm up in the jungle dont benefit from that as much anymore and junglers who reliably get their gold outside of the jungle just have way less downsides from not farming as much.\n\n3. jungle items are more expensive and give a different form of sustain which guts all champions having a hard time in jungle anyways. now its mostly due to having much less mana sustain and no masteries (except the neglible 5 on hit dmg) that actually help jungling. this means all junglers who naturally jungle and sustain nicely get buffed indirectly even more\n\n4. yeah there is a fourth point even. so many buffs for these junglers. from the new masteries, fighting in lanes and trading has been buffed and is encouraged MUCH more than last season, so laners fight and trade way more frequently which makes ganking much easier and increases the success rate of ganks drastically so champions who have strong early ganks and can gank frequently due to no/low resource cost/cooldowns have an advantage here too.\n\nthe change in tower-survivability surely gives opportunity to make games last shorter but the champions who take that opportunity decide the duration of the game and the champions who take it most are lee sin, kindred and rexai.\n\n\noh and by the way, last point: i dont believe in \"being able to apply\" mechanical skill/knowledge exists in league. that is exactly what i was getting at when i made the comparison to warcraft 3. \nin wc3 you could understand the game really deeply from theory alone but you lacked the mechanical skill to apply it because it was just so mechanics-heavy. league of legends tho requires basically no mechanics but only anticipation and experience. that means, if you HAVE the experience and if you HAVE the !KNOWLEDGE! (many people say \"i know\" and they really think they do but they actually dont. knowledge is a trap) then you CAN apply it even if you have only two fingers per hand. there is literally no mechanical excuse in league of legends.\n\nif you have it in your brain, you have it in the game. thats just how league of legends is designed. there is no mechanical boundary and lee sin and yasuo have no higher skill-floor and skill-ceiling or skill-my ass because they rely on pressing buttons a bit faster. \n\nofcourse there is no way this can be proven and the only evidence for it is progamer APM but here you can just take my word for it.","replies":[{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-12-07T08:36:21.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was only saying that, *by your given definition,* a champion's scaling does not fall off.\n\nNow that you're saying they become relatively less effective--the actual definition of \"falling off\" in scaling--you've said basically what I said.
