It denies exp from the enemy jg making him weaker when he does gank you especially since the jg re spawn timers increase\nB. There is not really much else to do when your not making your lane very gankable for me unless i have good wards in enemy jg and can set up a counter gank\nC. If i have the wards to set up a counter gank you have the wards to avoid getting ganked completely","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ozzie Storm","date":"2016-11-25T23:21:13.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excuse me? When the enemy jungler is ganking the jundler has 4 options: \n1. countergank\n2. gank another lane\n3. secure an objective\n4. counterjungle\n\nIf you think point no.4 is useless let me correct you. Taking the enemys blue buff for example while he's ganking who'nt only get me some ex that he will lack it will also have an efect on their mid laner. and even if you die he xp they get will be shared between them while i get more exp than him which in the long run will turn him useless.\n\nAnd ofc you can't blame your you're getting ganked if you have no vision in your area. and if you see your jungler on the far side of the mak play a little safer especially if you don't know where the enemy jubgler is.\n\nAlso wanted to note that you make ganlking seem so easy. If there isn't an opportunity for the jungler to gank the best he can do is focus objectives and farm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-11-25T23:18:43.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey laner,\n\nCounter jungling may not seem like it's helping the team, but indirectly it helps a lot when done right. With the increased respawn times on camps this preseason, a good counter jungle can set the enemy jungle an entire level or more behind, while also giving the jungle the lead to gank with. It also leaves the enemy to try to force ganks so that they are not behind, giving your jungle prime opportunities for a counter gank that would result in a double or more. The bottom line is not a matter of counter jungling, but how good your jungle is doing.\n\n-Plat Jungle Main","replies":[]},{"poster":"LU Vanilla Rice ","date":"2016-11-25T23:15:44.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Consistently counterjungling is not a good thing, however, doing it every so often is. Counterjungling takes away xp, as well gives information as to where the enemy jungler is most likely. Also, there are some junglers who are meant to be control junglers, such as Nunu!","replies":[]}]}
