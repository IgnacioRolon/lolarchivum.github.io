I think the main issue with league is not that it's short games but that it is often very one sided. If a team pulls even the slightest edge, they will typically just snowball from there and make games impossible to come back. There is a lop-side of power here. If towers were more threating and the minion pushing was removed the game would be less snowball - less people will just dive because towers actually mean something, and minions won't just trash towers as easily - it is likely the game lengths will remain the same but nobody will just gain massive advantages because they got 1 kill and now we can just dive bot and win.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-07-28T15:00:34.146+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"yet part of the reason for the changes was the player base wanting shorter games cuz the old 40-55min games people said took to much time \n\nso now the average game is 32mins ish \n\nthey added rift to make the game faster... the team  that gets it gets at least 1 turret out of it which equates to alot of map control/pressure and team gold \n\nbut yet they took this element from drag for team gold? \n\nnow you have to decide between baron or elder... if you get a pick or two and have a 3 vs 5 and lanes pushing then you can legit split and get both further snowballing. \n\ni cant tell you how many games i see 1st blood in under 3 mins. its like no one knows how to play and farm at all people just wanna all in at lvl 1 /2 and dont realize that most at those early levels if you just trade and make the enemy in lane draw agro from the minions that will do more damage then what you are gonna do with autos. \n(game i just finish jax on my team gave 1st blood to teemo top before minions got to lane fml ) \n\nanother thing that pushes game time is the gold/experience obtained jungle and support now ... sometimes i will be equal to or higher lvl then solo laners in either position so in the past seasons where solo lanes were super gold fed early and adcs were stronger mid game and jungle and supports had slightly less but if they were involved in a lot of objectives or asst they would be on par. now every one is rich... which in itself creates a power shift to certain champs \n\nthen we take a look at the element drags ... and the randomness it provides ... if a team was able to obtain two early infernal drags they clearly have an stat/gold advantage that just scale more with items and levels \n\nbut if you wanted to try to combat this at next drag and it ends up cloud/water drag you are kinda fuked if behind. \nmountain and infernal are truly the only ones worth contesting ( imo ) \n\nbut with the changes to turrets , and the 1st turret bonus gold it escalates agro play and dives which can legit lose a game. \nthen we add in the reworked masteries from season 6 with the balance nightmare they caused with keystones \n(bout to do the same fukin thing with runes FML ) and with the super agro meta, snowball games etc with having to rework more and more champs, buffs, nerfs, item changes etc balance to me is more of an issue then it ever been \n\njust my thoughts","replies":[{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-07-28T15:13:59.431+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are completely right.
