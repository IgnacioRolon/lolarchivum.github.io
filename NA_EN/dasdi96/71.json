It was hotfixed so it only works against champions. This caused it to only be viable on champions that have natural crit in their kit. It was reworked to just give you lifesteal based on how low you are, up to 20%. It made bot lane so uninteractive because adcs had ridiculous sustain, that they nerfed it shortly after so it is inly 1/4 effective against non champions for ranged and 1/2 for melee. Even then, it was still op on adcs like cait and draven as they use their ridiculous damage and cait now started rushing triple crit due to not having to buy lifesteal. However, it could be mitigated to an extent by armor. It was just a &quot;stat stick&quot; keystone. Earlier this season, riot reworked again to something charge based, where if you move around and attack you get stacks. At 100 stacks, your next auto lifesteals 5-40% of your ad unmitigated, and can be boosted by crit with no penalty and also gives a massive burst of movespeed. It also has no penalty for ranged champions. It usually triggers every 4-6 seconds. Again champs like draven and cait abused this to no end as it gives them so much free survivability. Cait especially as she continued to rush  triple crit to obtain massive damage since she doesn&#039;t have to buy lifesteal. Draven was also bad as he now usually buys death dance, which may give him just enough time to get another warlord proc, giving him 300+ hp in addition to the lifesteal he has. This combined with lifesteal makes him survive fights that he should have died in 3-4 seconds ago. However, the biggest abuser was jhin; since he has extremely high ad and his 4th shot is a guarnteed crit. I have seen a jhin heal 1200 off of just 1 auto attack and he had 700 ms after that, escaping what should have been a death.\r\ntldr: warlords shouldn&#039;t have even existed as copious amounts of free sustain can&#039;t be balanced at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Kairoptra","date":"2017-09-05T21:37:33.060+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":1,"body":"My question is: Why are you complaining _now_?

And since it gave you the same amount of ap and the same spellvamp PLUSS AD and Life steal there were no good reason to get it over the other. And the ones that did buy it was probably back when it gave an aura spellvamp to all team mates which was waay back. \n\nSame with {{champion:55}}  as on {{champion:84}} Gunblade was always a better option. \n\n{{champion:50}}  was part of the Mage rework. In that rework riot gave him reliable sustain, doing so that instead of healing for X% value of Y damage dealt to just simply heal for the same amount regardless of the damage dealt.  So he would be able to sustain even if he deal less damage. \n\nAnd here's the thing. People don't like changes. Most of us can only see the bad parts, what we will lose through changes and gets blinded on what we will gain with the removal of spell vamp. So what did we actually lose with this item? Build diversity? some fun elements to the game? Well yeah, we did lose a few of those elements but look at what we gained. \n\n(Just to clarify.

But now everyone has a ton of sustain and that build does not work even as a joke. \"Oh yeah I heal for 25 life a hit with my 21% life steal, I'll trade with him four times, heal to full, and do it again.\" And suddenly he (whoever) has full HP too despite me building into it specifically and he just has Warlords and Dorans.
