In Sara Gruen's novel Water for Elephants the protagonist Jacob Jankowski demonstrates strength of character through his brave and selfless actions. In this way, he is similar to Canada's veterans and soldiers who serve Canada to preserve peace and keep the country safe. Canadian soldiers display strength of character when they go to countries like Syria and Iraq to selflessly rescue the people from terrorism and restore peace and stability. Perhaps there is no greater modern example of strength of character than that of Malala Yousafzai, who stood up to a feared terrorist organization to fight for the right for girls to attend school. There are many moments in Water for Elephants where Jacob demonstrates his strength of character as well. Jacob tries to protect others, like Marlena and Rosie the elephant, from August's wrath with little consideration for his own safety. Similarly, Canadian soldiers put their own safety at risk when they protect the lives of others. One such example is Canadian soldier, Corporal Nathan Cirillo, who was shot at the National War Memorial in Ottawa during a terrorist attack. Jacob also shows his strength of character when he stubbornly stands up for what is right and fair. This is similar to the Canadian forces who go in to countries like Syria and Iraq to stand up for those people who cannot stand up for themselves. Finally, Jacob demonstrates his strength of character when he decides to leave his home after the tragic death of his parents. Like Jacob who persevered in the face of a tragedy, Malala Yousafzai persevered following the vicious attack on her life and went on to become an international icon for girl's education rights. Strength of character is the most important quality to determine a person's success and it is shown though Jacob in Water for Elephants and through the various people who stand up daily to fight injustice around the world.\r\n\tOne of the most important tests of a person's character is their willingness to put others before themselves. In Water for Elephants, Jacob is aware of August's violent temper, and tries to defend his comrades from it, regardless of the potential consequences he might face. Jacob is protective of Marlena because he loves her, so when he sees her being abused by August he reacts instantly by \"[Launching] across the open space [to tackle] him\" (Gruen 246). Jacob engages August despite knowing that he will probably not survive. This shows that he is willing to put his life at risk to protect others, demonstrating his selflessness and bravery. Cpl. Nathan Cirillo also showed his strength of spirit when he stood guard at the National War Memorial in Ottawa. While on duty on October 22nd of this year, he was shot and killed by a gunman who terrorized Parliament Hill. According to Maclean's magazine, Cirillo joined the military because \"He wanted to help people, and saw the military as a way to do so\" (Maclean's 34). Cirillo fulfilled the role of the everyday hero by being the sort of man willing to put the safety of his country and its people above himself. Cirillo gave his life in the course of his duties to his nation and for his sacrifice, will be remembered as a national hero. Additionally, in Water for Elephants, Jacob demonstrates his willingness to protect others when he defends Rosie, the new elephant, from August's wrath. Jacob feels that Rosie is merely misunderstood by August, which is why he defends her so often. When August attempts to beat Rosie, Jacob protests: \"But August!... Wait! She was good!\" (Gruen 170). From his first days in the circus, Jacob shows that he is willing to protect people and animals alike from harm and injustice. This is similar to how Corporal Nathan Cirillo wanted to help those in need. According to Maclean's magazine, \"... where help was needed, [Cirillo] always wanted to be the person to help\" (Maclean, 34). Cirillo's bravery in defending the National War Memorial and his selflessness show his true strength of character. For both Jacob and Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, it is in their natures to want to help others. They are, however, different in their motives; Jacob protects people whom he cares about and knows, while Cpl. Cirillo protected all Canadians as a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. Both Jacob and Cpl. Nathan Cirillo had a significant impact on their societies. Jacob looked after his friends in the circus, while Cpl. Cirillo became a national hero due to his bravery and sacrifice.\r\n\tAnother important aspect of a person's character is their willingness to stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves. This is shown in Water for Elephants when Jacob stands up to August because of how he has treated the circus workers and his loved ones. After weeks of trying to negotiate with August, Jacob reaches a low point and decides his only option is to kill August. After surviving a stampede which may have been organized by August, Jacob finds himself, \"... creeping across the top of the stock car on [his] hands and knees with Walter's knife in [his] teeth\" (Gruen 294). In this moment, Jacob is prepared to kill August to protect himself and those he cares about most. This is similar to the Canadian men and women who volunteer for dangerous missions in Syria and Iraq to fight against ISIS troops. According to CTV News, Canadian soldiers are actively bombing ISIS targets in Syria. In November of this year, they participated in an aerial strike where, \"... two CF-18 Hornets dropped four 2,000-pound bombs on an Islamic State fighting position\" (CTV News). The people of Syria and Iraq are suffering under the control of ISIS  and cannot fend for themselves. They need someone to stand up for them and Canada has committed to fulfilling that role, thus showing the strength of character that is in every Canadian soldier.  Jacob also shows his strength of character when he allows Rosie to kill August. Under the big top, he sees Rosie \"... [lift a] stake as through it weighs nothing and [split August's] head in a single clean movement\" (Gruen 309). Jacob understands that Rosie has suffered greatly at August's hand and needs to take revenge before she can move on. This is why he does not stop her from killing August. This is related to Canadian soldiers who fight in wars to free people who suffer under terrorist regimes, like ISIS. War and death are never ideal solutions to a problem, but at times they are necessary to protect those who cannot protect themselves. According to CBC News, Canada is currently at war with ISIS: \"The government of Canada is prepared to engage in actions against ISIL in Syria\" (CBC News). Syria requires assistance from Canada and other countries to defeat ISIS, who threaten the safety and freedom of Syria's people. Canada's quick response shows that Canadian soldiers are brave heroes who fight selflessly to restore peace to countries in trouble. Both Jacob and the Canadian forces display heroic qualities and strength of character when they stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves. They have both been successful in making a positive impact, demonstrating that strength of character is the most important factor in determining success.\r\n\tFinally, the most important part of a person's character is their ability to have initiative. This is shown in Water for Elephants when Jacob takes the initiative to jump on a moving train even though he does not know its destination. When Jacob sees the train, he \"reach[es] for the iron grab bar and fling[s] [him]self upward\" (Gruen 25). Jacob displays determination in climbing onto the train, which shows that he possesses initiative as well as enough courage to act in the face of the unknown. Jacob's ride on the Benzini Brothers Circus train opened the door to an entirely new world and life which he would not have experienced without his initiative to venture into the unknown. This is similar to Malala Yousafzai, a young activist from Pakistan who stands up for girls' education rights. According to BBC News, Malala Yousafzai spoke out against the Taliban's policy of denying education to girls. At the young age of twelve, \"She first came to public attention through [her] heartfelt diary, published on BBC Urdu, which chronicled her desire to remain in school and for girls to have the chance to be educated\" (BBC News). After she was shot in the head by the Taliban and miraculously recovered, she became recognized as an international voice for girls' education rights. Jacob also demonstrates initiative when he requests a job on the circus train. When asked what jobs he can do, Jacob answers, \"About anything \" (Gruen, 28). Jacob's response shows that he is willing to take on any task, no matter how tedious it seems, to achieve his goal of working for the circus full time. Like Jacob, Malala Yousafzai demonstrated that she is ready to face anything to make sure girls have access to proper schooling. According to BBC News, the Taliban threatened Malala Yousafzai for being an activist. They targeted her and her family, \"for promoting secular education\", (BBC News) and vowed to strike against her. Malala's persistence in standing up for education rights reveal her courage and her willingness to not let any obstacle get in her way. Both Jacob and Malala have demonstrated initiative and commitment to their cause. Jacob's ability to bravely venture into the unknown and join the circus shows that he is ready to stand on his own two feet for the first time in his life. His parents have died a few days ago and he finds out that he is bankrupt, so he has to find a way to make a living so he can live on his own. Similarly, Malala's courageous actions in standing up to the injustice that is ruining her country show an impressive level of courage and commitment. Malala has established herself as an international icon and is recognized, as one of the world's leading voices for girls' education rights. Both Jacob and Malala are successful in setting a good example of what can be achieved through initiative, commitment, and strength of character.\r\n\tJacob's actions in Water for Elephants and the selflessness of real life heroes show that strength of character is the most important quality to determining a person's success. The sacrifices made by people like Nathan Cirillo, the Canadian Armed Forces, and Malala Yousafzai show the positive changes that can be achieved through initiative, commitment to a cause, and strength of character. Much like these contemporary heroes, Jacob improved the lives of those around him through his selflessness, bravery, and initiative. Like Nathan Cirillo who put the needs of his country above himself, Jacob chose to defend Marlena and Rosie with no consideration for his own safety. Similarly, the bravery of Canada's armed forces in conflicts like what is currently happening in Syria and Iraq can be related to Jacob's will to kill August to protect his friends. In this world, sometimes it is necessary to stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves. Finally, Jacob's initiative in hopping on a train, with an unknown destination, in the hopes of finding a job is similar to when Malala Yousafzai publicly argued for girls' education rights despite threats made against her by a powerful terrorist organization. Like Jacob, her perseverance was rewarded and she achieved her goal of raising awareness about the importance of education for girls. Although there are many criteria which determine a person's success, it is clear through literary and contemporary examples that the most important of these is strength of character.\r\n\r\nWorks Cited:\r\nGruen, Sara.
