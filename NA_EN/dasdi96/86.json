The only good strategy right now is to inject as much steroids as you can into the marksman. I haven&#039;t watched a single worlds game because I basically know how it&#039;s going to go. A big reason for this is how ranged adcs is completely broken right now. They basically hit late game status once they get 2 crit items and they only become stronger from there. The only 2 players that have any form of impact is the adcs and the support, and that is only if they are playing an ardent censor support because if they don&#039;t, their team just gets stat checked by the enemy bot lane. Top lane has no impact whatsoever because even if they do slightly well in lane, they can&#039;t do anything against overpowered adcs.","replies":[{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2017-10-06T21:54:08.718+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":3,"body":"At least it has counterplay.

If a video game isn't interactive, it becomes boring, frustrating, and thereby not fun. In a PvP video game, it is particularly important to have interactivity, because you have players on both sides acting against each other, so it is better to have those players influence each other's actions and decisions. If one side or one player doesn't offer enough opportunities to be interacted with, i.e. insufficient counterplay, they become frustrating to play against, as this lowers the agency of anyone playing against them.\n\nTo some extent, though, you're right, not _everything_ needs counterplay: autoattacks don't have much counterplay, for example, and that can be fine, _so long as your champion has sufficient counterplay elsewhere_. Trouble is, marksmen right now often don't have much counterplay elsewhere, as most of their power is put into raw autoattacking power, and often into reliable, on-demand steroids as well. Because they have so little interactivity, they don't really feel fun to play against, even if they're behind, and fighting them often boils down to a stat check, rather than a true test of skill for either side. Effectively, what marksmen need is to have a little less generic autoattacking power, and instead more power put into stuff like conditional steroids or other enablers to their basic attacks, which could allow them to be sufficiently interactive while still relying on a mechanic with low innate counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Homie busta","date":"2017-10-07T11:37:04.023+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's why any champion that relies too much on autoattacks or point'n click can't be strong or viable until they get reworked.
