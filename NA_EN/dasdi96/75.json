He is just a damage mage that can zone well in the bottom lane with a stun (he initially started going bottom because his stun duration was A LOT longer).\n\nPros take him down there sometimes and that's why Brand support is acceptable.\n\nZyra IS a support though and is a weaker mid laner. Brand can hold his own in the mid lane but Zyra has some trouble with farming, always shoving, and is highly susceptible to ganks. If you play around her plants she actually is pretty vulnerable in the mid lane while {{champion:63}} is a real damage threat if a gank comes and his ultimate is up.\n\nZyra has a root, a knockup, and can zone. \n\nFor the record I play {{champion:63}} sometimes in the mid or bottom lane, but it really just depends on the matchup. I think Brand is a great champion, but against a hyper mobile comp or a tank in the bot lane like {{champion:12}} who can engage at will, he is vulnerable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zelorxon","date":"2016-12-27T21:37:10.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And you are a good player.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HCC Faust Lord","date":"2016-12-27T21:31:02.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Coming from a support main, brand is a support. He does assloads of damage but is very squishy, which is easily punishable by Thresh or Leona or Braum. Brand's passive instantly gives him all of the gold from spell thiefs procs, and his contribution to late game team fights from damage along with aoe slows make him one of the best supports in the game right now. Sorry, but it's the truth and you need to accept it.","replies":[]}]}
