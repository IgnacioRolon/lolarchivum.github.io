They do learn stuff slower overall, but their experience growth stops at gold V'ish (that's my guess, don't get pointlessly offended).

Talk about kicking em while they're down...\nIt's really a shame, because I consider them some of the most fun and healthiest teamwork-focused champions in the game... There are so many other champions with toxic kits that are left with permanently extremely high pick and ban rates without nerfs...  Sejuani doesn't even have a positive winrate in LCS.\n\nBy the way, I recently tried playing Sejuani and she legitimately feels like one of the weakest champions in the game.  If she falls behind at all, she can't clear anymore, almost anyone can counterjungle her, and she doesn't feel tanky in fights.  Succeeding with her feels like you need to put in way more effort than your opponents and get lucky enough to not lose your jungle and fall behind...\n\nAlso what is the point in even nerfing them for LCS?  Just let them be played or banned by the LCS players.  They are way more interesting and showcase teamwork and strategic play better than the other stuff that specifically gets buffed into the LCS champion roster...  Although the whole LCS, along with other televised sports and streamed games, is boring by its very nature in my opinion...  I am a person who would rather play a game than watch a \"Let's Play\" series, so I am probably never watching LCS no matter what.\n\nPS.  Balancing specifically around LCS ruins the sense of competitive fairness, because Riot is actually targeting specific competitive player's most comfortable/practiced champion picks.  How well a small handful of players do with Shen doesn't reflect Shen's overall balance, because it could very well be true that Shen just appeals to team-focused players who are the only people who can thrive in LCS, and therefore LCS players are drawn to Shen and practice him more than other champions.","replies":[{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2018-09-01T15:57:17.600+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've invested 5 skins in Sejuani and I feel like it was the worst investment I have ever made.","replies":[{"poster":"Hemulen Magi","date":"2018-09-01T16:30:37.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only have Darkrider Sejuani, but yeah, it feels kind of bad having a skin on a champion that will disadvantage you to play...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Naqel","date":"2018-09-02T10:04:25.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't even get to play her since the rework, since she lost all her support viability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2018-09-01T23:12:05.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have all sejuani skins....
