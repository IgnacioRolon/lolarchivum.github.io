Had a {{champion:25}} support last game who kept chasing kills and expecting her team to follow despite we being behind. Then she had the audacity to call us out for not following. May I remind all of you that 1 kill = 15 cs. If a wave is crashed under my tower don't expect me to assist you on your roam. If we have a teammate dead don't expect me to participate in losing teamfights. I think support mains do this so they can brag about how many assists they have in a game.","replies":[]}
