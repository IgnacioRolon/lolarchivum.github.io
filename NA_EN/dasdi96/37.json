If someone from diamond has an opinion that differs from a bronze, the diamond should NOT try to reason with the low elo. He shouldn&#039;t ask why either. He should take what the bronze says as fact without talking back. Too many times, I&#039;ve seen a diamond backtalk a bronze 5, and it&#039;s disgusting, because the diamond is wrong most of the time. The only time a diamond is right is when 500,000 diamonds are talking back to a single bronze 5. There&#039;s a reason why you&#039;re stuck in dismond. It&#039;s because you think differently than the bronzies. Start thinking like a bronzie.","replies":[]}
