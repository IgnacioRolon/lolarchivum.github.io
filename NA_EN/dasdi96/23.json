These cheap items have more impact than the most expensive fighter/mage/marksman items. These classes need to farm hard to be able to afford these items. Meanwhile a support can have near 0 cs and reach full build faster than a fighter with near perfect farm. Last time I checked supports should be able to function without gold.","replies":[{"poster":"HÃ³pe","date":"2018-03-02T23:23:22.423+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports are a bit too over buffed.

People just bitched for no reason.   \n\nSupport kits are and have always been overtuned to work effectively without gold income, with all this extra cash they get nowadays they're actually too strong and have disproportionate impact on the game in comparison with the effort it actually takes on them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Steel Blossom","date":"2018-03-03T00:33:32.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-03T00:59:15.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Steel Blossom,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ahwL6I0j,comment-id=00010002,timestamp=2018-03-03T00:33:32.334+0000)\n>\n> lol, first of all, anybody who says &quot;get used to it&quot;, I wish I can meet you in real life so I can help you get used to my many Kershaws and ZTs and Microtechs.

Season three supports actually had to focus on using their unique kits, instead of popping a shield and then sitting back to laugh at any attempts at diving.\n\nI am not sure what the fuck you are talking about, but you seem unusually mad for no obvious reason.\n\nMaybe consider being less insecure?\n\nMaybe you liked it, but supports dont.
