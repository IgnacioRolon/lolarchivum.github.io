It's how Riot distributes other defenses that makes things screwy.\n{{item:3812}} for example makes sense on a squishy ADC. It doesn't reduce damage at all, just delays it and offers a \"buy-back\" opportunity to not die.\n{{item:3046}} on the other hand, makes no sense to me. It's targeted at ADC's, who's defense is supposed to come from kiting, Life-steal, and teamwork. But Riot is giving them direct damage reduction (which is stronger than resists).\n{{item:3156}} adds a shield to the list and {{item:3139}} adds a cleanse because... Why not?\n{{item:3026}} I can at least get behind. Because without your team around, the revival is worthless on a right-clicker.\nI don't see a need for them to have such diverse and general defense options.\n\nSimilarly:\n{{item:3504}} Gives squishy supports the ability to make *another* person more durable.

Makes the user *slightly* more durable, while giving *everyone* (including the user) an \"oh shit\" button.\nSo supports sacrificing themselves to give others *more* defensive resources. These resources often catering to the squishies.\n(Don't get me wrong. As a support main, I love this itemization! That doesn't make the big picture any less odd though.)\n\nFor non-support tanks we have health+resists as intended and very targeted non-resist defenses.\n{{item:3194}} reduction to repeat ability magic damage (because there are apparently no AD casters).\n{{item:3082}} reduces AS\n{{item:3143}} reduces crit\n{{item:3047}} reduces AA's\nWhile it seems like tanks should be the ones to enjoy broad options (my opinion); they're the ones forced to specialize.

Doesn't change the fact that his point is true though about how armor scales, every point is as equally valuable as the last.  The question is if it may be more worth it to get more HP after a point, which is a different matter.\n\n\nArmor scales like this.\n\nEvery point of armor/mr grants you +1% effective HP vs that damage type.\n\nAt 100 armor, you are having your effective HP pool doubled vs physical damage.  At 200 armor, you had it tripled.\n\n\nLets use a fairly easy example.\n\nYou have exactly 2000 HP.  You have 100 armor.   This is worth 4000 HP vs physical damage.\n\nYou can buy a Warmog, or a Frozen Heart.\n\nWarmog gives you 2800 HP, and still 100 armor.  This is 5600 HP vs physical.\nFrozen Heart gives you 2000 HP, and 190 armor.  This is 5800 HP vs physical damage.\n\n\nNow lets change the story up a bit.  You have 3000 HP, and 200 armor.  This is 9000 HP vs physical.\n\nWarmog brings you to 3800 HP, and 200 armor.  11400 hp vs physical.\nFrozen Heart gets you to 3000 hp and 290 armor.   11700 hp vs physical.\n\n\n\nArmor has still had a greater impact on your durability vs physical than HP would have.  The main issue is you are rarely taking pure one damage type.    Pretty much the moment you start taking any other type of damage instead of just physical, HP's effective value on your durability is greater than armor.   Although more HP leaves you as a bigger health battery for LS users, so it isn't a clear cut tradeoff all the time.\n\n\nNow, lets pretend you are Rammus, and are vs a pure physical team comp.   You build up to 500 armor while W is on, although you only have 2500 HP.  What will bulk you up the most?  500 more HP, or 100 more armor?\n\n3000x6=18000 is the HP case.   2500x7=17500 is the armor.

There is nothing about the fantasy of playing a ranged attacker that is more inherently carry-like than that of playing a magic user or unstoppable warrior, and in practice marksmen are only the game's designated carries because DotA lacked ability scaling and features mostly autoattack-reliant carries. Nowadays, though, Dota 2 has carries across all types, including ability carries and tanky carries, and the same goes for most other MOBAs.\n\nI also agree further down that itemization needs some serious changes, as the sheer difference in raw stats between classes is a major reason why some champions cannot carry even if their kit innately predisposes them to a strong late game. On a surface level, stats from items are now pretty excessive for how quickly matches progress now, and are a major reason why the game feels so snowbally, so toning them down across the board and adjusting the stats of late-game objectives could help make combat feel less one-sided. On a more fundamental level, items as a system no longer truly accomplish their original purpose, i.e. that of offering varied choices and different playstyles for every champion, with stat-binding achieving the exact opposite effect, and so it raises the question as to how it should fundamentally change in order to give champions the customization and adaptability players want from them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blackstone01","date":"2017-08-14T07:27:07.555+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, there should be a \"hyper carry\" classification but not locked to any specific class that's currently in league.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2017-08-14T01:38:27.829+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":3,"body":"Revert the price decrease on B.F. sword.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-08-14T03:12:25.430+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"that makes the game more unhealthy","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2017-08-14T05:26:16.145+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"How?
