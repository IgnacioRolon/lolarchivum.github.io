Now Grants 40 AP + 15 Magic Pen. Removing the HP since Liandries is becoming it's own thing and we don't want 4000 HP Brands running around that built all the HP + AP items at once.\n\nLiandries no longer builds out of Haunting Guise, instead reworked into a dedicated anti-tank item with HP + AP (Think AP version of The Black Cleaver in terms of stat spread, High HP, medium AP)\n\nHaunting Guise now builds into a new item: One that grants medium AP but HUGE flat Pen. Magic Pen between Haunting Guise and it's upgrade cannot be stacked. Idea is to let you buy back that lost penetration at the cost of raw AP (Think 60-80 AP but grants 30 Magic Pen), meaning it's gated behind a complete item that is otherwise slot inefficient. \n\nCould maybe give Haunting Guise a second upgrade path that grants more raw AP but doesn't improve upon the magic pen, but that's getting a bit too deep for just some late night spitballing.
