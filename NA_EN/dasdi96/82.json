Maybe.\n\nMainly crit is just a tad too cheap. ( Riot's crusade to make/balance the game around shorter and buffing scaling is damaging the game. In higher ranks or in anyone's eyes that can properly play the game they will play the hard carries and pull through a mildly difficult start (it's nowhere near as difficult as it used to be) but still have those snowball levers play in their favor if they don't suck therefor completely sealing the game.)\n\nAs for Kog's build the pieces out of line would be wit's end and frozen mallet. Wit's end and mallet helped AD Kennen be pick ban last season (despite its questionable performance). I also rush wits end on Gnar now in ap matchups which if I'm tryharding is the main time I pick Gnar because magic resist itemization hard shuts down AP and Gnar is a ranged fighter tank that will kill them. Wits end is just too really good and not at all a tradeoff considering it's an early AP blocker that will further multiply Kog's support shields and health built from the mallet. And need I even need to explain what is wrong with mallet? Its got way too much health for what it does. That 300 extra health it has over cleaver is why I stopped building cleaver on Gnar nearly 2 years ago.\n\nAlso ninja tabi is still kinda dumb. But it's less apparent with this season's low base defenses so what was an OP item is more acceptable. But it's still a very anti fighter problem item top lane because you get perfectly good defenses for your gold but also your 45 movespeed which is HUGE in fights and everything really especially in fights with melee characters. Like wits end it's not making an appropriate tradeoff because you get good defense for your gold but movespeed too (like good dmg for the gold but mr too)\n\nI'm not here to cry. I just been abusing this crap long before is was a blip on anyone's radar. And shit's still broken. And the game never gets fixed.\n\nIt's actually defense stats that go unchecked because it's only more abused in higher ranks and because they keep designing the game so that bulking up is an almost mandatory if responsible decision point in the game. I'm surprised they went the other way and made base defenses even lower this season though it has made a more chaotic preseason solo queue. But in all seriousness I'm not one bit surprised the boring farm and scale with mostly uncounterplayable champions playstyle is still dominant","replies":[{"poster":"XeroKimo","date":"2018-01-28T00:17:13.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember the times when Wit's end was a useless piece of garbage item that no one bought unless they're trolling.....\n\nMan times have changed","replies":[{"poster":"Sohleks","date":"2018-01-28T00:42:13.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually... yeah.

However, in an environment where a) marksman damage is exceptionally high, and b) back lines are exceptionally well-defended, that counterplay is severely reduced. Moreover, the fact that his damage is target-agnostic means that the classes who have to travel the longest amount of time in order to reach him, i.e. fighters and tanks, are the ones that suffer even harder from his damage output. The fact that he is able to build a large amount of defenses on top of that, and receive even more protection from his support, adds insult to injury, as even at melee range it takes far too long to kill him relative to the time it takes for him to kill his opponents.\n\nIn general, the problem with a lot of marksmen is that their almost purely point-and-click damage means that they automatically put any target within range on a clock, where their victim is guaranteed to die within a certain time if the marksman is allowed to attack them unhindered. In the case of most marksmen, however, this is at least mitigated by the fact that their attack range is 550 units, allowing other classes to either outrange them or close a shorter gap in order to reach them. Kog'Maw does not have this limitation, however, and as such is capable of starting the clock much sooner, particularly since the steroid that enables this power has a significant uptime. He doesn't have mobility or hard CC, unlike most other marksmen, but neither of those weaknesses are as significant as they could be when he is constantly accompanied by a support, who can supply both lockdown and necessary protection, and can personally build a fair amount of defenses without cutting too hard into his own damage.\n\nMore generally, I think Kog'Maw is a good indicator that the clock every marksman applies on their target is currently far too short, as there are frequently cases of melee champions getting killed before they could truly get in range and deal significant damage to them, and even mages having a harder time dealing with marksmen whose mobility, range, or stealth allows them to kill them far too quickly. This is why I think Vayne and Twitch in particular have been unhealthy for quite some time, as their combination of upfront burst, stealth, and on-demand power (plus range, in Twitch's case) make them impossible to deal with properly past a certain number of items.","replies":[{"poster":"Catastrophic","date":"2018-01-28T08:35:42.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teridax, why are you no longer on the moderation team?","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-01-28T09:26:11.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I left a few months ago, actually!
