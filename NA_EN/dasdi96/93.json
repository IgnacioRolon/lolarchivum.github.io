Personally I don't think banning your teams hovered champions is a good idea however. \n\nIn ranked you may want to ban that Yasuo so you're midlaner or toplaner can't pick him but unless you look up his record you have no idea if you're banning out a champion he excels at playing. Thereby significantly hurting your own chances of winning the game. The solution could be to op.gg him and see how well he plays the champion and if he has any decent back ups. \nIf your midlaner is hovering Yasuo and his average kda is 5/10/5 across 20 games banning Yas doesnt seem like such a bad idea. Still especially in ranked it's worth noting that banning your teamates champion may tilt them before they game even starts again lowering your chances of winning the game.\n\nAs for normals.. Well personally I'll never understand people banning something from their own team. It's a normal. It'll never (or very rarely) be an even well rounded game. There's a good chance you have people first timing champions or at least learning them so what does it matter if your team mate wants to try to learn Yasuo.\n(e.g. I'm silver 3 and just had maybe my fifth game playing Gangplank trying to learn him and had to lane against a Plat 4 Riven)\nThey're just fun games where people play weird stuff half the time. Is it really worth banning Yasuo only to have them first time Lee top instead? Maybe it is.. Like you said that's your decision.\n\nEither way I'm not one to flame my team if they ban Yas. It happens sometimes on accident sometimes on purpose.\nIn ranked I'll play one of the other 3 champions I know how to play. In normals I'll work on learning a champion that's interesting to me at the time.
