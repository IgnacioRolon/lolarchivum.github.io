This is the reason why tanks are so awful to play for the past year.\n\nFor the 39.7k physical damage he did (9.4k was magic damage).\n\nhttps://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2975815713/211103400?tab=stats\n\nNote that your team had Garen with Randuin's, Thornmail, Tabi, and Chain Vest; Sej (you) with Randuin's and Tabi; and Leona with Dead Man's Plate and Thornmail. Kai'Sa even got Zhonya's and Guardian Angel. That is a very armor-heavy team, which is why true damage (probably from Conqueror, a common keystone for Yasuo) had such an opportunity to shine.\n\nAlso note that this was a 39-minute match, and both teams were extremely evenly matched in kills (48-49), gold (76k-77k), and objectives (only difference was Rift Herald).\n\nI don't really see a problem here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kalikain","date":"2019-02-12T03:59:01.670+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yup.
