For the longest time, marksmen being the game's carry class was somewhat justified by their builds costing the most gold, and their power being pretty low until they got 3-4 items' worth of synergistic stats. Currently, though, not only do many marksmen start spiking at 2 items, they also get to reach their core faster than any other non-support class. There is no justification for the power curve they enjoy now relative to everyone else.\n\nUltimately it boils down to one critical question: should marksmen be a carry class? If so, then they need to be balanced like actual carries, and go back to having terrible early game power and a curve that only spikes late. If not, then they should not collectively have access to nearly as much late-game power as they do now. Personally, I'm in favor of the latter, because I think trying to apply the same power curve to an entire class of champions is harmful to diversity, and often directly contradicts individual kits, where some champions are pretty much guaranteed to curve earlier or later than others. This applies to all other classes as well, who I think should have carries on par with marksmen in addition to early- and mid-focused champions, and because of this I think income and item costs need to be equalized across the board.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-12-03T21:24:08.989+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":22,"body":"Except they've buffed support gold income and lower support item closes by way too much.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-12-04T07:38:08.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports still only have ~75% of the income of a farming role, their items cannot be the same price.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-12-04T22:59:19.852+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"except support items are too effective.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2017-12-03T20:36:50.604+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":7,"body":"it still baffles me that zeal items dont cost 2900 and 3000 gold for {{item:3046}} \n\nmarksmen should come online at 4 to 5 items aswell, not at 3 items before the mid laner, and the top laner.\n\nespecially when you consider how snowbally bot lane is. a double kill on an adc right now means turret first blood on bot, usally means hes going to finish his third item when youre finishing your second item.\n\nmight actually be a good idea to make {{item:3086}} items exclusive like {{item:3077}} items.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-12-03T21:25:18.932+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":17,"body":"2800 at least man.

Mage core is not Morello Liandry Rabadon. No one is buying Rabadon right now until they are INSANELY ahead.\n\nSame for tanks, no one is building Sunfire, and Randuins is counterbuilding, not core. If anything Randuins should be a Dead Man's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yordle Xayah","date":"2017-12-04T03:49:17.850+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I understand what you mean, this post is ignoring entirely Gold Efficiency and focuses only on total cost, and that's not how the game works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pinkaj","date":"2017-12-03T23:55:58.836+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports I can understand why it's cheap, since they don't farm.

Meaning they get a shit ton of gold really fast, meaning 3 items faster **and** most of them naturaly power farm and get gold priority from an organized team. So everything is in their favor.\nBeing a Support Main I'd say that our build cost ain't a problem, we get so little gold compare to all the other role + the many control ward that we buy almost every time we recall, the cost clearly ain't the problem. The problem is how many other roles can peel the ADC, Toplane is most of time fill with Tanks and in the midlane Mages are still very popular, not that strong but popular. And we all know that Tanks and Mages have some kind of peeling tool or CC either hard CC or not. So assassins have a really hard time doing their job, even if they get fed of Hexdrinker/Nullifying orb shenanigans against mages.\nI have a One Trick Zilean Mid as a friend, if our ADC is a minimum good at positionning it's almost game over if we don't get camp bot because of how much peel he gets. It's for that reasons ADC can rush 3 offensive items back to back without buying lifesteal or any other kind of survability, not just the support but other carries, jungle, top and mid don't get only fast enough so they just peel for the ADC getting his big damage so earlier then them, I don't blame them, even If I was, I don't know, a Riven, I would either suicide mission kill the ADC or peel for my ADC because my damage is nothing to his.\n{{champion:29}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:498}} Are real monsters and they all got some kind of self peel (Except Twitch but his a invicible Team Killing machine, no need for peel when the entire enemy team is dead)\n{{champion:37}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:497}} {{champion:117}} Are pretty terrible to play against, I main Rakan and even myself fully admit how stupid I feel, I've won game by failling engages and just shield and heal the ADC. Sona and Karma are really annoying to lane against and the worst part is that they kind of scale well into the mid game. Lulu is just Lulu, screw Lulu such a living annoyance.\nI'd say we can up the ADC total build cost Riot and do something about Zeal items, maybe making it like Tiamat or someting. And don't get me started on \"Oh but they won't get their 100%\" they seriously don't need it, an ADC can do so much damage without critting every AA.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2017-12-04T02:23:15.994+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would {{item:3100}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3165}} really be core for AP assassins? \nI'd say {{item:3146}} would be considerably more core.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Clementine","date":"2017-12-03T23:58:16.099+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because supports have the lowest gold income?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ADC5LUT","date":"2017-12-04T04:13:56.151+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dcap being a core item on a mage rofl. xD The only mage that builds Dcap is veigar lol.","replies":[]}]}
