He would be a monster and hit full build by 20 min. After that he can dump the absurd amount of gold he gets from stomping to the rest of the team. \n\nThe way leagues itemization works means that putting all your eggs in 1 basket isn't actually a bad idea. Due to level scaling and the such. A full build yasuo at 20 min would be able to kill a squishy in a single q. Add in the ballerina effect on his dash q. This makes him able to kill 2-3 targets in 1 q. Then the other 2 are easy pickings.\n\nThe ability to funnel gold into a carry is a terrible idea","replies":[{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2017-03-03T21:19:34.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's not forget about those Champs that you need to focus early to keep down so that you have a few min of breathing room before they become hyper carries.
