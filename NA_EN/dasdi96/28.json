I have seen janna players shield the full hp adc instead of a 90 hp bruiser that has ignite on him. Then they go on and talk about how selfless they are. Real support mains assess which teammatr they should protect in every situation, and it changes in the same game.","replies":[{"poster":"VvVVvV","date":"2017-09-12T20:10:26.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because supports are damned if they do and damned if they dont.

Im not talking about the right move or the wrong move. Im just answering your question. From a former support main.

If the mage is also OOM, they're basically forced to back anyhow.\nAlso, depends on your adc. If it's a full-build Jinx or Kog'Maw, they're going to carry the teamfight and the boosts to them are often best.\n\n\nThere's too many varaibles to get into, but it's not ALWAYS shield someone to help them not die.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Raoul","date":"2017-09-12T21:08:33.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, do you become gamebreaking powerfull with the bonus stats from Ardent?
