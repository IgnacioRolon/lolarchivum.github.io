Annie doesn't have those kinds of specialties Kennen has to poke.\n\nKennen can stun easily, and since Yasuo is very easy to CC most of the time as kennen, no problemo. Kennen has an ult that can stun a Yasuo in less than 4 seconds at the least, and Kennen can just all in from there while Yasuo is stunned.

Her stun is longer as well as not being set-up reliant. \n\nKennen being able to stun Kennen in less then 4 seconds isn't really anything special when Annie is able to do it almost INSTANTLY with a W or Tibbers. \n\nLastly it's funny when you talk about Annie not being able to Zone Yasuo when in fact her Stun is better at zoning then his Whirlwind, as it's permanent, as opposed to his being 10 seconds. \nOnce he uses his Whirlwind or runs it down, Annie can use her stun without a care.
