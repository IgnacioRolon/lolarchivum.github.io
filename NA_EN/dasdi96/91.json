Lethality was changed so ad assassins aren't as lethal early on, but become slightly more dangerous later. This needs to apply to ap, even more so because mr scales much lower.","replies":[{"poster":"whiteLight3r","date":"2020-02-24T02:47:00.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP and MR have been in a bad place for a while. The most cost efficient items are all AP (best stats and abilities for price).  And MR items are very limited.\n\nBefore riot can touch magic pen they need to fix ap and mr items.\n\nJust my two cents\n\n-whiteLight3r","replies":[{"poster":"Cis7v0","date":"2020-02-24T06:21:13.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot can't touch AP until {{champion:8}} and {{champion:81}} are addressed first. \n\nI can build armor and see a difference early game. i can build MR and see no difference early game. MR just sucks and has no real options. {{item:3065}}{{item:3102}}{{item:3111}} are the only MR items that I consistently see. Most MR items are just too specific with their passives to be used effectively, or people build {{item:3065}} and say fuck it, it's good enough.","replies":[]}]}]}
