He can't kill anyone with true of magic dmg, these are so he can't be destroyed by armor stacking; he has crap early game compared to Fiora, Trynda and Yasuo - who are all lane bullies vs melee. If they nerf Yi, there is literally no reason to pick him - he is played for his mid-late game hyperscaling.","replies":[{"poster":"Sozan5","date":"2015-07-11T14:43:13.472+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just looked up a few games, and the Magic and True damage values were actually way higher than I anticipated.\n\nIn most of the games the true damage Yi dealt was 15-25% of his total damage dealt... And magic damage was 10-20% (depending on how fast he could've gotten sated devourer apparently). That's up to 45% of his total damage being not physical, which I think is quite major.\n\nSurprisingly enough, it's not only for Yi either.\n\nVi had 13% magic damage with sated devourer.\nShaco and Shyvana had 50% magic damage with sated devourer (though, they have magic damage on their kit as well, so that's a thing to remember)\nXin had 22% magic damage with sated devourer (he have a minor magic damage on his E tho)\n\nIf we assume that Vi and Yi cases are accurate enough (since they don't have inherent magic damage), it means that around 15% of their damage is dealt by Devourer passive alone... And if we would be able to count the botrk procs and just the attack speed increase effect on physical damage as well... It looks pretty ugly for a 2250 gold item.\n\nThat said, the few games I played are not nearly enough to conclude anything.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fadedpf","date":"2015-07-11T06:41:14.898+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"They will probably gut or straight out delete it.
