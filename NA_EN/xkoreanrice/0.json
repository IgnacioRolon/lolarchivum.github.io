I&#039;ve also recently got a Wacom Tablet so been practicing on that. Been recently drawing a bunch of Gnar stuff, but theres one part about him that I&#039;m unfamiliar with. I&#039;ve seen all different kinds of Gnar fan art and there&#039;s always a split. Is the brown stuff around Gnar&#039;s upper chest/neck brown fur or a bunch of leaves/vegetation? With all the art I see, its either one or the other. The texturing on the 3D model kind of looks like fur, but I&#039;m not too sure... I&#039;d like to know what it really is. \r\n\r\nRiot or anyone who knows... halp?\r\n\r\n{{champion:150}}","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-02-24T16:32:57.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://na.merch.riotgames.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/570x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/i/m/image_50.png\n\nI have that plush, and the brown thing around his neck appears to be ornamental. He lacks it on his non-classic skins, so I reckon that it's some kind of fur shawl. After all, Gnar is a hunter in his own right.","replies":[{"poster":"xKoreanRice","date":"2016-02-24T17:12:11.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right! I totally disregarded the possibility of it being a Fur Shawl. Nice Catch! \n\nAs for it being absent on his other skins, I would argue that his whole upper body and neck is covered with clothing (Snow Day -> Scarf || Dino -> The Dino Onesie). When thinking about it, the scarf on Snow Day might even be the Fur Shawl Equivalent on his normal skin. I think a fur shawl is on the right track.

The plush has a bit of rope that ties behind Gnar's neck, which I think further reinforce the idea that it's an ornament. Whatever the brown thing is, it's definitely something he puts on.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
