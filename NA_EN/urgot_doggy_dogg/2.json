You taking Heal is better since a) You can now increase the heal value on your ADC by 10% and give the MR/Armor buff (thanks Windspeakers) and b) you use your own hp in fights and when it gets to teamfights this helps keep you alive to heal more and increases your burst heal potential tremendously.

Unlike most divers though, Wukong is more teamfight oriented due to the nature of his passive, E, W and Ult. the best tactic in a team fight is to go in with your E, use your Q on your chosen target and Ult so the rest of your team can follow up.

Thanks to this, he can blow his entire combo while he's dead, expect his lantern, which disappears upon death.\n\nIf a melee champ is hitting creeps, you can walk up the creep wave and flay them towards you, most times this puts the minions behind you for a real sneaky hook.\n\nThe new coin is great on Thresh. No seriously go build it.\n\nSSW is a bugged as shit skin that basically spazzes out when collecting souls, if you collect a soul while casting q or other abilities, it has no animation until the hook or whatever comes out at which point his arm bends backwards. Skin to win.\n\nThresh aa is not blocked by windwall.\n\nThresh q has some strange rules, while banshee veil and sivir passive block the hook entirely and prevent him following, morgana and malzahar passive does let him follow the hook, they will not, however, suffer any cc from the hook.\n\nThere is no range limit on hook tether, theoretically, Thresh could follow you from his fountain all the way to yours. \n\nWhile Thresh follows his q, he travels a set speed no matter the distance. So there may be time to walk around as he follows the hook. You can flash, dash, zhonyas, whatever during this time. You can even go under your tower during this time, bringing Thresh along with you.\n\nWhile in teamfights, repeatedly casting hook is great for cc, but most new players loss out of the disposition after the first one, if you dont intend to use it follow the hook, walk backwards with it so they dont end on top of you, wasting an effect of your q.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2016-07-05T16:54:19.480+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can cast spell steal and AT THE SAME TIME cast the last spell you stole before it is replaced with the other spell you stole, this allow you to steal 2 ulti in a fight instead of 1.

If you can intercept them mid journey, you can stun/stasis them partway through. This goes for you and your allies as well, so be careful of champions like Blitzcrank, who can hook you out of your tunnel.\n\nIf your ADC is kind enough to ask who you want to play with, request Caitlyn. She is safe enough to not die when you roam, you can stop people from bodyblocking her ult with Tempered Fate, and she can set up traps under the feet of golden enemies. Ashe is also good, as the combo of Ashe and Bard has god like pick potential.\n\nYour ult has a long travel time. As such, it is likely that, once you fire it, people like Zed, Zac, and Rumble will burn all their cooldowns trying to hit whatever you just turned into a statue. You will be blamed for this, even though they cast their spells after you. This is just a fact of life, prepare yourself for it.\n\nSpellthiefs is amazing on Bard, but coin has its place. First, if you suck at Bard, always start Coin until you learn to trade safely. Second, if the enemy teamcomp is full AD (especially snowbally AD's like Draven), start coin, since Talisman grants 45 armor now. Third, if you have a Stampede comp, the Talisman active is MUCH better than the Frost Queens active. So, if you have Hecarim jungle, Sivir ADC, and Karma mid against a team of 5 Zeds, you should probably start coin.\n\nBard is great against Jhin, because his ult negates curtain call. Jhin's ult gives away his exact position, which makes your ult much easier to land.\n\nIf you have a ludens echo, you can proc thunderlords in one meep empowered hit.  Never underestimate the power of Thunderbard.\n\nMeeps remove Banshees veil and all other spell shields.\n\nMeeped attacks proc both onhit and spell effects. This is the same deadly combination that allows Fizz and Evelynn to kill squishies with a single button press, and one should not underestimate a Bard with Rapidfire Cannon and Ludens Echo.\n\nWhen you rank up your shrines, existing shrines are upgraded.\n\nIf you intend on playing Bard in ranked, you should buy a skin. On the basic Bard skin, there is hardly any difference between a prepared shrine and a newly placed shrine. On both of Bards skins, it is extremely clear when a shrine is prepared.\n\nUlting your own team is a valid means of baiting the enemy. DO NOT DO THIS IN SOLO QUEUE.\n\nalt-W can be used to instantly heal and speed yourself.\n\nPets and clones can go through magical journey. Combo with a Mordekaiser to send a dragon flying at mach 5 into the enemy team.\n\nTempered Fate goes through allied spell immunity. Just in case your Malzahar is a dick.\n\nIf neither team is going to invade (you can tell from team comps most often), start W, set up 1 shrine at your junglers first camp and two in lane (or just 3 in lane if you have an Elise or Shaco), and then recall for mana.\n\nI like to take a second point in my heal before maxing Q. There is a big difference between having 210 health in reserve and having 330 health in reserve.\n(personal preference).\n\nBard has shit AP ratios on Q and Passive, so don't run AP runes. Attack speed, Attack damage, Hybrid penetration, Movement speed, or just tank stats are all better alternatives.\n\nAgainst lane bullies, divers, and Blitzcrank, take meditation in your masteries. You will be forced to spend a lot of mana on heals, and will not have many opportunities to run into the jungle to recoup mana with chimes, since your ADC will likely die without your presence. Otherwise, dangerous game will save your ass quite often.\n\nBard's E can be cast on the sides of the map just outside of your base in top and bot lane. \n\nOn Treeline, if the enemy doesn't draft a tank, Bard can be a nasty little fucker with this build.\n {{item:3285}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3090}} {{item:3100}}","replies":[{"poster":"SerBlaise","date":"2016-07-05T17:23:19.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"swag! this makes me want to try bard.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The 2nd Horseman","date":"2016-07-05T16:07:43.309+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:105}}: Free Fucking wins, I don't care how brain dead, what build you use, or if you give someone first blood. \nYou are Fizz, fuck the red team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jewish and Smexy","date":"2016-07-05T15:51:33.589+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:412}} Your Lantern acts as a structure and if thrown in the right spot like between a tower and a wall it can change the pathing of a fleeing enemy and allow for easier hooks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ltmetal","date":"2016-07-05T14:12:47.975+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:131}} \n-Always take at least 12 points in Resolve for increased shield gain and reduced flash cooldown.\n-You can animation cancel your E channel with flash.

People almost ALWAYS dodge backwards, even when it's not the fastest way out of his zone.\n-Last hits are great for your shield passive, but you really don't need to take that early, the first 2 or even 3 levels won't contain enough CS for it to make a major difference. If you feel like you have a real chance to bully, two points in your q doesn't hurt.\n-If they interrupt your Q channel, you get it back with most of the CD refunded, don't just back off if they stop it. Your q will be back before their next interrupt.\n-If you just instant cast q without charging, it will hit max range for min damage.

It does the most damage if you can hit all three rings as they walk away after the trade. \n-Hooking yourself back into lane is a fantastic way to practice the max range of the hook. It's deceptively long range. \n-CDR gives more damage than AP. \n-When your shield is on, you apply a DOT in an aoe around whatever you AA. It stings, and if you last hit an enemy minion to apply the dot, you won't draw minion aggro. Combine with E to punish an enemy melee champ for last hitting. \n-When your ult hits anything, it pulls them towards you a small amount. It doesn't matter if it's the detonation or just the pathway knockup. Both pull forward. The distance is enough to pull them over thin walls, like at Dragon/Baron pit.\n\nOther tips\nUrgot Doggy Dogg -shield reset his aa","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valeckserai","date":"2016-07-05T18:35:30.084+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:30}} \nDeath Defiled: this is what allows you to build him as a full ap glass cannon and still get to participate in teamfights after you dive in and are bursted down. This automatically activates defile and will do good damage to anyone that stays on top of you. It only keeps you around for 7 seconds, meaning you have time to cast q twice (unless you've built in cdr) before you are unable to cast your ultimate, as if you wait until there are less than the three seconds required to channel your ult it will lock the skill out and you won't be able to use it until you resurrect. Keep in mind that this is the safest time to ult as it is impossible for the enemies to interrupt it.\n\nLay Waste: your most important skill (max this first), use it to farm and harass in early levels. Try to set it up on the edge of a group of minions to get all of the damage onto just one of them, as it will double the damage and make it much easier to farm without wasting mana. If you hit a single enemy champion with this, then it will prod the full effect of deathfire touch. Try to remember what directions your opponents like to dodge in. Once you have {{item:3070}}  or {{item:3010}} (I build both on him), it will be easy to throw out your q just to test their reaction without having to worry about wasting mana. Once you determine how they dodge, try to place your q in that direction so it hits them anyways. Once you've built your fist full item (usually {{item:3027}}) you can use this ability to push the wave incredibly hard, and force the opponent to farm under tower for most of the game. MAKE SURE YOU DON'T OVERESTIMATE YOUR ABILITIES IF YOU DO THIS. If their jungler is a bursty assassin or has lots of cc this is incredibly dangerous as it forces you to be by their tower a lot and you are squishy as hell. If the enemy is pushed under tower you can also use this to hit them and run out of turret range before it fires on you due to the long range and delayed explosion.\n\nWall of Pain: many people underestimate this ablity (but you still max it last), but the MR shred and slow that it provides can be the difference in winning a duel, teamfight, or in catching an enemy that would have gotten away if your ult is down. The mana cost in early game is outrageous so use it sparingly if at all until you have a decent mana pool built up. You need to know both your damage output on the enemy and theirs on you before using this in a duel. You only get to use this ONCE per duel due to the cooldown and you need to decide between putting it right on top of them after they engage to get more damage onto them, or in blocking their escape so that they can't try and run away. If you're ahead then its probably better to block the escape rout as you have enough damage in your q and e to kill them most likely. If you're even, put it on top of them to get all the damage onto them that you can. You can also use this when pushing turrets by placing it on the far side of the turret so enemies are cautious of approaching  you, potentially allowing you to kill the turret or run away before they engage you under it.\n\nDefile: the active and passive are both amazing on this abilty (max it second). The passive allows you to regain mana every time you kill anything, which lets you farm with your q without depleting your mana entirely. If you kill minions with just auto attacks (which is not fun, his autos suck) then you can regain tons of mana. The active costs lots of mana, but if you build both {{item:3027}}  and {{item:3040}} then you can keep it around for a long time. Its best to use the active in all ins or for when you're trying to escape from enemies. Keep mele opponents at the edge of the circle so that you are dealing damage to them but they aren't dealing damage to you.\n\nRequiem: always check the map whenever this is up, look for all ins or for enemies that just barely escaped. NEVER use this in the middle of your lane, try to use it under tower, at base, or when you are dead. This has a SUPER long cooldown and you need to make sure every time you use it that it makes a difference.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheAlabrehon","date":"2016-07-05T08:08:40.249+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:77}} : Your E lets you go trough units.

Use it at a time when the enemy adc (or their support) is focus on getting their Cs. The best way to get the max damage of her Q is to wait for a minion who is low that they are standing behind. Using your Q will then cause it to crit the person behind them, or just causes more damage because of her passive (love tap). If the enemy team has  {{champion:40}} try to tease her shield. When it's on cooldown use your Q on a minion to get to her adc. She can't heal them back like {{champion:16}} or {{champion:37}}.

More damage towards her because of love tap.\n\nDon't spam her e (make it rain) it uses way too much mana.

He will have more power than you give him credit for, even if you're a little ahead.\n\nW: Passively gives him attack speed. Also contributes to him being able to win trades/duels that people may not expect him to be able to, but the real punch is that this attack speed bonus is doubled for a few seconds after blocking an ability with the spell shield. Try to block CC abilities after using E to 1. keep them from escaping tether range and 2. grant you more attack speed while they're feared.\n\nE: It's a tethered ability, so NOTHING breaks it except leaving range. If you get it off, it can be used through {{champion:105}} e, {{item:3157}}, etc. It's also useful for stopping channeled abilities, such as {{champion:9}} W, {{champion:55}} R, and {{champion:90}} R (The tether also lasts long enough that it can be used to pop his passive, have it expire and apply the fear after CC immunity wears off)  Max this 2nd; it increases the fear duration.\n\nR: Stopping vision is a much more powerful tool than it gets credit for. It can be used to stop (or at least make considerably more difficult) Baron and Dragon steals.

When {{champion:56}} gets on top of somebody squishy and/or immobile, it's very difficult for them to kite him out on their own (I've even been able to keep up with {{champion:429}}), which is why I prefer to follow champions that can lock down entire teams. \n\nAs a {{champion:56}}, if you can you want to dive the ADC, use R > Q (you can use this while still in flight during your ult) > E. Use your W intelligently after the ult and early during the E channel to block some of the CC that will come in and get the attack speed boost.

Most enemies won't expect it. Just be sure you kill them or at least push them out if you do this or you wasted your ignite and you don't have your E which is very useful.\n\nYou can win almost any lane as Aatrox by simply focusing on poking them down and out-sustaining them. Play kinda like Nasus. Only fight when you know you have the advantage and focus very hard on farming. Get ganks from your jungler and get ahead and then no one can fight you. Aatrox plays a lot like Nasus. Just farm. He scales incredibly well with Attack Speed and Lifesteal so Botrk is almost always my first item on him followed by a defensive item (Spirit Visage if I'm ahead or against an AP, Sunfire or DMP if I'm even or behind against an AD.)

Using flash ever so slightly before E can catch the enemy team off guard when you just instantly blink into them from a very long distance away and blow up a squishy real fast and chunk the rest of the team with your AoE abilities, although you probably will sacrifice your life to do so unless your team follows up VERY quickly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Urgot doggy dogg","date":"2016-07-05T19:28:57.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"guys please more likes i don't want this thread to fade away it is so useful","replies":[]},{"poster":"21 shiny nickels","date":"2016-07-05T18:40:23.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you use Lucian's Ult and then get eaten by an ally Tahm Kench, Lucian's Ult will still be in effect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hella Kaiser","date":"2016-07-05T18:08:48.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:82}} always hue","replies":[]}]}
