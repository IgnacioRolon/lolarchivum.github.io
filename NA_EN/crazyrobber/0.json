RIOT killed this game","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"Just wanted to say, I&#039;ve played this game for a few years, but just can&#039;t do anymore. Balance of champions in this game is just a joke. Some champions are overpowered, some completly useless. For example, what is point to play ADC this days??? Adc is weakest position, easiest to kill in this game, have no crowd control, so that is why adc should have oustanding damage right? But it don&#039;t,  right now, every other position is as much OP as adc. Every tank kills adc, every mid champion kills adc, every jungler kills adc. Only thing that adc&#039;s have today is fighting on distance, which is not even advantage, because so many chanmpion can easly jump, stun, etc etc and kill adc. ADC is got nothing, is got low HP and no defences, nothing else.\r\nThis is only example.\r\nWhy tanks are so OP? The only thing that tanks should have is DEFENCES, so loads of HP, armor and mag res. But RIOT decided to make tank&#039;s unstoppable. No other lane can beat tank in 1vs1 fight.\r\n\r\nAnother thing : almost every character now is got slows, stuns, etc etc.. So logicly, characters without crowd control should be more powerfull then others. But Riot decided to give some of characters with CC decent damage too, making them overpowered. No point to play character without CC today as well. Useless\r\n\r\nEvery champion is got his unique skills, some of them useless as well, but some of them really good (example Yasuo, Zed, master YI). Yasuo should not have that much damage then!!! Its logic, ZED shouldn&#039;t have that much damage! Yi shouldn&#039;t have that much damage, and few others!!! Champions with really good skills should have less damage!! But RIOT don&#039;t see the problem, that in every single game we can see someone playing Yasuo, Zed, Yi and few others (exeption when they got banned before game)\r\n\r\nBye bye riot, happy to say, i have had enough. I used to love this game, but you ruined it. This game right now is completly unfair.\r\nGood job RIOT, thanks for few years of fun, (joke). I will make sure that, i will never play RIOT game anymore, amators","replies":[]}
