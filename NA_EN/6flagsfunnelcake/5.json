By that they mean; Instead of trying to find a whole new, more appealing thematic (As seen by characters like {{champion:6}} {{champion:3}} and now {{champion:50}}), they are going to instead expand on Akali's current thematic, as seen by, well, {{champion:41}}.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I am HOPING this means we get an Ionia lore event with Akali's rework (mind you, Bilgewater came alongside Gangplank!), but I have a little request regarding Akali's lore in general.\r\nPLEASE OH PLEASE keep her 'complicated' relationship with Zed and the Order of Shadows. It's mentioned by some Rioters that Zed once had a 'Favorite student' who left the Order, noting on Akali's title as \"Fist of Shadow\" and her passive \"Twin Disciplines.\" Along with that, it's heavily hinted at that they might've been ex lovers as well!\r\nNow I hope Riot keeps that aspect of her and makes it a KEY ASPECT of her lore for a few reasons. For one, it adds a whole new dynamic between the Shen and Zed. Maybe Zed hates Shen even more for practically stealing his favorite student from him? Along with that, it adds a neat dynamic between AKALI AND KAYN, I'd imagine they wouldn't get along too well either. Kayn could be jealous of Akali's high status in the Order, or see her as a traitor to the Order, while Akali can see Kayn as a fool and warns him to leave the order.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2018-02-01T17:45:15.908+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to be clear the comparison to Gangplank as I understand it was the idea of continuing Akali's story, sort of a _Chapter 2_, instead of rewriting it completely.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-02-01T17:53:09.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So is she intended to be older than she is in game?

In the narrative piece Riot did with Zed, Shen, and Jhin, Akali was there.\n\nAkali and Shen was investigating a scene that was supposedly caused by Jhin.  When Akali said she wanted to see, Shen stopped her saying that she's not ready.  Why? Cause HE wasn't ready at her age.\n\nWhich means she is as young now as Zed and Shen were when they first met Jhin, so I don't think she'll be older unless they hit \"fast forward\" on her.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-01-31T22:48:56.493+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nah, they mean that they will try to kill Akali in an explosion, but she will survive as a ciborg ninja.","replies":[{"poster":"Enderspider","date":"2018-01-31T23:08:57.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"also she has a metal arm she doesn't use and she can use barrels to dash to with her ult","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alex Luu","date":"2018-02-01T08:12:08.649+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with everything except the \"ex-lovers\" thing, a mentor/disciple bond is usually hazy and seen as love but isn't in actuality.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-01-31T23:37:44.653+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind they were saying that they want to expand on her narrative(instead of replacing it),they didn't say that akalis thematic is fine the way it is.\nThey even said that they are going to add some unique elements to her thematic,so while she is gonna keep her theme,they will be adding at least one more theme on top of that.\n\nAlso you are essentially saying that the dynamic between Akali and Zed is key to Akalis lore,even though this was never confirmed to be really the case.\n\nAnd on a side note:\nI actually don't think Swain really got a new thematic.\nThey just rebalanced the aspects of his current thematics,downplaying the ravens and strategist theme,while emphasizing on the dictator and warlock theme.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nintendo 3DS","date":"2018-02-02T14:47:59.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm. On Jhin story she seemed way younger than both Shen & Zed. Shen mentions she has about the same age he had when he was still a disciple of the Kinkou. Its also mentionned she entered the Kinkou at 14 and following the narrative, she doesnt seems that much more older.\nSo a romance is a total no-go IMO, be it with Shen or Zed. It was heavily hinted as well she might have been a student of Zed (probably for a short period of time) so she *really* seems too young to be ex-lovers with any on the twos. Even the \"growth and change\" give it away. She's really young.\nDon't know why there would be a need to put romance in Akali's story, it really doesn't suit her.\n\nIt could be really good if they do confirm she was indeed part of Zed{{champion:238}}  order though. It had an interesting twist, a character treading on the two lines of ennemies orders. Just imagine the potential it could have.\nIt can open doors on both the visions of the Kinkous & the Order of Shadow. Plus it fit well with her Twin Disciples passive and the Shadow dance ult. (thematically, since the gameplay is going to change)\n\nI've always wanted to see how a character who has seen both sides of two enemies factions could be like.\nIf i remember good, there isn't one like that yet ? From a lore standpoint, that sound pretty great. \nAkali as a double-disciple. Or, she learned about the Order of Shadows techniques and use them inside the Kinkou.\nAlso might explain why, out of the three Kinkous, only she wants Zed dead. She really seems to know him *personnally.*\n\nAlso. While i agree the others two Kinkous could be good for her story, i really want Akali to be \"herself\". As in, not definied by Shen{{champion:98}}  or Kennen{{champion:85}} . On Shen story they barely mention Kennen or Akali. It could be logical that she too deserve to be a character on her own. Akali old lore just talk about how she is part of the Kinkou and that's all.\nThe \"tale of growth and change\" really was intriguing. If anything, it does mean we will see more of her very own parcours. I can't wait !\nEven in her rare apparitions/portrayal, she seemed more like \"i am part of the Kinkou but don't always work with the other, all i do is killing when needed\". Maybe we will need to truly determinate how the triumvate function. If they still have the \"Judge, Jury and Executionner\" (i believe Akali is the Executionner) pattern, or if they are actually quite detached from one another. Seems like a mix. They just work when needed without much interactions with each others. On Shen and Kennen in-client short bio though, they mention Kennen is Shen's disciple who accompagnies him in the spirit realm.\nWhere Akali seemed more like a loner, who kills the treats against balance all by herself.\n\nI suppose for the personnality, they'll keep (but deepens) the original Akali : ruthless, a bit emotionless, executing her duties and with a big capacity for violence & cruauty. It would just be even more explored, giving her a real and well set persona.\n\nAnd finally i'd like to have her getting a few interactions with Irelia ?{{champion:39}}  We've got two Ionians combattants getting reworked closely, its impossible they wouldn't give them even the tiniest of links ? Both have been pretty detached from the rest of the cast in their lores, it could be the *perfect* occasion to give it something.\n\nAnd finally, if we go with the \"student from Zed order\" path, i could see Akali *despising* Kayn{{champion:141}} . (the contrary could be true as well) ~~Kayn's so arrogant it would do him good to have a character who clashes with him directly for once~~ When you think about it, they represent all the other wouldn't stand. Kayn is pretentious and always bragging, Akali who is said to be violent and executing her duties without questions would probably find him a waste of air. And if Akali was this \"favorite student\" who left the order, wouldn't Kayn be extremely jealous of her ? Kayn is the best student, but he isn't said to be the favorite. (Swain interaction even hints there is no love from his master to him) I can see him being quite jealous of her. They are probably close in age as well.\n\nThat's all for now, its pretty long but i really like Akali and i was a bit suprised her rework might come so soon.\n\n~~I've had a theory that Akali was Zed long lost daughter but thats for another time~~","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-02-01T00:06:14.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">  Along with that, it's heavily hinted at that they might've been ex lovers as well!\n\nIn what way was that supported?\n\nIt's weird that they say GP kept his theme.

I'm not particularly optimistic that Shen or Kennen are required to have their own stories during the re-release.

All things considered, to still think any new release will come with some kind of regional LU is a bit naive.\n\nIdeally even Zoe could have herald some further lore updating of Targon but the art update was sufficient substitute, however if that wasn't available then her release would have been all the same as the others.
