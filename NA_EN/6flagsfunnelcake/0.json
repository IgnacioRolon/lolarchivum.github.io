The fact that she fears the Watchers so much and is so active in keeping them imprisoned only emphasizes how big of a threat they are, maybe even as the *true* &#039;big-bad&#039; of League&#039;s universe.","replies":[{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2018-08-21T06:34:07.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Isn't this the exact definition of an anti-hero?
