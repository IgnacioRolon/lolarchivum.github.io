Someone said maps, so here I am :)\n\nTo answer your first question, I feel _very_ strongly about maps.  Love them, love poring over them, examining them, making them, finding them referenced elsewhere, imagining myself travelling their ways, etc.\n\nI think you may have misinterpreted (or been misinformed) on our current stance on maps, however - we _are_ looking to make and release more maps in the future (as fast as I can get them to you - which is frustratingly slowly).  \n\nWhat you may have heard was that it was unlikely we were going to drop a full, scientifically-accurate, world map in the near future.  That's still true, but the success of the Medarda Heirloom has meant that internally Riot is getting a better understanding of how important maps are to players like us.  There are quite a few map fans in the office, but without data, it's hard to prove that it's not just a few dozen nerdy Rioters who love maps ;)\n\nI agree that a map is a fantastic tool for conveying world information and relationships, and every time I do a search for \"Runeterra map\" and I see the old, non-canon, map, I feel sad.  Working on having something else pop up in those search results instead, but it may be quite a while. :/","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2017-06-05T22:37:45.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the R&D mistress herself work on an official map of Runeterra?

Its where the worshipers of Rammus do their yearly rolling through the streets.  It's where Nasus finally stopped his rampaging brother - because burning the ancient city's library was a step too far.  It even has its own (fake) [sun disc](http://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/region/shurima/?mv=visions-of-shurima)!","replies":[{"poster":"Darrosh Jewfist","date":"2017-06-05T23:18:56.794+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Would you mind giving me a bit more insight into why the Medarda map disappointed you/pissed you off so much?\n\nIt annoys me because when I look at this map, and I see the overload of details and no-name places. These places have no consequence. They don't matter. They're there really just as filler - to fill up the map. To copy paste examples from r/worldbuilding, it reminds me a lot of these.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/UyZP7Kz\nhttps://i.redd.it/v4hq2om65n9y.jpg\nhttp://imgur.com/a/oZJlc\nhttp://imgur.com/a/x96WW\n\nTo me, there's really no difference between Riot's maps here and the ones made by amateurs. It's EASY to get excited and make an overly detailed map and go wild adding random locations without any intention of actually fleshing them out later. They're just names on a piece of paper that exists nowhere but in name. They don't have an identify or an existence. They're just there to make the map look fuller and cooler.\n\nThe biggest difference between a map like the ones I linked and say, a map of Westeros, is that Westeros' world is intimately fleshed out either by movie, shows, books, whatever. Each region and culture in GoT is clearly defined and stories are centered around these locations with characters that progress and interact.\n\nLeague simply doesn't have that right now.\n\nI remember a friend telling me it's pretty common to talk what-if scenarios in Westeros. What if the North and Vale joined in an alliance against the South or whatever. All these armchair logistical discussions. They're fun because there's a plethora of backing that makes the map meaningful from books to stories or appendices. You can talk population densities, where major centers of trade and castles are, and fighting styles... \n\nYou can't do that in League simply because hell, we don't even have a full map of Runeterra.\n\nIf you ask any avid watcher/reader of GoT and talk about the Westerlands or the North, they'll have a pretty good idea of what you're talking about. If I talked about Urzeris or some random location on the map, even the more ardent League lore-nut would be tough to describe what it's like there. Compare that to how fleshed out Last Hearth, White Harbor and Dreadfort is from Game of Thrones both in terms of fanart, fanfiction, discussions, and etc... Then you realize these are relatively minor settlements compared to High Garden, Casterly Rock, King's Landing and think how well those cities are fleshed out.\n\nSo when I see a map like the Medarda map, I kind of see of it as pointless. I know nothing about this region. I care nothing for it. **Nothing outside of Piltover really matters**. \n\n> From what you write here, it sounds like you'd have preferred the map not to have any locations mentioned, except for Piltover? That might be the wrong way to interpret what you wrote. I know Psyrix has mentioned that there are several locations on the map that have been referenced in other contexts (bios, color stories, short stories, and VO) but that's not the sort of thing you were looking for, it seems.\n\nName-dropping a place doesn't exactly flesh it for me. I noticed in the newer lores, there's a lot more adjectives and name dropping. Taric's example come to mind.\n\n> _He saw the Alabaster Library engulfed in pitch and flame, and still he dashed into the roiling inferno to retrieve the poetry of Tung. He screamed in rage as the Frostguard ran the last dreamstag off a blind cliff, and then leapt into the abyss himself in a desperate attempt to save it._\n\nThis is a problem that's consistently seen in League lore. Stuff gets name-dropped and means pretty much nothing. There's no appendix or wikia to tell me what the Tung are or what a dreamstag is. The Frostguard barely have enough on the wikia to warrant their own section and they share their page with the rest of Freljord.\n\nI would much prefer a story that centers on a specific town or hamlet that gives insight to the culture.\n\nThe big problem with this is that this is how it can backfire like it has already happened in Lux's story. The region isn't highlighted at all. The town was Terbisia (had to look it up) and we really know nothing about it except it has walls, got struck with an earthquake and thats it. \n\nGranted, the story is supposed to center on Lux's character but you could honestly replace Terbisia with the city of Demacia herself and the story would gain or lose absolutely nothing. I've learned nothing about Terbisia anyways or its people or its culture.\n\nI think an actually good ( but not great) example in League of providing cultural context is in Jhin's lore.\n\nWe hear he's part of a traveling performing troupe and he goes to different places. What's also helpful is that this gives us an idea of the culture in Ionia. We get to see what mere mortals do - they like watching theatre performances and doing festivals. We know they like Blossom Festivals. That sticks with me because it's better than whatever the heck Trebisia was described as.\n\nAnd this helps me better understand Ionia. If there was a map of Ionia, as I see the Jyom Pass, I could imagine the people there having festivals and celebrating. This is what they do in the course of their daily life. I can imagine the possibilities of other festivals because there is documented examples of the Blossom Festival already.\n\nNow, when I see a map of Ionia, instead of just thinking of a somewhat racist asian-inspired caricature in my head, I can imagine the citizentry in their towns celebrating festivals watching plays.\n\n> Am I to understand that, for any map released in the future, you would hope would have an accompanying short-story/encyclopedia entry and illustration for each location labelled? That would probably mean that future maps would be very sparse in locations mentioned due to the time required for getting all that to player-facing quality and approval.\n\nIf the released lores are any indication of playing-facing quality, I'm not holding out for much. A lot of Riot's written lore pieces sound purply, excessive use of adjectives, and sometimes feel roundabout.\n\nI do think a short-story encyclopedia entry/illustration for each location would be massively helpful. Granted League isn't an MMO, but World of Warcraft did wonders for fleshing out its world. It's ridiculously detailed. You could look up Northshire, Goldshire, Darkshire... and that's just within the Kingdom of Stormwind. You can read on Westfall and all the struggles of individual places. Just from the name you can get an idea of the culture and the fact you can visit these locations in game is a huge boon (one that League might struggle to imitate like an MMO does).\n\n> Can you show me an example of a good map, one that you hold up as an example of what you would want to see Riot do in the future? Not to say that we would follow it, but often it can be easier to understand with a visual aid :D\n\nReally, the only difference between a good map and a bad map is what those things represent. If you showed a Warhammer (or 40k) fan a map of the Old World or the Five Segmentums, they can intimately tell you of each different region. From the Elector-Princes of the Empire to Britannia or the Realm of Ultramar and Cadia and Fenris. All these places mean something on the map.\n\nThey're not specks of nothing that serve as space-filler like the Medarda map.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-06-06T05:08:24.622+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kokoboto just called me out for over-complicating my responses - so I’m going to be super straight-up here.\n \nFirst off - those maps you’re referencing have places on them that weren’t detailed when they were first released.  \n \nThere are places on Tolkien’s map that aren’t featured destinations in Lord of the Rings.  \n \nWorld of Warcraft - well that’s fair.  They had several prior games and then released an MMORPG where any location on the map was a location you could visit in the game (with quests and characters and stuff).  Fair call on that one. \n \nWarhammer Fantasy?  Pretty sure that first edition’s map (1983) was full of locations that weren’t used yet - before their first novels in 1989 there were just offhand mentions in rulebook fluff.\n \nPlaces shown on the first two maps from A Song of Ice and Fire book 1, that aren’t mentioned, never mind visited.  Now, of course, George R.R. Martin does eventually reference and visit a whole tonne of places on those maps and they’re usually of critical, military and political, importance.  But in book one - who the hell knows anything about Dorne other than it’s on the Southern map?\n \nBut let’s ignore the examples and discuss the problem - there are places on the map that you don’t believe we’ll ever actually flesh out.\n \n**That is a legit fear, tbh.**\n \nStory/worldbuilding releases are slow - and nowhere near the speed or depth that releasing an MMO, or an epic novel, would achieve.  You don’t have faith, and that is your right.  Hell, it’s possible that we never will - even if we had whole wikis full of backstory and detail, some messed up confluence of crap could mean it never actually got released.\n \nAnd I’ll level with you - there are some places on the map that don’t have details.\n \nNow, that’s not because we don’t want to detail the cultures and stuff of each and every location (I’d love to do that) - it’s because this is a living universe, and folks are bloody terrified of limiting themselves in the future.\n \nTolkien and Martin - each a one man writing machine, beholden to no-one but themselves.  They had easy mode - no collaborators, and clear release schedules.  \n \nWorld of Warcraft is a better comparison - lots and lots of devs trying to keep everything right - except even then you see when they want to add some new content, they usually either **blow up the whole damn world**, or add a new continent.  Because whenever you really flesh out a place, it’s hard as hell to add more to it in the future.\n \nExcuses?  Absolutely!\n \nSo where does that leave us.  \n \nIt leaves us releasing maps with room to grow - it means that champs will casually name drop locations that another dev can run with later.  It means that _even since the Medarda Heirloom map was released_, writers have written characters having rich experiences, and artists have drawn concepts, of what was previously just a dot on the map with a name.\n\nIt’s like that game of D&D you mentioned - except instead of us telling the players that they need to go on a quest to Tereshni to rescue who the hell cares, it means that players have looked at the map, seen Tereshni on it, and when later on they follow the clues in the murder and discover that the shapeshifter has fled to a city of terraces that burns red in the sunrise from the intricate glass momento mori mosaics on every flat surface, they know where to go; a city with an unhealthy appreciation for death, three strictly chaperoned and veiled courting festivals a year, and ritualized mortification feasts with food so spicy that it can lead to fever, vomiting and unconsciousness.\n \nIs that Tereshni?  Not in the canon.  It may never be - but we’ve got the chance to show you what it is in the future (and with much more skill than my little crappy example above).\n \nNow, you probably hate this answer.  That’s fair.  It has confirmed your suspicion that there _are_ places on the map just for the sake of having places.\n \nI just would like you to keep in mind (even if you’re disappointed) that\n\n* It’s no worse than several of the examples you gave, \n* We do have more information on many of the places, and that \n* It is done with the _intention_ of visiting. Every. Single. One.  of them and bringing them to life as deeply as you find in other settings.  \n \nThat might take a long time, and it might never happen - but we honestly, really, hope to do so.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-06-06T22:49:01.644+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bio.

Some folks will just decide that it's taken too much time, and cut their losses.  Other folks may decide that they like where things are going, and hang around.  Some people might leave, and then return when things are further along.\n\nYou have the power here to decide what is or is not acceptable to you, obviously.\n\nStuff is being worked on, at a pace which is increasing.  Its up to you whether you find that pace acceptable, but I can't change the speed at which changes are made.  \n\nI'm not asking you for more time - you have to decide whether you want to 'give' the lore that time or not.\n\n\nAs for the terror of limits - oh I'm right with you!  As a level designer, I live for design constraints spurring me to novel and inventive solutions.  As a player, I want to have a reasonable level of trust that what I want to emotionally invest in isn't about to become Barbie: Fish and Spell overnight.  \n\n**I agree with you**.\n\nImagine for a moment, though, that there was an institutionalized fear that has came from exactly the things you're talking about; the backlash from the retcon, the Trundle situation, etc.  You could argue that the wrong lessons were learned - that what was learned was \"If you don't define it, then no-one will mind if you change it in the future\".\n\nWhat I'm trying to do is massage away that fear - convince folks that, as long as deep thoughtful consideration is given to decisions and their future impacts, we are not adversely limiting our creative options in the future - and instead we are inspiring them!  But it's not just a single Rioter who is suffering from this burnt-fingers feeling - it's a gestalt cultural wariness that new Rioters learn without even knowing why they're learning it.  I'm also far from the only Rioter who is trying to push us to a more confident world building attitude.

I know the expectations are crooked, but the reality is that these are League's direct competitors. These are giant franchises with legendary universes which I feel League could definitely match up to.\n\nI feel a lot of your points are summed up as basically 'things take time, trust us'. I understand things take time, but the only things I can see, criticize, and comment on are stuff that's out there. I don't know what's behind the scenes. I also don't feel it's an adequate excuse. It sounds deflective, like 'Oh woe is me! You don't know how hard it is!' And I'm here thinking 'but this is your job...?'\n\nYour main point:\n\n> But let’s ignore the examples and discuss the problem - there are places on the map that you don’t believe we’ll ever actually flesh out.\n\nIs absolutely spot on. It's hard for me to trust Riot and give it more time, why?\n\n* TIME\n\nThe Retcon was in 2013. It's been 4 years since then. **Four.** And still Brand's lore still has League of Legends in it.\n\nhttp://gameinfo.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/brand/\n\n> _Overcome by Demacian forces, he was given a choice: fight within the confines of the League or die. Naturally, he chose to use his destructive powers in the League, for now..._\n\nRiot has had FOUR years of TIME?\n\nMy thinking is basically, you guys (who seem to work via consensus and extensive collaboration) haven't been able to, at the very absolutely minimum, update all the released champions lore to reflect retcon changes after FOUR years? It screams either incompetence or inefficiency to me.\n\nI'm not asking for short stories. I'm not asking for long bios.\n\nI'm asking that all the champions are on board with this retcon.\n\nLike, it looks like total amateur hour. That we STILL need to talk about a retcon that's ongoing **four years later.**\n\n* TRUST\n\nThen you throw in how many events you've had in that time where you've basically ping-ponged over the place. Let's go to Bilgewater! Then Shurima! Then Bilgewater again! Shadow Isles maybe! Piltover-Zaun next! Vastayah! _Yeah!_\n\nI appreciate the events, but they're infrequent and inconsistently released. We have no idea when to expect the next big Demacia/Noxus update or whatever hypothetical update. It could literally hit PBE next week or in 3 months and neither would surprise me.\n\nAnd sure, people will care. They flounder back. Then after the event is said and done they slowly start to leave again until the next big event in 3+ months.\n\nBecause the stuff that's out there is shallow, quickly consumed, and people have nothing to latch onto. Engaging story lines mean nothing if they can ignored for literally years.\n\nSo how can I TRUST Riot when they haven't went back to the Freljord to the War of Three Sisters Event in like 5 years? There's definitely a history of starting some engines and then dropping them like a rock and moving onto the next thing.\n\n* IN SUMMARY\n\nThe TIME and TRUST issues goes into why the map pisses me off. The map just looks cool. It means nothing and judging by past experiences most of the places will never mean anything to the playerbase (simply because the content will never see public consumption). And if it does one day will mean something, it could take years at the rate releases of new lore is going.\n\nThe map serves only to look cool momentarily, like so many maps on r/worldbuilding made by amateur and teenagers.\n\nIf you're trying to ask for more TIME, I see a still incomplete retcon.

But we, the fanbase, have heard that before... the Great Retcon.\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/dev-blog-exploring-runeterra\n\n> Furthermore, the very idea of all-powerful Summoners made Champions little more than puppets manipulated by godlike powers. **The background we’d created to explain in-game action was ultimately restricting the potential narrative development of the game’s defining characters.**\n\nSo Riot wanted freedom from the League because it's restrictive (and now the IoW and LoL is retconned) but now Riot is **terrified of committing to details** because it could possibly restrict them in the future?\n\nI don't know what to say about that.","replies":[{"poster":"Beyond Legends","date":"2017-06-06T09:06:42.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't see why that's a problem.

League of Legends was released in 2009. that's been 8 years since then (barring the retcon). At this point and time for the Warcraft Franchise (First game in 1994) they were releasing Warcraft 3 in 2002. And let me tell you, Warcraft 3 was hella engaging in both the world, story AND characters. Hell, characters introduced then are still mainstays of current Warcraft like Arthas, Illidan, Tyrande. Warcraft has had its share of retcons as well but it's still truckin'. The devs aren't pausing development to mope around and go 'oh noes!'\n\nStarcraft got released with an expansion pack back-to-back years.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls franchise first game came out in 1994, 8 years later they're on Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and by then it's already a fairly well known RPG franchise.\n\nAll these universes are established. They're strong and have a distinct and patented universe.\n\nSo this stuff JRRTolkein didn't build LotR in a day just seems like bullshit to me. Other companies have made much more effective use of their time and didn't go into some (but it taaaakes tiiiimee) pity rant to keep re-assuring themselves they'll get there.\n\nThey released genre-defining products.\n\nI just don't accept the apologist arguments from posters. A lot of posters will come here and say  \"but dude, chill out and give Riot some time/be patient/stop being salt.\" Bruh. They've gotten four years and can't even finish a retcon they themselves started? \n\nIT'S LITERALLY UPDATING TEXT FILES ON A WEBSITE TO REMOVE MENTIONS OF 'LEAGUE OF LEGENDS' OR 'INSTITUTE OF WAR'.\n\nIf that doesn't scream incompetence or amateur hour to you, I don't know what to say.

They could, in theory, make a singleplayer/co-op PvE mode if they decide to but I doubt that's possible given all the tech debt they've accumulated with spaghetti code.\n\nBesides, the lore team has shown creativity before with introducing the Bilgewater map for ARAM and banning GP for a week.

If you were to do a map of the Freljord, for instance, I would be stoked to see Braum's home town labeled/referenced. Its the little details like that which give a world it's verisimilitude and leave us invested in it. This works because I know how braum has affected his community thanks to \"Tomb of the Troll Boy\" so i'm invested in that location. It's not just name dropping his hometown on the map, but the weight of what was done there and the history and culture of the place that helps. \n\nIf you were running a D&D campaign and said \"The town of Terbisia is under siege and they are taking hostages\" your players might not really care, they'll just go there because its the next thing to do in the campaign. If you say \"the town you saved 3 levels ago, Terbisia, is under siege and they are holding your NPC friend Alzar hostage\" now that carries some weight. The place feels real because they've been there before and they know some of the history and culture of the place. \n\nThis is something of a limitation for league because we play on one map (mostly) so the only place many players are invested in is SR. The howling abyss adds to the world and feels like a real place because we've been to the freljord now. The same thing can be said about the crystal scar and shurima. This is why some degree of map diversity would be useful for league worldbuilding, but that seems unrealistic by and large unless more maps can be created like with the thresh RGM recently and the butchers bridge map from longer ago. Of course to be successful those map creations would have to be tied to lore events like the release of some void lore in conjunction with the thresh RGM, but you've gotten away from that model for workflow reasons which is a thing i guess.... \n\nI've seen to some degree the worldbuilding team hold back (i assume to ensure that we, the players, can project ourselves onto the champions or see ourselves in the world) but that only leaves the world feeling hollow, empty, or just an uninteresting place to be.

Cuz I'm not really getting a clear reason.  Overwatch's lore (in regards to places and maps) doesnt really seem all that...\"more\"  than League of Legends (they have more cinematics but they're in regards to the characters.... they only give a brief description of each map, which is a different concept from league as you arent usually playing on those maps)....  Why don't you care about these places and how do u think you'd be able to care?

I too want a \"Westeros Style\" map so that I can understand Region relations, Capitol locations, sites of important events and how close they were to major cities, and stuff similar to that. That being said I completely agree with Riot's stance on not limiting the narrative or setting complete/final borders on what Runeterra and Valoran may look like; and here's why:\n\nIn a game that is ever changing and introducing more characters (each with their own back stories and lore) you have to understand that unlike Westeros and Tolkien's world where there is **One Story** and **One Timeline** (regardless of whether they are told by many points of view or have flashbacks), Runeterra is not like that at all. _**YES**_, it would be easier to have one story-line, start to finish, and get a fleshed out world that has a completed map with everything we lore nerds love, but RIOT cant do that unless they are willing and ready to limit themselves to a set guideline and narrative. This limits the diversity of characters and stories they can tell, because they can't create new towns, new regions, new races, new anything without messing up or changing the map and narrative they set in place. \n\nThose worlds built by GRRM and JRRT can have a complete map and fleshed out world that isn't super \"amateur world buildy\" because the characters they introduce and the places you learn about have influences and importance to the narrative, POV/characters and story. They can have a map because the story is written (or thought out) and basically done, everything that is going to happen has been planned out. \n\nRiot on the other hand doesn't have a complete story planned out or written down, they have many stories that over lap and tangle together, stories built from the individual characters they have in their game not from the need to move a story or contribute to the narrative. These individual characters that have relations to one another _**or**_ no relations at all (some characters that haven't even been discovered or shown to other characters yet) are what makes the game interesting and fun not necessarily the lore behind the game (tho that is another reason I play this game). The characters that we would get from Riot in a \"defined narrative\" wouldn't be as cool as what we are currently getting when Riot has the ability to create new things like races, towns, realms and cities. \n\nThe \"Medarda Heirloom\" wasn't made/used to define the narrative or to show a completed world, but instead to add to the stories in Piltover, a City defined by Trade and Knowledge. It is only natural that the map shows the whereabouts of Trade locations and local cities because while those cities may not have any significance to the Narrative (that doesn't exist) it does have significance to the owner/user of that map. It creates depth in **_that_**  story. \n\nTo end: I get why my fellow lore nerds are upset at the lack of information provided, but I hope you can understand why Riot is doing what they are doing. If it wasn't for them not limiting themselves on what they can create we would (arguably) be getting less interesting/enjoyable champions and stories. I also really want to thank Bio for putting up with us nerds and some less than enjoyable convos (when she didn't have to) and _**trying**_  to get us to understand.

It's unfortunate and somewhat sad, because I **really really like playing so many champions** and have a _shit ton of skins_ because of their cool looks, the VFX, VO lines and whatnot; but their background and story? Never even once crossed my mind to take a look.\n\nFor example _I absolutely love Jhin and his obsession with '4'_; sometimes when I'm feeling spicy in-game playing Jhin, I'll \"cosplay\" his lines and adopt his \"character\" while playing. But his background story? Never felt compelled or drawn to it because _Riot hasn't really put emphasis on drawing in the playerbase with their game and champions' storyline_. \n\nNow, I'm sure you folks at Riot adore your characters to death, and I'm sure you really, really, really want to have us, the community, share in the romance, adventure and unique, tiny details of the world of Runeterra.\n\nThe sad fact is, either your art/story department is understaffed/underpaid, or you guys haven't really fleshed out a solid path toward building an all-encompassing world that both looks cool _and has substantive details_.\n\nWhat do I mean by substantive details? Well, to take one of the posters' examples... you all released a map of Piltover or whatever, with some names of small cities/towns splattered throughout. And I get the intent, according to the Rioter responses in this thread, their notion is to **release visual content first, then build up the world from there**.\n\nThe problem is **that method is not only shortsighted, but prone to never becoming complete**. You simply _cannot_ release new champions, new \"visual lore\" like maps, names of cities and places and people -- **without first creating the entirety of each piece's backstory first**.\n\nXayah and Rakan -- all I know about them is they're a couple, they're something called \"Vastayah\" or however it's pronounced, and some other champions like Rengar come from their homeland. Oh, and there's something about them fighting for their home freedom or whatever. That's it.\n\nBesides that, when they were released, _there was absolutely nothing that I noticed either on the forums, the website, or in the client itself that compelled me to learn more about them_. And if I had decided to, would I even get anything more than cursory, superficial stuff like \"Xayah loves Rakan! Sometimes they fight, but they really love each other! Their home was destroyed in a fire/whatever and now seek vengeance for some atrocities committed against them/their people! Bird feathers! Whew!\"\n\nWhat these other posters mean with their arguments is simple: **build the fucking world first _from the ground up_. That means cross all your T's, dot all your I's, and flesh out the existing champions, their backstory, their homeland's backstories, their culture, everything**.\n\nThis is Basic Fantasy Novel Writing 101 (Trust me, I have a library of how to write novels because I'm a writer, myself). You can _start_ with the general, superficial stuff such as character names, places, et al; but at the end of the day in order to build a realistic, detailed and COMPELLING world for others to really dig into, you _must_ flesh out all the minor details as completely as possible. Once you do this, then everything else is easycakes.\n\nAnd if you _have already done all this_ to the level of detail necessary; then **why is it not being used already?**","replies":[{"poster":"Beyond Legends","date":"2017-06-06T11:21:25.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unfortuantely most of us aren't exactly planing to wait 4 or more years of content drought for things.

It was a keen to horrible drawn character with messed up porpotions, terrible color balance, terrible pose and ans a poorly thougjt out theme with the only saving grace was their is tiny detail that kinda looked cool.\n> \n> I think your not looking at the big picture and making a moutain out of spec of dust.\n>\n\nTalking down on fans who miss the old lore? Check.\n\n> The institude and the Summoners was unfortunately hasty proccess Riot made in the past. Writing and world building was clearly a side project. Reading JoJ for the most part seems to be second rate fanfic writer attempt at slice of life and politics. In fact most of the intrested story ended with being a major disapointment. I won't go into detail on the countless flaws of the old lore.\n> \n> As a artist/Creator you have to learn when to drop somethinh that clearly isn't working.\n> \n> Personally I rather see a new generation of lore ethuaist instead of dangling on bad old concept such as the IoW\n\nCalling old lore fanfic tier when current lore is over-written, adjective-overloaded, purple mess? Check.\n\n> Are we really going go through this again? It's been 3 years and people don't care nor have the bloody time to fucking read 35 fucking pages of your personal opinion.\n> \n> Even Riot admited it that during the earlier day riot had said the whole summoner was an lazy idea.\n\nHilarious because this is basically the back and forth between me and Bio. Double standards? Check.\n\n> Well there are simply alot of other stuff to do. Riot has a schedule like most other companies and has to push out changes/content.\n\nBUT CAN'T PUSH OUT A TEXT-BASED RETCON AFTER FOUR YEARS? HMMM.... Check.\n\n> There are still too many large holes that need fix. Currently there are still 5 major faction that are still unclear that needs to be fixed. It's unfair to leave fan of these faction waiting longer to patched up a few minor ones. I bet Riot are already working on another update already and they are very bussy due to their relatively small lore team\n\nBlind leaps of faith placed in Riot's team. \"Buuuut guysssss it's Riot.... we can trust them...\" Check.\n\nNote: You see this with a lot of fanboys in other companies. The biggest fanboys I've met are usually Blizzard and Final Fantasy. They have absolute faith in these companies even when the quality is subpar.\n\n> It's basicly the game personal opinion of the lore. I rather take a “generic” well written fantasy then a lazily shitty written writing anyday the week. I mean those slice of life story was the cringe worthy, the political drama was not well thought out and Singed getting sack by blitz gets old real fast.\n> \n> I'd say we just leave them alone and downvote. It prevent the disgusting circle jerking and move on waiting for the next thing.\n> \n> Eventually the entire lore would be out and we can forget these people.\n\nIt's hilarious because short stories like Lux's Last Light, Garen's Story, Ahri's Story are all basically the same slice of life stories like in the JoJ.\n\nDouble standards again.
