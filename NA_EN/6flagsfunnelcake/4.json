Sharjo, had recently dropped some hints about Ornn, revealing how he's really big, really hot, and how the Freljord think he and his siblings are 'gods' in a sense.\r\n\r\nMy guess, Ornn is the younger/older brother of the three sisters, Avarosa, Serylda and Lissandra. Why? Well the story behind the paper, though mostly covered up, roughly tells of how Ornn rejects the three sisters and goes off to build his own 'kingdom' away from the tribes. This is a slightly far-fetched theory, but it seems kinda resonable.","replies":[{"poster":"Epicurus","date":"2017-08-06T01:38:09.385+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Orrn is a volcano.\nMalphite is his brother.","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2017-08-06T21:27:09.039+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Epicurus,realm=OCE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=bH87u1BX,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-08-06T01:38:09.385+0000)\n>\n> I think Orrn is a volcano.\n> Malphite is his brother.\n\n\"I raised you as best as I could\"\n\nwas a line written to taunt Malphite but was cut bc it had lore implications that were not true.

She is an impossibly old magical creature that might have near deity level powers (which sounds like Ornn), and is one of the only existing characters that could have a connection that I haven't see proposed so far on the boards.
