My clients has been crashing consistently while I'm in champ select and it gives me the wait time as if i dodged. It's been pretty frustrating wanting to play with my friends and telling them to ditch me when my wait time is so long. \r\n\r\nNote: I have done everything on the riot support page  (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) and nothing has changed.\r\n\r\nI know the new client is coming soon and will probably fix this problem for the most part, but I was wondering if their was a way to differentiate between people who dodge on purpose and people who's client crashed. There might be some problems with being able to exploit it to dodge whoever many times you want, but if there is a way that'd be great (I don't know if this is good for ranked though). If this worked it would save allot of time for people who are having trouble with this.\r\n\r\nI know this isn't a huge problem since i haven't seen any posts about it, but I still think it would make a difference.

While this is not something that can be removed, we can prevent further penalties by getting this resolved.  Based on the information you've provided here, it sounds like you might actually be having a network issue and not necessarily with game files.  When you join matchmaking. the server is placing everyone together but network issues can leave you behind or failing to join.  My recommendation would instead be to go over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.  Hopefully, this does the trick!","replies":[]}]}
