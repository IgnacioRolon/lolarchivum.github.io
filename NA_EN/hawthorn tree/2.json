So, I mean, when can {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}}  get a Lifeline item that gives AD+Lethality? When can {{champion:55}} {{champion:131}} get some magic pen on {{item:3157}} ? If we're giving ADC a defense item that doesn't get in the way of them critting our faces off, then we all deserve to have some defensive options that doesn&#039;t gimp our damage at all, right???? \n\nOr is this just ADCs getting spoon fed game-winning advantages once again, for no reason other than the fact that Meddler is a Gold AD main?","replies":[{"poster":"Dracocrash","date":"2019-02-07T03:44:27.332+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let's not compare magic pen to armor pen.

It's not just true damage, not at all.\n\nAlso, all Lifeline passives primarily exist to negate burst, which is the only way you stop an ADC from melting every single person with right clicks. What Riot did is basically letting ADCs build {{item:3053}} again, except with even better stats. There's no longer any repercussions for ADCs building to survive, and that's just completely bullshit. If you've ever played a mage or assassin, you know how much a {{item:3157}} /{{item:3156}} as second item hurts your damage.

But while I agree some lack more intuitive counterplay like to and vayne (besides cc and burst down), champs like Darius already have tons of counterplay and are meant to be rewarded for A) reaching oppoenents B) keeping them in range and C) surviving long enough to burst down an opponent with a true damage nuke AFTER meeting the other conditions. Darius is slow, no Shields, no resistance buffs, lowest AS in game, telegraphed Q, slight delay on E, and has to build 5 stacks. I think he should be rewarded anytime he uses his strengths properly to get an adc (many of whom can kite him for days down to  executable range. Imagine kaisai now with double Shields.
