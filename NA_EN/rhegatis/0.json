His new reworked abilities dont fit him in anyway, I miss old elegant and unique playstyle. I am afraid that i quit league once for all, Aurelion was last interesting champ here, Azir nerfed to the point that picking him with higher ping that 30 doesnt make any sense. I dont even care about Aurelion HP buff, you can even double or tripple his base HP, he is going to be boring anyway and not everything is rounding about winrate. Where is FUN factor, did riot really forgot about it and why nobody is listening to his mains, so you tell me that ive mastered champion for nothing? Its just like spitting in the face, you really disappointed us with your attitude. Two most unique champs just got deleted from the game.

They could have just nerfed his minion damage early instead of reworking his kit and identity and he's still pretty able to shove and roam so IMO that was a fail on their part anyway. \n\nI just don't get how people don't find all these dashing hard CC bursting crazy mobile assassin / mage / tank hybrid champions toxic but Sol being able to push the wave is toxic?","replies":[{"poster":"Z3SIeeper","date":"2019-09-12T02:12:10.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cuz they don't do the same thing.

Why he is slow? Because of his new E, passive speed was much better for map controll, backing to lane, outsmarting your opponent, I could even create big Q without using E active and waiting to 16 lvl. Just everything was in my hands. You want to chase somebody? No problem, want to run? So just run with your E. I used to pick second point in E early for even more map control. With new E i cant do all that things anymore even if i try to roam with it, backing to lane with 325 ms is so slow that I will most likely lose two plates and ~10-15 farm. So the best option now is just staying in the lane and try to killand farm dont you think its a drastic change? His new W makes it even worse, with old W i had a choice, what i want to do I had ability to controll my enemy now is just simple: activate W hit two stars, AA to proc Electro and run for your life save q for backing off, so they cant chase you while youre powerless. You see you have right, its matter of opinion, for me was great champion funny to play in his own way and I was never sticking a nose to other champions and their mains, never demanded, a rework for Yasuo(imagine what would happen after...) because he has cool theme but i dont like his current kit, simply never played him and it was fine. Killing diversity and making ASol from control dps to burst mage is just unfair for his players. There is so more burst mages or assasins in this game(everybody can find something for themselves) leaving ASol on his own was fine. Riot is supporting diversity in real word, promoting LGBT etc but they are killing diversity in their own game, its just madness reworkig ASol is just like telling LGBT that you cant be like that(control mage) because you must be like the others(burst mage).
