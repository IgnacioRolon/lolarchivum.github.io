So far I've noticed it with Karthus, Zyra and Kog'Maw. I know the game doesn't recognise these characters as dead until their respective passives have been used, but it's a bit naff getting a kill in a teamfight and not have the space aids bounce around because one of these champions happened to be in the game.\r\n\r\nFix pls?","replies":[{"poster":"Sailor Mint","date":"2014-11-08T18:09:30.084+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's how all reseting abilities work.","replies":[{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2014-11-08T23:00:55.105+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Kha'zix kills Sion and puts him into his death status, he gets his reset on the kill not when the passive ends.\n\nMalzahar E fizzling likely has something to do with why the bug of DoT's \"double killing\" these champions.\n\n(Infamous is Brand passive getting a double kill on Karthus or Kog'maw)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77dVQUV2akk","replies":[{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2014-11-09T05:06:27.694+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that is something specific to Sion, as the other champs with on-death passives have deaths that are not triggered until the on-death passive ends, while Sion's ends when he initially dies. This is evident with his death timers: the others start when they die after passive, while Sion's death timer starts when he initially dies and applies his passive. If you die at level 1, try to farm some minions or attack enemy champs, then see your death timer. You are dead for, like, 1 second, and then you respawn.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SecretAgentHulk","date":"2014-11-08T20:52:48.846+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should it be?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2014-11-09T00:56:00.479+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"They've fixed stuff like this before.

We'll look into that one, at a guess it's probably just an oversight we can now correct.
