I usually mid and support, and so far I only got S one time. Is it a combination of kda or is there something more?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-18T21:36:42.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing Annie as Mid and Support are going to have slightly different \"requirements\" for getting high mastery scores. The most important thing to keep in mind here is that it's not a flat grading system. It's more like a sliding scale where you're graded *compared to others in the same setup*. \n\nFor instance, if you're playing Annie as Support, a better vision score is going to be more important than if you were playing her Mid. You need to perform your \"role duties\" as well as getting a good KDA and CS. Almost everything factors into the score, you just need to make sure you're performing in the top % to get S+'s.","replies":[]}]}
