It's really annoying and I can't dodge any spells (just hardly) which affects my gameplay enormous.. I've seen some videos and threads about that, but not for this patch, they had it ago 2 years and stuff, and everyone says, \"turn off movement predicition\".. but when I do that, I can't play league anymore, it feels like the game runs on 150ms... it feels laggs and delayed, which is even worse. I want to keep my movement prediction, and be able to play since I ever did, without these laggs.. what else can I do? I already installed the whole game over and over again, tried things out.. Idk what to do, this is zero fun. \n\nPlease send H E L P! \n\nGreetings,\nxiaojin xu{{summoner:3}}\n\nEdit1: Btw, I tried vsync, fps to 60 and everysthing, nothing fixes it, except turning movement pred. off. I need to keep that on tho, for playing properly. And secondly: My char doesnt \"teleports\", the \"lag\" only comes when I click very fast left and right.\n\nEdit2: HERE IS A VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_jjQjzViz4","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-14T02:00:20.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're on the right track with turning off movement prediction, since that can definitely have an impact on your games performance. If you need that to stay on to be able to play properly, there are a few different fixes we can try. \n\nThere's a chance that this could also be affected by packet loss, which means that some of the data going between your network and our servers is getting lost. We can double check for packet loss by grabbing your recent game logs and tossing them into our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743).

I just tested the most recent logs, from the 03.14, and 03,13... all of them were tagged with \"no issue\" - always great ping -> 36 - 41, but sometimes it said, \" minimal packet loss\" - highest percentage was 0,14%, and the average percentage was 0,06% ... What does that mean :x","replies":[]}]}
