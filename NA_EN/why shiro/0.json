Although there is one thing that has always bothered me. I've never had an actual good computer to play on and with these current updates all the things I have to use poor and hold me back from improving. I am too busy with school and sports to get a job and even though I am too busy I stilled applied to the few places around (no luck) If you could perhaps send me a computer to use or borrow until I am able to get a job and get my own that would mean the world to me. I love you guys and honestly I don't expect much but a funny response to this. anyways thanks for the years of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nSincerly: Lance, age 16","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-23T04:49:47.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh buddy I feel ya.
