He burned Flash at exactly the wrong time, causing his W2 to miss, and therefore failing to apply his passive, as you also noted. Part of the problem with how the issue has been discussed isn't just that people are coming up with mental gymnastics to try to justify the ridiculous amounts of damage being outputted, but that there's also quite a bit of victim-blaming going on, with people choosing to focus on how the player whose champion died played less than perfectly (which will _always_ happen, even if the player is pro), rather than the larger context of what exactly happened, whether that deserves a death, and whether or not the killer made mistakes as well. It's a horrendously toxic mentality, and despite that there is still an overwhelming amount of complaints regarding time to kill in the game, which goes to show just how obvious it is even in the face of sheer denial.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2018-08-14T01:20:19.413+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":69,"body":"Dude.

This could lead to a snowball in Talon's favor.  It could leave him susceptible to a followup dive.
