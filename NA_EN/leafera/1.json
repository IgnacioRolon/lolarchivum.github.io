I'll use the 2.0 amount here\n\n340 * 2 = 680 - 68 = 612 * armor value + 68 true damage per hit  = 326 physical damage per hit and 68 true damage per hit at 2 attacks per second = 652 physical and 136 true or 788 total damage per second\n\nif the champion has higher attack speed, the value goes up\n\ntake tristana.  if she manages to damage a champion at all, she will then have around 2.7 attack speed\n\n113(base) + 240(items) + 12(shards)  (up to 12 if you use ghost poro and up to 18 with eyeball collection, though that's less reliable and since ghost is only factored on level, it's more reliable) = 377 AD * 2(critical) = 754 - 75 = 679 + 75 true damage = 362 physical + 75 true damage per auto\n\n362 + 75 = 437 * 2.7 = 1179.9 (or effectively 1180) damage per second in addition to static shiv's magic damage and if you have chosen cheap shot over a hunter and the opponent is crowd controlled, 40 more true damage per auto, up to 108 more effective damage per second\n\n733 is a lot less than a potential 1288\n\nthough for the sake of it, i'll do tristana in calculations with the AD build\n\n113 + 360 = 473 * 2.5 = 1182.5 * armor value = 753.7 so 754 if rounded per auto.  With her kit, she will end up with roughly 1.5 attack speed then (or more by previous rune system but not much) for 754 * 1.5 = 1131 damage per second\n\nnnng, so it ends up less than 20% difference.
