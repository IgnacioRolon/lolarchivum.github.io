How is someone who can be dealt with by muting them and won&#039;t affect the experience when you do so, is treated worse than someone that will ruin your whole experience of the game? I just came back to the game after a long break and so many of my games have been ruined by these types of players that almost always go unpunished. I cannot remember any other time when I had to deal with the sheer amount of players of this type. And I think that might have to do something with Riot&#039;s illogical focus on toxic players.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for reading my rant.","replies":[]}
