Riot is comfortable giving them a long leash on questions of balance as a result.\n\nThe problem is that while Lee and Zed are fun to play and popular due to their abilities.  They are also not so much fun to play against and extremely unpopular in a growing segment of the fanbase that has noticed that these 2 champions are not balanced with the others in the game.  There is a reason that these champs are so often hit with the ban hammer in draft.\n\nHonestly, if Riot was paying attention they should consider any champ getting 20+% ban rates to be a problem and be investigating why.  There are 123 champions.  6 get banned per game so an \"average\" ban rate would be 5% if every champ was banned equally.  A champ like Lee Sin who is banned in more than 25% of the matches is being banned at a rate 5 times average.  That pure and simple should never happen.  MtG doesn't have that level of problem, but I'll admit they have more than 20 years of experience balancing their offerings, and they did have a few problems in the first year, but ONLY really in the first year.  After that they were ruthless about removing unbalancing elements the instant they figured out that there were problems.\n\nWe also see the same thing in play rates.  Again 123 champs.  10 champs in a game so on average a champ would appear in 8.1% of all matches if they were all equally popular/good  (8.5% of all possible matches with equal bans).  Lee Sin is in 50% of the matches even after his huge ban rate.  If you consider his ban rate he is in about 66.6% of all matches he is not banned from.  That is 7 times the average.  \n\nSorry, but Lee Sin is the perfect example of a disastrous imbalance in play.  Sure he's easy to play, but hard to master and can pull off some really spectacular stunts, but any simple analysis of how much he is used demonstrates that the players know he's vastly superior to the majority of champs.  Its extremely UNhealthy.  But Riot refuses to acknowledge the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-01-30T21:12:03.093+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":10,"body":"> A champ like Lee Sin who is banned in more than 25% of the matches is being banned at a rate 5 times average.\n\nWhere are you getting your numbers?  lolking has Lee Sin banned in 4.91% of games, and I almost never see him banned in my personal experience.\n\n> MtG doesn't have that level of problem, but I'll admit they have more than 20 years of experience balancing their offerings, and they did have a few problems in the first year, but ONLY really in the first year.\n\nI don't know what you're looking at here.

That's a huge part of why by the time the big tournaments come up everyone knows which decks are dominant and the game is absolutely unwatchable.  Its a luck game.  At the same time the makers of Magic are constantly trying to adjust the balance.  I will admit they tend to always have 1-2 cards per set that probably surprise them with how useful they are in tournaments, but they also almost always immediately produce counters to those cards.  It's rare that one deck remains dominant for years.  From all accounts there are champs in LoL who have been dominant since Season 3 who are untouched because they are \"healthy\" by some accounts.  \n\n> Popularity correlates with strength, but it's not the same thing.  Cassiopeia is currently a very strong champion, but she's a fairly rare pick.  Lucian is currently quite weak, but he's more than twice as common in games.\n\nCassiopeia and Lucian aren't great examples because they are 2 totally different champs with 2 different roles.  Cassiopeia is a midlane which means she competes with LeBlanc, Zed, Fizz, Katarina, Ahri and more than 2 dozen other champs for playing time and Cassiopeia has a high skill requirement which naturally makes her less popular than a simple to learn champ like Katarina.  Lucian is an ADC which means he only has to be considered better than Graves and Tristana right now, or at least equivalent before someone will take him.  (going by who I keep hearing is top tier for ADC from most people).  Their pick rates are not equivalent in any way.\n\nThe better comparison would be Cassiopeia v Syndra.  Both are by all accounts very powerful late game mid champs, but hard to learn.  The win rates are different, but I believe the pick rates are much closer.\n\n>Popularity doesn't always correlate with strength, but with reputation.  Some champs have very good reputations and are picked a lot more even if they aren't necessarily as good.  Master Yi is a wonderful example of that in the normal ranks I currently play in.  I see one in just about every game.  Garen also seems to show up quite a bit even though I've seen many Garen's do incredibly poorly in game.  Yi isn't considered super strong from what I can tell, but he's supposed to be fun to play and very flexible so he's a popular choice for new players.  In fact I've seen very few Zeds and Lee Sins at my level.  I see very few junglers and Ahri and Katarina appear to be everyone's top mid picks for my level.\n\nI do maintain that a high ban or pick rate is a problem.  if 80% of games a champ can't appear because one of the two teams said \"this is one of the 3 we don't want to see played\" I'd say that the champ needs to be looked at.  If a champ is getting into more than 16-18% of all games, someone might want to ask how that champ is so popular considering that a perfectly random sample would have every champ chosen 8%+/- 2% over time.  Lee Sin appears to hover in the 24-28% range consistently.  That's still triple the average and can't be explained by any kind of statistically modeling unless you accept a biased selection.  So why is it that heavily biased towards him?  Should any champ be 3 times more popular than average?  Can you say that the game is encouraging people to try out new champs when 25% of the time they'll see someone playing this one champ?  In my opinion the level of selection screams that there is a problem.  I don't know how to fix it, but I hope Riot is willing to start asking the questions because the number of passionate posts her about it make me believe they are going to start to cannibalize their fanbase if they don't take concrete action to convince the players that their concerns will be considered and not blown off with the \"We consider him healthy\" answer that answered nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-01-30T22:51:52.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":">  I could probably have noted Rek'sai or Akali who are above 80% ban rate in the last week. That is just a bit excessive in my opinion. I think even you would agree with that.\n\nIn my ideal world, bans are for cases where a particular champion is really good against something you are doing, or cases where you know the other team really likes doing a particular thing.  For example, banning Anivia against Froggen, or banning Rengar if you want to run a poke comp.\n\nI think it's pretty clear something is wrong with any champion that is banned a majority, or even a substantial minority, of the time.\n\n> It's rare that one deck remains dominant for years.\n\nIn standard, cards have a maximum shelf life of two years.  Half the cards in any given top deck are likely to be gone within a year. Obviously no deck stays dominant, they stop existing.\n\nIn legacy, there is no card retirement and dominant decks tend to stay dominant.\n\n> The better comparison would be Cassiopeia v Syndra.\n\nI agree that comparing Cass to Lucian isn't so apples to apples.  Let me split it up and give you two comparisons:\n\n{{champion:69}} versus {{champion:157}} \n{{champion:22}} versus {{champion:236}} \n\nIn both cases, the weak mobile champion is significantly more popular than the strong immobile champion.\n\n> So why is it that heavily biased towards him? Should any champ be 3 times more popular than average?\n\nI don't have a problem with champions being exceedingly popular.

That's a huge part of why by the time the big tournaments come up everyone knows which decks are dominant and the game is absolutely unwatchable. Its a luck game. At the same time the makers of Magic are constantly trying to adjust the balance. I will admit they tend to always have 1-2 cards per set that probably surprise them with how useful they are in tournaments, but they also almost always immediately produce counters to those cards. It's rare that one deck remains dominant for years. From all accounts there are champs in LoL who have been dominant since Season 3 who are untouched because they are \"healthy\" by some accounts.\"**\n\nSaying magic is a luck game really shows how little you actually know about the game. magic is influenced by luck but the game it self requires a huge amount of skill to play. Yes your next card can always win you the game but more often it comes down to who does the best over a series of small choices that have a huge impact. For example: if you have a mana leak in hand and your opponent tries to drop a 2/1 with haste on turn 2 your decision to counter or not counter it directly affects the rest of the match. If you counter it and they drop a bigger threat on turn 3 you made a mistake and might lose. However if by countering it you took the gas out of their hand you could win. Or by saving mana leak you stop their win con later. Magic is all about risk compared to reward. Those bad at figuring out when the small decisions can be rewarding well often lose a game. Also the people that are good at the game trivialize luck by how well crafted their decks are. People put specific cards in specific proportions to forge different results. If you put 4 copies of a card in a deck there is a good chance you will see anywhere from 1-2 of that card during each game. So if you include weak cards as 4 of's you well probably lose and it isn't because of your bad luck in drawing that card but rather your bad deck crafting. \n\nOn top of that magic has never been very well balanced. In every format their is usually one maybe 2 colors that dominant the rest. It is rare for a large veriaty of decks to be usable. In much the same way that professional lol players, play the same champion slightly different from each other; mtg players play decks slightly differently. The fact of the matter that any game or sport with this many variables to balance will never have every variable at a balance level. People will find a way to abuse something.\n\nYou could also argue that the attempt to change balance consistently is largely a marketing scheme.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2015-01-30T19:09:59.157+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SmokingPuffin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ac4ooezO,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-30T19:00:19.194+0000)\n>\n> I don't think this is a proper summary.

That just isn't compelling. The argument is not that easier champions should ALSO be overpowered. That was never the problem. Nobody wants overpowered Olaf. We simply also dislike overpowered Lee Sin, Zed and Fizz. It doesn't matter whether a champion is easy or hard, overpowered is bad and fun for nobody but the player. Coincidentally, I have never seen anyone argue FOR the current state of Lee Sin who doesn't also play as him. \"If champion X were overpowered, it wouldn't be good for game balance\" is not a functional argument against Lee Sin being changed to a state of balance.\n\nI have a short story for you here. In \"Soul Caliber 2\" there was a character who was extremely overpowered. You couldn't do a thing about them. Want to know the justification of everyone I ever showed that irritation to gave? \"He's hard to play as.\" There was just one problem with that argument - if two people of equal skill play as two characters in a game, neither of which counters the other, they should be evenly matched. This was never the case, because if two people were of equal skill and one was using that character, they won.\n\nLee Sin is in the same state. Regardless of whether he is hard to use or easy, with two players of equal skill the Lee Sin player will win every time. Sometimes even while outnumbered. Coincidentally, it's actually for the same reason too. The character I was referring to was so much faster than anything else available that it simply couldn't be played against if the user was above a certain skill level. The same is true now of Lee Sin, because you simply cannot counter the amount of mobility he has. He can retreat from any losing fight with it being possible to do almost nothing to stop him. He can catch up to anyone. The core problem with Lee Sin isn't his incredibly overblown ratios, because make no mistake, he does NOT fall off later in the game. It's the same problem that caused boots to be changed from 50 to 25 Movespeed. For Lee Sin to actually die requires being outnumbered or making a mistake. If something cannot be beaten unless the user makes a mistake, that means that it is overpowered. What happens if neither player makes a mistake? Both have executed all of their actions perfectly. Lee Sin won. Why did he win? Because he's Lee Sin. Not because of anything his player did better than their opponent. Just because he is Lee Sin.","replies":[]}]}
