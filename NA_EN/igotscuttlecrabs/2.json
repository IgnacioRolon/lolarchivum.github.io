It's an overglorified autoattack that restricts Quinn more than it enables.  A lot of Skystrike's power budget is invested into its AOE, but that contradicts with Quinn's role as a duelist/splitpusher rather than a teamfighter.  Fun fact:  **Max damage skystrike** starts doing less damage than a **non-crit harrier** after around 300AD.  Removing Skystrike will let Valor be used for mobility like intended, and will allow Quinn to receive buffs outside of Tag Team without becoming too oppressive.\n\nKeep her as a solo laner.  Quinn will never be a good ADC so long as she has vault, and yet vault is perhaps her most recognisable skill.  I honestly think she'll be healthier as a roaming midlaner, but she's also found a strong niche as an anti-melee top laner.  I don't mind which lane you choose, as long as it isn't bot lane.  Supports punish Quinn far too easily and prevent her from snowballing like she's supposed to as an early-mid game carry.\n\nThat said, please give her a way to get into fights that isn't vault.  Vault is too risky to use to jump into groups of enemies with, even in Quinn form.  Perhaps give her movespeed while walking towards blinded targets or something.  Otherwise, really emphasise her trait as a splitpusher/skirmisher if you want to keep her weak as a teamfighter.\n\nPlease consider reverting her passive back to 10/3 second cooldown instead of 6/6 seconds.  It gives her more of a consistent steroid that rewards you for popping the Vulnerability and provides more counterplay for the opposition.  While it's optimal uptime is shorter, enemies can play around it by staying out of range and putting it on a 4 second longer cooldown than otherwise.\n\nLastly, please buff her vision skills.  Her lore depicts her as a demacian scout and yet her scouting capabilities are arguably the weakest compared to her competitors.  Compare her W to Kalista's, Ashe's, Nidalee's, Teemo's, etc.  Like seriously, Nidalee's bushwhack was effectively Quinn's heightened senses for most intents and purposes but on a 9 second cooldown until it was nerfed recently.\n\nQuinn as it stands is thematically unfulfilling for two reasons.  1) Her weak scouting capabilities as highlighted above.  2) The limitations of Valor as a mobility tool.  Right now, Valor is a kamikaze bird, both in Q and R.  You can't call Q/V a tag team duo when 99% of the time is spent as only Quinn.  Refocusing Tag Team as a mobility skill will increase the uptime of Valor and justify the two's title as a duo.","replies":[{"poster":"IGotScuttleCrabs","date":"2015-08-11T00:39:17.836+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have to agree I'd be ok with Skystrike leaving and allowed for her other abilities taking its power budget.

Point to an area for Valor to scout out and she'll scout out that area permanently until called back (where it goes on a decent cooldown) when an enemy walks in that area with a low amount of health Valor would get massive increased movementspeed moving towards that target.\n\nTo compensate for such a powerfull vision move i'd love to give her a thematic buff/nerf. Let Valor have her own health and make Quin's ult free to use with a decently low cooldown. (make them an actual combo team) while in vision form Valor can be killed thus disabling her ult until she respawns. \n\nI have no numbers and these are just ideas which i would love to hear feedback about from other people who love quin's thematic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2015-08-10T19:02:17.906+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nice.\n\nJust, be careful...We Quinn (and Valor) players are a fiercely protective bunch.

I feel like the last attempt to fix Harrier didn't fully fix it, but rather..it fixed some things, but made other things worse; namely the two bullets above.\n-----\nBut in addition to Harrier, there's a minor kit swap, possible CC change, & Valor buffs I'd like to see for Quinn & Valor, to make their kit more intuitive & fun.\n\n* Switch the **Movement Slow** from **E - Vault** with the **Blind** from **Q - Blinding Assault**\n(_& possibly rename \"Blinding Assault\" to 'Crippling Assault', or 'Achilles Assault', if you wanna be alliterate.  Vault can stay as \"Vault\"; just imagine she's vaulting off of their eyes to blind them/throat to silence them_.)\nThis should somewhat stem the counter-intuitive result of using Vault to _**gap-close/initiate**_, only to be bursted right after (_which also makes more sense when Vaulting to get away - **Blind/Silence, then withdraw**_); and add more risk-reward to landing that Movement Slow skillshot.\n(_A skillshot Blind never felt right/made sense to me in the first place_.)\nThis should also swap Valor's attack animations of both abilities, for consistency.\nThe 'dash & Slow' would move to Valor's Q-Blinding Assault (*Crippling Assault*), while the 'Blind-@-current-location' would move to Valor's E-Vault.\nThis way, players don't confuse Quinn's skillshot (Q) with Valor's Dash (E); they'd both be on the same ability (Q), which makes more sense & increases intuitive play efficiency.\n35/40?%MS Slow that does _**not**_ diminish over 2 seconds (_for the new skillshot MS Slow_).\n* Replace her Blind with **Silence**.\nThe Champions she more often goes up against & bursts her down easily, require being Silenced, rather than being Blinded.\n* Maybe buff Valor's health/armor/magic resist, as if he was like Nidalee & Elise's animal transformation (_more resilient in melee form_).\n* Valor's also missing his own passive.  He should be able to proc his own version of Harrier when attacking low-health units, so he can actually inflict some damage like Quinn.\n-----\nSo, with the kit swap, the improved kit would be like so:\n\n* Q-'Crippling/Achilles' Assault\nQuinn calls Valor to damage targets in an area and _**slow the target's Movement Speed**_.\nValor flies in a line and strikes the first enemy in his path. He then attacks all nearby enemies, dealing 70/110/150/190/230 (+65% bonus Attack Damage) (+50% Ability Power) physical damage and _**slowing the target's Movement Speed by (35% or 40% )**_ {_lesser than Live because_ -->} (the effect _**no longer**_ diminishes over 2 sec).\n**As Valor**:  _**Dashes**_ to target/target area & performs the same attack.\n* E-Vault\nQuinn dashes to an enemy, dealing physical damage and _**silencing**_ the target.\nQuinn dashes to an enemy, dealing 40/70/100/130/160 (+20% bonus Attack Damage) physical damage and _**silencing them for 1.5 seconds**_.\n**As Valor**:  Performs the same attack _**at the current location**_.\n\nCouple this with buffs to Valor & giving Valor a passive like Quinn's, and Quinn & Valor would be a much better champ to use.\nHope you consider these, Repertoir!

She's a pretty low range marksman and her ultimate makes her a melee carry which is really cool, but its generally a death wish against coordinated teams, maybe if she had something that made her ignore a percentage of the targets bonus armor  (especially in bird mode) it'd give her some target neutrality so she doesn't always have to go for the back line dives when in melee form. Just a thought, keep up the good work ^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LycopolisKing","date":"2015-08-10T15:07:50.821+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP, you've really captured Quinn's biggest problem: consistency. \n\nIt's really all we want. The main reason why I as a player started moving away from Quinn in serious games is because she is _risky_; and I'm only slightly referring to her identity as a lane-bully. I'm referring to my Auto Attacks not popping my passive when I needed it, or worse, popping my passive and not delivering damage. Or even better - taking a magical journey with _Vault_ that actually delivered me to the _other side_ of my opponent, between them and the turret. Wheee?\n\nIn all seriousness, Quinn is very powerful, but technical issues like that make her so much of a gamble. \n\n\n(And agreed on the walk animation. But I highly doubt that one will get attention.)","replies":[{"poster":"IGotScuttleCrabs","date":"2015-08-10T15:15:06.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I'm in the same boat. She was my top played champ last season and even reached close to 70% win rate at one point. She's definitely useable.  At least at my level. \nBut still, if I want to play a lane bully burst champ like Quinn I'm better off with Vayne bot or Gnar top. You can actually count on them. I hate to say it but I've been drifting away from a champion I love because she's unreliable, my teams always disapprove of her because they know she's in a bad spot, and there's just to many champs that do her role better only because they're consistent.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KarmasPolice","date":"2015-08-12T10:14:53.898+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's how you make Quinn into the adc beast she's supposed to be.\nChange Harrier to put an unconsumable mark for 4 seconds. Instead of giving bonus AD, this mark ignores a % of the targets armor! Also this way Valor can help the entire team, not just Quinn as during this mark, the entire team can proc it.\nNow, make it so it has a long cd, like 10 seconds, BUT if you hit the mark, Valor get excited, and the cd is reduced by 1 second for every AA. If you get a kill the passive RESETS!\nThis will shift her power from early game to late game and give her relevancy even without attacking by herself via her passive.\n\nAbout Valor in general, make it so you can switch to her at lvl 6, and have you switch between Quinn and Valor on a a 15 cd. Now as Valor you gain MS, MR and Armor by ult rank. Remove the active from the w, and switch it into a passive for Valor that reads: \"Valor get heightened senses while not in lane getting a boost of MS while periodically discovering all enemies in a 1000 range, including bushes. That way, Valor is the scout.\n\nBut first of all, please fix her AA's and make it harder to interrupt her E.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MisterLayzee","date":"2015-08-12T08:49:16.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Small suggestion on the passive (apologies if this has been suggested already):\n\nWhen Harrier is off cooldown the first thing you auto attack will cause valor to mark the target you just hit for the 4.5 seconds, and the cooldown won't start until the mark is used or disappears.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darth Kala","date":"2015-08-11T19:25:39.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@RiotRepertoir  I think something that could be nice to \"fix\" Quinn's problem with her ult is to give her a tool to re-position after going back to Quinn form from Valor.
