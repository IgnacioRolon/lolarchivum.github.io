It's likely that you'll also get kicked out if you try the legacy client as well, in this case.  \n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nIf that's the case for you, run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide and test it out in a custom game to prevent penalties.

We aren't able to remove a queue dodge, but are requesting logs to investigate further.  If you've installed League in the default directory, you can find the log files by following this path:  \n\n**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\LeagueClient Logs\\**\n\nIn that folder, you&#039;ll want to provide the following log file types:\n>* LeagueClient.log\n* LeagueClientUx.log\n\nAttach them to a [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can investigate.\n\nIn the meantime, collapsing your friends list groups before queuing for a match, may serve as a temporary workaround. Here's a screenshot showing what that looks like:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/wMLOFya.png\n\nLet me know if you have any questions on this.","replies":[{"poster":"IGotScuttleCrabs","date":"2017-03-04T17:41:15.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It just happened a second time in a row \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n\n\nI wait and try again with your suggestion","replies":[]}]}]}
