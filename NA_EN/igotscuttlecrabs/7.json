What I was referring to that couldn't be detected were negative intentions for banning champions that people like you would consider \"reportable\" and punishable. Which aren't punishable.\n\n2.) Okay, that's nice. That doesn't change the fact that banning a champ in draft because you don't want another player to play that champion isn't punishable. Which is the point that I was trying to make.\n\n3.) That example is a proper instance of griefing that can likely be detected **and** punished by the system, you're correct. However, that isn't the case for banning somebody's desired champ in draft.\n\nAlright.
