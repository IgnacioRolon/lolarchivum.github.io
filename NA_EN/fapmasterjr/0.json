If so, this is worthy of a permanent ban, yes, because this isn't okay behavior (even if it's not *that* bad in the big scheme of things), and the 14-day ban is your last chance.\n\nI get that it's frustrating to have an ally you think isn't taking the game seriously, or one who is feeding, or one who is insulting you, or all three. That doesn't make it okay to constantly complain about him, tell him he's feeding, comment on other player's scores negatively, and generally bring down the whole tone of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"FapmasterJR","date":"2018-06-11T16:26:12.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I forgot that I had a warning because the warning was over a year ago maybe even 2 years.

This doesn't seem like something that should have earned a permanent ban under those circumstances.","replies":[{"poster":"FapmasterJR","date":"2018-06-11T16:32:49.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK thanks, I have sent a ticket.
