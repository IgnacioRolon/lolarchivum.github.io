I sent a ticket the other day and got a message saying their wait time was a little longer than normal.\n\nWhat kind of crash are you talking about? Are you actually getting the bugsplat notification? or is it the windows \"Stopped responding\" popup?\n\n I have this weird issue where when the loading screen starts all the portraits are blank for 10-20 seconds and if I click around during this time I get the not responding message. All I do is click \"Wait for program...\" and it eventually loads as normal. I don't recall when this first started happening to me but it does it every game. I also got a new monitor some time ago so that could be the issue. \n\nBecause you got a new monitor I imagine it has to do with your in-game visual settings. You might want to try swapping back to the old monitor to see if it still works. Otherwise maybe try changing your video settings to accommodate the new monitor.\n\nHope this helped!\n{{summoner:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"playerknown","date":"2016-10-12T06:28:57.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is actually giving me the bug splat message.

Since they have logs, they'll have more context as to what could be causing this.\n\nWe've had a lot of tickets submitted recently, so response times will be a bit higher than normal. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"playerknown","date":"2016-10-12T06:29:49.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks rioter!
