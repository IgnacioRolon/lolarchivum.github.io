He's taking coincidence and interpreting it as causation.

Just go watch his streams. He acts \"toxic\" on camera for entertainment but is a very determined and legit player in game. Don't go picking on people without actually making sense next time. If those Tyler 1 wannabes were really wannabes they'd play their heart out too. Otherwise, they're just your average troll.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BreathNrelaX","date":"2018-03-13T06:49:28.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all games are dieing.. im old gamer.. I look for new games to play to get away from this one.. its 2018 and the graphics all seem the same for the past 10 years and nothing insane has appeared or interests me/\n\nwhere are all the insane games that aren't re-run fps, sports, half Butt budgeted mmorpgs that constantly grab your wallet, rerun rts. (have to say butt instead of .... what a joke).\nbunch of money grubbing developers and sponsors who don't care about the experience of the player. so the great game ideas that deserve funding are unable to start up because there is not an instant profit. no time is available to the graphics designers or programmers or game makers since they have to push deadlines and make sure they make money and profit instead of enhancing experience.... SO they are busy developing expansion packs and 20$ skins\n\nthis is translated to many subjects throughout the world... a metaphor for the current state of affairs... Though this may not be the fault of the companies or developers at all it is just now the norm and the only way to fund games as people need money to create and live.. and the current economic system can no longer suit creativity and development as priority as it may just not be possible. Or it is and all these games and companies try and branch out and dabble in too many things instead of sticking to their priorities.. making an unbelievable gaming experience and fair competitive scene for the player.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ph03n1xb1rd","date":"2018-03-13T11:06:45.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"He just got unbanned because he started playing Dota2 and Rito would have lost money if some players chose Dota instead of LoL. $$$ before consistency, this is what Rito does.","replies":[]}]}
