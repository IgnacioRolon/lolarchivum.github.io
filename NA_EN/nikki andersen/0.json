If the assassin stays in his range he will out dps them with Q and W and finish them off using Phase Rush to stick to them. Morde also can easily shove them under tower and prevent them from roaming, forcing them to blow all their mana to cs. The only danger for Morde is if he gets cheese killed at lv 1-2 and the assassin gets 2~ levels on him, but that is easy to avoid if you just play safe until 3.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
