Upon closer look, it seems like it hasn&#039;t disappeared, but somehow bent downwards and stuck to the frontal part of the tail (the one that faces the ground), like making a 180 degree turn. Sometimes it even goes through the tail a little.\r\n\r\nAfter further inspection, I have concluded that the thing isn&#039;t always positioned in this abnormal way. Sometimes it goes back to normal. I did some tests and these are the results:\r\n\r\n\r\n**ABNORMAL POSITION:**\r\nwhen moving normally\r\nwhen moving with a speed buff (homeguard, her passive, etc.)\r\njoke _(ctrl + 1)_\r\ntaunt _(ctrl + 2)_\r\nwhen using W, E, R\r\nwhen using flash\r\n\r\n**NORMAL POSITION:**\r\ndance _(ctrl + 3)_\r\nlaugh _(ctrl+ 4)_\r\nduring recall\r\nwhen using Q\r\ndeath animation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve included **2 pics:**\r\n [**_In movement_**](http://oi68.tinypic.com/1f0ya.jpg) and [**_joke (ctrl + 1)_**](http://oi66.tinypic.com/2isjbwo.jpg)\r\n\r\nAnd **2 videos: **\r\n[**_Emotes_**](http://media6000.dropshots.com/photos/1362832/20161109/094950.mp4) and [**_In combat_**](http://media6000.dropshots.com/photos/1362832/20161109/094952.mp4)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the bug itself isn&#039;t that bad since it doesn&#039;t really affect how well one plays, but if it&#039;s one of your favorite skins you&#039;ll probably be a little frustrated every time you enter the Rift XD (especially if you&#039;re a Nami main).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; {{champion:267}}  _Rito pls fix my tail_","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-11T20:43:10.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gahh, this is a weighting issue!
