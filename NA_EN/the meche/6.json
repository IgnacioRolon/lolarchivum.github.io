Why isn't misusing pings to harass people who died reportable?\n\nI guess Riot just wants us to take it up the butt, which is why they don't even give us an option to mute pings in the same way you can mute chat from people.\n\ne.g. If I mute someone's chat, it disappears. Only thing you can do with pings is turn down the volume.","replies":[{"poster":"MUSHROOM MIDGET","date":"2017-03-22T14:43:04.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"yeah dude i agree with you.  its really toxic the way the ? ping gets abused.  but their automated system isnt going to pick up on it so they will think your report is fake.\n\ni just want to have a way to mute pings.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lil Lewd Witch","date":"2017-03-23T00:14:37.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You CAN report it. But unlikely to be effective, Riot gives players the tools and yes some players use them to harass but its hard to actually PROVE that, beyond a doubt. I ping other lanes when I see someone go missing frmo mid, even as a top laner or elsewhere so I can make sure my team is aware of it. Some people might feel this is harassing them while they are in lane, but I am using the tool as intended. \n\nThats what causes the issue","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-03-22T15:04:59.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they do it consistently (or spam it), I'll generally report them for harassment and/or spam with an explanation in the comments.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2017-03-22T14:45:34.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep ping spamming is reportable.","replies":[{"poster":"The MechE","date":"2017-03-22T14:46:55.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Happy Honker,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=BEjijpE9,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-03-22T14:45:34.496+0000)\n>\n> yep ping spamming is reportable.\n\nThis isn't ping spamming though.
