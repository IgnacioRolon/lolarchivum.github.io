It's better but indeed still not fixed.\n\nAs far as I could tell, this was the only problem.\n\\> Arcade MF uses the classic auto attack sound when making auto attacks that trigger Love Tap.\n\nAttacks on targets with Love Tap already applied used the proper Arcade AA sounds. \nI could not tell if it was using the proper double \"bwip bwoop\" sounds for alternating Love Tap applications. Couldn't hear over the top of the classic AA sounds.\n\nSomeone should slap Supercakes. One of the \"favourite skins\" of the skins team manager has had various audio problems for probably almost 2 (?) seasons now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-07-12T17:57:15.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have PTech taking a look at is.
