Since yesterday i have had ping ranging from 150 to 400. I have pinged various non league related servers in Chicago and Minneapolis and they all have 30 or less ping. It appears to only be a problem when connecting to the lol server. I have restarted my computer, reset my router and that has done nothing. I ran the diagnostic test using hextech repair tool and the netalyzer tool, and their doesn't seem to be much wrong. I also ran a tracert connecting to the lol server.\r\nWhat more could I do to fix this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-08T23:49:50.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Large changes in latency are often caused by changes in ISP routing to that specific server. Sometimes local network configurations can cause latency changes as well, so I recommend your next step to be working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local settings are good.\n\nIf you still have issues after working through that guide, let me know.","replies":[]}]}
