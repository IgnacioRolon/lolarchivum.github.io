Perma Stealth is a design issue at this point for solo q.\n\n\nFor people who are arguing over {{champion:28}} and thinks she is broken/imbalanced because of her permanent stealth – it is simply not true. I would like to point out that there are many ways to counteract and deal with her. Why am I bringing this up? From my insight, I see a lot of players (especially in bronze-platinum tier) who refuse to buy a single vision ward – place it on the map or play champions that lack any crowd control. Evelynn does not scale well in terms of late game potential. She falls off in terms of damage/inability to keep up with farm and if she falls behind – there is no comeback mechanism for her. She'll continue to greatly fall off because of her lack ability to obtain kills and farm in her own jungle. Any champions {{champion:92}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:89}}  that are AD bruisers, Tanks, or heavy burst damage output would wreck Evelynn. Her health is equivalent to that of a Master Yi Jungle except she does way less damage than any other jungle assassin.\n\n\n-Why would you take the best feature of Evelynn?\nShe is fun to play because she is suited to be an invisible assassin in exchange for her low health. However, she still struggles because of the recent patches in jungle buffs and reducing the hp sustain gained from {{summoner:11}} She is meant to be played as an assassin – but we should not cripple her to the extent where she is barely able to come out of the jungle alive.\n\nShe has a 42.49% win rate (3rd lowest from {{champion:60}} & {{champion:429}} ) in comparison to {{champion:59}} & {{champion:254}}   (51.6%), {{champion:80}}  (54.31%) and of course {{champion:19}} at (59%)\n\nThere are a lot of top tier junglers that I could mention, but I want to be short and succinct in that Evelynn is struggling in the new jungle patch and that removing her permanent stealth would just be detrimental to the champion itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2014-12-11T08:58:28.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"funny i said perma stealth not eve.

The fact that solo Q players cannot work together is a huge advantage for any champion that can roam.  I see Evelynn's kit as perfect.  Nobody complained much about it in season 4 after another nerf. \nReason why Permastealth shouldn't be an issue is because Evelynn is not stealthed in her own jungle, and her range makes it so that you know many seconds in advance that she's going to attack you. Her stealth is what makes some of Evelynn's weak points viable : No CC ( except for ult ), Squishy champion, limited by mana ( unlike champs who operate off of fury).  Take away her stealth, and you have pretty much a Shyvanna/ Yi who does not do as much damage, and is probably squishier.   \n If an individual's concern is Evelynn's stealth,  I can say that Twitch / Shaco stealth is more deadlier due to the fact that they can pop up right beside you,  compared to Evelynn who actually cannot stealth beside you.  Eve's stealth is honestly only used from her pathing from the jungle to your lane. Whereas the other stealthy champions are used from going in your lane to kill you.  Permastealth on Eve shoudn't be an issue. It's actually what makes her unique and is what shapes her identity.","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2014-12-11T15:33:31.251+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"With vision being so hard and the limit pink wards stealthy champs are inherently strong gankers. To properly ward against this type you have to go in to the enemy jungle. This requires help from the whole team to do safely and properly in the early game.  This level of constant  coordination is not in the cards even at the gold level. \n\nPerma stealth may be Eve's thing. That does not mean it is not problematic for solo Q.
