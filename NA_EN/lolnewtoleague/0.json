My account scrubrogue was recently hacked (within the last 2 days). I looked on op.gg and noticed someone has been playing ranked on it as well. I am very afraid they are going to get my account restricted/banned or have my ranked rewards revoked by being toxic in the game. \n\nI submitted a ticket when I noticed this morning and I am afraid that it won't get processed or noticed fast enough. I have TONS of paypal RP payment emails saved and a vast history of the account details. If there was anyone I could talk to so that I could speed along the process I would be eternally grateful. I have been playing on ScrubRogue since pre-s1 and I have easily spent $1000+ on RP. I would hate for my investment to instantly disappear because something outrageous like this happened. \n\nI don't know if this is the right place to make this sort of post, but I am very concerned and I don't want anything to happen to my account. \n\nPls help me Riot :'( \n\n-ScrubRogue\n\nEdit: Whenever I try and look at and review the ticket I just get redirected to a 404 not found page.... Is the ticket even in the system?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-30T22:56:57.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries! I can see that ticket in the queue and it should be answered relatively shortly. Don't fret too much about any purchases, we'll be able to repair and reverse any of that as well.","replies":[{"poster":"ScrubRogue","date":"2017-11-30T23:54:36.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Recovered my account!
