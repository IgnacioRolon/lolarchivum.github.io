Who doesn't love crawling out of bronze? A friend of mine suggested playing Zyra, so I thought I'd try her out in norms. I queue up, got a funny team, we're good to go. Then, this happens.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/iOrad\n\nI cannot buy items, can only exit the shop by mashing the esc key, can leave the fountain and go to lane, but restarting the game and the entire client did not fix the issue. My team wasn't given the chance to remake, but they could see me in the chat. Has this happened to anyone else? This was a norms game, draft.\n\nEDIT: said X key at first, meant esc. \n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe lost. Tried the practice tool with Aatrox and it worked, but again when I got into draft norms with zyra, same bug. \n\nUPDATE 2:\n\nIt's Zyra. Tried a custom with her and it didn't work. Tried bots with Morgana and it worked.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-18T03:45:12.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Snap you weren't able to search for items or anything at all?! Yea that'd make for a rather upsetting game for sure =(....\n\nThis might be related to your config settings and item sets, so let's try manually resetting those to see if that helps really quickly. Try these steps, and let me know if it helps or not.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2018-01-18T02:09:15.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Change from recommended items?
