KateyKhaos is easily one of the most friendly, welcoming and vocal employees, and I'm not exaggerating when I say she has the patience and composure of a saint.\r\n\r\n It must be very frustrating and upsetting seeing players angry (and then vocal about it) about things, especially when there are issues such as this current Dark Star Thresh Bug. I know that wouldn't be able to do what she does because when I read some of the threads, and how disrespectful players can be to after she's given a reply (or more), that I want to just break a laptop over those peoples faces.\r\n\r\nYet every time, no matter how negatively players are responding to the issue, she always maintains a calm,, kind, respectful, and empathetic response, and keeps us informed as best she can. To me its admirable, and I appreciate her taking the time to interact with the community. To me, that's worth acknowledging and thanking someone.\r\n\r\nSo thank you very much KateyKhaos, You are very appreciated and really make a difference in your interactions with the community Keep up the good work\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-22T16:09:01.340+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey hey! \n\nThanks for the kind words! \n\nIt's more of a passion project than anything else - I love what I do! \n\nIn return, I'd like to thank you guys and grills on the boards for helping out by posting bug reports, feedback on content, as well as posting ideas for skins. It helps us out a ton. :)\n\nWe've been able to fix a ton of issues based on the bug reports we've received - even some of the smaller issues that are a bit more cosmetic than gameplay impacting.\n\nWe've received awesome feedback when new stuff comes out - we even delayed the released of Debonair Galio and made changes based on a huge feedback discussion thread on the boards. We've also made smaller changes, too! \n\nThere are a ton of talented artists on the boards, and seeing some of the unique concepts are great! We do go through fan ideas when considering new skins as inspiration. :)\n\nSo, to you guys, thanks for all of the help, and thanks for understanding when shit gets rough! ^-^","replies":[]},{"poster":"FACE THE WlND","date":"2016-06-21T17:44:02.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"COOL","replies":[]}]}
