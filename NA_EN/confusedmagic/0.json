I wasn't able to repro this. I tried having Beast Hunter Sejuani die next to him, as well as dying off camera, but still in peripheral view, then scrolling onto the body and I wasn't able to get a repro. Would you have any additional information here? Is this occurring every game for you?","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-05-23T00:17:00.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen similar bugs with Corki (can't recall if it was base skin or Red Baron), where you can hear his flying sound constantly after he dies. Haven't been able to tell if it's still existing since I don't see Corki in games anymore.\nThis patch I've also had Ignite sounds persist constantly sometimes. Can't recall other details to help in reproducing.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-23T17:11:41.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh, okay.

We particularly noticed that when the enemy Sejuani came to gank it seemed it was not normal for her to make that sound. Later in the game we realized it must of been a bug as we killed Sejuani and the roaring kept on going. Also when the body disappeared, it stopped, probably as we no longer had vision on Sejuani. \nAnother point: The Sejuani's team didn't notice it - they said they couldn't hear it.\nMaybe it only occurs rarely in match made games.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-20T21:01:44.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha!
