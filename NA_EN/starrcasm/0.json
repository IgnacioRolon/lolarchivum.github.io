I have tried all connection issues and nothing resolved it. I can't log on now at all. I did the hextech repair tool and that didnt find anything either.. Im at a loss. Riot you need to seriously get your shit together, If its not a patching issue its a connection issue.. You are trying to connect all of North America on to 1 server and its just not working. Quit being a cheap ass and upgrade your stuff!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-31T18:15:01.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there's an issue with how your connection is being routed to the server. If you've worked through every step on the [Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), then I recommend trying a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to reroute your connection to the servers. If you notice any change in your ability to connect, it will confirm that there are issues in your ISP route and we'll want to investigate into that.\n\nLet me know of any updates on your issue.","replies":[]}]}
