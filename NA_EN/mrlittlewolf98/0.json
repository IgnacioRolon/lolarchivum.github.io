The traditional map idea is a Top lane champion which is typically a bruiser or tanky caster that can sustain the lane. Jungle is an assassin or bruiser with crowd control of sorts. Middle is a caster or an assassin and bot has a marksmen and a tank or utility healing. What i want to ask if what if we change this so that the traditonal Top lane fight is in the bot lane, the mid lane is in Top lane, and bot fights in middle. Having this idea allows for a double roam and allows for the lane that shares xp to be the first to get minions. When the marksmen is able to hold on better and travel back faster the support has better opportunity to move to bot or top and assist in kills same as a jungler which creates a higher pressure.\r\nIts just an idea i would like some discussion on.","replies":[{"poster":"Phyuq Yiu","date":"2017-07-16T11:30:44.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This sounds legit. Maybe if your mid isnt a great roamer. Assassin mids are good mid bc they can get to and from other lanes faster. But I like the idea of having duo mid for the slightly earlier exp and supp can roam and ward everywhere easier and earlier. \n\nI'd like if people didn't feel so obligated to play a marksman every game. At least in real low divisions, most people locking in marksman are doing nothing but taking all the farm, feeding and being useless, just pick a mage or w/e you're good with and be usefull!","replies":[{"poster":"MrLittleWolf98","date":"2017-07-16T13:25:57.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats how i feel. Thats why i felt that if we change what normal is people will be able to advance their own growth and supports like bard can roam the whole map much faster.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lilpokfluf","date":"2017-07-16T23:48:14.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could work, it's just that the current meta makes it easier for bot lane to be taken while keeping mid laners safe in a short lane.\n\nRecruit some people and make a team let us know how it goes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2017-07-16T23:33:54.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not looking to shoot you down, but the current meta exists for a reason.\n\nHistory lesson!\n\nIf you go back to S1, the standard meta was mage top, ADC mid, tank/sup bot and Fiddlesticks jungle. The thinking here was to give the carries as much a lead as possible. Often times support would just roam, taking only about 15% the experience from each lane (and being *much* lower level). While this gave the carries a lot of snowball potential (for the time), it was built around marginalizing the rest of the team.\n\nEnter the EU meta after it won the S1 worlds. This is the standard 1/1/1/2 we see today. The thinking here was to maximize resource distribution across the *team*, instead of funneling to individuals. \nMages went mid because it is the shortest lane making it the easiest to escape from ganks. This also reduced how long they spent out of lane after backing for mana [potions]. Because ADC's scale more on gold than levels, they got stuck with the support (range has always been a strong in lane). Supports are still responsible for roaming to ward and help jungle on occasion, in addition to being the ADC's now private slave. Because dragons were worth a lot more back then, the ADC/sup went bot (as they were the strongest lane). Jungle was occupied by the 4 or 5 champions that didn't suicide to ~~Chickens~~ Wraiths. Tanks went top as they were generally durable enough to survive ganks, their durability steroids scaled with level (support utility, not so much), and it was the only spot left.\n\nSeason 2 or 3, Riot lowered the jungle difficulty. This allowed utility heavy champions to jungle and not just Warwick, Fiddlesticks, and Xin Zhao. By the time Alistar started chain-ganking everyone with 80% success rate, the jungle difficulty was re-adjusted *and* Alistar dumpstered. This returned the jungle to the sustain+damage master race.\n. . . Enter Lee Sin.\n\nThen comes S4, and the introduction of expendable Support income (OH THE HORROR!).\nThis meta [very] briefly saw a 2/1/2 meta. 2 tanky tops taking targon's, mage mid, ADC/Everyone bot. This meta abused the new income to force down early turrets with huge lane pressure. In response, Riot gutted the new support income making duo-top inefficient again and bot lane still viable for utility mages (almost erasing non-Janna support from the game).\nRiot Also re-balanced support champions around  AP \"utility scaling\" so they could use that new gold. But still nerfed anyone who left bot lane. Then left the scaling intact after gutting said income.\n\nNext was the season 5 LCS swap meta. After the dragon value nerfs and turret value buffs, Turrets became the better all-game objective. Due to this, the LCS developed a system where they would send their duo lane (still the strongest) top to shift pressure away from dragon. This forced the other team to either meet them top, or trade top turret for dragon. To cease this shenanigans, Riot turned bottom turret (and *only* bottom turret) into wet rice paper for the first 10 minutes. This meant sending the duo lane top would cost your team both dragon *and* bottom turret.\nHence the \"gangbang bot meta\" - where sending everyone bot at least 3 times before 10 minutes was a tactical *requirement*.\n\nThere were a lot of smaller scale meta shifts (10 ADC's per game, anyone?), but those were all I recall messing with the lane distribution.\n\n(I feel like I'm forgetting one.)\n--------------------------\n------------------------\n-----------------------\n\nSo what does this have to do with your suggestion to change the meta? Well it highlights a few problems.\n\n1. Riot enforces a ~~stale~~ \"healthy\" meta,  despite their claims to the contrary. So if this does catch on, Riot will likely \"fix\" it.\n2. Although I think they returned some of the durability, bot turret is still the weakest one early game. By sending your duo mid, you reduce the defenses on your weakest front. In exchange, you increase the pressure on the easiest lane to roam to and defend.\n3. The extended top lane puts immobile mages in more danger. With League's CC and mobility ~~sprint~~ creep, this could potentially push them out of the game.\n4. F Support champions.
