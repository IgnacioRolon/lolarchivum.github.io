My League Won't Launch Game","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This only happens every other time the game goes to launch after champ select, i don't get the league of legends logo and the icon appears on my start bar. It acts like it's trying to launch but it's a blank screen the never does anything, not even a black screen, just nothingness. I have to hard close it then try to reconnect to current game from the client and sometimes this works and the game launches as normal, other times it doesn't, just gives me the same nothingness and I have to try again. Sometime restarting fixes it, but then I come into game 2 minutes in and everyone is pissed at me. \n\nThis time, what's forcing me to finally make a post about this, is that, when I restarted then started to launch league, it crashed my computer... \n\nWhat is going on? Why won't league launch... I've tired uninstalling and getting a fresh install, I've tired installing it on both of my SSDs and my harddrive and there is no difference. This only started when I got my new computer 2 months back. As I said, it only happens like every other time I try to go into game.\n\nI'm tired of getting leaver punishments for something I can't control... I want to get into game, it's like a gamble if it'll work or not... I'm tired of letting people down for something as stupid as the game just won't launch... There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the client, it seems to be the game itself.\n\nPosting here because I don't really think it's a bug since it seems specific to me, I can't find any posts past 2013 that have this problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-06T21:45:36.987+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey are you on a mac or PC?  This sounds super frustrating and I want to help, so I'll go with my intuition for now.  Give your PC a restart just in case something crashed in the background.  If your screen is showing blank, then either 2 things are happening:  Your have an antivirus or some other setting blocking your patcher from launching.  Similarly, you might also have a connection issue that is failing to reach the patching server and launch.  It could even be both issues, but it's hard to say for sure right now.\n\nFor now, I recommend going through the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that access is being allowed and League is added as an exception.  This will help rule out possibilities with that factor!","replies":[{"poster":"Trap Be Nimble","date":"2017-12-06T21:54:06.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do use a PC and I did find the permission page a while back and tried a lot of the stuff and it didn't seem to work. I made sure my Windows was updated, running the game as an Administrator, checked my Hard Drive for errors, and have reinstall the game as an Administrator. I haven't tried the UAC thing, I'll try to give it a go now, will update if that helps in a few hours.\n\nSomething with the patcher might be right as well, I was just assuming this was a new client thing, but I commonly have to restart league because it tells me I'm having issue with the patcher even after I've patched and played a few games, could this be related to this problem? I don't remember if i got these errors on my old computer, but I do get them a lot currently.\n\nAlso, I use Windows Defender for my anti-virus.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-06T22:00:06.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It may depend on when the error is happening.  If it's pretty early own then it's likely a permissions problem, with the error suggesting that it's having problems accessing and preparing your game files for an update.  If it's a little bit later then it could be a connection hiccup losing the updated files.  Definitely go over each step and let me know, we can go from there.\n\nWhile you're at it, download the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) as well to see if auto-configuring firewall settings or even a Force Repatch might help.  A force repatch could help determine if something is just straight up wrong with the patcher itself, and fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Trap Be Nimble","date":"2017-12-10T00:50:48.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I uninstalled and reinstalled my network drivers and that seems to have fixed it <3 When you said something about network i decided to try that...
