I'm sorry to hear you're going through this. It's obviously too late now, but these types of situations are a big reason why we don't recommend transactions like this that occur outside of the client. Regarding the chargeback, yes, you'll have to pay it back in full before the account is released. You can find out more about chargebacks in our [**FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201753334-Chargebacks), so I recommend checking that out.\n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EMPEROR RD","date":"2017-02-06T20:24:24.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bummp","replies":[]}]}
