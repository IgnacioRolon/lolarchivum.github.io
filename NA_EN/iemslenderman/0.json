This can occur up to 3 times every 30 seconds. Killing a minion disables this passive for 12 seconds.&quot; This is a spell that does damage to a champion, yet it doesn&#039;t give you gold for it. It&#039;s the only ability that hits champions in the whole game that doesn&#039;t work with spelltheif&#039;s edge. \r\n\r\n2) Liandry&#039;s Torment, also does not work with boxes yet they work with Heimerdinger&#039;s turrets and teemo shrooms. &quot;UNIQUE Passive: Spells burn enemies for 3 seconds, dealing bonus magic damage equal to 2% of their current Health per second. Burn damage is doubled against movement-impaired units.&quot; This is a spell, that causes a fear yet it doesn&#039;t apply liandry&#039;s what&#039;s so ever in any way. not the burn not the 2% not the 4% it should, nothing. \r\n\r\n3) Luden&#039;s Echo should work with his boxes, yet works with teemo shrooms and Heimerdinger&#039;s turrets &quot;UNIQUE Passive - Echo: Gain charges upon moving or casting. At 100 charges, the next damaging spell hit expends all charges to deal 100 (+10% of Ability Power) bonus magic damage to up to 4 targets on hit.&quot; yet it doesn&#039;t? \r\n\r\nI understand that Shaco&#039;s boxes are annoying, but so are teemo shrooms, Heimerdinger&#039;s turrets. There&#039;s no reason for his boxes to not trigger effects that they should be triggering it states right in the passives that it should be working but it isn&#039;t, why isn&#039;t it? \r\nI made a post about this problem right after the assassin update, mostly to do about spellthielf&#039;s edge and it&#039;s yet to be fixed. Now you are looking to make changes for preseason and add all these cool features asking us for feed back, and I would like these problems fixed before you worry about adding to features that will add more bugs. \r\nShaco&#039;s boxes are a core part of his kit, and you nerfed AP shaco so much already to the point where PinkWard a legendary AP shaco plays more of a hybrid now. Shaco&#039;s boxes should be applying these passives, they are a spell and they damage the enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"IM ON SHAC0CAINE","date":"2017-09-02T13:47:08.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yup this is quite strange that they coded his box differently, does zyra plant has the same issues or is it only shaco box ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2017-09-02T07:23:34.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, idk what these boxes are but even jax can dodge them with counterattack as if they are autos, but he can't dodge mf q from a dead minion.","replies":[]}]}
