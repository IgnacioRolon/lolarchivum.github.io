I guess I'll spend some more effort on this post.\n\nI know that the free week champions are for new players, but I remember as a level 15 \"nocturne main\" that was completely sick of every game getting stomped by Master Yi wishing I could try poppy, and so I did with 450 IP. I barely felt the loss in IP. Meanwhile, I was waiting every single free week for exactly three champions: Jayce, Kha'zix, and Aatrox. These guys seemed really cool to me but would take literally 14 times the IP it would take to buy, for instance, Ashe. It was frustrating then that all these extremely cheap champions were free while those free week slots could have been replaced by champions that seemed so inaccessible to me, and it's frustrating now.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-04-27T18:07:24.747+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":12,"body":"The free rotation is for new players.
