I just wanted to bring this up because i doubt many people have noticed it and to let you know that the video could use an update for the exhaust nerf that happened a while ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-01-21T11:23:07.432+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think they gonna touch the display, after all they have \"recently\" like a massive overhaul of the displays, it's probably gonna be another 4 years or something like before it's updated, but for future gens and past, they can always admire how much better/op-ish old exhaust was compared to now.","replies":[]}]}
