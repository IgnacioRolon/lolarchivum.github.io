Presently there is already a large number of number changes to Bard on the PBE, so we can expect him to be a little to a lot stronger on the next patch.","replies":[{"poster":"fReAkThEzOiD","date":"2015-03-31T01:45:17.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...isn't it funny that Bard the helper of the good is causing so much rethinking..\nit's like the a little fairy which told you not to code without a proper concept...and now u have to deal with the mess she predicted...
