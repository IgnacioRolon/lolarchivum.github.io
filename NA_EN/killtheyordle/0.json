The character is shit (not even gonna talk about her aesthetics), and virtually null existent. I don&#039;t know what we&#039;ll get for the champion gameplay itself, but I honestly hope it&#039;s good else this champion will be as memorable as Rumble.\n\nSomeone else summed it up well. The Void drives you mad, loneliness drives you mad. She's been in the void for years and lonely for years too, and she just sounds fine and calm? Like, Riot missed such a good chance when it came to her voice lines \"clicking in and out of sanity\" but honestly they missed hard.","replies":[]}
