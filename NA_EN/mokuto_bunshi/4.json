With other dashes like Shens{{champion:98}}  or targeted ones like with Gragas&#039; {{champion:79}} their dash would continue.\nIf this ISN&#039;T a bug then I hope that riot can change to tool tip because its official tool tip says:\n\n&quot; MOUNTED - ACTIVE: Kled and Skaarl dash a fixed distance in the target direction, dealing physical damage to all enemies in their path and gaining 50% bonus movement speed for 1 second. This cannot go through terrain.\nKled and Skaarl mark the first enemy champion or large monster they hit, granting True Sight icon true sight of them and gaining the ability to reactivate Jousting to dash a fixed distance through the marked target, dealing physical damage to all enemies hit. If circumstances permit, this ability can go through terrain.&quot;\n\nThe wiki says &quot;Jousting is a linear dash.&quot;\n\nI could understand this for his second dash witch is labeled as a &quot;Auto-targeted dash&quot;\n\nBut his first one is a &quot;Direction-targeted dash&quot; Just like Shens. And As I said before I know for a fact that Shen using flash to extend or change part of his dash is a staple of high level play.\nI smell a bug.{{champion:240}} \n\n]\\&#039;[","replies":[]}
