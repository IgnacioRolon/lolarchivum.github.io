Change leaver buster.\r\nHere is why:\r\nI try to load into a norms game, duoing with a friend botlane, recently leagues servers and my IPS haven&#039;t been communicating well so I ask him to tell me if the game loads before I load in. This bug has been here every once in a while (1/10 games?) but no biggie, because I can reload as a work around. So I DO, and am relieved I reconnected before 5 mins, like 4:08 ish. I play the game, win bot win game... Then at the end I get NOTHING because I have a leaver buster!\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Lqu7XO0.jpg\r\n\r\nSo I am left thinking, WHY? I CAME BACK, PLAYED MY HARDEST, WON and lets be honest, got back pretty fast considering the bug.\r\nIt DOESN&#039;T have to be this way! Especially not in a norms!\r\nProof that I did what I said I did and even evidence of the bug where I Disconnect and reconnect for a second early on:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/WA23DMLTEsc\r\n\r\nNow, I KNOW that leaver buster will ONLY ban you if you displayed afk behaviors recently, and I admit it, I HAVE. But do you know WHY?\r\nBECAUSE OF THE BUG AGAIN :|\r\n\r\nI could describe the bug in  more detail and even send a ticket, but i&#039;m tired, and this probably wont get as much traction as it needs for the devs to see it anyways.\r\n\r\nTL;DR Loading in late, especially to a bug shouldn&#039;t be grounds for a leaver buster, especially if people can&#039;t even remake...","replies":[]}
