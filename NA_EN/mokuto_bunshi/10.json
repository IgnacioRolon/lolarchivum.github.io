With no % dmg in a tank/bruiser/diver/resistance buidling lane \r\non his abilities (only 2 of which do damage IIRC[Q and W]) He either DOES or DOESN&#039;T do enough damage.\r\n\r\n2 His play patter IS that of a riven when it comes to Q EXCEPT that he locks himself into place casting an AOE not dissimilar from Camille and Darius baring needing another ability to move. Not only that but unlike them this is the primary part of his CC and missing that ability (just by dodging to the weaker part) removes said CC from his combo. Darius still has apprehend and a auto attack-slow, Camile still has her ult and her wall jump stun. Attrox has his W but guess what? It needs his Q to land! Your best bet is to always start with W for the slow then Q and then aim 2nd Q where the W pulls to. Granted, the synergy is nice, but should any part of that ramping CC combo fail you loose most of it...\r\n\r\nOn top of that, his ults move speed, even though nice, doesn&#039;t allow you to more easily land your Q and its CC+damage areas. MAYBE ult giving cast time or your E scaling with Move-speed (for distance or CDR?) would help. However, as it stands he will have to be buffed at least once when he first comes out, probably twice maybe even more than normal due to learning curve.\r\n\r\nWe all know what happens when a champion comes out too weak... The balancing process is a drag.\r\nIf these 2 things are changed I think we have a worthy champion on our hands (I never said he wasn&#039;t fun/satisfying).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{champion:266}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2018-06-17T19:48:23.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone put it\n\nHis name is no longer aatrox\n\nits qqqtrox now","replies":[]}]}
