{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2018-04-20T00:54:47.227+0000","title":"[GAMEPLAY] Kled has 10 bugs and counting! (All listed with recreation some methods)","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":39,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lets go by order of skills and give footage where possible.\n\n{{champion:240}} \n\n**Passive**\n[Mounted]\nThere are 2. \n\n1. Your Dis-Mount passive can FAIL to give you any untargetability for the duration, allowing damage in excess of Skarl's health bar to be counted and pass. The dismount animation still plays behaving as a self CC displacement. (That dismount to the location of ally nexus).\n\nhttps://clips.twitch.tv/RespectfulSpinelessCrabCurseLit\n\nhttps://clips.twitch.tv/TenderGorgeousParrotTwitchRPG\n\n~~Reproduction:\nAs of 8/17/2018 I have successfully learned how to 100% reproduce this bug AND how to use it to your advantage!\nI would like to thank @SkaarlNotFound in the comments below.\nSteps:\n1. Be about to dismount.\n2. When you dismount be next to a wall facing ally nexus.\n3. spam movement in that direction as you dismount to trigger it!~~\nHere is the (NOW FIXED) video I made of the reproduction:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp-yQVLdi3g\n**_FIXED!!!_**\n\n\n2. If you stand in the enemy fountain the pure damage laser will not dismount you for a few seconds. I am not sure if this is Kled or the fountains coding or both causing this odd interaction.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mNvXT91ywQ\nReproduction: Stand in the enemy fountain.\n\n\n[Dis-Mounted]\nNo Known Bugs.\n\n\n**Q **\n[Mounted]\nIf you Teleport in and cast Q if will often fire back to where to TP'ed from. This behaves exactly as your TP+E. Videos below.\nReproduction: Cast Q immediately after teleporting.\n\n[Dis-Mounted]\nThe knock back on Kled's Q has the ability to launch him almost as far backwards (and sometimes in the opposite direction of the kick back) as a Zac's Elastic Slingshot.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cEq0IbQkg0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TnLMspJI0M\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOIj2p0YkjM\nReproduction: Unknown, however it usually occurs near many minions or if Mounted Q is casted as you dismount then you cast Dis-Mounted Q.\n\n\n**W**\n[Mounted]\nThere are 2. \n\n1.  If your W comes off cool down while attacking it makes the sound effect of an empowered (in attack speed) Auto, but does not count towards the 4 count, hence you end up hearing 4 increased AS auto sounds before the final empowered one. The sound is vital for helping count in a busy fight so this bug is a BIG problem. It happens often in a fight because you tend  attack when your W first comes off CD.\nReproduction: Start an auto attack so that W comes of cooldown whilst in animation of said auto attack.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta14J8WUAqM\n\n2. If you level your W while in use, your 4th empowered auto does not occur. This is a huge issue because what would normally give you an edge \n in damage as any other champion in a trade (a level up) either gives you no edge in damage (because you don't level it like me) OR looses you your primary damage.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVz-DhLF670\nReproduction: Level up your W whilst in any stage of your W animation.\n\n[Dis-Mounted]\nThere are 2. \nThe bugs for dismounted W are identical.\n\n\n**E**\n[Mounted]\nThere are 3.\n\n1. As with Mounted Q, your E can cast towards the location of teleport cast instead of the location of the cursor if casted immediately after Teleport.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39jFyERAr80\nReproduction: Cast E immediately after teleporting.\n\n\n2. Your E can fail to follow targets over walls on its second Cast.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2SZ0GEXx5I\nReproduction: Unknown.\n\n3. If you E+Flash (like with a Shen E to skip a target or extend the range) you will flash and then become sudo-self CC'ed to that point for the remaining duration of the E animation, which behaves almost exactly as an entangle. This bug prevents Skill expression on a champion that could really use it.\nBonus1: I didn't find video footage for this one, but I DID find this https://www.reddit.com/r/KledMains/comments/7pckky/til_kled_can_eflash/ what worries me is that RiotExgeniar said that, and I quote \"... I though I made sure that wasn't a thing.\"\nReproduction: Cast E and during the cast also cast Flash.\n\nBonus2: Somehow Kled's E can kill Yorick's Ghouls in a single cast. I am unsure if this interaction is intended.\nKleds E also doesn't work on Yorick's Maiden.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LdwSI5GAJk\nReproduction: Cast E and hit Yorick's Ghouls or Maiden.\n\n[~~Dis-Mounted~~]\n\n\n**R**\n[Mounted]\nKled's Ultimate can produce more than one bug, it is unknown if they are related.\n\n* Change pathing at initial cast from the displayed path of movement (Without player terrain being spawned or altered). [Rare]\nhttps://clips.twitch.tv/RespectfulSpinelessCrabCurseLit (from the earlier footage) As you can see none of the enemy (Kog'maw Zoe Kayne Thresh or Jax) could make terrain HOWEVER there was an Anivia on the ally team. Maybe its connected?\n\n* Change targets while in mid flight [Rare] The example here is even MORE rare because he bush vision (on Janna) is what makes the ult change directions to Kog'maw BEFORE locking on! (At least visually). I believe these are the same bug. Start @40 seconds.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2hLm7XzcjI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=40s\n\nI have new footage of the same (or similar) Targeting bug. My first reaction was to blame flash, but after closer inspection it is likely 2 things. \nThe ult loosing line of sight on the target or out of range and defaulting to _any_ target in range.\nOR\nThe ult having always chosen the closest target which is not documented anywhere that I have seen. Everything seems to say \"it homes in on first enemy encountered\" but this is clearly NOT the case...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMsYlAuR6QM&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\n* Fail to cause damage to targeted enemy. [Common]\nhttps://clips.twitch.tv/BlushingFriendlyHamburgerMoreCowbell\n\n* Divert if Hex-Flash is used. [Reproducable]\n~~Reproduction: The only successfully reproduced bug is using hex flash whilst in ultimate charge.~~ **_FIXED!!!_**\n\n[~~Dis-Mounted~~]\n\nAll these bugs are up to date and repeatable to this day.\nIf we could get a @Riot response for the bugs (or even some clarification on the interactions). That would be awesome.\n\nFor more bugs and updates please look here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/KledMains/comments/7yg3ht/a_post_for_a_post_kled_bugs/\n\nOther posts:\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/16Jv6rgu-gameplay-kled-w-and-r-and-q-and-e-after-tp-and-passive\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/uNvNGKO4-kled-q\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/EYEQtcfA-kled-jungling-bug\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/EB7emzEa-kled-q-fires-the-opposite-direction-after-you-teleport?show=flat","replies":[{"poster":"Aximil","date":"2018-07-27T10:21:00.073+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumping for Kled's sake.","replies":[{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2018-07-27T19:22:42.784+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone actually COMMENTED?!?!
