With and without said range his kit still works, and works well too (no I am not going to ad win/lose ratios until later because it is not needed in the OP).\nMy argument before was that it&#039;s because he is a fast champ and can get in close and get hits off before the enemies can hit him... but that argument holds no water. And on top of all that there are PLENTY of ADCs that have either abilities like his or even a kit like his and individually they do a better job\n\n1. lucians ult does a lot of damage but over time and requires you do keep close to you target (easier said than done XD even using W)\n* jinx Ult rocket beats his ult in early game and late game does missing health and aoe damage anyways, is global.{{champion:222}} \n* Ashes Ult base damage is great and AP scaling is high (at 100% [I know that Ashe usually builds AD bot but that is for another time]) , is global.{{champion:22}} \n*Draven... is draven....  &quot;Draven hurls two massive axes to deal 175/275/375 (+110% bonus Attack Damage) physical damage to each unit struck. Deals 8% less damage for each unit hit (Minimum 40%) and resets when the axes reverse direction.&quot; Is also global {{champion:119}}\n*Ezreal, &quot;winds up for 1 second to fire a long range missile that deals 350/500/650 (+100% bonus Attack Damage) (+90% Ability Power) magic damage to each enemy it passes through. Deals 10% less damage for each enemy hit (minimum 30%).&quot; Burst,also global {{champion:81}} \n*Jhin Has a massive ult range and can fire 4 times with the last bullet being the strongest doing 100% crit and 2X missing health damage. {{champion:202}} \n\nA much more direct comparison can be found with Miss fortunes ult and kog&#039;maws &quot;Bio-Arcane Barrage&quot; (W)\n*M Fortune Does 75% bonus AD and &quot;Each wave can Critical strike icon critically strike, dealing 20%  &times; (1 + bonus critical damage) bonus damage.&quot; Does that damage in a cone.{{champion:21}}\n\n* Kog&#039;Maw Deals only 55% AD BUT does 2+(0.75% per 100 AP) as percent max health damage and he can shoot up to 5 shots per second... that makes it possible (if you have at least nashor&#039;s tooth for AP and 2.5 attack speed from other items) to kill anything even if you could get millions of warmogs in exactly  (7.27272727273) or 7.4 seconds(he fires every .2 seconds). This is not an ultimate ability and I did not include the AD damage that this does... Moving on.   {{champion:96}} \n\n\n\n2. Lucians claim to fame (and what makes him fun Imo) is his run and gun abilities (which to be fair taliyah is great at)\nLooking at it simply though.\n\n*Vayne also has a &#039;dash&#039; in the form of a tumble and can go invisible.{{champion:67}} \n*sivr and draven can speed themselves up.{{champion:15}} {{champion:119}} \n*Caitlin can fire her net backwards to dash forwards.{{champion:51}} \n*Ezreal has a blink (Blink vs a dash in my experience blink wins every time (:  ) {{champion:81}} \n*Jhin gets a ghost every 4th auto attack.{{champion:202}} \n\nNow for lucian, the ability that makes him fast is his W (looking past the fact that it&#039;s usually the last thing upgraded on him and some other chams){{champion:236}} \n\n&quot;marks enemies for 6 seconds.When Lucian or his allies damage a marked target, Lucian gains 60/65/70/75/80 Movement Speed for 1 second.&quot;\n\n&quot;Draven:{{champion:119}} \nMovement Speed bonus decreases rapidly over its duration. Catching a Spinning Axe will refresh the cooldown of Blood Rush.\nDraven gains 40/45/50/55/60% increased Movement Speed for 1.5 seconds and 20/25/30/35/40% increased Attack Speed for 3 seconds.&quot;\n\nSivir: Passive.{{champion:15}} \n&quot;Sivir gains a short burst of Movement Speed when she attacks an enemy champion.&quot;\n\nSivir: Ultimate.{{champion:15}} \n&quot;Sivir rallies her allies for 8 seconds, granting all nearby allies an initial 40/50/60% Movement Speed bonus that reduces to 20% after the first 2/3/4 seconds of On The Hunt elapse.&quot;\n\nSo his flat increase in speed also exists on other champs that scale late game due to percentage.\n\n\nI could keep going for his Q (vs miss fortunes double up maybe and Jhins auto attack) and his kit over all but I just realized how long this post got so I will end it here.\n\nIf you look at lucians kit, Has a damage Q damage speed W a speed/mobility E and a damage R\nOther kits for ADCs also include protection, CC, Utility, True damage, Abilities that lock on(Lucians Q has a delay), % damage, \nand even invisibility and blinds...\n\nSO, my question is this: **Why is lucian as popular as he is (I mean I even like him!), and work as well as he does despite other ADC usually having a leg up in what he already does or having some other bonus in their favour?**\n\nAfter making this thread and seeing the numbers &lt;_&lt; &gt;_&gt; I think imma go play a WHOLE LOT more kog&#039;maw... **Whispers to self**(I bet I can do better than 7.4 seconds...)\n\n]\\&#039;[okuto Bunshi\n\nPeace Out","replies":[{"poster":"Stalinium","date":"2016-08-01T19:37:20.551+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Burst.

And I could probably give some insight over the years. \n\nThe one thing I've noticed is, Lucian's kit is very adaptive to a number of item pathways. The first core build I saw him with was BT and TF. Back the, BT was an offensively minded weapon, with a stacking mechanic. It favored early game bullies because the first to buy it basically won. After patch 4.10, BT got changed to the defensive weapon with the overheal. One of the more experimental builds was BotRK (which was buffed that patch) and Ghost blade. This popped out since, at the time, Lucian's ult scaled with AS, so it technically synergized with the Ghost blade active. And BotRK synergized with his passive. That build however, got dropped in favor of a crit oriented build, because after 4.10, Crit was strong, IE was a rush item, and hyper carries were on top. \n\nOf coarse after the most recent ADC update removed his AS scaling, in favor of flavoring him as a caster. Though on that same patch, ER was changed to be crit oriented, with scaling CDR. That had become the go to Caster build for a little while, basically until the Korean's found that Armor pen, is really good on casters who deal damage with their spells. \n\nAnd over the coarse of that balancing nightmare thanks to how many build he can actually get away with. Riot decided that Lucian over all lacked any meaningful weaknesses. And then decided that his weakness should be his range. \n\nThis might sound like a long rant, But I feel his popularity is part in due to his history. Not just because he's currently good.","replies":[{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2016-08-02T06:16:23.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never really got how the youmu's armor pen worked on his abilities.

And it does so based on base damages as well as the scaling. \n\nIn the Pro Scene, Youmu's is typically built first. And that is due to the fact that Flat penetration is better before people have started buying Armor. (Such as when you fighting the squishy ADC and support) Then build your BC afterwards, when the laning phase is over and tank shred becomes important. Most Caster ADC's can make use of the Flat pen. (Jhin being the other strong Ghost blade user) But Lucian makes good use of BC in particular, due to it's synergy with his ult. (Shreds the Armor really quickly.)\n\nAs for the Whole ER Build. I think the Idea behind it was, these caster champs would have better synergy, if they could rapid fire cast their spells. And even when ER Arguably offers a better late game for such champions. (Because of their crit) The High penetration Builds offer much more damage with the spells themselves, especially early on. But you want to know where the spell slinging nature of ER actually shines? On utiltiy casters such as Ashe and Sivir. They don't particularly use their spells for damage, all pretty much always relied on crit builds anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2016-08-02T21:47:17.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, well I use dusk blade instead of youmu's since its damage got so reduced.

Not a lot of black champions and theres only 1 black adc :P puts me in a bit of an awkward situation.\nAnd I would just like to point something out: \"you have a Q for burst that can hit multiple targets as a laser\"\nYeah... that is what I used to think, turns out:\n\"After a 0.35-second delay, Lucian fires a laser in the direction of the target enemy, dealing physical damage to all enemies in a line.\" So if your fast or have good predict you can (And I have done this) side step his Q.
