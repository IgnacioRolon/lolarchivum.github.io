By definition, assassins assassinate a champion, effectively turning a fight as soon as their assassination is complete. This however, is what makes them SO HARD to do right it seems.\r\n\r\nIn league, death is the best disability, it keeps a player from much for tens of seconds and once they DO revive they have to WALK back to the fight in most cases. When an assassin does its job it can be very frustrating for the other team no matter how much the assassin had to risk or use to take that player out of the picture. Also, just BEING an assassin can be frustrating for the assassin. This can stem from a bunch of reasons, but primarily its that once they get in and blow their burst... they don&#039;t have much else to contribute and usually try to re position to try again.\r\n\r\nNow according to Riots idea lately, an assassin isn&#039;t ALWAYS supposed to take an enemy from high to 0. Rather some excel at taking out more than one low enemy etc but one standard, almost unifying feature is that assassins do their burst, QUICKLY. This was a large reasons for the reworks of {{champion:7}} and {{champion:107}}(to an extent). \r\nWhen you extend an assassins burst window they become something else akin to a combo fighter or a diver that escapes depending. **The problem with this is their kits are not meant to support this kind of play even when its viable.** (This sometimes leads to assassins who can&#039;t assassinate or in rarer cases, ones who still can because they got a buff for that new play style making them better divers.)\r\n\r\nThat being said, Riot seems to be doing experiments to learn what IS the essence of an assassin in league. \r\n(Hopefully how to make them do their jobs, be fun but also be fun to play against/have readable counter play without making burst slow.)\r\n\r\nFirst with the recent introduction {{champion:142}} then {{champion:145}}  and now {{champion:555}} \r\nWhether  its just marketing or not they have all been branded sudo assassins.\r\n\r\nAssassin mage\r\nAssassin Ranged carry\r\nAssassin Support\r\n\r\nAll of these strange, and all of them unique. Love them or hate them. They ARE something we haven&#039;t seen or rather a twist on what we know.\r\n\r\n{{champion:142}} Only keeps her &quot;Assassin&quot; tag as opposed to burst mage because you largely cant see her coming or she moves too fast.\r\nShe still has some of the CC of a regular mage but with her W&#039;s utility being random and her passive being like sheen shes meant for fast burst.\r\n\r\n{{champion:145}}  She is much more similar to a regular assassin, little to no cc, attacks quickly, has a burst combo and targets squishes, ironically though, her weakness is actual assassins because she too is a squishy.\r\n\r\n{{champion:555}} This guy is a HUGE unknown. Traditionally, to get an assassins help you look for a jungle gank or a roam, now he lives in the bot lane with you. He has nearly as much CC as an {{champion:12}} or maybe a {{champion:497}} with stealth similar to {{champion:107}} and an ult to make {{champion:55}} or even {{champion:122}}  type plays.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not drawing any hard conclusions, but I think we are seeing so many assassinesque characters is because Riot themselves are testing what an assassin really is and which aspects a character needs to actually be used as an assassin. \r\nIt could also have to do with assassins not mixing into every class traditionally to get new information and excite players.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m stuck wondering what will be next on this list of champion tests.","replies":[]}
