Cool thing is it may even give interesting data, if sylus matched against certain champs has a higher win rate, maybe those ults are stronger than once thought... and to top it off SOMETIMES the ults are better in his kit that the original. (Seems like older characters where you had to work in spite of a kits weakness in stead of having the answers in the kit would be a good example). Best of all, there is little denying that a good sylus will likely be a good player because good sylus players have to know how any ult they pick up works!\r\n\r\nSeems like he might be a positive addition.","replies":[]}
