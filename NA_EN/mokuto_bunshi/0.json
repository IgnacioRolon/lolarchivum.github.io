He says use portal jump to dodge, when, if you look closely she still got hit and stunned, she just moved.. :/ She's not tricking anyone. Also, according to the vid shes an artillery assassin.\n\nTo be honest I really like zoe, I really do(she herself is an awesome character), but her kit feels... empty. All her dmg is in Q. Her W is fun, but wholly unreliable due to its nature and need to be balanced with good ol fashioned RNG. Mechanically, her E is CC similar to morgana Q. What this leaves you with in a fight is an artillery mage who&#039;s whole kit lets me sleep ONE person into position(E), then use your R (either forward or backwards relative to targe for max dmg) in conjunction with Q to do a single slight shot for an AOE of dmg thats SUPER DAMAGING... but in less area than arcane comet. Its FEELS like a jayce&#039;s shockblast and Acceleration Gate but instead you use R and Q. Difference is, jayce has a HUGE kit that isn&#039;t just primarily that one combo...\n\nHer kit as a whole feels like a stereotypical artillery mage&#039;s except its more risk/reward for landing the shots and you have some close range outplay potential. But that&#039;s it, she shoots one (or two) skill shots, uses some auto weaving maybe as her primary combo, and repeats.\n\nHer ult is the trickster part but the issue is its the same as if you got rooted then knocked forward and knocked back. I&#039;m defiantly stealing, but how am I tricking anyone of anything? If anything I am telling them where I&#039;ll be in 1 second! It doesn&#039;t feel like I can use it to trick them (see zed shadow, leblanc blink)  if they see my origin, any OTHER champ with a skill shot knows where to fire.\n\nI know I use the word &quot;feel&quot; a lot and compare to other champs, but thats because this champ makes me feel a lot of ways.\nMorgana Q with small delay.\nzed blink while rooted and without control.\nThen nidalee(or small aoe xerath shot)\nand repeat. Her only abilities that give the idea of a trickster are her E and R\n\nMaybe if her Q had lots of interactions like throwing it then taking a ryze ult it would be a good wombo (I&#039;m aware this interaction doesnt work)\nMaybe if her Q mg was cut in half so that she could use both casts of it to actually TRICK someone.\nMaybe if her W was able to hit more than one champ after if landed on the ground .\nMaybe if her E was more prominent in her kit as a combo or even outplay tool.\nMaybe if her passive wasn&#039;t just more dmg.\nMaybe if her R didn&#039;t wasn&#039;t just a reaching too and could actually TRICK someone. Or any of her kit for that matter.\n\nMaybe, like her personality, she'd be more fun...","replies":[{"poster":"option paralysis","date":"2017-11-19T17:16:52.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here, I was excited when they said it's gonna be a burst mage... then I see this lil gurl and was big time disappointed. another champ with ult that does no dmg, gimmicky shit with E and Q. either UP or OP. bad champ.","replies":[{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2017-11-19T17:29:08.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=useless nihilist,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zKdAhByE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-19T17:16:52.429+0000)\n>\n>  gimmicky shit. either UP or OP. bad champ.\n\nPretty much sums up Certainly T's champion designs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2017-11-19T23:57:53.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually don't mind champs with ults that do no dmg AT ALL or ones with low cooldowns for small effects:\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:126}}  ETC\n\n\nMy issue personally is that rather than using her ult to \"trick\" people. Its slow to dodge a lot of things if you don't know they are already coming. And rather than tricking anyone... you guarantee you position for 1 second. In a team fight, that opining spells DEATH, not trickery like a zed, leblanc, etc. On top of all that, you cant control her Ults, speed, duration, whether it sends you back(see her lore, that was actually NOT her original power, it was a mistake :P). Her W seems like it doesn't need to be controlled due to its nature.\n\nEdit: also, the fact that shes a single target mage is interesting/odd. Her Q IS aoe but its small enough that its seems like single target.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NTrumpWeTrust","date":"2017-11-19T21:12:29.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, Certainly T designed it so yeah, it's gonna be garbage and disappointing","replies":[{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2017-11-19T23:58:49.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know who certainly T is actually or even what he does... but it would be wise not to point to an individual involved in a creative process.","replies":[{"poster":"AlistarMilking","date":"2017-11-21T03:01:58.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's the guy who designed {{champion:122}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:157}}  {{champion:429}}, and reworked {{champion:82}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:19}} .\n\nHe gets a lot of hate for making Yasuo and Kalista hypermobile overloaded messes that everyone hates playing against, and for Morde's failed update.

Should I use sums on her with low cooldowns like barrier and ghost along with CDR boots summoner specialist and cosmic insight?  (108 second cooldown) or maybe smite with those things(45 seconds cooldown)?

Her auto-passive and W suggest she needs to be in close-mid range, but for a close-mid range champ, not only doesn't she have tools to survive, but she actively locks her self down at medium range (albeit in 2 different locations) for one second. Forbid if you team begins to back-step while your setting up a skill shot (forwards or backwards). You wont have the mobility to get out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2017-11-19T23:49:48.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo, guys. I agree that she needs more to do in team fights (Outplay if shes NOT a mage or other combos if she is etc). But to be clear my stance on the champ her self is that its amphibious and IS good as a character. If I was only looking at her cute/annoying/mischievous/trickster personality. Id give her a SOLID 9/10. This thread is more to discuss her mechanics. I am bringing this up because I see the conversation might get cluttered away from mechanics and go off topic into whether a cute character fits into the game *EHEM*{{champion:117}} *EHEM* \nAnyways stay chill yall.","replies":[]}]}
