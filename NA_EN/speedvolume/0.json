At least show a warning when someone gets reported frequently (unless they're false reports) or SOME form of feedback. If you're going to be that harsh on mere words, it would be MUCH more helpful for game health to focus that energy on people intentionally trolling in-game, inting, afking etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Drugoth","date":"2017-07-13T20:20:05.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"As far as I'm aware, you do get feedback from the system when you've been reported.","replies":[{"poster":"SirLime","date":"2017-07-13T20:25:11.214+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=3SheetsTotheWind,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=PVEOEOcE,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2017-07-13T20:20:05.586+0000)\n>\n> As far as I&#x27;m aware, you do get feedback from the system when you&#x27;ve been reported.\n\nNope.

It was mainly just a disagreement about champion viability and apparently that's not allowed on here. I NEVER received ANY warning. The first thing was a chat restriction for 10 games and the \"evidence\" was complete BS. Even totally out of context so as to make me look crazy and angry, it still seemed like complete BS. People control what you can say if they don't like it even if you are not objectively being rude about it. However, that's not what's under discussion now. You do NOT get any warning prior to punishment as the game is now and you also never get any notification of having been reported for any game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpeedVolume","date":"2017-07-13T21:29:16.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually it would for me.
