As of today, the game started straight up freezing before i updated my AMD drivers, it started freezing every 10-20 seconds for a few seconds soon after my computer started prompting me for the update.  Then I updated, and the freezing would happen every 4-5 seconds.  I found out this problem was somehow due to razer synapse from my keyboard and have disabled it.  However, the ping spikes still occur in the bot game im testing it in right now.  It could be my router but im not sure as my ping was fine 2 weeks ago. Please help me riot my 5v5 team needs me.","replies":[{"poster":"El Viejo1899","date":"2016-10-04T05:29:14.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got this from a player.  It has to do with the new windows update.  You need to go to XBOX icon.  Create an account if necessary.  When XBOX menu appears look for gear settings icon.  Click on DVR.  Switch from ON to OFF.  \n\nI exited and rebooted and now game is back to 158 FPS from 55 and do not have any more 'freezing' of game.\n\nIf this works let me know.
