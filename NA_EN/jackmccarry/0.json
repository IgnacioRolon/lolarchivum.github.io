It's true. There are excuses. It is a recurring problem that many, probably all, regular players suffer. It's not a very frequent occurrence, but enough to be disruptive- that is, at least 1 in 20 games, it happens.\n\nEdit: i mean if it might be that frequent, it is a significant problem.\n\nI am inclined to say that being positive can help prevent it, but this is more severe behavior that cannot be justified and should be punished.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2020-01-25T19:06:41.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno man,  sometimes I say yes to everything to dismiss the toxics.
