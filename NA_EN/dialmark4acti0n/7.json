I'm usually a co-op only player because I get very emotional and go on tilt faster than a carnival ride, but I wanted the pretty icons so off I go.\n\nIt all began in champ select when I got handed captain and had to ban.  I never played draft or ranked before.  I was like 'Crap, what do I do now?!  WHO DO I BAN?'  Thankfully someone else on my team (Thank you I Am Splur) had a calmer head and thawed my head after I froze up and we wound up getting the other team to ban one of our own choices for us, scoring a free ban against them.  Nobody wants to deal with Akali.  Tristana makes it through and is picked up by the enemy team.  We later realize that, because I own every champion, the enemy team wasted all their bans on dangerous champions I don't play and nobody else owns.  Score.\n\nI picked Garen because I've always been comfortable on bruisers and I thought we might want someone tanky and annoying.  As we go into the match I realize I forgot to pick my summoner spells, got {{summoner:6}} {{summoner:7}} .  Whoops.\n\nI figure out how teleporting works easily enough and it's game on.  Lots of early aggression.  Takes us a while to work up the nerve to go for Xerath, but finally the enemy team makes a move when we're all pretty low, except for me because Garen.  A light bulb forms in my head as Xerath begins to drop.  I look at the summoner spells I defaulted to.  Hmm...  Heal gives movement speed now, right...?\n\nDecisive Strike.  Fast.\n{{summoner:6}} Faster.\n{{summoner:7}} Warp Speed!\n\"DEMACIA!\"\n\n\"An allied champion {{champion:86}} has ascended!\"\n\nWow.  They don't call it Spin to Win for nothing!\n\nI don't know if it quite happened like that but it was pretty awesome either way.  The enemy team never really forgave me for that one...  Especially not after I died, came back, and stole it off them a second time.  At that point I became the primary target for everybody on the enemy team, which let our Miss Fortune score two later Ascensions pretty much uncontested.  After four deaths I had my Black Cleaver and most of a Banshee's Veil, at which point their four-glass-cannon-plus-Malphite team seemed to collectively realize I had become a raid boss - I wasn't as tanky as our Mundo but I hurt a lot more.  The best thing they could have done for me was kill me considering I had several thousand gold to spend!  I happily spent the rest of the match chasing people down and killing them, ending Legendary with a 10-kill streak with our team scoring a perfect ascension.\n\nI don't think my Ascension experience will ever top this first game.","replies":[{"poster":"BewareTheDragon1","date":"2014-09-11T14:23:09.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spin steals are the best. {{champion:23}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Major Yikes","date":"2014-09-11T16:27:19.195+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"imo its really sloppy. i have a really hard time telling what i can/cant see, the bordes on the map look like normal FoW, so i run into them not knowing why i stopped, the ascension buff actually feels like a huge debuff to non mobile champs cause people can see you 24/7 and just kill you. the very first game i played was basically my team dying 1v5/dying to xerath/asking wtf is this wtf is that wtf do i do. its way too hard to fight anyone cause the vision interrupted by bushes and walls every 2 inches.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Castanean","date":"2014-09-11T14:07:36.149+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My first game of Ascension was as...
