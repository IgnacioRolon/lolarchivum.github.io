I feel like I owe you the truth for reading my long posts about a video game's lore where I basically geek out about League of Legends, and for sharing such sweet and encouraging comments alongside some cool theories and comments about how much you also love League of Legends and its lore. You loyal readers of this series, have been very friendly and nice to me and I hope we can continue to do this together, or it just wouldn't be the same.\n\nSo, why haven't there been any discussions lately? Well, to be frank, I've just been missing time. Have I been super busy with work? No. Have I been facing personal issues? Oh no. Have I been away of the computer a lot? Nope. The truth is, I haven't had time, in the sense, that I couldn't reserve time for this. I can be a very stressful person sometimes and I like to just chill and watch YouTube videos, or watch TV, listen to music, or play video games (not just LoL). The time I spend with these things help me keep calm and just alleviate my stress. I end up being less bound to get mad about every little thing in my life if I do this and it works. And, although I do this series for fun, it's just me, and it's a lot of work. None of my so called friends that play League bother to read my discussions and sometimes, I don't even realize how much of you enjoy my discussions. I guess, sometimes I feel alone... But, that's not the point. The point is that I don't want to give up my stress-free time, to something that sometimes can make me stressful (\"I need to hit the deadline!!\" sort of thing). Sometimes, I like to just chill and watch The Avengers. Sometimes, I like to play SMITE, LoL, Hearthstone, Bastion. Sometimes I just like to hear all the reviews I can on the new Smash Bros. for Wii U. Some of these things I can't talk about to my friends, so I like to hear from and/or play with people that do like these things. Thusly, I've been missing time and energy, in a way, to do the series.\n\nBut, that's not all. The single thing that threw me off my schedule and made me realize all this, was the lack of inspiration. Honestly, I thought doing the topic that won the poll two weeks ago, \"The Battlecast Secret\", would be really cool. But, in the end, I was lacking inspiration or motivation to write this one. I mean, it wasn't as interesting or huge as the theories I had on Orianna, for example. It was just a theory about the potentially teased new champions that would come out in the future. It wasn't even that much involved to lore, or the champions we know and love. And, now, that's where the poll comes in. My lack of inspiration and ideas to write that post made me realize that the poll system makes me talk about what JUST SOME of YOU guys want to read the most, and not what I want to write about. That's cool and all, and I love all the topics you suggest, but the truth is, I can't simply grab a topic chosen by you and be as excited as I would be if I had chosen the topic. My first two discussions, \"The Darkin\" and \"The Master of Shadows\" were on topics I had chosen by myself, and honestly, those are the discussions I was most happy with the way they turned out. And then there was the \"Who is Jax?\" discussion, that is ultimately my worst discussion to date, in my opinion. That was THE FIRST topic chosen by you guys, and while it was a cool topic, it just didn't hit all the right buttons for me. Don't get me wrong, the poll isn't going away and the poll certainly isn't something bad, but it's something that restrains me, more than it should. I mean, the \"Jinx and Vi\" discussion, is arguably the one that turned out the best. And was pretty fun to make.\n\nAnother thing that you guys may not think about too, is I get 0 physical reward (e.g. money, RP) for all the work I put into my discussions. It's for fun, so I don't mind. But, I can't simply kill myself working for something I'm not hyped for and not be compensated in some way. Reading your comments and your feedback is seriously one of the only reasons I even made this a weekly series. But, with all that has been said, I've ultimately made a decision. **\"Facts, Myths and Theories\" is no longer a weekly series.** What does this mean? I'm not sure yet. I think the discussions will still come out on Wednesdays, as they have been during the time the series was weekly, but I'll probably just post it anytime and you guys can just find the discussion on the boards. But, now, I'm not going to release them weekly necessarily. Sometimes, it will be one for the whole month, sometimes it will be weekly or sometimes it will be biweekly. I'd love to try and make it stay weekly, but my life doesn't accommodate that too well. You can still keep track of when my discussions come out by following me on Twitter: @dialMARK4acti0n. After all, that is why I even created that Twitter account. If I get a perfect schedule some time, of course it will become weekly again, and honestly, I'll try to put out a new discussion every week even with this arrangement but if I don't, it just meant I couldn't that week and I wasn't obliged to do it that week. \n\nThe poll is going to change too. For starters, there will be a little less topics to choose from each discussion, but **the poll will not decide the next topic.** I'll look in the poll to see what topics interest you most, but in the end, I'll always write about something I'M excited about. This will mean better discussions, hopefully, and make me more excited to make sure the discussion is made. The topics in the poll will most likely be done eventually at some point, but I myself will always choose what topic to talk about next. Imagine, the next champion gets a new lore, I can just talk about that, instead of the poll winner. This was something that I always wanted to put in effect, so consider this the official announcement.\n\nIn the end guys, I love writing these and I couldn't have nicer or better fans. Honestly, I do these for myself, just as much as I do these for you. I love your comments, probably more than you love my discussions honestly ^^ I hope you guys and I can continue to talk about lore and share our love for these topics and this awesome game for... who knows how long! Thank you for everything.\n\nYour fellow summoner,\n\n**dialMARK4acti0n**","replies":[{"poster":"LordHippoman","date":"2014-11-21T23:09:28.216+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're one of the best posters we've had in a really long time, Mark.

I love your discussions and am willing to wait to see those great thories, I've been here since your talk on the master of shadows, and I'd rather you do theories on what you love and make great sprawling concepts then force yourself to come up with something that meets a topic. \n\n\nSo take your time, I'm willing to wait, and many others are as well.

I completely understand the bit about having no inspiration do fulfil a request since I get art requests once in a while I have zero interest in but if it comes from a friend, I'll feel bad about saying no so I half-ass my way through it and feel even worse when I give them a piece of crap and end up feeling that I maybe shouldn't have done it after all. Not that I'm saying your writing is crap, though! I wouldn't be checking every week for your series otherwise. xD\n\nTo be honest, I think you might want to consider removing the poll entirely and just writing whatever you want when you have the time. Your articles are fascinating to read and analyse no matter what topic they are on. Having a poll, even if you don't plan to pick the top-voted option, might pressure you and put a damper on your creativity and inspiration. That's the last thing we, you and us readers, want.\n\nSo yeah, you don't really have to do Battlecast as the next topic. I'll happily read anything you produce! ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hissael","date":"2014-11-26T21:16:15.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was checking the board on every Wednesday just to read your awesome posts. It was a great pleasure to read and think about your theories and have been enjoying it lately. I think you made some great decision about the future of the series and I believe your posts will be better than ever after after the break and when you find the inspiration to write. I suppose you getting to choose which topic you want to talk, like you did at the first place, will make it even easier to discuss and get inspired to write. I can't wait to read your next post. I hope you will have a fruitful break.
