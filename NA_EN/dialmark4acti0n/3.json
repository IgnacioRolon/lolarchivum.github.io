Don't worry, plenty of people make that same mistake (and still do, guilty myself)  \n\nI got your reply though!\n\nWhen it comes to formatting, I actually have a post about that very same deal, but it's incredibly out of date right now. I really need to go about updating that.....\n\nAnyway, I'll give an up to date summary:  \n\n1) **Break a wall o' text up** to pertinent sections.  Using \n\n* bullets (\"*{space}\")\n  * sub-bullets (\"{space}{space}*{space}\")\n* headers (created with a \"#\" at the beginning of a line)\n* horizontal dividers (created with \"---\")  \n* pictures \n\nand others can make  post read by much faster as well as helps constrain your explanation to easy to digest bits. To really see the effect of this go get a news article form online, read it, copy it into word and take out all the indents, bullets and what not and it will read very differently.   \n\nA great header strategy to us (as it goes all the way across the post) is using a quote block (\">\") and a Header (\"#\") for sections. (Credit to *Stephenizgod* for that trick)\n\n>#An Example of Such  \n\n\n2) Use **Bold** to draw attention and *italics* to emphasize. i.e. use Bold for keywords that you want to stuck out, use italics for 'hot' words like *disastrous* or *horrible* or *amazing* or even *this/that*.  \n\n3) Don't ramble. This one is hard for me, I mean really hard, lol. A good way to prevent this is to read your post out loud after you write it up. Make sure it's out loud too, you have to physically hear your own words. This also massively helps with typos.  \n\n4) **BACK UP REGULARLY**. If you're planning on writing a long post, back it up on notepad, word, Google Drive, anything. Nothing will kill your writing mood faster than losing possibly hours of work due to a crash, a backspace button hit or any other problem. It's gotten me several times, and I'll never wish that frustration on anyone.   \n\n> 5) Try to stay neutral where possible. I strategy I like doing in my [[SALT]](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/RepiRzVn-so-i-heard-you-want-to-debate) series is outline the discussion as unbiased as I can (It's nigh impossible to do perfectly so don't slave over it too much) and then detail my own opinion in a separate section. The reason this helps out is because if you seem too judgmental or aggressive in your stance it'll prevent shy-er people from stating their own opinions. For a good discussion you *want* as many people to disagree with you as people that agree with you, that shows you found a great topic!  \n\n> 6) Finally, never write expecting a red response. Ever. They're usually reading it trust me, but they have a very tough time commenting due to how much visibility their presence gives. I'm not at all saying it's impossible, but imho it's better to write a post for the community and if a Red stops by as well it's an awesome bonus!\n\nAs a brief example of number 3, these last two tips aren't related to formatting and are a real example of how hard it is to not ramble on sometimes :P","replies":[{"poster":"dialMARK4acti0n","date":"2014-07-31T18:44:27.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man!

Find something interesting to talk about! By that, I mean, finding something that the community could have a discussion around, rather than something that people can just answer yes/no to.  (Although, polls can be fun!) \n\n**Visuals can be helpful!** Aside from pulling attention, visuals can help illustrate what you're talking about. For example, if you're talking about a new skin idea, maybe sketch it out. \n\n**No wall of text, pls.** Sure, you might have a lot to say on the subject, and that's totally cool! Try breaking your thoughts into paragraphs, and posting them logically. It'll be easier for everyone to follow, and people who check out your post won't be intimidated by a bunch of text on their screen. Bolding important ideas is also a good call! \n\n**Try to be positive**. You may not be a fan of a recent change to your favorite champion. We still want to hear about it! However, keep in mind that a post like, \"THIS CHAMP SUCKS, PLS NERF\" is probably not going to get a good response, whereas a post like, \"I really don't like the changes made [champion's skill] because I think it really makes laning phase more difficult now. Anyone else noticing this?\" will receive a better response. Quite simply, there's a discussion to be had, rather than someone just stating a negative opinion, which can turn some people off to responding. \n\nGood luck posting!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sunfield","date":"2014-07-31T22:59:46.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Comment on a hot topic.\n\nProfit","replies":[]}]}
