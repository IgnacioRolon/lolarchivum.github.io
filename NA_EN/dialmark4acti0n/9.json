{"poster":"dialMARK4acti0n","date":"2014-10-06T20:09:01.523+0000","title":"Welcome forum users!!! Where are we?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":7,"down_votes":7,"body":"Hello forum users!! And:\r\n\r\n# **Welcome to the Boards!**\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vwMin.gif\r\n\r\nI send you the most warm of welcomes to you! It has come to the community's attention that today's a very big day for you. That's the reason we are here talking today. See, over the last few months the Boards have been in Beta and now the Boards are ready to make the big move and replace the old vBulletin forums as the community's main go-to website to express their opinions as a community. Well, at least in NA. Now, you may have tons of questions, such as:\r\n\r\n- Why the change?\r\n- What are the rules?\r\n- Where are all the sub forums?\r\n- How do you create and format your posts?\r\n- What are the coolest new features I need to know about?\r\n- Any cool events on the boards that you can recommend?\r\n\r\nI'll try my best to answer these questions and I hope I can enlighten you with this post! My main goal with this post is to hopefully show you that, although you probably liked the forums and don't want to change things up, the boards have soooo much to offer! Also, **I should point out that I never wrote on the old forums. I just read them from time to time, but very rarely! So, please, keep that in mind!** Now, without further a due...\r\n---\r\n# WHY?\r\nWell, very basically, it's because the old forums had issues that needed solving and Riot couldn't really work with the old forums, so they created the new Boards to make it easier for us, the community, and for them, the community managers. **For more details, please [read this Red Post!](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/riot-official/EeUfMGHE-making-the-full-transition-to-boards)**\r\n---\r\n# THE RULES\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/02k01QP.png\r\n\r\nAlrighty then! What are the rules in the boards? Well, each sub-board has its own sets of rules, but I'll get into that later. As for the boards in general, I heavily suggest reading [this post](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/QMLzFo0N-universal-rules). It's made by [**Tamat**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/Tamat?content_type=all), a Rioter that works hard to manage the boards, so if you really want to know the rules, read his post. I can't add much to that since I don't make the rules so... let's move on! ^^\r\n---\r\n# BOARDS FORMATTING\r\n\r\nI hate to redirect you again, but Sir ArmaMalum (who isn't a Rioter btw), goes into this topic pretty in-depth [**in this post**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/YHPBc6k3-board-formatting-101), and I'd highly recommend checking it out if you want to know how to make:\r\n\r\n# This\r\n> this\r\n\r\n***or even this***\r\n\r\n* maybe\r\n* even\r\n* some\r\n* of\r\n* these\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/b2ckPLc.jpg\r\nWOW PICTURES!!\r\n\r\nHe also goes really in-depth on how to make your posts be easier on the eyes and how to make a post look better in general. But, before you start formatting a discussion, you need to create it. \"Oh dialMARK4acti0n! But how will I ever do this? I have no idea!\". Have no fear! I'll explain!\r\n---\r\n# HOW TO CREATE A DISCUSSION\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8zf3Ayv.png\r\n\r\nActually, this is pretty easy! See that button on the left of the page? Yeah, the one under the board list! It's big and says \"Create a Discussion\". Click it. There you go. Next topic!\r\n\r\nIn all seriousness though, you might want to know what to do next. And that's totally comprehensible! Well, you could start by writing in the box down below. You're able to see a preview of what the post will look like as a final product, below the box. You can also create polls on the \"Create a Poll\" button and introduce the poll's data there. But, what should I talk about? What will make a great discussion? Welp! These questions are up to you, man! It's all up to you ;) Just keep in mind you can edit your post anytime you like, but you can't edit the title OR the poll!\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WCerGjG.png\r\n\r\nIf you have something to talk about, starting a discussion has never been easier!\r\n---\r\n# COOLEST NEW FEATURES\r\nWell, images showing up on your post and being able to share links are just some of the new features. You also have attachments. The comments are now in discussion form (sort of like YouTube), but you can set it to the chronological view if you wish, and the comment section becomes just like a forum thread. There's actually way more planned content to come out in the future like subscriptions for example. Don't take my word for it though! And the Red Tracker works better than ever.\r\n\r\nUpvotes and downvotes are a thing now too! And there's also the Post of the Day (PotD). Every day, [**Riot Baconhawk**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/Riot%20Baconhawk) makes a post, Post of the Day, which puts it on top of the main page and gets it some more exposure. I've gotten this privilege a couple of times, but anything from concepts, memes or lore discussions can be named Post of the Day.  (Speaking of Baconhawk, keep an eye out for her in your favorite discussion, she just might show up in the comment section. She is a Rioter that supports the boards intensively and is super interactive with the boards' community! Keep an eye out for her and tell her that dialMARK4acti0n sends cheers!)\r\n\r\nBut, honestly, I can't even begin to talk about all the cool features on the Boards, so let's move on.\r\n---\r\n# THE \"SUB-BOARDS\"\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HVq4fJf.png\r\n\r\nWell, technically each topic IS a board, that's why it's called the boards, but y'know. Each board has its own set of rules and you shouldn't post things on the wrong board (trust me). When you enter each Board, if you look to the left of the page, under the list of all the boards, you'll see a short description of what that Board's all about, but I'll just help you out and write it here.\r\n# [Boards Feedback](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback)\r\n\r\nDo you hate how you can't subscribe to a user and you want to suggest this to the Boards team? Don't like Boards' color scheme? This is the place for you! Write any feedback or suggestions you have for the boards here.\r\n\r\n# [Esports](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/esports)\r\n\r\nStill moping around TSM's defeat against Samsung White? Or C9's defeat against Samsung Blue? Really hate Samsung for ending both your favorite american teams? Do you find it funny both TSM and White, and C9 and Blue, having both a white color scheme? Can't get enough of Phreak saying Mantarrrrraya all the time? This are the boards for you! Feel free to discuss anything in the world of Esports here.\r\n\r\n# [Community Creations](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations)\r\n\r\nIf you make something, or create anything League of Legends related, like fanfic or fan art, this is definitely the place to go! Just make sure not to post skin or champion concepts here.\r\n\r\n# [Memes &amp; Games](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes)\r\n\r\nThis is where you come and post funny memes, or talk about funny memes, and/or talk about League of Legends' games, like that game where you got a Pentakill as Sona, for your first time! Stuff like that.\r\n\r\n# [Miscellaneous](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous)\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous. If it doesn't belong in all other boards, it goes here. Should I say more?\r\n\r\n# [Announcements](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/riot-official)\r\n\r\nThis is a board STRICTLY for Rioters! This is where they announce the next champion or a new skin for Karma, and stuff like that. You can't post anything here, but you can read it!\r\n\r\n# [Maps &amp; Modes](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/summoners-rift)\r\n\r\nThis is where you post your fan-made map or feature game mode ideas, talk about the current maps and modes and talk about the newest feature game mode!\r\n\r\n# [Gameplay &amp; Balance](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance)\r\n\r\nWant to remind Riot how insanely broken Lulu mid is? Or how insanely stupid Azir's E is? Post it here. The title is pretty self-explanatory. Don't report bugs here though.\r\n\r\n# [Skin &amp; Champion Concepts](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts)\r\n\r\nThis where you post skin and champion concepts... Or anything related to those things... Next!\r\n\r\n# [Story &amp; Art](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art)\r\n\r\nSo, this is basically the place where you TALK about League of Legends' lore and art, like Maokai's new lore or Kog's new splash, and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\n# [Report a Bug](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report)\r\n\r\nPretty self-explanatory, although you should follow this guide on how to report a bug and not simply... report a bug.\r\n\r\n# [GD](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/mNBeEEkI)\r\n\r\nSo, old forum users will know this as \"General Discussion\". Although, the new GD is considered a \"board\", it's actually a board completely separate from other boards. The comments in the GD are also, just like the old forums by default. So, if you miss the old forums, this is probably the way to go. Also, the GD is where you can post ANYTHING. So, keep that in mind.\r\n\r\n# [Help &amp; Support](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/osqw6G4M)\r\n\r\nThis one is there for you to ask for help to resolve any issues you may be having with the game or the boards. This, however, doesn't mean you should post things like \"Help me because I'm in Bronze V!\", but more like, \"I bought Neon Strike Vi, one day before the sale...\"\r\n\r\nAnd that's all the Boards we have at the moment. There's a place for everyone! **And don't worry RPers, I didn't forget you. Tamat has said that they're working on a solution for the RP boards as we speak! REJOICE!!**\r\n---\r\n# SO... ANYTHING COOL GOING ON I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?\r\nWell, the community here in the Boards was pretty small before all of you got here. But have no fear! There ARE some cool events and series here in the Boards as of right now. \r\n\r\nYou should check out the [Champion Concept Contest](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/tExstuGG-ccc-october-champion-concept-contest) by [**Sir ArmaMalum**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/Sir%20ArmaMalum), where each month, people can enter with a champion contest and receive prizes and have their concept evaluated by judges, at the end of the month! It's pretty cool. There's also [Lore Discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/kppGyEOI-lore-discussion-omni-post) by [CaptainMårvelous](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/CaptainM%C3%A5rvelous), where each week, a topic of the reader's choice is discussed, like \"the Black Rose\" or \"Who is C?\", for example. I'm also just starting series of my own, as of very recently, which is pretty similar to Lore Discussion called [\"Fact, Myths and Theories\"](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/EookJA38-the-darkin-facts-myths-and-theories), so if you'd like, please give it a look and tell me what you think! ;)\r\n---\r\n# FINAL WORDS\r\nNow, you're all ready to go with some of the basics. But... \"what now?\", you may be thinking... Well, that's totally up to you! You could go and check out some discussions and comment. You could share your champion concepts, or your opinions on any subject. You can do whatever you want!\r\n\r\nUnderstandably, you may miss the old forums now and not like the changes. But, just keep in mind that the Boards and Forums have something very similar to each other! They were both created as a means of the community talking about their favorite game. It's a place for us to enjoy and celebrate the fact that League of Legends is something we love, and that we want to share it with others! I hope you all get accustomed to the new Boards and that from now onward, we can have fun and be joined as a community, together!\r\n\r\nHere's to the new Boards and to a happy community! Cheers guys!\r\n\r\nhttp://media0.giphy.com/media/GCLlQnV7wzKLu/giphy.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2014-10-06T21:12:21.798+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Welcome forum users!!!
