The only thing I see is an ugly bearded guy in a wolverine(?) skin who tripped as he was sprinting...there is so much more to Udyr than that which they could have exploited and featured. His stance changes, his communing with the spirits, all of which could have given his figure more detail and flesh out his identity. I now have less information about Udyr, what he looks like, or what he does than before.","replies":[{"poster":"Kinjishi","date":"2014-11-06T22:28:37.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.

I think SGU is still awesome. Though this new splash makes me cry every time since I played Udyr since I started LoL. :'D But SGU has more in his textures and voice. Unless they make a texture update for Udyr, then I might have to think on it. But his VU will only smooth his animations (a little), change his clothes, and we may see some new coloring on his skin and furs.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"exe3","date":"2014-10-10T23:09:09.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotta be honest.
