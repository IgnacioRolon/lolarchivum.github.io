YET!! You'll see... I'll be on posters all over Super Bowl and US Open in 10 years. Now, let's get serious for a second. Last week's poll had a few issues and bugs and that is why it had so little options last week, so I'm sorry about that. This week the poll will be back in action... I hope... I'll only know when I post this of course. x) I have a bad taste in my mouth after last week's discussion not coming out that great (I'll talk about Jax again someday I promise!), so what are we waiting for?!! There's lore to be discussed here!\n\nBut before we start, let's just explain what \"Facts, Myths and Theories\" is to anyone that just now discovered this series exists. **This is a series where I talk about a Lore-related topic every week. I grab what we know, what we don't know and mesh these together to form - you guessed it - theories, to try and crack the lore wide open.** So, let's get going with this week's topic already! That's what we're all here for!\n---\n# **This Week's Topic:** Jinx and Vi's Family Ties\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0Eh9Lo3.jpg\n\nAnd before you ask... Yeah, the rhyme was on purpose. It's what I do... Now, **Jinx and Vi are two crazy ladies!** Seriously... One's a cop who just wants to punch stuff and the others a criminal who just wants to blow up stuff. They do make quite the pair, don't they? Yes, they do. That is just one of the reasons that makes people believe they might be sisters. Of course, this isn't a very good reason to think that. But, don't worry... this is called \"**Facts**, Myths and Theories\" for a reason.\n\nThe fact is, that ever since the Howling Abyss was released, people started to patiently wait for Vi's sister being released. \"Why?\", I hear you ask. Well. It's pretty simple actually. Do you guys know **Lyte**? You know. Lyte, the Hermit...! Ezreal's uncle!! **The elderly inventor, that has a pet robot named Geeves, who travelled to the Freljord to investigate about the Watchers and the Iceborn?!** Anyone? ...the purple side shopkeeper from Howling Abyss... Man, please tell me somebody knew who he was! Anyway, Lyte's from Piltover and, naturally, he has quite a few special lines for most of the Piltover champions that visit his store, during a heated match of ARAM. Vi, of course, also has special interactions made for her. And one of them is what sparkled the community's uproar that Vi's sister would soon be joining the League of Legends. I quote (boy, I love these):\n\n# *\"You look like your sister! Er, wait, I'm not supposed to talk about that...\"*\n\nSo yeah! If you didn't squeal like a 9 year-old girl when you heard this my friend, you have a heart of ice. Get it? 'Cause the Howling Aby... yeah, not funny... Couldn't resist. Clearly, Riot put that in there to tease us... and it worked. But, **when Jinx was being teased by Riot, A LOT of us (by which I mean everyone) just assumed she'd be Vi's sister.** It had been a few months after we were teased by Lyte, everyone's favorite hermit, so it fit. But... the question still remains to this day. **Are they sisters or what?**\n\nI have some theories... but first, buckle up my friend, because we're about to go over some facts!\n---\n# **The Facts**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/S6x0lJl.png\n\nSo, we already know for sure that Vi has a sister and that she may be older, due to Lyte saying Vi looked like her, which is something you usually say to the youngest siblings (trust me, I'm the youngest in my family). However, **we also know that Lyte says that he isn't 'supposed to talk about that'...** what could that mean? Did Vi's sister pass away? Does Vi not know she has a sister? Maybe Vi dislikes her sister and doesn't like to talk about her? Lyte knows more than he seems to share with us... But what about Jinx? What proof is there that she even has a sister? Well, it's actually something she says herself in-game:\n\n# *\"You think I'm crazy? You should see my sister!\"*\n\nSo, that's a wrap folks! Both of them have a sister. That's a fact! But, surely, we can cement this statement by showing some other conclusive proof that helps us make sure that they both have a sister. Well, Jinx at least... You see, back when Jinx was teased with the graffiti on Vi's page a while back, **Vi wasn't the only one to have her profile page vandalized.** In fact, in the Brazilian servers, Lucian's page was the one that was vandalized. Not much was said here, but she did sign the graffiti with \"X esteve aqui\" which means \"X was here\" in Portuguese, just like in Vi's page. But, her teaser in the LA server had much more dialogue from her than Vi's vandalized lore even. In it, she interrupts a story Gentleman Cho'Gath was telling about tea and boring stuff like that and starts saying random stuff. Roughly translating it from Spanish, one of the thing she says is this:\n\n# *\"YoU Take ouT youR MiSSiLe L4uNcheR and BOOM! YoU hAve the Best \"LauNch\" partY Ever xD. NoT liKe my SisteR's LaUncH PartY wHich... By tHe wAy... HavE You SeeN Her h4iR? As BoRinG as thE fAce of the HaTlaDy.\"*\n\nWell, now we know a little more about Jinx's sister now don't we? From the first quote, we can deduce that **Jinx thinks her sister's crazier than herself, or looks crazier, in the very least.** And from the second quote, we know that **her sister had a 'LauNch' party, as she puts it, and that she thinks her 'h4iR' is 'BoRinG'.** Interesting stuff... **In the case of Vi's sister, we're not entirely sure she even knows she has one.** She never mentions a sister in the lore or her VO and Lyte is the one that mentions her in the first place, following with a remark of how he 'isn't supposed to talk about that...'. \n\nWell, from this we could already jump into the Myths... But, before we get to the Myths and the Theories, there's something we need to talk about first. **Vi and Jinx's stories.**\n---\n**\"I let my hands do the talking.\"**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WprVYSr.jpg\nWhooaah Vi. Let's write this discussion with our fingers and my **brand new** keyboard, ok? Yikes...\n\nFirst, let's go over Vi's lore. Vi was a street orphan in her youth. She had to survive with what she had and she had to learn how to find her way on the outskirts of Piltover. To do this, she learned how to rob and cheat, something that was a must in the lawless streets of Piltover. **She taught herself self-reliance during her time in the streets and stealing and tearing apart hextech hardware made her a skillful mechanic.** Then, when she was only six years old, this happened:\n\n# *\"A ragtag group of criminals took a shine to the young delinquent and brought her into their fold. By the time Vi was eleven, she had become a seasoned accomplice, and she relished the thrill of every heist.\"*\n\nSo, **Vi joined this criminal organization at a very young age** and she started to 'relish the thrill of every heist'. But then, Vi had a change of heart one day. On a raid to a mining facility, the mission went south and some innocent mine workers were trapped in a collapsed tunnel. Opting to 'play the hero', Vi decided to stay and help the mine workers, while her crew ran away. Improvising, **she grabbed a robotic mining rig, tore apart its arms and made a pair of makeshift hextech gauntlets.** Using the gauntlets, she blasted away the rock that had the workers trapped and when they were freed, she fled the scene. Her lore proceeds to tell us that:\n\n# *\"After that job gone wrong, Vi severed her connection to the crew. She returned to a life of solitary crime, but stole only from other criminals.\"*\n\nSo, at the age of eleven, Vi started working alone again and, as the years went by, continued to use her gauntlets in her crimes and upgrade them. When Caitlyn got her hands on Vi's case, instead of seeking Vi's arrest, she offered her a job as a cop, in order for her to redeem herself from her life of crime. Vi naturally accepted, since she finally had an excuse to punch people without the cops bugging her. Together, they are now known as **Piltover's finest and the greatest at what they do.**\n\nSo, before joining up with \"CupCait\" as a law enforcer, she was a criminal from a very young age and joined a gang for five years, in her youth. She was, supposedly, an orphan, but she is of Piltovian origin. **There is no mention of her parents or a sister.** Now, let's take a look at Jinx's story.\n---\n**\"You're starting to bore me.\"**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/sRumWJH.jpg\nDon't worry Jinx, 'cause we're gonna talk about you now, and there's nothing boring about you! **Everybody** knows that!\n\nNow, **Jinx's lore doesn't give us much about her backstory**, unlike Vi's. The lore does tell us that before Jinx came to Piltover, Piltover was pretty peaceful. But that all changed when Jinx came to Piltover. In Vi's own words:\n\n# *\"They call this place the City of Progress - or they did until she showed up.\"*\n\nThis quote was taken from Jinx's teaser. And in Jinx's teaser, Vi goes onto mention that **no one knows who Jinx is or where she comes from. Jinx isn't even her real name apparently.** This is backed up by this section of Jinx's lore:\n\n# *\"Though the young woman's origins were a mystery, some saw traces of Piltover hextech in her firearms, while others described the street fashions of Zaun in her dress. Because her arrival always brought trouble with it, those who crossed her path soon gave her a name: Jinx.*\"\n\nThis also mentions that she had traces of both Piltovian and Zaun culture. Looking at her profile page, we can see that **Jinx apparently originates from Zaun, or in the very least, is affiliated with Zaun.** According to the lore, she came to Piltover, because it was the place she found 'the dullest', thusly, a perfect place for her to wreak havoc. Her motivations are also unclear. Nobody knows why she does the things she does. Vi acknowledges this:\n\n# *\"The worst part is: none of it makes any sense. Ask her why she's doing it, and she'll give you a million different reasons. But the only one that matters is: She's having fun.\"*\n\nAnother interesting thing about Jinx is that **she takes a very special interest in Vi.** Sure, she likes to mess with both \"fat hands\", as well as \"hat lady\", but she has a very nemesis-type relationship with Vi. Sure, ever since Jinx challenged Vi and told her that 'she would never catch her', Vi has considered Jinx her nemesis as well. But, even before they met each other face-to-face for the first time, Jinx called Vi out to try and catch her, specifically. Very interesting...\n\nBut, what can we learn about their potential family ties from this? Well... \n---\n# **The Myths**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FJ4sX35.jpg\n\nNow, let's go over the most popular myths revolving around Jinx and Vi. If you're new, the Myths section is meant to explore **things that have been hinted at and aren't totally out here, although not official.** Now, let's go over some of the myths.\n---\n**\"Let's get to the fun part!\"**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Z8YdTtz.jpg\nIndeed, Vi! The myths and theories are the fun part of these discussions!\n\nThe first of the myths is, of course, the myth that **Jinx and Vi are sisters.** Heck! Most people that don't pay that much attention to lore think that **they are** sisters. Are they totally wrong? Well... actually, not exactly. We have proven that both Jinx and Vi have sisters. Vi, apparently, doesn't even know her sister exists, or doesn't acknowledge it, according to what Lyte says when Vi visits his store. While Jinx is very well aware of the existence of her sister, going as far as saying that she is crazier than herself and that her hair is boring. Does this description of Jinx's sister fit with Vi? Well, yes! \n\nVi is kind of crazy, due to her unhealthy love of punching people right in the pie hole. And her hair can be boring from Jinx's perspective I guess... (personally I think it's super cool). But, the description fits her very vaguely, although, if you remember the \"LauNch partY\" bit, in Jinx's LA site teaser, she does say her sister's launch party was boring, unlike her own. If you remember, Vi wasn't teased at all and was released to the PBE the second she was revealed... yeah, it was kind of boring. Jinx however had a lot of different teasers and her own music freakin' video!! Yeah, I guess that bit fits Jinx and Vi perfectly! But, the physical descriptions are **vaguely** accurate to Vi. Another thing is that Lyte says that Vi looks like her sister... and Vi looks **nothing** like Jinx! Jinx has different eye and hair colors, has pale skin and has no shared distinctive features with Vi.\n\nBut, the question still remains... **are they sisters or not?** Let's go over this one other myth and then we'll try to answer that question.\n---\n**\"Vi... stands for violence!\"**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2bo9ods.jpg\nHumm... You're joking. ...right? 'Cause... Violence. That's a weird name. Just sayin'!\n\nThe other myth that has been floating around is that Vi isn't Vi's name, but it's actually a codename attributed to her. **\"VI\" being the roman numeral for \"6\".** This is a very natural assumption 'cause seriously... who names their kid \"Vi\". Even in a world with a guy whose first name is Warwick! Also, Vi has stated that her name stands for violence, vice and vicious. Obviously, she is joking slash taunting. But, these shows she has thought about what the name actually stands for, so **it's likely she got the name from someone else, besides her parents.** This makes sense, since she was a street urchin. Word is that she got the codename \"VI\" from her gang, that uses a roman numerical system to assign codenames to its members.\n\nHowever, Jinx may also have a similar codename assigned to her. Remember, \"Jinx\" is a name assigned to her and is not her real name (although she uses it as if it were her real name). But, remember how she signed her graffiti on Vi's vandalized profile page, as well as Lucian's vandalized BR server profile page. **\"X wuz here\". So, she also goes by \"X\"**, which also happens to be the roman numeral for \"10\". Interesting... The myth is that Vi and Jinx, or in this case, VI and X, were part of the same gang when they were younger. \n\nThis makes sense. But, does it go deeper than that...?\n---\n# **The Theories**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kG2CLz0.jpg\n\nOh boy! This is the part you love the most... AND I'M NERVOUS!! But don't worry... I feel like this week will be better than last week's Jax discussion. This week we have some pretty neat theories... and others that you may have never even thought about! So, let's get to it.\n\nSo, up until this point we have some really cool theories that are already mostly in the Myths section, this time around. Vi and Jinx being sisters is a no-brainer. I don't think it can even be called a theory at this point. Nah... OF COURSE IT CAN! That's why we're going to talk a little more about it.\n\nSo, we already discussed the fact that both Jinx and Vi have sisters. Positively, absolutely confirmed(tm). Now, what links them together? Well, their being both from Piltover, or around, and Vi's mysterious past. **We don't know much about Vi's early life before joining that gang. We don't know about her parents or her sister.** I think it's safe to assume that she never met them, since she never mentions them. Maybe, she did get to meet her sister though. It's possible though, she did something to upset Vi, possibly abandon her, which made Vi hate her, most likely, older sister, due to her leaving her alone. Also, adding to this, is this Riot statement from [**Jinx's Q&A**](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1no2gi/we_are_the_jinx_team_ama/):\n\n# *\"Jinx is approximately - to use a reference you guys all know - Vi’s age. Maybe a little bit older.*\"\n\nOf course this is up to interpretation. But, maybe that's why Lyte says 'he isn't supposed to talk about' Vi's sister. **Vi just doesn't want to hear it! Or maybe Lyte doesn't want to tell her she does have a sister.** Anyway, having abandoned Vi, either if Vi met her or not, her sister went to Zaun... and something happened to her. Maybe, she was experimented on, causing her to become insane. She would then return to Piltover, maybe due to a fragment of her life before going crazy making her come back. So, **it's possible that Jinx is Vi's sister and she doesn't know it... Maybe, both don't know it. Zaun is a place that would mess anyone up!**\n---\n**\"Wait, I'm thinking! Urgh... how do people do this?\"**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/txNitB9.jpg\nDon't worry Jinx... I'll think **FOR YOU!**\n\nAnother theory actually makes a lot of sense. So, remember the myth that \"VI\" and \"X\", stand for 6 and 10, respectively? That this would make Jinx and Vi having been a part of the same gang at some point? Yeah, well, you know who else goes by a roman numeral? **\"C\".** We know that Vi and Jinx are recent nemesis, but Caitlyn and C have history man... She has been on C's tail for years and all over Valoran.\n\n# *\"The bandit, who always left a card with an ornate 'C' at the scene of the crime, became Caitlyn's arch-nemesis.\"*\n\n \"C\" is the roman numeral for \"100\", of course. Is it possible C is the head, or at least, part of the gang that Vi and Jinx were a part of? It's very possible that at some point she was part of the gang, since we don't know where C hails from. He, or she, may be Piltovian. **It's likely C isn't a part of said gang anymore due to the way she commits crimes.** In Caitlyn's lore, C is described as a cat burglar that commits high-profile heists and leaves a calling card on every crime scene. This is an MO for a criminal that goes solo, rather than a gang member. But, **C could be the codename that she operated as, during her time in the gang.**\n\nCool. But what does that have to do with Vi and Jinx? Well, **maybe the gang is a sort of sisterhood.** We know VI and X are both girls, maybe C is a girl as well. They may act like sisters as part of the gang's code of conduct. They may have all operated in the gang at very different times, but they'd still be morally obliged to call each other \"sisters\". They have kept their alias in some way or another. VI is Vi's name and she has tattooed the number \"VI\" on her cheek. Jinx signs her graffiti as \"X\". And C leaves the calling card with \"C\" in every of her crime scenes. Maybe, the sister Lyte refers is a gang member that looks like Vi... her mentor perhaps? Maybe, the sister Jinx talks about is C or some other? In [**Vi's Q&A**](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=35366916), **gipsylord** (Vi's lead designer) does mention this:\n\n# *\"She had that 6 on her cheek from day 1. Was up to creative to find a meaning for it. It's got a story, I just can't tell you ;3\"*\n\nThis confirms that the \"VI\" tatoo on her cheek does indeed stand for \"6\" and not for Vi's name. And it also confirms it has a story. It probably isn't \"she thought the tattoo would look cool.\" So, this does back up this \"gang member codename\" theory. So, basically, **this theory suggests Jinx and Vi are not actually sisters, but that they are part of a sisterhood, their gang.** Of course, the fact that Lyte refers to Vi's sister as an actual sister in the first place, and that both he and Jinx refer to a specific sister, are valid reasons to debunk this theory. But, the next theory is more plausible and has no contradictory factors...\n---\n**\"Here comes the punchline!\"**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/N6J17nI.jpg\nIndeed Vi, 'cause this theory is the theory that has my thumbs up... **and my thumbs down...?**\n\nHold on to your hats, 'cause I'm just going to come out and say it... My theory is that **NO! They are not sisters!** Now, surely you're shocked, because like you, I love the idea of Vi and Jinx being sisters, all the while not knowing they are sisters, or at least one of them not knowing. I like this theory a lot. But, **every bit of evidence kind of points in the opposite direction.** Sure, they were released in a context that makes their sisterhood plausible. Yes, they both have sisters. But, it seems weird to me that Vi wouldn't know her sister, even if she had not met her in a age where she would remember her. Maybe, Jinx abandoned or got separated from Vi at a very, very, very early age and Zaun's experiments on Jinx changed her appearance to a place where she does not resemble Vi and that would make her irrecognizable. But, Jinx does mention her own sister a lot. And Lyte does say that they look a lot alike, which Jinx and Vi don't. **I think, Jinx and Vi are indeed related in some way, just not as sisters, in any shape or form.**\n\nMaybe, they met each other the way described in Jinx's lore... or maybe they met when they were younger. Maybe, they were street urchins together. Maybe, they met as gang members. **Maybe, they met under circumstances that would make them not remember each other when each of them grew up.** But, that's the only way I see each of them being related before they met, due to their childhoods having very different contexts, although Jinx's is still shrouded in mystery. Now, Jinx does take a special interest in Vi, perhaps because she relates to her? They are both crazy to varying extents. Sure, this takes away some of the mysteries about Jinx and Vi's relationship... But, honestly, I think that Riot don't seem to be heading the sister way with the lore. **That being said, the other two theories are very cool and I love them equally. I kind of hate this last theory, but, to me, it's the one that sounds like the real deal...**\n\nBut, you know what...? I may actually think that this theory is the coolest! You want to know why? 'Cause it leaves a very cool mystery to be solved... **If Vi and Jinx are not sisters, then who the hell are Vi and Jinx's sisters?** I have a few theories... But, hey! That's a discussion for another day!\n\n#**It's all just a theory though... Thanks for reading!**\n---\n**\"Any last words? Ha! No, just die.\"**\nWell, that's rude, since I do have some last words!\n\nThis week's discussion was a lot of fun to make! I love Vi a whole bunch. I also love Jinx a whole bunch. It's fun discussing the mystery revolving around the nature of their relationship. The last theory was the one I leaned for of course, but reading it again I realized I like the other ones most... except the part where the last theory is the one that gives an even more interesting discussion... Anyway, please let me know what you thought of this week's discussion, share some of your own theories and vote in the poll below for the topic you want me to talk about next week! Thanks for reading!! Hope you enjoyed. ;)\n\nBy the way, just one more thing, I'm thinking of changing the schedule of \"Facts, Myths and Theories\" from every Wednesday, to every Monday. Do you agree? Please let me know what you think!\n\n# **Last Week's Topic:** [*Who is Jax?*](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/LfpdHeYY-who-is-jax-facts-myths-and-theories)\n# **Next Week's Topic:** [*League of Romances*](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/EKrkKdMg-league-of-romances-facts-myths-and-theories)\n---\nVoting for next week's topic is now closed!

Really cool analysis you've written up here.\n\nSome tidbits for you :3\n\n1. Vi was orphaned at an extremely young age.  A combination of her youth at the time and whatever trauma she suffered has left her with absolutely zero memories of her past and any family she may have had.  I can't say whether or not Vi has a sister but I can say that if she did have one she would not be able to remember her.\n\n2. Vi's name is from her tattoo, not the other way around.  She's had that \"VI\" on her cheek for as long as she can remember, and so when she was first on the streets and people asked her name and she had none to give them they just started using the most distinguishing thing about her: the tattoo.  Whatever family she may have had might have given her a \"real\" name at one point but she can't remember it.\n\n3. It's important to remember that there is somewhat of a method to Jinx's madness.  While at first it may seem that everything she does is crazy and random it's all with the underlying goal of entertaining herself and making things (currently Piltover) more \"exciting\".  \n---Example:  If Jinx saw a Piltover citizen standing alone in a dark ally looking scared and all she had was a knife she WOULD NOT be at all interested in running up and stabbing him to death.  Boooring.  However, if that same Piltovian was sitting on a pile of fireworks and she had Fishbones on hand she wouldn't think twice about taking a shot at the firework pile with pretty much zero concern for the guy sitting on top.  Those explosions are gonna be sooooo cool!\n---This makes Jinx's antagonism of Vi all the more interesting.  What type of entertainment is she getting out of going after Vi in such a targeted manner?","replies":[{"poster":"NarokKurai","date":"2014-10-23T16:18:02.845+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even since before Jinx's reveal, I got the sense that Vi was the result of some sort of sinister experiment. Perhaps Zaunian in nature, or worse--Piltovian. If Vi stands for Six, then maybe she was originally Patient Six, Subject Six, or Experiment Six. Perhaps there was some sort of genetic laboratory, where young girls were kidnapped in order to be experimented upon. Jinx was part of this program as well, perhaps being known as Subject Ten. What exactly they were researching is impossible to tell, but clearly it left some heavy psychological impact.\n\n During this time Vi and Jinx could have been good friends, blood sisters, or simply acquaintances through the experiment itself. Perhaps Vi was an especially potent subject, but over time she became more and more difficult to control, eventually resulting in **something terrible** which caused the destruction of the facility, and the total loss of Vi's memories. But Jinx still remembers. She still carries all the scars from the experiment, and perhaps she resents Vi for being able to forget. Or perhaps she's just showing her affection for a lost sister and friend the only way she knows how. Probably a little bit of both.\n\nOf course this is all massive speculation, and the biggest flaw is that neither Jinx nor Vi seem especially... super-human. At least not by League standards. Both characters explicitly gain their abilities from the weapons they use, so if they were being experimented on, the reason why certainly isn't obvious. Both seem to be particularly prone to violence--could it be they were intended to be super-soldiers? *IS* there any evidence of either of them showing unnatural, supernatural, or superhuman powers?","replies":[{"poster":"dialMARK4acti0n","date":"2014-10-23T16:47:00.491+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed there is my friend.

Assuming that C is in some way related to these two, it would make sense that she could be the third sister.  Lyte clearly has met Vi's sister and being an inventor, it would make sense that he created something for her keeping the hextech theme that Vi and Jinx share (Vi with gauntlets, Jinx with guns).  As well, Lyte is not supposed to talk about her sister, keeping in theme with C's mystique.  \n\nAs well, Jinx considers her sister \"crazy\".  C being methodical and careful might fit under Jinx's description of \"crazy\", as it seems you assume Jinx's usage of the word is the same as ours would be.  As well, C could have incredibly boring hair to fit in with the hair theory and the more subtle tones expressed in Cs lore and could look like Vi to fit with Lyte's comment.  \n\nIt would follow that Jinx being aware of her sister and Vi not being aware indicates that some sort of separation occurred when they were younger.  C would clearly be the eldest as she has a record of messing with Caitlyn and made appearances before both Jinx and Vi.   Possibly they originate from Zaun and C got Vi out but not Jinx, and had to go back for Jinx but did not want to take Vi, leaving her alone in Piltover.  This would also give a solid backing to why C has the technical skills for heists (and possibly having a teamup with Lyte as an inventor?), seeing as she had to develop them to rescue Jinx.  However, the events Jinx experienced in Zaun in the duration would help explain her more volatile nature.   C having rescued Jinx returns to Piltover and is unable to find Vi and resorts back to running heists with Jinx to get by.  When Vi joins up with Caitlyn and gains some fame, C recognizes her but is unable, or perhaps unwilling, to approach due to Vi's connection with Caitlyn, but informs Jinx of their relation.  Caitlyn having cleaned up most of the crime in Piltover at some point ruins Jinx's enjoyment of running heists with C, and at this point Jinx decides to mix things up and splits off from C, but still honors their sisterly relations by keeping word of her a secret.  Of course while terrorizing her other sister for fun (really just wanting her to join up with them), she happens to let slip a few things about their shared sister.\n\nAlthough not exactly like your shared gang theory, it would help explain a couple logical flaws within your theory.  If Jinx and Vi were part of the same gang which referred to people by roman numerals, wouldn't it make sense Vi would be aware of the categorization system and connect the dots?  The lack of follow up in lore would imply that the gang Vi was part of and and gang Jinx were part of are unrelated.  This would also give meaning to Jinx's X, Vi's tattoo, and C's calling card if all three of them originated from Zaun where they obtained the letterings (as perhaps part of a shared experiment).  There's no proof that Jinx doesn't have an X tattooed somewhere on her body from experimentation, so it could be that's how the experimenter kept track of them.  Tying into that, this would explain Vi's mental lapse of family if she did go through a trauma in Zaun at an early age and then was abandoned in Piltover by C (albeit with good intentions) and Jinx's mentality.  This would also explain why each has an aggressive tendency for violence or thievery if the experimentation was about behavioral modification in relation to aggression and why Vi and C are more toned down (C having escaped and Vi being too young to have finished the experimentation process).  Jinx's physical differences would be explained as well by the extended duration of her experimentation.  \n\nEven if they weren't directly blood related, this would also give reason as to why Lyte would be referring to C as Vi's sister as would Jinx, because C would have been the one who interacted with both parties and would have explained it as such if she so desired.","replies":[{"poster":"BA Synthesize","date":"2014-10-23T10:40:10.782+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just some other comments I wanted to leave regarding this theory:\n\n1.  If Jinx and C were related, it would explain why Jinx is so good at avoiding capture.  She learned from the best.\n\n2.  C's calling card could be for Vi, not Caitlyn.  As in a \"Yo sister I can't find, here I am\" sort of deal.  Since Vi doesn't remember, it would explain why Vi and C haven't met up.  Could be C interpreted Vi's team up with Catilyn a betrayal and why she let Jinx loose, unaware of her amnesia.\n\n3.  Jinx's reference to her sister being crazier than her could be a shoutout to C being the only person able to keep Jinx in check, and thus earning her respect.  Crazy is again relative when talking about Jinx.\n\n4.  Jinx could have been let loose by C as a way to let Jinx \"play\" (a very affectionate term for Jinx I would assume) with the sister she never got to meet and a way for C to cause chaos and havoc to make heisting that much easier.  This would indirectly let C vicariously interact with Vi and give Jinx something to do.  Also would hint that C has a maniacal and \"crazy\" side to go with Jinx's quote.\n\n5.  Lyte clearly has some sympathy for C's plight in this theory which would explain why he helped her and why he has kept her secret from the authorities.  He also sells dangerous weapons to rage infused murderers in a frozen wasteland, so clearly he has a flimsy moral code at best.","replies":[{"poster":"dialMARK4acti0n","date":"2014-10-23T13:02:37.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude...

It's a little far fetched but it seems somewhat reasonable.  \n\nAs for the allegations of C being a man, there is the possibility C is the parental figure of both Jinx and Vi and they still have a third sister in the mix somewhere.  C being the parental figure would make sense as it would explain why Jinx and Vi have criminal tendencies and the roman numeral identifications as they picked it up from their parents.

If this gang theory is true, then technically none of them are blood-related sisters. Maybe C is Vi's actual sister, because Lyte does say, \"**You* look* like your sister! Er, wait, I'm not supposed to talk about that..**\" He doesn't just state that you act like your sister, but you physically look like your sister (depending on how you interpret *look*). Jinx and Vi look nothing alike. Maybe C is Vi's actual sister. Maybe C remember what happened to Vi but doesn't want her to know. Maybe C places these cards not just as evidence she was there, but maybe she is trying to tell Vi that she is still alive? Or maybe she places those cards behind to spy on Vi when they pick up the cards, because maybe she misses her sister and wants to see her. This is a speculation, obviously, but if C was Vi's actual sister, that would be more amazing than Jinx. \n\nOlder siblings sometimes work in weird ways, like try to hid certain things from the younger for various reason. For those of you who have seen the anime \"Naruto\", the relationship Vi and C share could be identical to that shared by Sasuke and Itachi, but with a twist. Maybe before Vi was born, C left the family to form a \"sisterhood gang\" and raid Piltover. After Vi was born, C was sent to destroy the only people who knew her before her \"thug life\" and finished them off. But before she could finish all of them off, she spots baby Vi. She didn't know what to do because now, she discovered that she had a younger sister. Both shocked and upset, she wanted to end Vi's life but was too soft to finish her. She abandoned baby Vi and sent her to the streets. The amount of trauma baby Vi received was too power and made her forget her past only to find herself on the streets with no family. Once Vi became stronger, she was found by a few gang members and brought in. Once C heard the news that her sister joined the gang, she was shocked. She wanted Vi to live a different life than hers. When Vi joined, C decided not to communicate to her, but instead observe her from a distance. I'm assuming the gang was huge (or at least decently sized) if the numbers go up to C (100), so not being seen in the group wasn't hard. Maybe C was like the master and was only allowed to be seen by higher ranked members. She didn't want Vi to see her because although Vi was young, seeing C might trigger the trauma and make her remember her past, maybe. Maybe she was just embarrassed for being a criminal in front of her sister. When Vi left the gang, C was slightly thrilled since her younger sister decided to take a different path than she did. As **BA Synthesize** said, the C cards could just be a sign from C saying \" Yo sister, here I am watching you from afar. I'm not creepy. I'm your sister.\"\n\nNow to the Lyte issue. He obviously states that Vi has a sister, but stops and covers it up. Maybe Lyte knew C and knows about her relationship to Vi. C then told him to keep his mouth shut instead of finishing him off. OH WAIT. Perhaps Lyte is Vi's father. Lyte could be a traveler from Piltover. **Lyte is the uncle of Ezreal who too was from Piltover.** What happens if, before an expedition, maybe Vi and C were left behind at like a babysitter or something while the family ventured to the Freljord. While there were being babysat, someone stole them and used them as test subjects, which would be the \"experiment theory\". That is where Vi, received her tattoo. There in the laboratory, C and Vi were separated and experimented on. After the organization who were doing these experiments broke down, the children held there fled. C then formed a gang where all the former patients could come together and fight the government who let these experiments (similar to the anime, Terror in Resonance.)\n\nAll in all, I hope C is Vi's real sister and actually looks like Vi. C, the older sister, who seeks revenge against the government for destroying her family and conducting horrible experiments, and VI, the younger sister, who joined the Police force to bring peace to Piltover.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ShadowedNexus","date":"2014-10-26T03:11:22.523+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just one problem, VI is not 16.... its 6","replies":[{"poster":"Narcoleptic9","date":"2014-10-29T18:52:34.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's true, but C = 100 + X = 10 + VI = 6 still equals 116.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sahira94","date":"2014-10-23T10:58:07.997+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"(I'm sorry for my english :C)\nWhat I think?\nI have an headcanon about Vi and Jinx, and I'm drawing a comic about that.\nI think that Jinx and Vi are sister, and that they come from a Zaun laboratory. \nYes, I think they was lab rats, and that they have identification numbers: VI (6) for Vi and VII for Jinx.\nWhy VII?\nLook at Mafia Jinx's splash art and in her concept art: there is an VII in the bottle and in the violin case.\nSo, the hair of Vi, I think, are blue\\dark purple (in the concept art her hair was purple), in fact I think that she colors her hair. \nPerhaps for a fact unconscious she wants to hide its true color, I don't know.\nShe was a baby, she don't remember nothing and she don't have a true name.\nMaybe someone managed to free these little girls from the lab, maybe \"Jinx\" (her name is also false) has grown in Zaun, in place sicker than Zaun.\nJinx's hair and eyes aren't in a natural color, no? \nExperiments, abuse, chemicals. \nReally we wonder why Jinx is crazy? \nProbably she spent most of her life locked somewhere, in silence. \nIt's normal that now she is obsessed with chaos!\n\nVi also has something wrong: no one has purple hair and eyes (no matter that she color them), but she grown up in Piltover, she is lucky.

Blitz is a bulky robot, there's no doubt about that. Vi is pretty bulky, but much less so than Blitz, and Jinx is a twig.

Actually he/she took interest in 3 children. These 3 kids were in the gang and were even further trained for stuff like heists. Jinx was the energetic one. She may have took interest in guns at a very young age, so she was maybe given one during their time in the gang. VI was a violent child. But she knew about hextechnology, so she was given the task of lock breaking or hacking. Stuff like that. C was smarter and maybe a bit older than the other two. So she was probably given more task to do during raids/heist. And she was good at it. They maybe had ties with each other like a family. Later down the road, or say 5 years down the road(since Vi was 6 when she joined) left the crew when she was 11. So her work as a Cop probably made her forget most of it over the years. Jinx however remembers this. Now, all grown ult, Jinx decides to pay Vi a visit. I would think the gang went to zaun some time after Vi's Departure. However, C probably started her own crime before Jinx showed up. Maybe the gang went separate ways at some time. But, Cait can't figure out who C is, Neither can we.  I want to get to the bottom of this.\nBut this is just my thought about this, or thoughts lol","replies":[{"poster":"dialMARK4acti0n","date":"2014-10-23T07:27:36.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I loved reading this comment man!

I really don't.\n\n\nSure the interactions are there, but even Yasuo doesn't go anywhere with it. Sure She uses 3 strikes, sure her Ult's called windslash...but it's just not in her personality.\n\nRiven is this badass soldier, And Noxus knows it. They Could send her on an assassanation to kill an elder...but wouldn't she be more useful at a fight? Plus without a timeline, the killing might have happened AFTER the gas incident?\n\n\n\nAnyway, on to my comments on this one.\n\nI'll be honest, I like the sisterhood theory, seems neat.

We all know Jinx enthusiastically loves explosions, right? We also know that Vi's parents were killed when she was young. My theory is that Jinx somehow accidentally killed their parents, and then driven partially insane by the trauma, fled the scene. If this happened very early (remember, Vi was already taken in by the gang when she was six years old) and jinx *is* older, then I think it could make sense. Here is another theory, Vi's and Jinx's parents *were already criminals*. This would explain a few things, mostly why both were drawn to become criminals/thieves/arsonists once they were forced to live on their own by circumstance. It could also explain why a piltovian child like jinx would randomly have access to explosives to cause such an accident.\n\nVi and jinx could also be half sisters. Jinx could be the result of their father going on some sort of crazy fling over in Zaun, and Vi could be the legitimate daughter. That could explain a few things. \n1: Vi doesn't remember having a sister, because they never met each other as children. \n2: their physical differences could be from having different mothers. \n3: Jinx blew up her father and Vi's mother out of a combination of insanity and anger (Yes, I know this is a stretch, Jinx blows stuff up because it is cool, not because she is angry, but this would be a special case). \n4: Lyte isn't supposed to talk about it because people in general don't discuss other people having illegitimate children in civilized company (Piltover citizens seem to fit the \"Civilised company\" mold).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2014-10-23T01:34:43.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sidenote about the Oriana thing....
