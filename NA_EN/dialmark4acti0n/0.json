Welcome all. **This. Is. LORE BATTLE!!!**\n \nThis is what I hope will become a weekly series, where we pit characters from the League of Legends against each other in a sort of \"Who Would Win?\" scenario. **This is not a gameplay discussion, it's a lore discussion.** Of course, gameplay is what tells us a champions' abilities and powers, but the battle scenario is not a gameplay one, it is a  lore one. It's kind of like discussing Hulk VS The Thing, for example. You can discuss what champion would win in a 1v1 situation, objectively. Or you can root for your favorite. Your choice.\n\nNow, without further ado, I bring you... **LORE BATTLE!**\n---\n# This Week's Battle\n# **Garen V Darius: Dawn of Justice**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nbjvHc5.jpg\n\nGaren and Darius. **Two of the most well know warriors in both Demacia and Noxus.** These two rank high in their respective armies and stand for opposing ideals and city-states. Although they fight for different causes, they are similar in their ways of combat and their ideals. Of course, their methods and objectives differ. **One seeks justice and peace. One seeks to fight and conquer. These two warriors are symbols of the ideals they stand for.** Naturally, these two hold a grudge against one another. Their final battle is one that they both await for anxiously. \n\n**Today, we decide who wins.**\n---\n# The Combatants\n# **Garen, the Might of Demacia**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/E5xHsLv.jpg\n\n# *\"Come forth, you will find honor in death.\"* - Garen\n\n**Stats:**\n\n***Occupation:*** Leader of the Dauntless Vanguard; Demacian Army High-Ranking Soldier\n***Equipment and Weapons:*** Iron armor; Two-handed sword; Magical abilities; Justice\n***Physical Traits:*** Strong; Agile; Fast; Heavy\n***Loves:*** Demacia; Justice; His little sister; Spinning\n***Hates:*** Noxus; Noxians; Anything Noxus-related\n***Wishes for:*** Peace; Justice; A red-haired family\n\n**Signature moves:**\n\n***Judgement:*** Garen spins his sword around, while moving, easily cutting through enemies\n***Demacian Justice:*** Garen uses his limited control over magic to summon a gigantic energy sword on his opponents, executing them\n\n**Overview:**\n\nHere we have the fearless leader of the Dauntless Vanguard! Garen is known in Demacia as one of the best warriors in all of Valoran. **He is fearless, strong and just.** His sense of justice is one he takes to heart. He is a member of a family of nobles, the Crownguards, and is one of Jarvan IV's closest friends, who would entrust his own life to Garen and with it, the throne.\n\nGaren is a very bulky warrior and wears a lot of armor, but don't let it fool you. **Although he wears a heavy armor to the battlefield, his strength allows him to keep his agility.** He is able to run fast and strike fiercing blows, all the while being protected by his thick iron armor. His above-normal strength allows him to be agile even with his armor on, being able to do one-hand handstands, and spinning his sword around rapidly without losing balance. **Extremely protected and heavy, while also being extremely agile, quick and strong.** Additionally, Garen also has a limited stock of magical abilities that he can use to reinforce his armor and execute his opponents. Although, agile and strong, **his armor does make the swings of his sword less potent, making them somewhat, heavier but weaker.** Still, we have to pity those who meet steel with this juggernaut...\n---\n# The Combatants\n# **Darius, the Hand of Noxus**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vTejc8p.jpg\n\n# *\"Defy Noxus and taste your own blood.\"* - Darius\n\n**Stats:**\n\n***Occupation:*** Noxian Military General\n***Equipment and Weapons:*** Light iron armor; Battle Axe with hooked edge; Tactical thinking and ability to easily find an opponent's weak points.\n***Physical Traits:*** Strong; Agile; Quick; Precise movement.\n***Loves:*** Noxus; Necks; Blood; War; His little brother.\n***Hates:*** Demacia; Wimps; Spinning; His little brother.\n***Wishes for:*** A world with no mercy; Glorious victory and humiliating defeat for his enemies.\n\n**Signature moves:**\n\n***Noxian Guillotine:*** Darius jumps over his opponent, with his axe overhead, then quickly descends on his opponent while swinging his axe forward, effectively cutting his opponent in half.\n\n**Overview:**\n\nFacing the Might of Demacia, we have one of the most feared Noxian generals. Darius has been known to decapitate commanding officers that even dare to suggest a retreat. **To Darius, cowardice is intolerable and mercy does not exist.** He wishes to fight honorable battles where no one ever retreats and he can face worthy challengers. He was entrusted by Jericho Swain, Grand General of Noxus, to rule his army on the battlefield, and lead Noxus in its rise to glory.\n\nDarius is an experienced tactician, winning numerous battles against bigger armies and odds. **His tactical view of the battlefield allows Darius to know how to move and how to execute his strikes perfectly and without hesitation, beforehand.** He is also quick to carry out his swings and strikes with almost microscopic precision. He is able to cripple a foe easily with one swing of his axe and is also agile and quick enough to execute large swings of his axe that can hit numerous enemies. He can also push any opponents closer to himself by using the hooked edge of his axe. **He likes to hit an enemy's critical points and make them bleed out afterwards.** His signature move, the Noxian Guillotine, can quickly execute wounded opponents. **His armor isn't that thick and protective however and** - if Darius doesn't take care on the battlefield - **can be easily penetrated.**\n---\n# Battle Strategies\n\nNow, **comparing Garen to Darius**, we know for a fact that Darius is slightly faster than Garen, with his lighter armor, and can punish him more severly, since Garen's sword swings aren't as strong or nearly as precise as Darius'. But, **with Darius' lack in more defensive armor and overall concentration on finding Garen's weakpoints, Garen could unleash a flurry of attacks with his spin**, that could make him lose balance if Darius was able to seize the opportunity, but if successful could really wound Darius. Additionally, **Garen's accessibility to magic grants him a natural advantage.** His magical reinforcements on his armor could make him simply outlast Darius. Darius, however, being the master tactician we know him to be and being able to execute such precise attacks, could focus on Garen's body parts that are missing protection. His face is a good place to start. **A well timed Noxian Guillotine could end Garen in a flash, but we all know that Garen wouldn't let that happen so easily.**\n---\n# FIGHT!\n\nNow that we've gone over the combatants and the battle strategies, **it is now up to you to carry out the battle.** \n\n**Vote in the poll** below to vote on who you think would win (or whoever you're rooting for, your choice) or even if they'd end up a in a tie.

Garen isnt equiped with normal weapons and armor.  He has \" Demacian steel.\"    And even for items crafted in that mythical precious metal, he uses some of the finest armor and weapons ever created.  He will be tough to hurt and faster than you'd think.\n\n 2. Garen fights to defend a heavily fortified nation with elite troops guarding its choke point entries.  He has no reason (or mandate) to pursue Darius outside of his nation's rigidly defined border.\n\n3. While Darius doesn't believe in retreat ( Hi Kled!) and he is tough, unrelenting bastard-- he's also extremely cautious with his men's lives -- far more so than most Noxian commanders.  This is part of the reason his troops love him.  He hard engages ONLY when he is certain h,e and his army, have the right tools for victory. \n\n4. Neither of these men fight in a vaccum.  Both have duty, family, and armies which would affect the situation and outcomes.\n\n  5. Thus i would guess the most  likely encounters between these two are probably a testing of defences--  where Garen can retreat easily to safety and attempt to bait Darius (and his army) into a bad position.  While Darius dare not risk advancing too far (rightly fearing over extending  himself into a bad position).\n\n2cents. Havent really been following where the lore on these two is headed though.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-12-29T22:06:39.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://forum.bodybuilding.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=5177013&d=1355400169","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2016-12-27T01:09:55.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait this was 2 years ago.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rengar vore","date":"2016-12-26T20:00:44.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> This is part of the reason his troops love him.

He would force the situation even if it didn't look completely certain (to us), just to have the initiative in the battle and/or to try to achieve a maximum advantage. Maybe it was just his personal preference, but he somewhat serves as a model for militant leaders to me (he never lost a war). I don't think I would describe any good military leader as very hesitant; after all Demacia and Noxus are enemy empires and an attack at the right moment could be perceived as a preventive move as well; attack your opponent before he attacks you. \n\nIf you don't know anything about Caesar and ancient Rome, I would recommend watching Historia Cilivis on youtube. Don't worry, his videos are entertaining even for the average person (they are short videos on Roman battles, political games, and sometimes culture). Though different to rome, I think they will also give you some inspiration on how these 2 empires could function.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rengar vore","date":"2016-12-26T19:58:27.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=HHbfjAFy,comment-id=001a,timestamp=2016-12-26T19:04:46.492+0000)\n> \n> 3.

If Garen were able to play a bit more like a guerrilla fighter and move in and out of combat, use his bush ambushes, use his  (recently buffed) healing, then I think Garen could win in a longer duel where he doesn't allow himself to fall to execute range for darius. Very close and kind of situational in my opinion.

This would be a battle essentially, between good and evil. A classic battle;\n\nViktor V Jayce these two are depicted enemies right from their beginnings, Viktor stole all of Jayce's Credits for his accomplishments and then turned himself into a machine, now jayce has a practical sworn revenge against this bitter foe.\n\nLux V Katarina, these two practical assasins have a fight coming for a long time, katarina has mostly assassin skills at her disposal, but Lux has full on magic. Katarina met garen on the battlefield, and it was the first time Garen EVER went home tired, and no doubt these two are probably gonna eventually on a full out battle\n\nKassadin V Cho'gath This battle is practically quite obvious as one that's bound to occur. Cho'gath wants to break free from the ties of the League in order to-essentially- go out and devour every living person.

Darius Facechecks. GG kid. lol\n\nBut on a more lore-based fight, We can equate Garen's silence to a blow so staggering it leaves his opponent, well.. silenced -stunned? staggered? and his age and martial advantage over Darius pretty much seals the deal. You have to take into consideration as well that Garen is known to never, ever, tire except against Katarina, and he is always on the battlefield. Darius is, as you mentioned, more tactician than actual fighter. He isn't as fast as Garen, and even wonders \"how does he do it?\" which one can use as an argument that Darius isn't as agile as Garen. \n\nIf it came down to it as well, Garen can just take of his armor and that would probably make him even faster -given that his armor is definitely heavier than Darius'. \n\nGaren is younger, faster, and more oriented on the battlefield than Darius. Darius in his prime as a soldier is a different battle altogether though.
