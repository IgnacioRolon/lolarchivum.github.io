I got Gold V this year and expected to get Victorious Maokai, and checked to see it still saying 'Unavailable'. I did however get a golden border, icon, and the champion himself, as I didn't own him. Is this a mistake? Or have I simply not gotten it yet?\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-10T17:11:53.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, and everything looks okay to me!
