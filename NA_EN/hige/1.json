If you want to provide some more information on the issue that is causing you to leave, I'd be happy to help!  Leaving a game will not provide you with a win, LP, or IP.  It would count as a loss as well as get you marked by the [leaverbuster ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)system.  We also have a great guide on [/remake](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) that provides more information.  It's important to resolve whatever is causing this to prevent further issues.

I did some research and disabled a few features and now my disk is back at 1% - 2% from 100%, so I hope it's fixed.\n\nI don't appreciate being tagged by the leaver buster though, this is the first time I leave a game in years, last time was because of my GPU dying so not my fault either and I just got a warning at the time.  I don't leave games intentionally since I understand how jarring the whole thing is.","replies":[]}]}]}
