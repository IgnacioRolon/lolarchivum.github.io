I'm going to recant my statement about the quality. However, on the other hand, Nidalee has a lot more skins, and ~~they all~~ most looked low quality. So that made her a prime candidate for a splash art update! \nThere are still more champions like Nidalee with many poor splash arts, so unfortunately you probably won't be seeing Phoenix Quinn get updated for a long time.
