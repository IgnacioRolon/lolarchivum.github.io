I seem to have mispoken here, my pc doesn't do this with any other program at any other stage, I'm an illustrator and I work with photoshop and Illustrator plus several other programs at the same time, those consume a TON more resources than what league does and my fans don't tend to make any sounds, not to mention, my cpu is a gaming one so it has holes everywhere, I also have 2 more fans in there just in case and my pc is at a stable 45 degrees most of the time...\n\nThis happens ONLY with league during champ select, see, the irony here is that the game itself should consume more resources and while I'm in-game my pc is perfectly silent, this is exclusive to champ select since the last patch","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-14T23:27:28.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this happen in both the Legacy Client **and** the Beta Client?

If the animations are causing issues, you could try enabling *low spec mode* and disable *animation*. You can find these settings from the cog icon in the top-right corner of the client.

Since the new client is still in Beta, weird interactions like this are bound to happen. I recommend reporting this behavior on our [**Client Discussion Boards**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) so we can track this. You can continue to use the Legacy Client for now if you'd like to avoid this behavior in champ select.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
