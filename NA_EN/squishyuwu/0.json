How does it even makes sense to get it when its ur first time to get reported for toxic behavior plus i wasnt, the guy from the game was toxic to me so i responded but he dont get any restrictions... so fair and now i get honor level removed that i got after months just bcs of this one game where i did nothing bad.

It cant be that hard to find.\n\nAnd you said you got chat restricted for no reason, not just reported. False reports do nothing. Thats why i say there had to have been a reason for the punishment. Imagine a system where you can just report anyone for any reason and get them punished. Sounds a bit r%%%%%ed... no company would create such a system.

Honestly if they would block me from the chat entirely i wouldnt mind but why touch my honor level. And trust me these toxic behavior systems are all broken. For example i used to play rainbow 6 siege and u can get banned for saying something that means nothing, like that infamous dabbing backwards, it means nothing but system takes it as terrible word and insta ban. Every game have that system but it never works. So a lot of companies made that, if u google u will find lots of such incidents on game news. The thing is its not always gets fixed. The way this system should be is restrict and ban those who had reports for toxic behavior many or few times before and not after one game, i think u would agree. Plus if im toxic then how tf i reached honor lvl 4 and have 32 keys? I think i would be on lvl 1 if im toxic cuz no one would honor me for GG friendly player... honestly it proves system is broken","replies":[{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2019-08-07T03:07:45.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NaniSenpai69,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=IGEiMtbd,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2019-08-07T02:55:41.285+0000)\n>\n> Ok i will search tho its probably no use as uasually no one checks complaints or anything like that.\n> \n>  Well its not one person who reported me like i said, it was the whole team bcs maybe they were pre-made so system probably takes that ammount of reports enough for restriction.

Multiple reports in one game do nothing to increase your chance of getting punished. If youre confused as to what got you punished, you can post your chat logs here and we can explain what it was. Riot has very strict rules about chat, so you may be surprised and learn something. \n\nAlso, you can thinkof your account as having a hidden toxicity meter. As you play games and get reported, the system checks those reports. Reports that contain no rule-breaking do not count towards anything. Everytime you do break a rule (evenjust being negative for a lot of chat is against the rules, like having a defeatist attitude, or complaining about plays your allies make) it adds some pointsto your toxicity meter. Once that meter fills up, you are dealt a punishment. \n\nThat means consistent minor negativity can add up to a punishment. Or one game of excessive negativity can fill it up. One game containing racial slurs and other zero tolerance phrases can actually result in a 14 day ban (things like kys, homophobia).\n\nHonor has nothing to do with punishments. A lot of people honor the carry. Some honor the friendliest player. Some honor a person who played well and didnt flame anyone despite everyone else playing like shit. Honor will do nothing to yourtoxicity meter. Its a completely seperate thing.\n\nI hope that helps and sorry if i came at you aggressively to start.","replies":[{"poster":"SquishyUwU","date":"2019-08-07T12:44:45.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah that explains a lot, kinda. Just one question then there is left, how exactly does that \"system\" detect negative attitude? Im actually very interested cuz while most systems just detect swears and racistic or sexistic words this system would have to indentify whole sentences and understand what player means. And i think this particular one can have loads of issues as i have never heard of such great AI to understand meaning of a whole sentence precisely. If one word can sometimes be taken wrong by the system let alone the sentence where dude could have said \"im done\" but he didnt mean giving up and system would take those words as he was giving up...? I doubt its that good. Well that helps, now i see whats the issue and if its not this one game then its fine. Its just random sentences i made previously so this game doesnt matter, bcs i didnt say any of the \"toxic\" kinda words this game, i was never toxic before so it must be that negative attitude thing. Thanks and no u were not aggressive or anything like that","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2019-08-12T17:17:06.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Telephone Booth,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=IGEiMtbd,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-08-06T23:55:15.710+0000)\n>\n> Doubt it.

LoL's punishment system (the IFS, or Instant Feedback System) places a punishment on your account when it deems your behavior bad. Behaving well sometimes doesn't mean you behave well all the time. In this instance - and possibly others, since the IFS punishes based on severity and consistency, and the reform card doesn't necessarily display logs for every match where you were validly reported - you behaved poorly. Poor behavior is very impactful and thus carries a lot of weight with the IFS, so to regain Honor and avoid losing it you'll have to work on controlling your behavior. The IFS does forgive the occasional bad day, but if that kind of behavior becomes habitual, you might be greeted with a reform card telling you to rein it in, or with a permaban message if the temporary punishments haven't worked.\n\nYou weren't punished for misbehaving in one game. You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the logs that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several logs. You might see three logs, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.\n\nIn a perfect and just world, everyone who deserved a punishment would get one. In reality, it is possible for some punishable behavior to go unpunished. First, punishments in LoL can only occur after a valid report. Second, punishments take into account the consistency and severity of the punished player's misbehavior: if two players in a match break the same rule in the same way, one who consistently misbehaves in this way might get a punishment while the other who almost never does so gets away without a punishment (this time). At the end of the day, though, all this does is explain how differences in player behavior over many games can produce different results for equivalent behavior within a single game. It doesn't excuse poor behavior. One person having a rare bad day doesn't give a consistently toxic player the right to join in. The only behavior that matters in your punishment is your own... and a good thing, too: how would you feel if you behaved yourself but got punished anyway just because all your teammates were spectacularly friendly, communicative, and positive?\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025054153-Understanding-Your-Temporary-Account-Ban):\n\n> We can not discuss other players’ actions with you but you can always report them at end of game and mute them when in game. There is no excuse for raging back or responding to people trying to get you to tilt. You are the only one responsible for your actions and your words which is what we are trying to address with these bans.","replies":[{"poster":"SquishyUwU","date":"2019-08-07T13:17:39.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok but i didn't get any reform card with logs. I knew i got chat restricted in the next game i played. Game didn't show me any reform card. And like i said i'm never toxic, i don't flame even when my team is bad and even when they intentionally feed. That means i should not get restricted bcs as u said it's not one game. Also can it be that system understands some sentences wrong and inappropriate even tho you didn't mean it that way? Cuz after people here talking about how this system works i searched for people who got issues and i seen some with those logs where guy didn't say anything bad just a simple sentence. So while one log is nothing bad but if that system literally took random sentences wrong and build up your toxicity meter out of them then i see it as a problem with a system. Ofc idk what logs i got bcs i didn't get reform card and idk where to check so i can't say system took some random sentences as a toxic behavior. Also if system keeps log of my toxic behavior then why can't i see them all so that i know what system took as inappropriate, i see a lot of explanations on how it works and how it builds up your behavior but it can't show me any of those. Well thank you for reply and maybe there is option to mute yourself and teammates in settings so you don't have to mute them in every new game? If i don't write anything then there will be no toxicity from me and there will be no logs so system can't take anything as toxicity","replies":[]}]}]}
