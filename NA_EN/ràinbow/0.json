Single target damage and mobility are likely to remain her strengths. She'll probably end up with a bit of situational CC and a bit more disengage than at present, though in exchange have a somewhat less guaranteed combat pattern (e.g. we've been testing a Q dash that's free targeted, rather than certain to hit once cast).

(and its not even clear that this is her ult in the end).\n\nand just because you brought up ekko. right now shes more than ekko, than her original intended role. just like him, she plays like an assassin who ults to deal damage and restore part of her healthpool during a fight.\n\nexcept for the entire wind theme, yasuo simply looks more like the champion fiora originally should have been. including his q, which would have fit her much the same way, and the way windwall blocks projectiles (which seems a similar defensive move to riposte).\n\nso making her playstile similar to his (even if not exactly the same of course) would make a lot of sense. plus, yasuo simply works. it took them years to figure it out, but they have finally found a way to how a melee adc can work in this game. we have the opportunity here to see melee adc finally develop healthy gameplay and becoming a permanent part of this game instead of the occational split pushing tryn.","replies":[{"poster":"TheJinxedOne","date":"2015-06-25T23:15:01.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol ive used her w and killed people chasing me after a fight, get a kill, walk away cause mf about to kill me and didnt want to risk it, w (DOUBLE KILL!)","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-06-26T00:12:13.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=miseryvein,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BzNct5tV,comment-id=000200040000000000020000000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2015-06-25T23:15:01.597+0000)\n>\n> lol ive used her w and killed people chasing me after a fight, get a kill, walk away cause mf about to kill me and didnt want to risk it, w (DOUBLE KILL!)\n\nnieche case. there are a handful of champions or so with an ability that can be blocked by riposte. and theyre all on a shorter cooldown.\n\nagainst a lot of single target poke abilities, the spell is useless. it doesnt help you with the stuff that actually gets you killed. usually single target spells with hard cc attached.\n\nim not even saying to remove riposte. im saying to put more power into it, and have a successful riposte enable other abilities in her kit.\n\nits her core ability. its what makes her unique. it should be more impactful than it is.\n\n\nfor example picture this: \n\n- riposte is on a 10 second cooldown at all ranks. the uptime of the spell is half a second, giving you very small windows of deflection, so you have to use it in response to an enemy attack, and cant just sit on it for 2 seconds like a shield.\n- in return it can block all projectiles, auto attacks and blocks on hit effects that are associated with auto attacks. basically like a private windwall that blocks 1 projectile or auto attack. damage return is removed (put onto her e)\n- successfully blocking an attack puts it on 2.5/2/1.5/1/0.5 second cooldown instead of 10\n- her q damages everything she passes through, and is put on an ammo system on a very short cooldown (scales with attack speed, ~0.5 seconds by lategame). she charges up to 2 stacks over time (one every 20 seconds). a successful riposte instanly gives her a stack\n- her e is changed to a massivley empowered auto attack on first activation and backwards dash on second activation, that enables for like 5 seconds after a successful riposte. the second activation is cancelled by q.\n- her ult removes all the restrictions from her abilities for a limited duration. her q doesnt consume charges, her e is available for the entire duration and her riposte has its reduced cooldown.\n\n\nnow imagine this scenario. your opponent pokes at you. you react with riposte. you dash in with q + aa, another q + aa, reset the aa with your e for another big hit immediately followed by a backwards dash out of range. since your riposte was successful, it goes off cooldown incredibly fast, allowing you to react to follow up poke.\n\nor imagine a chase scenario against an ad carry. each auto attack you block would give you another charge for your q, which helps you chase him down as  long as you keep blocking his attacks. which is pretty difficult on a .5 second uptime.\n\non the flipside, if you miss a riposte or your opponent baits it out, it puts you into a  vulnerable spot for like 10 seconds.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Reikken","date":"2015-06-25T03:23:04.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"agreed with this\n\nI play Fiora because I like her speed.

I believe people mistake it for strict by-the-books fencing. \n\nShe's not a samurai character who would fight an obviously suicidal battle and die \"for honor\", nor is she restrained to fighting using a specific ruleset as a fencer is. \n\nBeing the \"Grand Duelist\" simply means she wins all her duels. It doesn't necessarily mean she doesn't play dirty, and in fact would make sense that she does (to some degree) if \"playing dirty\" is defined as breaking our real-world fencing/kendo rulesets. The belief that Fiora will only fight a fair fight and would never run comes from people drawing associations and conclusions from information that was never given and adding their own real-world representation of a fencing and kendo-style dueling to the character.\n\nNow, this doesn't mean she doesn't have a code of honor or avoids certain un-sportsmanlike things (for example, it was disgraceful that her Father slipped poison in a drink), but that doesn't mean things like pommel bashes, attacks to the legs, or disabling moves in general are illegal in her dueling code-of-honor (while they are in RL fencing/kendo). \n\nFurthermore, in a fight to the death, there's also no reason to believe, as we have literally zero evidence suggesting it, that Fiora would be *unwilling* to concede defeat and escape from an unwinnable fight. In fact, it would be *out* of character for her to not know when a fight is lost and react accordingly. She's arrogant, not foolhardy, and is the best *duelist*, which means she wins 1 on 1 fights using speed and deflection, and you *have* to be able to read your opponent to parry and win with speed.

To lose face is to lose honour, and to lose honour is to become no more than a mere brawler. She's not the grand brawler, but the Grand Duelist. If she dies, she dies with honour. It's that simple. She's willing to die in a duel because that's a possible outcome. My point is, she goes into the duel knowing that the loss of life is possible, and that by putting her life on the line and fighting honourably, and by the rules, and coming out on top, she has not only sufficiently defended her and her family's honour, but increased it and the prestige of herself and her family.","replies":[{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2015-07-25T09:11:31.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm perfectly aware of what people have *decided* duels mean in runeterra. \n\nAs I'd made abundantly clear, the ***assumptions*** about what a \"Grand Duelist\" is are the problem. \n\nIt's pretty obvious that the fights going on in a 5v5 game *are not duels in the traditional sense*, pretending otherwise is just simple denial.\n\nSure, in a true sanctioned duel I'd buy that Fiora would pointlessly, idiotically, unintelligently fight to her death (cuz apparently people have taken their headcanon and decided Fiora is a fuckin' moron who's as obsessed with the notion of honor that she'd do that, like some female Garen knockoff), but when it's an ACTUAL fight that ACTUALLY matters, there's literally nothing supporting the belief that she'd idiotically and selfishly die in the midst of an important conflict over an important issue with 4 teammates counting on her just because \"durr hurr honor\".\n\n She wants to bring notoriety and respect back to her tarnished house, that doesn't mean she's a goddamn imbecile who thinks \"yeah, dying for no goddamn reason cuz of my ego is definitely respectable and brings tons of fame to my family name\".

She doesn't need a change.\n\nNot every champion needs to have 85 game mechanics in them. Not every champion needs to be Ekko.\n\n[Here's Guinsoo talking about Fiora](http://www.surrenderat20.net/2014/04/red-post-collection-guinsoo-and-his.html)\n\nAlmost everything that Guinsoo said about Fiora is wrong.\n\n \n> She should be about finding weaknesses in the opponent's play and finding the proper occasion to go on the attack.\n\nThis is exactly what she is right now. Half my laning phase is waiting for the enemy to use their abilities incorrectly, or waiting for the enemy to get too close and too cocky. This is the way the game is supposed to be played, and it is how one plays Fiora properly.\n\n> he pushes her buttons pretty much as fast as she can without a second thought\n\nIf you suck at her, this is true. I work hard on getting my Q-AA-EE-A-Hydra-Q (etc) combo off flawlessly. Clicking any button at the wrong time can make you lose upwards of 2000 damage in a team fight.\n\n> I expect opportunities to use my abilities at optimal times to counter out the enemy's champion.\n\nThis is already true, except that Riot made her W stupidly. It cancels out X and Y, but not X2, and Y2.\n\n> Mechanically speaking, I'd expect a duelist type champion to be mechanically intense. I expect opportunities to use my abilities at optimal times to counter out the enemy's champion. I want to have a lot to keep track of, but with clear success cases when I do well. \n\nYou just described Ekko. GJ on that.\n\nI repeat: not every champ needs to be Ekko.\n\n> Some of the current goals including switching Fiora from an assassin to a melee DPS, and moving her lane from top to mid/jungle...\n\nThis is already how many Fiora mains play her. Maybe Guinsoo should pay attention.\n\n**And, Finally** Guinsoo's solution to\n\n> she pushes her buttons pretty much as fast as she can without a second thought\n\nis to make her mash MORE buttons EVEN FASTER with even LESS care for what happens.\n\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=938879&d=1396668009\n\n**TL;DR**: Most of what Guinsoo says is nonsense. He clearly doesn't play much Fiora / watch how other Fiora's play. The new changes will just make the supposed problem worse. Riot wants every champion to be the same. Riot just wants to make Ekko 2.0.\n\nPLZ don't ruin my baby {{champion:114}}.\n\nMaking a duelist (1v1) in a team game will lead to weird results.  She's fine how she is.","replies":[{"poster":"TheBreakerEns","date":"2015-07-25T06:37:03.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know. I know how you feel. I loved her since I saw here.
