They can happen at any moment: when ward is placed, when attacking a minion, when a team fight starts, when trading damage, when entering a bush. I have tried everything and nothing works... I turned down my graphics to the lowest setting possible, I turned v-sync on and off. I capped FPS to 60, I uncapped FPS, I tried disabling all sound (read that in some forum thought it was worth a shot), Playing game in windowed, borederless, fullscreen. Repaired the client, reinstalled the game. Installed it on my HDD, than on my SSD. Turned off EVERY single program running on my computer except for essentials and LOL,,, Nothing works... And it cant be my computer because I have an ok Rig\n\nIntel Core i7 6700K @ 4.00GHz\n32.0GB RAM 2600MHz\nASUSTeK COMPUTER INC. MAXIMUS VIII HERO ALPHA (LGA1151)\nAsus Strix Geforce GTX 970 4GB RAM\n250GB Samsung SSD\n2TB WB HDD\nCorsair H100i GTX CPU Cooler\nEVGA Supernova 850P2 80 Plus Platinum\n\nLiterally cant figure out what is wrong... I can easily play games like Mafia 3, and battlefield on High setting with no freezing...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-18T16:12:51.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The screen freezes has been an issue for some players after a recent Windows 10 update.  If this is the case for you, then the auto-enabled of the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) might be the culprit.  Disabling that should get the issue fixed!","replies":[{"poster":"PhaseSett","date":"2016-10-18T17:44:43.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It worked no more lag!!

When I turn vertical sync off and cap my fps to 60, 80, 120, or 144 I get bad screen tearing but it's less noticeable at the higher fps caps. This is why I instead play with vertical sync on so it caps my fps at 60 but when champions die or objectives like baron/dragon die, my fps drops and I basically stutter/freeze for half a second. Also when I play jayce and change forms my fps goes from 60 to around 48-52. It's really annoying if I'm in a teamfight. When I have vertical sync off I will drop fps from 100+ to 80 but the screen tearing is just so bad I can't play on it.","replies":[{"poster":"PhaseSett","date":"2016-10-18T17:45:08.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are using windows 10 do what Porocles wrote above it worked for me.","replies":[]}]}]}
