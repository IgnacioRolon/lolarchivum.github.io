I had purchased some RP about a few days ago and I wanted to purchase more again a couple a days ago. Now I remember that when I attempted to that an error message said that I have reached the maximum amount of purchases and that I must wait 24 hours to purchase again. I decided to wait until another day (24 hours) and when I decided to purchase RP again, it still reads that I need to wait 24 hours to purchase again. This has been going on for the past couple of days and I know that 24 hours have passed by, please help solve this problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-13T21:42:14.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not seeing anything that would prevent you from purchasing more unless there were too many attempts made.  Reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) in this case, and our billing team can use their tools to take a deeper look with you directly.
