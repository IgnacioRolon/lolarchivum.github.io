I feel as if the lower tiers (bronze and low silver) have too much of a skill gap. With the millions of people who play the game maybe a new division is needed. The new division does not even have to be lower then bronze it can be put in the middle and the current bronze can be lower then it already is.

To put my own spin o it, it's a tier that isn't necessarily lower than bronze, but separate, where higher ranked (Let's say, plat and up?) players can coach a player from behind the scenes. Playing with other 'coaching tier' players until they reach silver MMR, where they're left alone to fend for themselves. There would still be the ability to solo que but for those who would like to improve and play instead of troll and rage it would be a good option not only to learn, but surround themselves by like-minded peers and ideally escape the toxic portion of lower ELO ranked play.

Skill wise I feel people who 'belong in bronze' just get punished for trying to get better when playing ranked, and since the skill level of bronze is, for lack of better phrasing, easy to get to without trying a lower floor will not keep this behavior at bay.\n\nGranted I don't have access to the statistics so I'm biased here, but as I stated above I feel it's less of a problem with skill and more of a problem with attitude.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tehdef","date":"2014-05-01T15:07:50.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please add Wood League... >>","replies":[]},{"poster":"JackYAqua","date":"2014-04-29T18:45:52.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you ever played Space Pioneers, you'll know bootcamp is awesome !","replies":[]},{"poster":"MackleDoge","date":"2014-04-29T18:44:05.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any opinion on how it might influence the toxic and negative connotation that a fair portion of the community have about Bronze and the new division if you implement it in the mind set that it is \"lower than bronze\"?

It already has the 'less and worse then' mentality that people insult those in Bronze for. What should be done is find a way to manage LP so that those with very little consistently or low MMR/Elo are put on \"ranked hiatus\" where they are dropped out of their ranked league and get a small normal game restriction or something of that nature. This would allow them a break from ranked and help to alleviate issues with tilting.\n\nAnother thought would be to decrease the individual number of players in each Bronze division group and have more of them of stratified skill level / MMR/ ELO that way you are in a league with equivalent players and it theoretically should free up movement room in between divisions. Furthermore, the actual ranked division is only moderately limiting as to movement in ranked, the real issue is promotional matches and the system that is used in that instance. Being in Bronze 2 doesn't mean you only play Bronze 2, the matchmaking system pairs you off of MMR not actual rank, so theoretically a Bronze 2 player with Silver 3 MMR will be playing with and against players around Silver 3 MMR regardless of what ranked tier the player is actually in.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JackYAqua","date":"2014-04-29T17:52:33.171+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cardboard  \njk ^^  \nHow about a division called bootcamp?

I agree that there is a huge skill gap between the tiers in bronze, but the last thing League needs is more toxicity.  Creating one lower than Bronze would promote more people to blame you for being \"worse than bronze\" which could be even more of an insult.  It's hard though, with how most of the community bases your skill on ranked roles when perhaps you didn't quite have a great day that day, or got put in roles you weren't good at, or even get stuck with trolls.  I mean, if there was some way to make Bronze not such a bad place to be, I think more people would play ranked.  I know many people who refuse to play ranked because it's honestly a scary thing to be in.  Especially being placed in Bronze, people get poked at, and it's truly not fun.  I wonder if there could be a way to get a type of Team Builder feature in ranked, so perhaps players could get the roles that they want instead of complaining about it.

The thing about a lot of low ELO players isn't that they aren't provided with the resources to learn, it's moreso that they are unwilling to learn. They believe they are perfect and aren't likely to admit their mistakes or attempt to improve their play, but rather, blame it on other players.\n\nSecondly, while players over exaggerate the number of trolls or mistake poor play for trolling, I do believe hat trolling in ranked is a problem. It encourages players to try less, even in games with non-trolls.
