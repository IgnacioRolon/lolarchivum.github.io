Previously i had no problems with the client nor with the game itself(i was on max graphcs and ha 120 fps constantly), but now  i just reinstalled league and suddenly my cpu usage during the game client is 90-100% wich causes lag on my computer(the task manager shows that the league client is eating up my cpu entirely on its own). Even after setting the client for low spec mode it still causes problems, and the game runs worse now. I tried reinstalling windows and the drivers but nothing changed. I also searched on the league forum for problems similar or identical but none of the solutions worked for me. If someone knows how to fix these problems please help me.\r\nSpecs:\r\nIntel Core I5-4460 3.2ghz quad core\r\nNvidia Geforce gt730 2048mb 128 bit\r\n8gb ram\r\nWin 7 ultimate","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-09T17:16:53.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My suggestion here would have been to try low spec mode, but it looks like that's been attempting.
