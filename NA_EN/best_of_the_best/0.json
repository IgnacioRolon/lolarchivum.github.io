For example, pass holders will get bonus tokens and have access to more missions (novice and master) than just the main path.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Best of The Best","date":"2017-06-23T17:58:07.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didnt spend rp on any passes or any token  but the first two missions i did  gave me 30 tokens, 10 for completing the first quest, and 20  for the secondary quest for the day. however im not sure if it was only because i missed the first day of the event or if it was just only for those missions.","replies":[]}]}]}
