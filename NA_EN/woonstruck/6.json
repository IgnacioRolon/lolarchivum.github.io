The difference isn't even noticeable after working with it outside of a complete lack of lock-out on her E, which is positive. \n\nMechanical differences in how you execute it doesn't change a champion considering the outcome is the same. \n\nHaving her 1 shot if she landed W was not healthy, especially with how over-loaded her Q already was. E would have gotten nerfed later whether the W change went through or not. \n\n**If she deserved nerfs after the W change, she would have deserved them before the change as well.

And then also tried to make her a generalist by adding tons of unnecessary shit which made her needlessly more versatile.\n\nSo as a result, they had to gut the shit out of her damage and then try to re-balance around that.\n\nHer playstyle itself as well as her identity got absolutely trashed.\n\nShe never ever one-shot pre6.14.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-11-18T12:07:47.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"No actually, she wasn't absolutely perfect.

It was perfectly fine until 6.14 onwards.\n\nShe was ONLY a zone control/pressure mage with almost no pick potential against non-stupid players, no DPS, very situational burst that took a ton of skill and practice to even achieve for a burst that didn't even do more than half-health and costed a shitton of mana in early, couldn't waveclear for shit without using up her only meaningful damage ability combo, and couldn't risk roaming without taking heavy tower damage. All that retarded shit came 6.14 onwards.\n\nHer Q damage was perfectly fine pre-6.14.
