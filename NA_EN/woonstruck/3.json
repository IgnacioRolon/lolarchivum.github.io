You can't claim protobelt is good and Rylai's is bad when Rylai's still has better stats. It also lets you kite champs you normally would not be able to; this happens a lot in this meta, regardless of Rylai's state. \n\nLiandry's is not a good replacement because it still doesn't let you kite. \n\n#This is why so many people are such trashcans on Vlad. They just rely on stat-checking everything to death, which often doesn't work. \n\nNo matter what you say, the slow is invaluable on Vlad. The kiting and chasing abilities that the item offers will always be necessary in any game that's not a complete shut-out. It doesn't matter how bad the item gets until it doesn't accomplish that job anymore. \n____________\nThe CD on flash/ghost is stronger considering you need one of the summoners up in order to do any teamfights if you're facing anyone that actually knows how to play the game. \n\nYou can't take sorc shoes in most cases; you don't always have the luxury of waiting 3 minutes between fights.","replies":[{"poster":"strut","date":"2017-01-09T13:32:33.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Preach","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"XinCrin","date":"2017-01-05T22:13:54.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think one of the big problems with Vlad right now was that he was pretty bad before the {{item:3116}} nerfs but the {{item:3116}} nerfs made him that much worse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-01-05T21:57:53.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you aware of the fact that his competitive use mostly rides on his Ult's damage amp for the team?\n\nDo you believe it would be healthier if it were a Vlad-only boost, reserving a team-wide amp 'niche' of some kind for some sort of aggressive 'curse' support?\n\n________\n\nAny power that's added, I would personally avoid his HP ratios and base damage entirely. \n\nNobody wants tank Vlad to be a thing again.
