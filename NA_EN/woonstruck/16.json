We literally can't survive a game against a lethality user without all the movespeed from the lethality items + {{item:3814}} .\n\nWhy do i know? Because i tried playing Ashe and despite playing well by most standards a rengar with the same stats as me down me alone into the middle of my team and oneshot me. Later on a kha6 did the a similar thing when i was walking with two others.\n\nDoesn't help that lethality is the cheapest damage build that is pretty much strong from start to finish. Against low armor targets you deal near or actual true damage and if dealing with a tank you can always get a {{item:3035}}  item and perhaps {{item:3071}}  and they won't be an issue either.\n\nDon't go pointing fingers at the ADC's. We are simply trying to stay relevant and lethality and it's items is the only current way. If you have doubts trying playing Ashe and see if you can do anything for the first 30 minutes.
