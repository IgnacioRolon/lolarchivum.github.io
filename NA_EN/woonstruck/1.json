I can tell you're passionate about what you're saying, so I'm not going to badmouth you.\n\n2.) I just want to give you a bit of perspective.\n\n\nSince this is the meme and games board, any rioter that posts here shouldn't really be required to answer certain questions that isn't M&G related.  Especially if their job description has nothing to do with the boards or M&G in general (and if it did have M&G in the details, then I'd be damned.\n\n\nAnyways, keep in mind that you are speaking with humans, and most of them would possibly feel overwhelmed by what you just typed right after they posted in a thread for fun.  That fun most likely being during their off time or break before having to dive right back into work.  (After all, his job isn't 24/7 answer questions on the board.)\n\nRight now, this kind of response would make me--as a rioter--hesitant to post within the boards, purely because they would get assaulted or blind-sighted from posts/questions/concerns that they probably can't directly answer themselves, or, even worse, answer the question incorrectly and cause mayhem (RIP Riot Opeli)\n\nBut all-in-all, I think your best shot with getting a rioter response with what you typed is making your own thread for it.  I know that not every thread gets a red response, but reading your post seems like one they can and will (apologetically) respond to.  Your post doesn't outright attack anyone.  You're voicing a concern in a detailed way, and it can be built upon in a not-so-negative discussion.  I know that, if your post was lore related, you would definitely pull the attention of Riot Jaredan since he is a jovial person who doesn't mind speaking with folks from time to time.  Bioluminescence is also a good example of one (though he often give disclaimers that he lacks the ability or full knowledge of most concerns people have on the board).\n\n\nJust try to post your concern as a thread in one of the forums you think it might be relevant.  Just be careful of directly quoting rioters because not all of them can do an immediate, rapid-fire response to detailed questions.  (I can only respond like this purely because it wasn't directed towards me from out of left field, or else I would be taking 2-3 days to figure out the best way to say \"Oh...\" in order to not offend you.)","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Socialist","date":"2016-06-02T02:32:09.334+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"fyi Bioluminescence  is a she :P","replies":[{"poster":"Valaran Nara","date":"2016-06-02T22:35:35.356+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=naagza,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=BLbi9TTB,comment-id=0006000100020001,timestamp=2016-06-02T02:32:09.334+0000)\n>\n> fyi Bioluminescence  is a she :P\n\nBio's gender doesn't matter to me.

Unfortunately, we had people so angry they gave her death threats as well as sexual harassment to the point that she had to be transferred to a different part of the company.\n\n\nIt's the reason you only find Lore related to her.  It was...\"brutal\".  To put it lightly.","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2016-06-03T00:02:05.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks... Wow...

Wow... Wtf...\n\nYep.  That's why I try to be somewhat respectful when talking with people.  Even if I disagree.  There's too many folks on the boards that are going through puberty and hormones they don't understand. Lol.  Not saying they're all like that, but not every one of them (including the adults) think things out fully when voicing their opinions.\n\n\nAlso, the thing with Riot is that they will tell you their thoughts on something in the beginning.  if people question them, they will give you their answer and reasoning for, say, the first week or few days.  After that, they stay to themselves.  They don't go queit because they are bad at communicating (which they can still improve on), but because answering the same question as well as variants of such won't help with anything.  It will only please a small handful of people, and that is ONLY those who read that one response.  Not only that, but if you refuse to understand their reasoning the first time, then you won't the second or third.  Because of that, they just give up or keep quiet for a month or so until they come across a new development or finalized decision.\n\n\nBest example would be Solo Q.  They took it down.  Gave their reasoning.  People complained.  Riot said \"okay, we'll try to find out how to fix this thing for you.\"  As they worked on it, people kept complaining.  Since they answered what they could and don't want to give us empty promises (consistently) they just kept quiet until they can tell us more.  They came to the conclusion they couldn't properly do with it and said \"No solo q.\"\n\n\nThis angered everyone who prefers Solo Q.  Yes, it was a bit of a disaster.  Yes, they lost people and they angered even more, but in the end, they tried to look into it.  If they gave us their reasoning on \"Why no solo q\" it'll bounce off of what they mentioned before, and people will refuseto listen, so, after they gave the news and gave their reasoning on it in a full on blog, they will not carry on the conversation of Solo Q.\n\nUnless they find a way to bring it back, all the communication in the world will not pacify those who are angry unless they say \"Sorry, we'll bring it back\".  But then, that'll cause more problems, and if they don't right then and there, the fucked up.\n\n\n\nGet what I'm saying?","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2016-06-03T05:00:43.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I know what you're saying, people are super unreasonable here, they only hear what they wanna hear and if they don't hear what they wanna hear then it's a shit storm...

I didn't mean for my comment to be anything other than a joke, so thank you for recognizing that and being honest about your reaction. For what it's worth, there are many Rioters that agree we need to up our communication game and are, as we speak, working to improve that. As Riot and the player base has grown, we haven't properly scaled up our ability to talk with players in the personal way we were able to do before, and that's definitely been an oversight on our part. \n\nWe're all in separate fields with knowledge tailored to the many different aspects of the game and its systems, so as far as our communication strategy, I'm not an expert. Due to the extremely variant levels of expertise, it'd be nearly impossible for one person to be able to respond to all the different conversations and ideas that are presented on the boards.\n\nWhen it comes to feedback or bugs involving/relating to skins, wards or icons, I'll be working to maintain an open and constant presence.

That means someone might actually make a decent PVP MMO again because the competition isn't so incredibly stiff, which I'm all for. \n\nEspecially if its like TERAs. Its a shame all of the new classes have been trainwrecks for the game. Don't even get me started on the Awakening system...
