Messing with the config files to get the interface to work the way you want and to customize it to handle personal issues with the client has always been something people just do, and have even gotten advice and assistance from rioters to know how to do so many times in the past.\n\nBut of course there is a legal line riot is obligated to stick to just to cover their asses like any company needs to. \n\n'We don't punish for this kind of thing right now' -> because the person responding probably isn't high enough authority to be allowed to claim that it will never be something riot decides to restrict in the future, but realistically this isn't likely to happen as it clashes with their company culture and  even if they did make this change it would be a big announcement and would come with warnings first\n\n'can't ensure this functionality in the future' - because they don't want to have to keep careful watch to make sure they don't accidentally make a patch that breaks things people have been trying to do outside of the client. They don't want to be dealing with support tickets and 'riot pls' requests and emails because a few people who edited their config file in ways they didn't expect are sad that due to some random change their weird setting doesn't work anymore.\n\nYou can't tell this to some people though, they get some sort of high off of thinking they 'really know stuff' and can't help but force that 'knowledge' on everyone else 'for their own safety'.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"envicia","date":"2017-06-29T22:15:18.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For people new to mechanics and new to all t he ranged champs, i see a ¨benefit¨ in having indicator always on.\none less thing to keep track of.. but its like training wheels. and holding or pressing A lets you see it anyway.\n+ people tend to put their faith in assisting addons so much, that they allmost cant play at all without them.\nso if this option gets removed one day, those who used it, will have a transition period where they either loose interrest or make alot of in-game mistakes.\n\nLike, i mix up smart cast and normal cast depending on the champion and the ability/skill shot.\nIf i reset that or has to fill in for a homie with something urgent that requires him to get afk briefly.\nI tend to fuck it up so bad... ive played this game for years, but if the setups, shortcuts or functions are not alike, even thou i know it. \n- then i still have a hard time getting used to it. some days it corrects it self fast, but i cant play ranked and compeet with those options.\n\n¨All of this¨ hit me when i was searching for the option to keep indicator on always.\nAnd yes, ive also searched for ability CDR addons and wether they are legit to use, witch they are NOT!!!!!!\nDid 2 - 3 years ago, and trashed the idea.\nToday i've played so many champs enough, so that i allmost always can calc approx when the enemy CD's are up or ready.\nYou can tell that by knowing the enemy champ, does the ability get lower cdr? pr lvl, how much? if so, does it also scale on dmg pr lvl? and how much. \nEtc - ability lvl 1 does 25 dmg, lvl 2 it does 35. you got 100 hp, gets hit, only took 25 dmg. witch means lvl 1 in this case.\n\n\nWhat we really need is a way to fully costumize placement of everything in the in-game UI.\nPlaying as top base, whilst being ADC or SUP sucks IMO. the charracter HUD even thou scaled down, can make entire champs ¨out of sight¨\nBut they can see you!...","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-10-21T15:13:48.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh tho just spam A wherever you go, why bother using hack?","replies":[]},{"poster":"awdaf","date":"2016-10-20T20:05:50.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't even know this exists.
