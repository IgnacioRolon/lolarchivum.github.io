In that light, Oppressor had no actual cost for its damage increase apart from the need for the target to be afflicted by impaired movement (even slows), and the fact that cc'd enemies are far more prevalent in the game than five-man teams of easily-killed champions meant that though Oppressor's benefit was smaller than a farmed Bounty Hunter's, it was far more reliable to proc and therefore accounted for higher damage overall than Bounty Hunter's promises.\n\nI guess the question here is: should tanks have to worry about their options for dealing higher damage to the enemy team themselves? They're already providing a meat shield that trips up and belly slams the enemy so that your f'ing Teemo can drag them to hell screaming (even more so in the new patch). And if the concern were about \"being melted down in the late game\", well, what does that say about fighters/skirmishers/adcs who are much much squishier and therefore more likely to worry about melting?","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-10-21T00:57:29.888+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":4,"body":"Considering tanks can't actually tank for significant periods anymore, relative to season 5 and earlier, they need to contribute more during those periods. \n\nSo yes.

This is why you see the jayce, kennen, yasuo tops now also since riot has basically nerfed or ignored all the other tanks for so long. \n\nWith the lethality changes i don't see myself picking up top lane tanks again any time soon. The worst part is that riot is basically gonna force the rengar and ad carry top lane with these changes and tanks are gonna go almost out the window. Maybe i am just jaded but it would be nice for tanks to have an actual place in the game instead of the o welp lost lane, could do nothing mid game and got melted late game and now with lethality the ad is gonna scale better into me so i guess i'm packing my bags and heading into the jungle/support role. \n\nOne last thing i might add on my way out is that the top lane is gonna be even worse than the jungle after these changes and right now unless riot fixes something the assassin rework could be as bad as the juggernaut patch was. WELP I'll see you top side when i pick up rengar and play him till he is nerfed maybe even pick up the other soon-to-be broken champions (perhaps you will see the kha'zix\\talon top too and riven could only get stronger on this patch) until they nerf 'em back to the juggernaut patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"God Went MIA","date":"2016-10-21T15:49:49.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because tanks need more damage.
