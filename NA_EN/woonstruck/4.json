The MS buff isn&#039;t enough to cover any of his past issues, and is really only a tease at the fact that Riot could have fixed that. The MS is essentially a weaker Furor enchant, and the damage/healing is double, but that encourages building AP, which made his HP way weaker, which you also need for E to be decent...His Q is a mixed message, and if you build straight to either side, you still won't feel rewarded.\n\nW: Nerfed by 33% and the HP cost is going to hurt a lot more without WotA (his healing wasn&#039;t really helped that much unless he&#039;s under 50% hp...even then its weaker than WotA).\n\nE: Weaker in every aspect. Made unreliable. Does less dps. Only slightly more upfront burst, at the cost of a channel you&#039;ll never get off unless you want to waste W (cast-able during W now). Slows you, negating the Q MS buff, even though you won&#039;t have it the large majority of the time you want to E. **AND YOU CAN NO LONGER LAST HIT WITH IT UNDER TOWER, WHERE YOU WILL ALWAYS BE PUSHED TO THE FIRST 10 MINUTES.**\n\nR: Functionally the same. Damage amp 12%->10%. Duration 5 seconds->4 seconds. Heals for 50% damage, but by the time it pops, fights are already over. A win-more button now...not that he'll ever win with this kit, especially since his only 'utility' is being nerfed too. \n\n\nAll you&#039;re doing is nerfing him. The only way for him to work as you&#039;re making him is to lower his base damages more, emphasize building HP more, and giving him a defensive steroid. His new kit will not work as a damage-focused sustain champion. \n\nFor a champion that already has an extremely low win-ratio, you guys seem like you really want to make him playable... You're basically choosing whether you want Q or E to be viable when you build him.

I was pissed that all of his numbers were so low considering he's already weak on live, and they're a nerf relative to that even, however that can be fixed with tuning. My real issue is that his rework didn't solve any of his issues outside of reliability (on the enemy's behalf) when things are in range, which only hit his already shaky performance. He has no way to encourage enemies to get in range unless he's objectively out-gunned, so his kit essentially sets him up to fail even more than before. \n\nAnyway, he doesn't scale well with AP anymore. You want as much as you can get out of a single slot just to push your Q potential as much as you can with the least investment. Deathcap fills that by pushing rylai's (which is still must-buy) and your passive more than any other item in a single slot. \n\nAfter that, HP does far more than AP will damage-wise. Randuin's lets you maneuver in fights, deadman's does the same. One's more defensive/team-reliant, one's more aggressive/pressure-based.\n\nRemember, his E does FAR more damage than his Q now and all of his AP ratios were hit pretty hard, including ult. \n\nZhonya's is actually a bad buy on him now, considering it offers no HP and a subpar amount of AP, along with the active not pushing his kit as far as it used to. CDR doesn't make items must-buy for Vlad since 10-30% CDR rune pages exist, along with boots of lucidity (which still isn't must-buy).\n\n\nFinally, tankier builds suit him much more due to the choices his Q and E force him to make, which is committed ones. He won't be instant-killing Ez (sad times) through heal/lifesteal just because Ez accidentally got close enough for you to R->E->Q. He has to actually be in range for a full second, or step into range (for some reason) while you're charging E, not to mention he needs to be able to survive long enough to Q 3 times, which was rare for AP Vlad (who was tankier pre-rework).

My experience with Vlad is very limited, so I'll have to believe you about the builds.\n\nThat being said, I do believe the rework achieved more than you give it credit for. Maybe the **numbers** are too low, but now that there is \"unreliability\" (some would say \"counterplay\") in his kit, it's easy to just tune the numbers up without making him instantly OP. I'm impatient to meet a reworked Vlad toplane, and I expect the laning phase to be much more interactive than it was before.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-04-21T01:09:21.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, he's much more likely to be mid now, I believe. His gameplay revolves around using E much more than before, since he isn't reliant on having WotA now. \n\nConsidering top requires heavy trading (especially with his new Q), he'd be heavily pushing via E in order to do so, which spells death with him against the current junglers.  \n\nThe only reason top Vlad was a thing was because of the offensive/defensive power that WotA+Zhonya's effectively offered in the large majority of match-ups. With the current {{item:1054}}  and {{item:3211}} being in the game, his ranged harass is effectively negated by top laners. Even immobile ones. In order to deal damage through that combo, you're forced to use E, which pushes the wave, allowing them to safely farm under tower and call for ganks if you decide to keep pressuring. \n\nMid-lane he can waveclear safely much earlier and sustain through harass a little better early game, especially since the enemy mid-laner will likely be quickly clearing waves as well, while also having near-supreme safety and objective presence, of which he offers nearly none top lane, even with TP.\n\n\nAlso, your point about numbers is valid, but he'll still have the same issues as old Vlad, just weaker overall if they decide not to let him be insanely strong when under optimal circumstance. That's my biggest issue with his new kit. He'll still likely be either too strong or not offer enough threat throughout the game for people to bother playing him. \n\n**The rework should have addressed that while also lowering his reliability. Instead it just lowered his reliability. **\n\nI can't think of another champion that legitimately requires Rylai's (the rework more than the old Vlad) to function, just like no physical champions require FMal to function. His usability is still low despite the rework, and that desperately needed to be addressed, IMO. \n\nI don't know if they'll allow his new kit to have a juggernaut-like impact considering he's pretty in line with juggernauts, but I have a feeling they won't.

OK, Morde or Singed don't exactly have the highest playrate, but still, they exist.\n\nAnd since Vlad was the \"poster-child\" for \"Battle Mages\" in the dev blog about classes, I'm pretty sure they'll let him have juggernaut-like impact.\n\nAlso what do you mean about \"usability\" and \"old Vlad issues\"? For me, it was an un-interactive laning phase with no counterplay available and so a champ very hard to balance as a result. And the rework definitely solved **that** issue. Well, maybe it's a bit early to say \"definitely\", but that's my strong first impression, at least.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-04-21T02:52:01.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aurelion has long ranged CC, so I'd hardly say its required on him. He simply benefits a lot from it, like Brand. Morde has issues just as big as Vlad's, except he's also melee and part of a currently scrapped project of Riot's. But you aren't wrong. \n\n\nAs far as \"usability\" and \"old Vlad issues\", I mean what he can accomplish past laning phase. He has no intrinsic CC outside of a nearly melee-ranged slow that sacrifices his only defensive tool. This means he has absolutely no damage threat or kill pressure unless someone enters his range, which he can never actively enforce. \n\nIf Vlad is going to get a kill, its entirely reliant on someone essentially choosing to take Vlad's damage, team-mates, or flash/ghost (reliance on summoner spells is bad; they are a tool, not a crutch). Even when absurdly fed, his kill-potential is relatively low because of this. \n\nThe first means extremely unsatisfying experiences for Vlad in many cases, even after you get fed. \n\nRequiring team-mates isn't bad at all, but this is the issue about it: Vlad cannot follow-up on his team usually because 90% (yes, made-up and slightly exaggerated statistic) of the players in a game will have more mobility, range, CC, etc. Usually all 3. The only exception is Morde. He has less of all 3. This makes it extremely difficult, and many times impossible, to get into a position to have a significant impact. \n\nThe most Vlad can do to follow-up a large majority of the time is ult. He might be able to Q the closest target. The fight's usually decided by the time he can get into a good position to use E, or a good target for Q. \n\n\nThe new kit isn't nearly as rewarding if you manage to be in range of someone. Yes, its more up-front burst, but its less damage overall, less sustain, and higher costs. Not to mention its less reliable, meaning your power will sometimes be inaccessible even if you do manage to get into a decent position (which is difficult enough). \n\n\nThe heal on his ult makes for a good teamfight interaction...but it being potent requires him to be in the middle of a teamfight, which will still be exceedingly rare at any moderate MMR or above.

He's eating number nerfs along with this. \n\nHe was already extremely situationally unreliable. His teams positioning, their teams positioning, their team's builds, your team comp, their team comp, their mobility, your mobility, do you have Rylai's, do you have void staff, do you have zhonya's, do you have 40% cdr, are you somehow far ahead, do you have your E stacked, can you proc storm-raider's, etc, and it was very easy for things to end up sub-optimal for him, even if they start optimal just due to his lack of ability to reposition well. Just one of these things being out of your favor can make it so you absolutely will not function. His animations and self silence on ult held him back a lot as well. \n\nNow you have to wait for CC to be used in order to E. Basically can't E unless W is off CD. Need to have stacks on Q.

Q does less damage, heals less after rank 3, and in situations where you can actually trade, E costs WAY more without significant payout until way late game, where its still weaker than old E DPS-wise.\n\nNot to mention that, despite Q being weaker in just about every way, and just barely stronger with the rush proc, he no longer has WotA as a crutch and Randuins lowers its damage as well. \n\n\nThis new kit is a wash. You need HP for E to feel good, but you need 100% glass cannon AP for Q to feel good now.\n\n\nLess burst. Less DPS. Squishier. Worse Vlad than the already pretty bad one. Can't even use the E+Q->stormraider's surge proc to let you actually teamfight decently with the new rework. ","replies":[]}]}]}
