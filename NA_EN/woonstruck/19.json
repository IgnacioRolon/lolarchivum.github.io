I'd hardly say champions are 'abusing' ADC items, despite many of the rush items there being just as binary as IBG. *cough* {{item:3508}} *cough*\n\nThe reason is because of the massively lopsided AD meta, not because its OP.\n\nIf mages were more viable, IBG would cease to be a rush item unless its absolutely core on that champion. \n\nEven with the nerfs, people will still use IBG because it offers CDR, damage, and armor. Everything a tank needs for this meta outside of HP, which they will be buying plenty of. \n\nThis isn't solving the issue, which is AD being too strong atm which creates damage spreads leaning way too far towards physical damage. \n\nIn fact, a better 'nerf' would be to make the spellblade procs all magic damage. It would be a self-correcting problem in that every top laner would then also need significant MR in order to lane safely. ADCs would also effectively take less damage due to Maw/Scimitar.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GamblerOfLives","date":"2016-04-06T13:16:52.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"the thing is IBG and TF are very good items both..but, IBg gives 20% cdr,has spellblade,tank stats and it;s very cheap..\nWhy go TF when IBG gives early powerspikes, tanks etc.\n\nI started buying it on VI,and it feels so good..TF has more burst..but, it's not really that much of a difference ..They should balance the price and things will go better;).","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-04-06T13:23:20.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GamblerOfLives,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jtr5XE3h,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-04-06T13:16:52.429+0000)\n>\n> the thing is IBG and TF are very good items both..but, IBg gives 20% cdr,has spellblade,tank stats and it;s very cheap..\n> Why go TF when IBG gives early powerspikes, tanks etc.\n> \n> I started buying it on VI,and it feels so good..TF has more burst..but, it's not really that much of a difference ..They should balance the price and things will go better;).\n\nTF was nerfed for everyone except ADCs...and even on ADCs it was effectively nerfed.

If they nerfed AD, they'd see more diversity top, and less IBG as a result.

Why use that item slot for ~600 HP late game when you can use it for something useful? You grab warrior's and black cleaver, you have damage to kill anyone if they're in range for 3 seconds.
