Because they're approximately less expensive than other builds?\n\nThat's not a good enough reason, because there are _way_ more factors than just \"total build cost\". It has to do with per-item effectiveness.\n\nAn assassin is generally effective with around _half_ of an item. Typically {{item:3134}}, although {{item:3144}} or {{item:3057}} works as well, depending on the specific champion. That's from 1050g (for someone like Fizz, who rushes Sheen for Lich Bane) to 1500g (Akali, who sometimes rushes Cutlass for Gunblade).\n\nA mage comes online with about _one_ complete item. Nearly all of the time, it's {{item:3165}}, for 2900g. Some use {{item:3027}}, for 2700g and 6+ minutes to hit effectiveness. Enchanters do the same, except with whatever enchanter item is the meta at the time (currently Ardent, for 2300g) combined with a 500g starting item (technically 850g, but we're ignoring costs for the first part of it, as we ignore Doran's items for others) for a total of 2800g.\n\nNote mages can still do things without these items, they just kinda suck before they have them.\n\nJuggernauts come online with about one and a half items, typically Black Cleaver and the resistance component of their first item (Chain armor or Specter's Cowl). 3000g+800/1200g, for a total between 3800g and 4200g. Riven, Kled, and Fiora come online here, as well, and Yasuo starts to be relevant, as he gets 100% crit.\n\nTanks come online with around two items. Either two full defensive items, or a semi-aggressive item (Titanic or Sunfire) with a defensive one. There are a _lot_ of options for this, but it sits around 6000g. Yasuo actually becomes decently relevant here, as he completes his Infinity Edge, although he won't be teamfighting for shit yet, because he has no sustain or defense at all. Mordekaiser also becomes relevant here, or at least as relevant as he _can_ be.\n\nTeam phase starts about right now, with at least 2 outer turrets gone.\n\nBruisers tend become relevant with around three items, although it ranges between 2 and 4. Gunblade is a must, as well as a defensive item, combined with Rageblade, Triforce, or Titanic. This is around 9000g, because these are a _lot_ of expensive items.\n\nPantheon caps off about here, as well. Most assassins tend to, as well, as they have to start building defensive after their third item.\n\nAround three and a half items is when marksmen tend to become actually important. IE, Zeal, BorK or Bloodthirster, and half of their tank-shredding item. Before, they were kept alive solely by the support. Now, they're actually able to 1v1 tanks, juggernauts, and other marksmen, as long as the opponent isn't fed, and doesn't close to them. 2600 for zeal item, 3700 for BT, 3400 for IE, and 1300g for Last Whisper, for a total of 11000g. Sure, they do damage _before_ then, but they'll still suck ass in any team fight, because they'll be killed by stray damage. Before now, the only thing keeping them alive is the support. Now, they actually become somewhat self-sufficient.\n\nMost other champions cap off here, as well, as almost everyone takes a truly defensive item.
