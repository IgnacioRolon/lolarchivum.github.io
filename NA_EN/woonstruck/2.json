Ideally we'd have a situation where people wanted to queue up equally as all 5 roles at all times of the day. Given that doesn't happen we instead look to approaches like this to put together the best matches we can with the players in queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Aazzlano","date":"2016-10-17T21:38:25.812+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the theory of it anyway.
