First and foremost we wish for the boards to be a fun, inclusive, and engaging community where others can share their thoughts, opinions, and ideas with each other about the game we all love. However, there comes a time where clashing ideals can arise both from playstyle differences and from the ranks in which people play. Someone in Silver, for instance, has vastly different opinions than someone in Diamond. That's fine, that's to be expected, and in fact some people who are in lower ranks can offer valuable insight to others in those ranks. For instance, despite the fact that Malphite is not considered a very good top laner there's definitely arguments to be made that he can be fantastic for players that are either new or lack mechanical skill for higher tier picks. \n\nNow, when mentioning rank there are three ways to go about that. The first is what I just did, a broad sweeping generalization that targets no one. That's obviously quite fine because not only am I not targeting anyone specifically it also is spoken in a positive fashion. Stating that silver is a lower rank is not derogatory or hurtful in any fashion because it is just objectively the second lowest rank that is currently available. \n\nThe second is talking to someone in a respectful manner where rank is relevant. For example, if someone in Bronze is claiming that Orianna is terrible and is having trouble winning with her despite being a very good pick you can use that as an example to say something along the lines of, \"Orianna is a very team and farm dependent champion and since bronze players usually are not very team focused she might not be best for someone in your rank. Instead, you should try someone like Lux if you want to play an immobile, utility focused mage as she's more independent.\" \n\nNow, for the third, and the one that we action on, is one I'll use the Orianna example for again. Instead of being respectful and objective with your statements you might instead say something like this. \"Well you're in bronze and bronze players are bad and can't farm and don't coordinate so of course you think Ori is bad.\" While you're saying effectively the same thing this comes across as very inflammatory, insulting, and disrespectful. You've thrown all ability for thoughtful discussion out the window when you pointedly used their rank as a way to discredit their opinions and effectively tell them they suck. That violates the golden rule of our board and thus is grounds for the deletion of a comment. \n\nI hope that this post has been informative to you and other that may be reading this. In the future I trust you will keep this in mind for both your own personal conduct and approach to the boards as well as knowing exactly what kind of comments are considered valid reports. \n\nGood luck out there Summoner!\n-DJ Hatsune Miku","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2017-07-28T21:03:31.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DJ Hatsune Miku,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=872fWmfh,comment-id=000100010001,timestamp=2017-07-28T20:37:06.182+0000)\n>\n> Hey Dominick Destine\n\nHello , Mr. Moderator.\n\n>in fact some people who are in lower ranks can offer valuable insight to others in those ranks. \n\nThat doesn't explain why my comments started to be deleted for pointing out people's status in a bracket.

At the point where subjective arguments overtake objective reality, is the point where justifications become irrelevant.\n\nBronze and Diamond are not the same thing no matter what rules or forced censorship you apply. We will all still know this but we just can't 'say it'.  This is the problem with hardcore censorship, you don't eliminate the idea, you just assure that it will take place in hushed tones  behind your back.\n\n>Well you're in bronze and bronze players are bad and can't farm and don't coordinate so of course you think Ori is bad\n\nAlso.... funny you use that as the \"bad example\" despite it being 100% correct. This is one of the cornerstones of censorship; It doesn't matter if something is factual , accurate or correct, it has to follow a certain ideology or it will be suppressed....\n\nDon't get me wrong, I will follow whatever ideology you command. These are Riot's forums after all and I will obey the rules.\n\n>when you pointedly used their rank as a way to discredit their opinions and effectively tell them they suck.\n\nI would challenge you, Mr. Moderator, to point out a single instance of me saying \"You are wrong because you are (Bracket)\" or, \"You suck because you are (Bracket)\".\n\nNever once have I done that, what I did do  (Very often actually) is state \"You are wrong because X.... I'm not sure why you'd say Y but it's probably because you are [insert bracket]\".\n\nFormat:\n[Counter argument] + [Suspicion] + [Statement of fact (Bracket status of %t)]\n\nYou did not mention within your three ways of stating reality, what I just said. As in, an explanation for the terrible arguments presented by a person in [bracket].\n \n> I hope that this post has been informative to you \n\nYou had no interest in \"being informative\", you were just twisting the knife.\n\n>I trust you will keep this in mind \n\nDon't worry, I have already been informed of it and will engage in self-censorship \"or else\"  as has been made clear to me.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be a shame if you were perma-banned from the boards\" is what you are saying, I read you loud and clear sir... funny how I can be directly threatened by moderation and that's fine, but if I even point out someone's current status in a bracket, that is considered 'wrong'... do as you please.\n\n> Good luck out there Summoner\n\n\nYou too, Mr. Moderator.\n\nI expect swift retaliation from Moderation due to me even responding to the above quoted... if the observed trend is to be believed.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2017-07-29T08:22:27.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh for fucks sakes.... You are not a free speech hero here mate.\n\nPointing out someones rank (Like you do) is simply an ad hominem attack (Especially how you use it). It is the basic \"You are x so your opinion does not matter\" bullshit that those who avoid debate use. Again, in a real debate or a discussion such ad hominem attacks would simply make you lose instantly. \n\nIdeas have to be countered by ideas, not pointing out the person who has those ideas.\n\nBronze and Diamond are NOT the same, you are right, but that DOES NOT mean that they are different in EVERYTHING. Like it was said THOUSANDS of times to you before, game knowledge is only a small part for going up the rankings. As such a person in bronze can have just as much game knowledge as a diamond, just have troubles applying it in game doe to many other factors (Which you covenietly ignore).\n\nSomething being factual does not mean you should say it if it has NO relation to a discussion. If you are making arguments over something and discussing ideas or something like that, brining up a character attack is unnecessary and an asshole thing to do, no matter how factual it is.\n\n>  \"**You are wrong because X.... **I'm not sure why you'd say Y but it's probably because you are [insert bracket]\".\n\nOnly the BOLDED part is needed. What is the purpose of the rest of that? The only purpose of that as i can see is simply saying \"LUL YOU SUCK BRONZIE\" just hidding it. I have done simmilar things in debates before, hiding a character attack in some differently worded sentences, it does not change that it is a character attack and has NO PURPOSE.\n\nYou are threatened by noone, and the \"Help i need to self censorship\" line is just riddiculous. Is me having to not say \"Get cancer\" or else i get banned, censorship? If i can't say the N word to not get banned, is that censorship?\n\nNo, it is not, its being a polite human being that goes after opponents ARGUMENTS and not the opponent himself.\n\nI will repeat, what purpose there is to point out anyones rank in ANY situation when discussing ideas. What does it give to the discussion?
