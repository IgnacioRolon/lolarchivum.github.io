The nerfs you had in store for him weren&#039;t even very significant.\n\nJayce's early game is FAR too potent **when half of his all-in is magic damage**, even before pen builds were meta. He fell off way too hard then. That should be something you seek to change regardless of the state of itemization around him.\n\nThe only difference now is that he's stronger mid-game and he doesn't fall off as hard due to lethality. \n\nJayce needs tuning. I promise you its not just lethality. God damn. This is why people say your balancing is way too slow.

We do in fact take data into account when we decide to make or pull nerfs/buffs. It was difficult to justify hitting Jayce again given the way his performance has been trending down from other systemic changes we've been making over the past few patches. (Mastery damage amp nerfs, Yoomu's nerfs, Black Cleaver changes etc.)\n\nVarus on the other hand did not experience the same impact from those changes as Jayce did and so we had more confidence we needed to tune him down a bit more. Shallow example: Varus doesn't build Black Cleaver, which is still pretty staple on many Jayce builds. \n\nThat said, it's not like everyone on the design team believes Jayce is perfectly  tuned in his current state, but it is difficult to make a case that he is blatantly overpowered and requires more nerfs on top of the Edge of Night nerfs we will be shipping in 7.5. The shield duration is being reduced from 10 seconds to 5, making it much less potent as a \"I get to walk around wherever I want\" tool. We will still be keeping an eye on Jayce and make adjustments if deemed necessary in upcoming patches. \n\nOn the topic of favoritism, I will say that though Jayce and Varus are both powerful at poking enemies, I tend to think Jayce's poking pattern has more play around it than Varus's. Empowered Shock Blast is not only block-able, but it also has a much longer down time between blasts when compared to Varus's high up time pass through Piercing Arrow shots. When these two champions are both strong, I believe the game feels less fair if you are being poked down by a Varus over a Jayce. This is why the direction of our Varus nerfs in 7.5 are targeted at making the damage of his Q more in line with a pass-through ability and hitting its up-time if spammed at long range mindlessly. Differences like these influence our decision making as well when it comes to nerfing/buffing champions with similar strategic strengths. Out of all the champions that share a strategic space, we tend to favor the ones who use healthier gameplay patterns to express their strategic strengths than ones who don't.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-03-02T06:27:40.776+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":6,"body":">On the topic of favoritism, I will say that though Jayce and Varus are both powerful at poking enemies, I tend to think Jayce's poking pattern has more play around it than Varus's.

You don't fight a Jayce early game... That's not how you win from him. You take the poke, try to make him miss a few Q's, farm what you can and wait till you get 6. Irelia, riven, fiora can take on jayce on lvl 6 if you can utilize on his mistakes. If you are still scared or playing a weak early champ just farm, avoid poke as much as possible, take TP and outscale him... If he pushes (which will probably happen) ask for a jungle gank, cc him and fck him up.  If Jayce gets some kills someone fcked up... Then you just have to stall as long as possible and wait for his weak lategame. If you don't have frontline then you made a mistake in champ select..","replies":[{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2017-03-01T14:29:28.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"or we can gut him which is the better approach.","replies":[{"poster":"Joseraph","date":"2017-03-01T15:56:04.919+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Or you could adapt until he gets tuned down.

Not only can he kite but he has multiple disengage tools that while also following up. The only time he going allow a chance at a sustained fight when Jayce is believes he bash your brains in with his melee form.

What you don't realize is everytime he pokes you with q or even autos he auto pushes the wave. Get more game knowledge learn how to manipulate the wave and you'll win lane more often damn stop complaining and get better at the game","replies":[{"poster":"Oakleaf Ranger","date":"2017-03-02T18:16:19.570+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If it was really that simple he wouldn't be the best too laners currently. The champions you listed are of the few who can beat him if close enough. If you really know the game enough then you would know that even under tower he has the tools to still damage you without getting tower aggro to continue to make you miss cs or take damage for it getting it. Yah he won't deny you all your cs but he can deny you enough that there will be a significant gold difference. Now what if I pick a ranged top laner who can farm better under tower? Well that is true but at the same time you are also probably squishier than a melee champion and now Jayce can also use his melee form as part of his rotation to harass you instead of just finishing you off as opposed to a melee champion who could possibly  win a sustained fight against him. You also assume that Jayce can't manipulate the wave as well. Newsflash he can and guess what I would do if someone is trying to freeze the wave on me if I was in his position? I would shove it straight to their tower assuming I even allowed a good chance for the wave to be frozen in a unfavorable position.","replies":[{"poster":"FTWolf","date":"2017-03-03T06:06:19.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's not one of the best top laners anymore it's literally that simple. I wouldn't say anyone with a 47% winrate top is the best top laner. Sure he was the best when he had a high 52% but that's simply not the case anymore. Manipulating the wave isn't just pushing it, it's knowing when you can back without losing cs, freezing, putting jayce in a advantageous position for you since he insta pushes the wave when he harasses you. It'll put you behind in gold, but if he doesn't kill you and you play it smart until you get your power spike relative to his level cuz trust me any tank who doesn't die to him early can 1v1 him easily its incredibly difficult for jayce to face tanks. Trust me when I say this if you aren't adapting your play style to beat a measly mid tier jayce now, you're probably worse than the person you're laning against.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
