Significantly weaker, and he was already in a terrible state before. \n\nThe burst you do its relatively equal if you happen to have empower Q and get a fully charged E. The DPS took a HUGE nerf. \n\nThe sustain from empowered Q hardly matters because its so clunky that you can never, ever get it off in a situation where it would be useful.\n\nThe ult heal feels insanely weak for how much damage they took out of it. \n\nThey even nerfed his W damage for absolutely no reason. At least make it scale with rank back up to 15%.\n\nDespite being 'the sustain guy', he cannot even fathom fighting anyone with lifesteal now. His DPS and burst are now both far too weak to even hope to go toe to toe with them.\n\n\nThis Vlad reworks' numbers suck. He needs huge buffs. One of them could be taking the healing delay off Q. Its impossible to get clutch heals because of the delay, especially since using W makes you avoid the Q heal, and that's where a huge portion of his issues come from.

Heal particle gets canceled if you wait until after Q casts to W. \n\n* W gets canceled by E. Can't cast E during W. \n\n* W now has a longer delay before untargetability. Untargetability now ends sooner, but you are self-silenced for that remaining duration still. Combined with new Q delay, its nearly a full second that you're vulnerable, and often get crit 2 times by the ADC and die before you can use empowered Q out of W. \n\n* I seem to be dying during W quite often, despite facing minimal DoT damage so far. Hell, ignites aren't even on me the large majority of the time before I pool. \n\n* E's self-slow is entirely counter-intuitive. I'd rather them remove the self-slow and enemy slow on full charge.

I just played several games with him. \n\nI did fine in lane without dying but when it came to team fights, the damage and DPS nerf was real. Q did pretty much no damage unless it was empowered (and there's too little control over when its empowered, the window is too short to use). \n\nE is SUPER hard to aim. People would just walk away whenever I have the blood balloons up and if I snap-shot fired it, it does SHIT damage. \n\nHe is now super awkward to play with very little pay off. It used to be the case that you would simply kite in team fights with Qs and snapshot Es (both were highly reliable) with tons of damage, the only handicap being range and lack of cc. The old Ult worked very well with that because you could fire it and just keep kiting.\n\nNow its SUPER not fluid because E takes time to charge (people just walk away).

Considering CD was nerfed, he gets off even fewer still, and only half as many actually do something.","replies":[{"poster":"UltÃ®ma","date":"2016-05-05T04:33:58.607+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"My personal thoughts on Vlad from someone who purchased him as his second character when starting League years ago, and played him moderately ever since, sometimes in ranked...\n\nPassive: I actually like the shift towards health. Vlad being more of an AP Juggernaut is an interesting concept that really fits his theme and the class mechanics. Low mobility, huge DPS and tankyness/sustain.\n\nQ: Currently the Blood Rush passive has far too short of a window for Vlad to do anything but use it immediately in lane after the second charge. There's no way to set this up for a gank or teamfight in any fashion, which means that Vlad never gets to position himself at an advantage even when he gets the drop on someone. That feels really bad. Either the window needs to last longer or the unempowered Q needs a bit more sustain/damage to let Vlad trade.\n\nW: Virtually unchanged and it wasn't Vlad's biggest damage dealing ability by a long shot, so why the numbers got nerfed is a bit beyond me but falls under the \"pretty inconsequential\" category for me since the move was used either as an escape tool or a means to dodge an opponent's nuke/cc.\n\nE: Considering the huge telegraphed windup on E, and the fact that it can be blocked by units, and it's relatively short range I don't understand why he needs to be slowed while channeling it. There's already a lot of counterplay existing in that skill - the self-slow just makes Vlad feel clunkier than he should.\n\nR: Vlad should get an immediate payoff for using this ultimate since the 10% damage increase is extremely hard to actually use given that the window of opportunity for an optimal use of both Q and E have been narrowed significantly. Getting Blood Rush and an fully charged E while this ult is active to get a fair trade feels restrictive.\n\nThey're pushing him in the right direction but he's severely lacking in power and his windows of power are far too telegraphed. Given that he has no execute, no hard cc, no real tools beyond his sustain and power to assert lane dominance he really needs to shine in these departments, which he isn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JMoormann","date":"2016-05-04T22:44:23.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of that seem number problems though, which are to be expected after such an update.

Vlad COULD have survived this if spell vamp hadn't ALSO been removed.

They should also remove the Slow from E in exchange for more damage. The Slow is useless anyways because most Vlads are going to rush Rylais. I would also consider making E Snap-shot fire but still block-able (allowing counterplay) and FIX the health cost and damage at a point between the max damage and min damage as I think it being snap-shot fire would be way more useful to Vlad players for their DPS then the current clumsy charging. I know it takes away some decision-making but right now there's too little oppertunities to use the full cast anyways. \n\nCrimson Rush needs a longer timer for the buff since you can't control WHEN it is up. Think about it... am I going to go... ''Okay, there's a team fight, let's use the First Q on a target, when I get to the fight I'll use my Second Q on a nearby minion and then position myself so that  ~SEVEN/FIVE seconds later I'll be near an enemy to hit him with Empowered Q? It's just not REALISTIC and you just can't set up plays like that. You can't predict where you will be or where your enemy will be that many seconds later.\n\nAlso... R should get MORE damage amp than pre-rework Vlad (I'd say 15%) and we can do away with the Heal. It's entirely useless, you don't heal if you are in Zhonya or Pool mode anyways.

If you look at the changes to his passive, his scaling on his e, and the way his crimson rush healing works, building HP on him is much more valuable now than it was before.  He's less of a burst mage and more of an AP bruiser now.","replies":[{"poster":"CowboyNinja","date":"2016-05-05T06:56:42.740+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be true, if the HP to AP scaling where much much higher, but its not nearly enough of a boost. Old Vlad was a better at every format. From Glass canon to strait Tank to in between. The numbers on Vlad right now are just super low. But on top of that, his kit is now the most telegraphed in the game. He literally can't even do damage without help from teammate CC. Oponents who are more mobile, which is literally everyone in the game, can bob and weave out of his damage. He is a joke compared to his former self, which is saying something b/c his former self was already under-tuned. \n\nIf he got ahead, sure he was unfun to play against. Just a wall of stats that you couldn't ever kill. But you had plenty of opportunity in the early game to crush him, with many many counter picks or even just solid jungle pressure.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AHeroNamedHawke","date":"2016-05-04T20:49:42.477+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait they didnt even fix the bug where pooling makes you lose your Q heal?
