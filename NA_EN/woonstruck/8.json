Because pretty much every item interacts with one mage's kit the same as it'll interact with another mage's kit. \n\nWith Marksmen you've got abilities that make them auto attack faster, or give them on hit damage, or they've got a low cooldown spell that they can use in between auto attacks, or they primarily use spells and only fall back on auto attacks. All these different play styles, each of which has a slightly different build that works better for it. \n\nWith Mages, you do most of your champion specific decision making at level 1: do I start Tear, Catalyst, or Lost Chapter? Everything after that is dictated by what the enemy team has, not what your champion wants.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-03-09T19:25:59.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it had cost added to it, it would need even more HP or simply just buffing the HP and not touching the AP. \n\nIt already isn't cost efficient.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Orangesilk","date":"2017-03-09T21:28:27.140+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, why break the legs of champions like {{champion:31}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:85}} just to nerf Brand Zyra and Cass?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Golden Tager X","date":"2017-03-09T19:08:30.148+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:154}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:27}} yes pls","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheIronRevenant","date":"2017-03-09T21:46:02.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"plz no {{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-03-09T21:49:20.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you not realize how much better it would be for Morde? lol","replies":[{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2017-03-09T22:42:00.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because having an item balanced around a single champ is a good plan.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-03-09T22:45:11.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Implying Morde would be the only champion to use a Rylai's with more health and less AP...lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheIronRevenant","date":"2017-03-09T21:50:37.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why not just nerf problematic champs and keep the rest alone though","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2017-03-09T20:26:31.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WoonStruck,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6N2pmmlg,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-03-09T18:04:00.706+0000)\n>\n> Nerf Cass&amp;#039; E because it USED to count as AoE/DoT for the purposes of spellvamp and Rylai&amp;#039;s, and during her shit-tier rework, they removed that in an attempt to make the rework less trash.
