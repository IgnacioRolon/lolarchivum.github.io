Only players who consistently leave games face punishments from the LeaverBuster system.  \n\nIn regards to legitimate excuses, this is much harder to track from a data stand point.  If your internet was cut out for instance, there is no way for us to determine if this occurred due to issues with your ISP or whether you simply pulled the power cord from your router.  However, this is why we give some leeway and lenience to players who disconnect from games -- we understand that \"things\" happen.  Therefore, the punishments are only given to those who consistently leave games.","replies":[{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-08T04:14:51.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not true, friend.

Had you been in a Summoner's Rift game, \"friends\" could refer to two people and still leave two spots for randoms on your team.  Both were Twisted Treeline games, so those are teams of three.  You won one, and lost the other, both with the same teammates.\nWin: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1720291449/32485300?tab=overview\nLoss: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1720303437/32485300?tab=stats\n\nSo are you saying your friends reported you for being AFK?
