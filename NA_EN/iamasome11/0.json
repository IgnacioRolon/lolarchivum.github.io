The second i pressed alt+tab the client crashed. At first i just assumed it was a bugsplat and then it continued to happen. So i decided to re log. That didnt work because now the log in screen wasn't working. I go onto another computer and i try to log into my account and its fine. But the second i get into loading screen it crashes. I finally manage to get into game. Then crashes again and this time it goes to completely to black and i can't leave the client. Can someone help me with this( yes i did repair my client) idk if this is just a problem with the champ or what.(Legacy client)'","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-03T23:06:27.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since this happened across multiple computers and similar crashes were experienced, I suspect this is caused by an *unstable connection to our servers.* These issues are typically caused by certain network settings that aren't compatible with League, so I strongly suggest working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as your next step in troubleshooting.\n\nLet me know if this caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
