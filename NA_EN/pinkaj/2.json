I don't play with anything in the background other than the client, and making it disappear after the game starts doesn't seem to help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-30T02:13:41.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your network may just be having some kind of hiccup with its connection to our servers, and that hiccup lasts long enough to actually d/c you.
