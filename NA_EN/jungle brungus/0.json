Fortunately, there is an easy fix that should resolve this:\n\n1. Make sure that you are logged into the client\n2.  Go to your League installation:  C: -- Riot Games -- League of Legends -- Config\n3.  Delete the following 2 files:  Game.cfg and PersistedSettings.json\n4.  Go into the client and start a new Custom Game\n\nThis should force all of your in-game settings to default, but it should also resolve this issue.  \n\nIf this doesn't help, let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Mustafa115","date":"2018-03-23T20:55:09.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do I do that?

I play on Windowed Bordered, and sometimes if i click off of league, it will auto-lock the camera (even if the option is not toggled) The way I've found to fix this, and who knows maybe you'll have some luck with this, is as follows:\n\nHold Left Click on the minimap and scroll around the map briefly.\nThen hit space. You will be auto-locked on your champion again.\nRepeat the first step, and your camera will be no longer locked.\n\n\nIt works for me, hopefully it will help you too.","replies":[]}]}
