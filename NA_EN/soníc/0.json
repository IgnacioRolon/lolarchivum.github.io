Story of my life, a solution.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We&#039;ve all had that guy, in ranked, who disconnects, claims to have astronomically high ping and we have to sit back and watch the game spiral out of control as the inevitable defeat of a 4v5 comes to fruition. Sometimes, you win and it&#039;s a miracle, but more often than not, you are stuck in a game for at least 20 minutes that is far from enjoyable.\r\n\r\nNow, there are 2 solutions, 1 little more harsh than the other, but one, as a soft encouragement to those who have intermittent connections issues. \r\n\r\n1. Have a way to view ping before being in-game or have ping tested/connection tested BEFORE queuing up. A lot of the people who have connection issues didn&#039;t know it would happen before they go into ranked or a game and as a result, get punished for not really knowing. It would be really great if we could see our ping to the local server before we queue up for a game, with perhaps warnings for anything over 300 when starting queue. An average over a short period of time could be taken to give some idea of stability too.\r\n\r\n2. The harsher concept... connection test before queuing up for Ranked games. Stress test the connection, check ping and for any problems specifically that might impact gameplay. No one likes it when a player dc&#039;s and i&#039;m sure many players who suffer from disconnects feel bad as well, leading to punishments/longer queue times and restrictions they did not really have much part in. Giving people something or someway to test connections, maybe an average over a short period of time could significantly reduce problems with people&#039;s internet or at least highlight the fact that they may be having connection issues. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts on the matter, please feel free to comment below and add any potential other solutions!","replies":[{"poster":"No Good Deed","date":"2016-03-23T18:11:35.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe they could add in a active ping meter to the landing page or something because I've been having these exact problems too and I never really know when it'll happen as it seems to be fairly random. (Ty comcast).  That said it feels like there might be server issues to consider, like how do you test your connection to a server when you don't know exactly which server your connecting too or various other conditions I'm not smart enough to think of.  Wish they would add something like a ping test though before you get in-game.","replies":[{"poster":"Soníc","date":"2016-03-23T18:37:22.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, generally servers are clustered around the region you are in I thought (im not certain), you could at least get a fairly decent idea of what ping you'll be playing with beforehand, but yus, a ping on landing page would be great :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrNova","date":"2016-03-23T19:29:00.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I doubt any of those would be foolproof.\n\nI've pretty good net and generally have no problems, but like every so often I have one match that's starts out fine, normal ping on loading and normal ping to start the match, but then randomly it starts climbing and so.e games when it happens it has hit like 10k. Next game will probably be fine too.\n\nSometimes the servers just don't like you.","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2016-03-24T01:26:13.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol, so true. Also LoL servers in general have been really weird lately. You can run a pingtest, a traceroute and even try out other games and have your ping be fine but then you try to get into a game and poof 200+ ping","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soníc","date":"2016-03-23T19:41:58.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree, it's not a total fix all, but a lot of people go into a game with the problem existing and not realising til the game starts, by which point it's too late for everyone.
