How Do You Handle It?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you think is the best way to handle shards you own or dont like?\n\ni reroll champion shards because i already own all the champs so i get all new champs on release day for 0 IP. i can basically reroll for the next 7 new champions with because i have 21 champion shards.\n\n\nhowever for skin shards i use to reroll skin shards i didnt like and ended up with crappy or inferior skin permanents like repear hecarim so now i handle each skin tier based on the value of the skin shard:\n\n1) if its value is 520 RP i reroll it with 2 other 520 RP skin shards for a total of 1560 RP value. this way my chances of getting a skin worth more than 975 RP is increased since there are more 975 RP or higher skins than 750 RP or less skins.\n\n2) if its value is 750 RP i disenchant it if i need skin essence for skin shards that i like but need skin essence for. if i dont need skin essence then ill reroll these with other 750 RP skin shards and any 520 RP skin shards that im looking to get rid of.\n\n3) if its value is 975-1350 RP i handle it based on different criteria which is based on questions i ask myself and these questions are:\n\nis the skin nice to look at? if yes keep it to permanently unlock later, if no disenchant it\n\nis the skin shard legacy? if yes keep it,  if no look at other criteria\n\nis the skin shard for a champion i cannot play or do not like to play?  if yes disenchant the skin shard, if no look at other criteria\n\ndo i own a skin for that champion?  if yes which of the two skins is better IMO? if it&#039;s the skin shard then i&#039;ll keep it. if the skin i own is better than the skin shard then i&#039;ll disenchant the skin shard. \n\nso based on this criteria:\n\nfor instance i own winter wonder lulu and IMO winter wonder, star guardian and pool party lulu are much better than dragon trainer, wicked, and bittersweet lulu, so if i get pool party or star guardian lulu i&#039;ll keep it to unlock later and if the skin shard is dragon trainer, bittersweet, or wicked lulu i&#039;ll disenchant it since those are the inferior shards IMO. if the skin shard is for a champion i cannot play such as corki or viktor i will disenchant it unless it&#039;s Arcade Corki or Creator Viktor (i love those two skins so if i am forced to play either of them in ARAM i can at least enjoy the skin for that 1 in 5000 games).\n\n4) if its value is 1820-3150 RP i will always keep these to eventually permanently unlock as all these skins are not only really expensive but almost all of them are really nice. even for champions i cannot play such as Anivia i will still keep Blackfrost Anivia since the bird sound she makes is cool and the skin in general looks nice. and if i ever have to play her on ARAM i can at least enjoy the skin.\n\n5) any skin shard worth 975 RP or higher that i already own is automatically disenchanted on the spot so that i can permanently unlock other skins that i actually do want. if the skin shard i already own is less than 975 RP it automatically gets rerolled with other skin shards from the reroll pool.","replies":[]}
