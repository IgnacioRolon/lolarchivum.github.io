As soon as the client went into champ select it crashed on me. I logged back in before my turn came up in champ select but it didn't reload champ select and still gave me a dodge timer. The only other program that I had running was teamspeak.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-25T20:21:16.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your client randomly crashed in champion select, it may have been due to third party programs which is something we don't support for reasons like this.  If you are using play.tv or overwolf, remove them and you should be good to go.  Losing 10 LP suggests a frequency in [dodging](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging), so it's important to get this fixed up to prevent further problems like this.
