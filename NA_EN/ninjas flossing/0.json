Usually, but not always, the hate is understandable because that champion is at peak performance at the time. or is riven. or yasuo. or master yi. but in all my years of league ive never understood the hate, not for Annie, but the person playing Annie. In all the instances Ive seen the people go after the Annie player harder than if they were a yasuo main, a riven main, and a supporter of John Wilkes Booth all wrapped into one. I dont get it. where is the reason behind this? i&#039;m genuinely curious if anyone know why its so bad but no one actually talks about it.\n\n\nEdit: Im asking abou the hate towards annie players, not annie herself.","replies":[{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2017-10-29T21:41:48.808+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They dont like being beaten by a little girl.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TetsuTeito","date":"2018-01-08T01:00:49.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for chiming in so late. Just stumbled onto this page. I wanna throw in my cents. I think people hate people who play Annie for the same reason they hate people that play Garen. Both are considered \"noob\" champions that are meant for new players and players who don't yet know how to play the game. They're both made so that even someone who only has basic knowledge of the game can still do well and even carry the game. So you have all these players who are trying their hardest to win games with complicated (sometimes) champions and doing their best with them, and then you have the people playing Garen and Annie who literally just have to point and click and can win lane and are beating those people into the ground. I think that's part of the reason. Singed is another good example. Just run around in lane with Q on. People aren't so mad at champs like that, because they know they need to be there for newer players. They're just mad at the people playing them because they're so easy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2017-10-29T21:47:04.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well for one thing, pretty big burst, impossible to dodge stun (q is point and click, w is aoe and is more point blank, therefore impossible to miss, and R has no missile speed) , and {{item:3152}} to increase your buttblast radius.\n\no and like 40% shield  from e and the only counterplay is to not get close.
