Opinions don&#x27;t matter!\n\nFirst, What are you talking about?  the way you said \"what is right\" and \"opinions don't matter\" implies you believe that there is a single objective morality...  which, wow. Im not going to give you a liberal arts degree in this post, but wow. I guess youve never heard of philosophy? \nanyway the reporting system is the first step in a process, not the entire process. it sounds like you don't understand that.  it doesn't matter if the players agree what is right or wrong because RIOT has its own ideas, and the reports simply flag behavior for review by a bot and or arbiter as needed.  \"expecting that most players know what is right\" is irrelevant. in this little fiefdom of the internet, RIOT is the law and they pass judgement, so I really don't see your point. If I report someone for playing Yasuo because Yasuo makes me uncomfortable, the system will disregard it. the only rationale which needs to exist is the rule set the bot is programmed with or the feelings of the arbiter\n\nP.s. if you haven't learned that morality is a fluid construct governed largely by mob sentiment then it sounds like you've never studied  history at all.   throughout all of history some people have behaved badly, and the whole reason we created law in the first place was to build a structure of agreed boundaries to make the SUBJECTIVE desire for a behavior into an OBJECTIVE expectation of it.   This is what Riot has attempted to do with the reporting system. so because Riot wants B.S. reigned in but cant easily define it, they leave it up to us call it.\nas such whether something is or is not considered offensive is best judged by the one reporting it, after wich Riot is responsible for sorting reasonable reports from the frivolous.","replies":[{"poster":"Ecophile","date":"2018-11-05T12:02:58.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice novel on ignorance of philosophy.

They will always find something to nitpick over. Ur not playing meta. Ur not playing at the skill they expect of you. you dont build how they want, play to thier schedule. \n\nI have gotten sick of trying to play by thier broad \"how ur supposed to play\" attitude. People in this game spend more time trying to micromanage who can play who in what role, what they are and are not allowed to build. Rather than actually play the game. \nI have had more people who are \"uncomfortable\" with the fact I dont play like....everybody else. I play like....ME (what a horror story.

Unless I get one of those bizarre games where everyone is chatty and nice, I just don't bother. It's not worth it. I don't need to deal with getting reported because somebody didn't like my performance and so they reported me because I might have been a bit negative as a result. I feel threatened as a player, constantly concerned I might say something that upsets someone and it triggers the wrong flag, getting me banned or muted. And I think it's ridiculous, I shouldn't have to be some ray of sunshine to chat. I should be able to say a game is over, defend myself from harassers, discuss the possibility of why we're losing, etc., without getting muted. I hate how Riot is trying to turn this game into some form of safe space. Let me vent, my team can mute me, let me defend myself, I'm being harassed and it hurts, let me speak my opinion as long as I'm not being some racist bigot. Why must I appeal to every person I meet, out of fear that they will get upset and report me? No other game does this. As long as I'm not being some racist piece of shit, I don't have to worry about getting in trouble. Now I have to censor myself on the off chance I upset someone or Riot doesn't like my word choice. Even saying \"shit\", on Riot's boards makes me nervous, where nowhere else would I be afraid of cursing. \n\nThis company seeks to censor and silence and it's frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"DumberThoughts","date":"2018-10-25T18:15:32.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"No other game does this.\"\n\n\"This company seeks to censor and silence and it's frustrating.\"\n\nWell, Riot (a company originally created by some American kids) was sold to Tencent Holdings Ltd (a Chinese company) in 2015.  Tencent, like all Chinese companies, is actually owned by the Chinese government.  And from what I've heard the Chinese government has some issues with censorship.","replies":[]}]}]}
