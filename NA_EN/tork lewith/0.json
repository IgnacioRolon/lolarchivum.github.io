I play one game out of it and I dc again because my connection turned off. The game ended early and not only did I lose 17 lp but I just got placed again for low priority for 20 mins. This is actually unfair and is there anyway of a mod taking this off or at least reducing it to 5 mins each game because it just makes playing this game so much less enjoyable if I have to use up over an hour for one ranked game. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"KZ Engel","date":"2018-05-24T00:50:57.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"forum mods are in no way employed by riot or able to do anything outside the forums \n\nlmfao \"can a mid take this off\" jesus christ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-05-24T00:04:05.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you should have a prob with anything, have a prob with your isp, or your equipment.","replies":[{"poster":"Tork Lewith","date":"2018-05-24T00:06:13.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"not everyone has the money to buy new equipment but thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-05-24T00:48:44.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tork Lewith,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=M9czIA4Z,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-05-24T00:06:13.125+0000)\n>\n> not everyone has the money to buy new equipment but thanks\n\nGet a job, get a better job if you already have one.\n\nDon't blame riot for your own faults. aka bad equipment.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
