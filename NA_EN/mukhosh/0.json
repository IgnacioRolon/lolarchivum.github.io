For some reason, it was fixed after following the steps in this thread : http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/LpIqNmo4-after-downtime-and-patch-patcher-window-is-wrong-size. \nUsed the fix there because I had the dpi issue also but yesterday the dpi issue was not keeping me from logging into league. The fix required me to log out of windows to apply it. Re-logged into WIndows, launched league and it worked.","replies":[]}]}]}
