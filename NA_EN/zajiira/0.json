This bothers me because i don't like every champ . Im not asking for a refund , i just want them OUT of my personal collection please . This would benefit the company as well , as you would make a good profit off indecisive people who may want to delete a champ and buy them again , thus they would pay a second time for the champ and any skins they may have had of it .  Please please HEAR MY CRIES lol and implement some sort of delete a champ system . Im a good League player who spends a lot and loves the community . I will literally PAY you guys if i have too . their are just certain champs i'm not good with and want out of my collection and have no interest in wanting to keep .","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-26T17:39:02.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While we may not be able to offer a refund without tokens, we can look into removing champs for you.
