Both times were around the 25-30 minute mark.  First game was with Fiddlesticks the second game was Miss Fortune.  After letting the game try to reconnect I logged out and attempted to log back in and reconnect to the game that way.  Both times I kept getting the \"Unable to reconnect\" error.  I've never had trouble with the game before, sure maybe the occasional lag spike but nothing like this.  I enjoy getting reported and losing LP for this kind of crap, any suggestions?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RajdRsY.png","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-03T19:05:38.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Losing LP is a crappy feeling when it's out of your control like this, and I'd like to help.  It sounds like you could be having an unstable connection that's losing comms with the game server.  This seems to be the issue even more if you're getting hiccups on the client side too, and trying to grab updates.  You'll want to go over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this, making sure to go over each step to rule out possibilities.  Test it out in a custom game to be sure.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"99Samurai","date":"2017-03-03T22:54:52.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the help however I disagree entirely with the fact that I am being punished by the leaverbuster and that I lost LP over this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"99Samurai","date":"2017-03-03T09:17:07.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I should add this, finally able to log back in and the game says \"Applying update\" then gives the countdown timer.  I log back in and I get the leaver buster warning!  Are you kidding me, back to back disconnects on your end and now I get a warning that I have to sign no matter what, absurd.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/gA0af7U.png","replies":[]}]}
