That's not gonna be that great in this game unless you are low elo. He can't stick to you forever and well he isn't going to be ulting you unless you want to be ulted by him so giving him more damage doesnt really matter.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Goldenwolf14","date":"2016-05-20T09:59:21.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an Ekko main who only likes playing AP Ekko I personally like the removal of the slow from his passive more than the scaling Q, mostly because that strong slow on his Q is one of the only ways to really get that second hit off with his Q since it is pretty easy to dodge that second hit if you aren't slowed as hard as you get after it has been upgraded a bit. Also the slow on his passive is the main reason he is so oppressive as tank Ekko because it is an easy to confirm strong slow unlike his Q and W which are much harder to land which makes getting that strong CC from them fair in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Bombstek","date":"2016-05-20T12:07:57.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"no, landing the Q isnt that easy, removing his passive slow will kill ap ekko literally.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheOvermind","date":"2016-05-20T06:23:03.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rioter response WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO","replies":[]},{"poster":"7thHeaven","date":"2016-05-20T02:45:12.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7587RhmB,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-05-20T00:54:33.952+0000)\n>\n> We&#x27;re still considering changing Ekko&#x27;s Q slow to scale with AP instead of rank.

Work in progress change list basically\n\nEkko has already been killed off tbh I feel you're just basing what to do with him off player frustration. I've encountered many problems with recent patches with what's too strong and difficult to play against and Ekko was never one of the cases, His kit offers so much counterplay it's high risk low reward. If anything he deserves a few buffs to bring Ap Ekko back to being a assassin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bombstek","date":"2016-05-20T12:15:37.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The Q slow scaling with AP is a nerf to tank ekko without affecting AP ekko negatively\nbut removing slow on passive is a huge nerf to AP Ekko and will kill him.. and i figured out from your posts guys that u want to nerf tank ekko without affecting AP Ekko negatively, so i dont understnad why removing his passive slow instead of making his q slow scale with ap??","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bombstek","date":"2016-05-20T12:05:26.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please man dont remove slow on passive just make Q slow scale with Ap, but removing his passive slow will completely kill AP Ekko too, just dont kill a champion bec ppl are crying to you man about him.. i believe the base damage nerfs for all his abilities including Q and R and q slow scaling with AP are enough to kill tank ekko without destroying AP ekko with him,","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RengClaw","date":"2016-05-20T00:47:01.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it was discovered that it made him too weak","replies":[]}]}
