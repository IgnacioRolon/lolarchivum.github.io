The pick brings no counterplay to the lane.  Malphite can poke with the best of them and when he hits 6 the lane kill potential is huge with no counterplay.  I shouldn&#039;t have to flash to outplay an ult that is going to slow my attack speed down to the point of never being able to shoot an arrow.  I haven&#039;t discovered a way to beat this out unless you ezreal.  All other adc&#039;s need their attack speed to do any damage and malphite reduces it to the point of an automatic loss of lane.","replies":[{"poster":"H1 H0w are Ya","date":"2018-01-16T22:30:33.040+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":">Malphite can poke with the best of them\n\nGave me a good laugh\n\n8/10 shit post","replies":[{"poster":"Get Body","date":"2018-01-16T22:32:13.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you played against a malphite using comet, manaflow, and scorch????","replies":[{"poster":"Get Body","date":"2018-01-16T22:34:45.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"One button from a level 3 malphite is going to chunk you for 150+ hp.
