It's nice to sit down after a long day and play some league - it's particularly fun when I win :P. However, after the recent update (I can't remember which one but it was a bit after the Heimer rework) I got huge lag spikes every 2-3 minutes where my ping would jump from 90 (what it normally is) to 400-450 making the game unplayable during those intervals (the lag spikes last about 10-20 seconds before they go away). \n\nI have disconnected and reconnected my router to see if the internet was the problem. It's not as I have no trouble with it when I'm doing anything other than playing League. I don't get to play LoL a lot and this is really frustrating me.\n\nCan someone help me with this? \n\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-04T19:43:13.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it almost sounds like you might be having some packet loss troubles. If you can grab your most recent network logs that had the ping issues and toss those into our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). Take a screenshot of what the log reader says using something like Gyazo and post it here so I can confirm that packet loss!","replies":[]}]}
