Originally I was thinking something like Black Sun would sound and look really cool, but then I realized that may be to dark considering the Bloodmoon skins already are kind dark.  So then I thought It could be like Rising Sun Leona, or something like Shinning Sun Leona.    Unfortunately I can't think of something as catchy as 'Bloodmoon' lol.","replies":[{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2015-08-30T21:36:27.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"solar eclipse {{champion:89}} ?

In the same way that Blackfrost Anivia still is about, well, ice, just a varied form of her champion (darker colored).  In the same way that Forecast Janna still is about the weather, just a varied form of her champion (her weather ooks more dust-like).

You have a point, and I initially agreed with idea before posting this, but then I realized there's already some legendary skins that are just a varied forms of the classic champion, for example:\n\n{{champion:8}} - Bloodlord {{champion:8}} \n{{champion:40}} - Forecast {{champion:40}} (she still relies on wind)\n{{champion:34}} - Blackfrost {{champion:34}} (still ice/frost just a darker color\n\nThe point is, I don't think a reason such as it being too similar to her original concept would be enough reason to not give it to her.  It could really provide what I would feel would be a cool skin, and definitely on par with the standard of other legendaries.","replies":[{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2015-08-31T01:20:53.128+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get what you're saying.
