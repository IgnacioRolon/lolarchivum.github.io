Whenever I go to launch it I don't get this pop-up that is supposed to appear so I click this https://gyazo.com/708258e518e98b058f517e90dcb8ac80 \r\n\r\nAnd this pops up\r\n\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/342d6f0f37174efef70f8b2b13fb1a3e\r\n\r\nWhich only has information on the practice tool ^\r\nI have searched through the website for the download and maybe I missed it or something. I only found the download for the legacy client which seems to bugsplat every time I launch it now. (I fixed it by doing something like this https://gyazo.com/414c4bf57710c7b54dc294fbec2d50af ) Which brings it to the legacy client from which I do get a pop-up for a download for the beta (Which I haven't gotten in months) When I click on that it brings me to a page where it just uninstalls the whole game...\r\n\r\nI do not know if I am missing something or maybe I should just wait until they release it completely in 12 months.  \r\n -Sincerely,\r\n               me","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-24T23:57:02.550+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There might be some confusion with the directory and the client thinking you might already have the updated client installed.
