It does not happen all of the time but it happens enough for it to get annoying. I normally get around 150 fps on max settings. I decided to put all of my settings on the lowest to see if that fixes it and I am still experiencing the issue. \r\n Specs i guess\r\nIntel Core i5-4690l CPU 3.50GHz \r\n16 gb ram\r\nnvidia geforce gtx 970\r\n\r\nI can run most games decently maybe my computer is just crapping out.
