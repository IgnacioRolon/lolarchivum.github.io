Well every so often my game client will just crash right after i pick my champion to go into champion select, or another instance, sometimes i cant start it up again if it crashes from the game, like dc, crash, etc.. Another thing is i'm getting banned for this, today i went to play a game, and it wouldn't even start, right after champ select i got bug splat, i tried multiple times to get it to work, i even tried to restart league and it still didn't work. Anyway i'm getting banned for dumb reasons, it would have been fine and i would have got a warning but yesterday i dc from league of legends in the middle of a game and it wouldn't reconnect and it counted as a quit. Just please riot, can i get un-banned, and mostly my thoughts is if your game crashes you shouldn't be penalized at all, because even if you do reconnect to the game, you missed a leash(if your jg) or missed valuable time farming in a lane. In my opinion you guys are way too strict when it comes down to this kind of stuff, its at least an hour of game time, how are you expected to be available for 1 hour 100% of the time. You get 1 chance, i think it should be 2 chances. Please if you revert the ban can you please tell me in comments below, i never check my emails so.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2014-09-25T22:01:32.182+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have the Crash report number from reporting the crash via the bugsplat prompt?","replies":[{"poster":"Soy Juanito","date":"2015-07-06T07:08:03.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont but i used my email and name when filling the bug report\ni dunno if u could help me??","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venearas","date":"2014-09-26T03:31:15.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can you help me?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2014-09-26T18:20:51.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have the crash report number?","replies":[{"poster":"HexTechBomber","date":"2014-11-24T15:18:07.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Do you have the crash report number?\n\nSo it's going to be a good thing to keep these crash reports now?

One thing I have forgotten to mention is that when I experience my issue in champion select, if I am in a Ranked Draft game, if it disconnects me, it makes to where I cannot select & lock in my champ.  This causes me to dodge a ranked game, which penalizes me.  I haven't been banned yet, but I have been given timers for dodging; as well as other folks.\n\nHere is a link to my thread with more descript information of the issue: [(http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/dEgs00Xi-bug-disconnected-from-pvpnet-bug)]\n\nIt would be helpful if a Riot member could post something on this issue.  I live in Louisiana, so the fiber optics cutting in San Fransisco has no impact on my connection issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nezbeck","date":"2014-12-07T05:51:59.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My current game crashed and won't let me reconnect. No bugsplat, the loading screen just never came up. I have already played a few games today and nothing was changed. I have tried reconnecting and resetting client multiple times and nothing happens. The loading screen just doesn't come up. On top of this being unfair to my team because they have no jungle now, but I'm going to get a leaver mark. I have never left a game on my own accord. Aside from uncontrollable happening like server crashes or power outages I have a perfect record with not leaving games.\n\n(just made a fraps of clicking the reconnect and nothing happen if riot would be interested in seeing what is happening)\n\n*UPDATE* i just had to agree to \"not leave a game again\" so i got punished because your server has problems....\n\nCan't reconnect video-  www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WXPuPaYP6A&feature=youtu.be\n\nChanged a few things restarted my computer and made sure only essential programs were running still had the same problem.
