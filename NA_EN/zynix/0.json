I came from Warcraft 3 like many others who played dota in custom games so my transition to LoL was pretty smooth. \n\nIn those days I could pick what I wanted and play in whatever lane I wanted. There was no pressure to play the champions I like in a specific role or lane. I could even build 3 sunfire capes on Morde if I wanted (legit strat btw). Building champs the way I wanted and trying to come up with unique ways to play them was fun. But Riot had to incentivize playing a meta and removing many off builds destroying a lot of creativity in the process. I've always felt like players should play games the way they want rather then developers telling us how to play. \n\nWell it wasn't until the release of Teambuilder that I finally started playing Summoners Rift again because I could finally guarantee that I would get to play what and where I wanted every game. Hell, it even got me to play my first ranked season because of the practice I was able to get in Teambuilder.  Just reconsider please Riot. Many people don't want to fight for their role and are willing to wait very long to get it. That's not even mentioning the lack of toxicity that exist when everyone has time to come to an agreement before the game even starts.","replies":[]}
