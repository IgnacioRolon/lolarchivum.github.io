My bad.\n\nUnavoidable damage without recourse plus absurdly powerful sustain is what made Yi OP in lane. Please reread the part of my post where I said \"mid\" and \"least fun lane\".\n\nThat is not the whole point of learning to play this game. Avoiding abilities surely is, but do you know how far Alpha Strike can target you from with a good minion to use it on? The required positioning to avoid getting hit was beyond farming reach. If you tried to push him under his turret (best course of action), he could clear nearly all of the minions under the turret due to the strength of his Q + his base AD. Also, not just a lack of CC. A lack of CC that you can afford to save until Yi uses his heal and is instant or near instant. It needs to interrupt channels, which many midlaners do not have easy access to. If it is not quick enough, he will have regained half of the total health which was an absurd amount.\n\n{{champion:84}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:143}} (old {{champion:26}} ) {{champion:91}} {{champion:105}}  For reference, if I missed any point them out.\n\nEffectively, what AP Yi did, was turn a lane into \"I've already won\" and it was absurdly frustrating to play against while also being able to clean up teamfights handily. \n\nIt deserved the neutering it got.","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-05-12T04:29:12.161+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"pushing the wave to yi's tower is never a good idea, it leaves you over extended and gives him easy farm. The best way to handle ap yi was to freeze your lane just outside of your own tower, that way you are protected from dives, and if you picked a champ with good wave clear, you can use that to cancel out his shoving if he tries to do so.\n\nAlso, so what if some champs didn't do well against yi? Every champ has their matchups. Also, you don't have to kill your opponent and shove down their tower to win your lane. It's better to focus on trying to out farm your opponent and roaming only when you are presented a good opportunity.\n\nAP yi wasn't 'guaranteed' to win his lane just because he had \"unavoidable\" dmg. It just made winning his lane against stupid opponents that much easier. I've lost my lane as ap yi several times because my opponents were smart and let me shove up exposing myself to ganks and being unable to capitalize on the harass I got on them due to their tower.\n\nAlso, katarina was always a great pick into ap yi. She could farm with her BB's if disadvantaged, and her ult was great for stopping his heal before he got any sizable ap. Also, yi had really no way of beating her in trades unless he could get away to heal up. If kat focused on out farming yi, she'd be able t burst him down while his heal is on cd. (22 sec cd is an eternity against a kat)\n\nOld talon was also an excellent counter against ap yi too because of his silence. Once talon got the ad he needed to wave clear, there's really nothing ap yi can do against him.\n\nYes, ap yi has a strong laning phase, but he doesn't have many options if his opponent engages on him. He's got 1 alpha strike and his weak sauce aa's. AP yi's late game is entirely reliant on resets, and if you deny him that, all that advantage he got in the laning phase goes out the window.\n\nYou need to stop looking at things in pieces and look at the big picture. You can't just ignore the flaws in a champ simply because they are really good at a specific time under specific conditions. You need to look at things more holistically. Was ap yi's laning phase frustrating? To champs that specialized in trading and kill potential, yes, to others that specialized in farming, not really. Was ap yi an unstoppable monster? If he got his resets, maybe, but otherwise was just an annoying lane bully with little late game presence.\n\nAlso, if you see that the enemy picks yi with top and jungle already taken and you havent picked a mid laner, don't pick a mid laner that is weak against his harass, pick a sustain monster or a farm centered champ that can bring more value to team fights than yi does.\n\nThere are numerous ways to deal with any situation presented to you, and it doesn't have always be \"dodge the skill shot.\" tbh, I sorely miss the days when the best advice for how to deal with a champ wasn't \"dodge\" but rather \"group up, focus him\" or \"stay behind your tank line\" or \"stun lock him\" or \"spread out so they can't get the most from their abilities\" But I guess that's just me being a season 1 fogey who laments how the game has become more about how good you are at dodge ball than actual strategy.\n\nEDIT: also, to be clear, I've had less fun playing against a le blanc than I ever did playing against an ap yi.","replies":[{"poster":"Orbv","date":"2015-05-12T18:12:57.644+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry but as a Season 1 player as well, AP Yi was always worse to face than LeBlanc. The idea behind league is that you should not need to pick specific champions to beat one champion. Granted there will and should always been champions that are just better than others at certain things, but beating AP Yi MEANT that you needed Talon, or Pre-Rework Soraka (ftw, this is what I used) or Fizz. \n\nI don't think Katarina was ever a good counter because he had better poke, her poke was and still is one of the weakest without a full rotation. Also, her grievous wounds is only her on ultimate, and if she ults to prevent his heal, he's still not taking damage with +100 Armor and MR.\n\nWhenever I played against an AP Yi, (hated when he was a last pick in ranked....), I would instantly sigh. I can handle LeBlanc with proper wave clearing and distancing. Yi could wave clear and could stand in your face and take harass because he would just heal it back. His Q CD may have been high, but it also had high base damage for a lvl 1 ability and he could proc his double auto off on you (which at lvl 1 still hurts).\n\nBUT, the #1 thing that I HATED about AP Yi, is that he only needed 1 of your teammates to die........and then the fight was over. Katarina at the time had the same issue, but lacked sustain. The difference is vast in that regard because yi could nuke, heal, get an assist, and then nuke and then stay in his stasis like heal tanking damage unless there was hard CC. On a team with someone like Tryndamere, it was a guaranteed lost teamfight. You can't hold hard CC for both of them.
