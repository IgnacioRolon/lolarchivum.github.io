I still occasionally come back to the game and play just enough to get a rank and then quit again. In the last year or so I&#039;ve been pretty much exclusively playing Dota 2 and maybe it&#039;s that but after coming back to league again for 10 games or so the game feels a lot worse than it did. I was wondering if the community could shed some light on a few things for me.\r\n\r\n1) I&#039;m a support main in both dota and league and generally play full supports like Soraka and Nami, with defensive secondary runes. Is it intended that burst ADCs like Lucian can almost one shot soraka with a combo at level 3 with no items? Or is Lucian just in an overtuned place right now? As a Dota player pretty much everyone does a ton of damage, including supports, but even in Dota you actually have to have items or levels to do that damage.\r\n\r\n2) In the games I played early snowballing almost guaranteed the win especially from assassins like zed or rengar, which happens in Dota as well to a lesser degree with heroes like Tinker or Storm Spirit, but in Dota a support has a lot more agency to help prevent this snowballing (porting in to counter gank, ganking mid yourself, etc.). In league a support is pretty much tethered to their carry until the end of laning phase by design, so the only person who is really in a position to preventing the snowballing is the jungler. My question is, am I doing something wrong as a support not being able to prevent this snowballing, or is this just the state of the game right now?\r\n\r\n3) Burst in general seems really high in league in comparison to Dota, things hit hard in Dota, but you rarely get one shot by something (even playing a support) unless the enemy team is REALLY fed. And even then the plethora of items with activated abilities gives you a chance to save yourself, there is even an item called Aeon Disk that literally makes you invulnerable for 2.5 seconds when you would drop below 75% health to prevent people who are really fed from auto killing you. It seems like half the champions I played against in my recent league games could 1 shot me with me having little to no way to prevent that. It is simply more viable to play champions with high burst right now? Such as Brand, Zyra, or Lux, instead of Soraka or Nami?\r\n\r\n4) Out of the 10 or so games I played, not a single time did the games feel close. Either my team was dominating until we won, or we were getting stomped until we lose (this does happen in Dota on occasion but only maybe 20% of the time, and you at least feel like there is something you can do). In both cases the games had no sense of apprehension or excitement. Are games generally much closer than this and my games were just outliers? or are games generally so one sided right now? My logic used to be &quot;Never surrender, they are going to screw up eventually.&quot; but that seems less true now.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking a look. I used to love league, but in comparison to Dota it just feels poorly balanced and swingy. I could be wrong though, so if anyone can shed some light on how I can fix this in my games I would really appreciate it.\r\n\r\n-Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Dovahkiin416","date":"2018-12-01T12:26:29.973+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":12,"body":"They have no idea how to balance this game, forget it and go play Dota.

It has a lot in common with league, with a few major differences. The biggest ones are map mobility, character design, and items. Everyone has high map mobility in Dota because of town portal scrolls so it's easy to counter gank if you are paying attention since you can port to any allied tower every 60 seconds. The characters are all very impactful in their own unique way, supports especially are the most powerful characters early game and have a huge impact, they fall off later, but it's a great feeling being able to impact all of the lanes in a meaningful way.","replies":[{"poster":"Stormshadow3503","date":"2018-12-02T03:10:44.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How big of an adjustment would learning how to deny minions and manage build be?

The hard part is forcing your opponent to let you get your own creeps since he'll be trying to deny your creeps too. There is also no blue pill in dota, instead you can purchase town portal scrolls that allow you to teleport to allied towers/fountain for 50 gold. But the cool thing is there is a shop in the side lanes so you can purchase some things there, and if not the courier can deliver items to you.

Still, damage overall is damn high, and even on a tank support like Alistar, you have to be very carefully to not get 100-0 by the enemie duo, especially if they have an agressive sup like pyke.\n\n2) Snowballing is extremly high in league atm, though supports do have some agency in coordinated play. If the duo is dominant or the adc is on a save pick, it enables the support to roam and help the jungle/mid and in rare cases top even early in the game. \n\n3) Prettymuch nothing to add here, damage is just so damn high compared to defensive options atm, and most champs can 100-0 with even a small lead, and those who can't are basically out of meta... \n\n4) Again, nothing to add. Games are very snowbally and atleast at higher elos, rather one-sided. In lower Elos, you have a decent chance that a fed oponnent gets cocky and donates some nice shutdown gold or that the eneimies just mess around instead of peoperly closeing out the game, or that they simply screw up big time. In high Elos, the changes for that are much smaller, and just stalling it out or pro-actively finding a come back is not really an option anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2018-12-01T16:26:36.432+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"I can put this simply: If you enjoy the way DotA is balanced, you will NOT enjoy the way League is.

I'll just leave it at that. \n\nStick to Dota and try again some other time, because in this state of the game I would strongly advise against starting to play/coming back to it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2018-12-02T12:37:53.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 - In LoL, you can get way more value out of defensive items as a support, not a carry, than in Dota 2(in Dota 2 as I'm sure you know, carries can be ludicrously difficult to kill due to some of the defensive items they can buy). In LoL, you're expected to be constantly on the front line or at least close enough to it so you can do your job. Often that means being the oppressed champion in bottom lane, unless you're the one oppressing the opponents. In team fights, you can perhaps get away with not being so important to the front line, but you can't count on it with regards to your allies in other lanes. That's why I like to get a head start on being a strong front line because in team fights it will really come in handy. In Dota 2 on the other hand, if you're trying to front line in team fights when you're several levels behind various enemy heroes, that's a recipe for disaster very often. \n\n2 - The jungler is not important for protecting allies. It's your job as a support champion to know when you should leave your lane partner. Many supports have mobility passives or actives to help them bounce from lane to lane, there are also assassins you could play as substitute supports that have mobility. Many players opt for buying Mobility boots and sometimes they pick up the teleport summoner spell to help out. The map is smaller than Dota 2 map, and there are runes sometimes for mobility, right now we have a rune for bonus movement speed in the river which is quite helpful for getting to the other side of the map, and there is also Relentless Hunter which is like the mobility boots. The jungler needs more help than has needed in seasons past due to the various jungle changes. If the support isn't helping the jungler, they are quite possibly throwing the game. Not just that, but rotating to another lane can sometimes result in a first tower taken for your team which is more difficult than was before the latest tower changes.\n\n3 - I think LoL is way more forgiving as a support than Dota 2 for staying alive. LoL has cleanse if you're playing someone like Soraka to guarantee you get your ultimate. Barrier is also always relevant to deal with some of that burst. Exhaust is the perfect support summoner spell as it cuts through enemy offense and makes it relatively difficult for the opponent to escape in just one spell. Income items allow you to maintain your gold gain, as does the lack of bounties being taken out of your income which happens often in Dota 2 as a support, making the support player fall further and further behind the other players.\n\n4 - Can't really comment on this one. I feel like if you know you're doing something wrong, you can improve, that's true in any of these games. RNG teammates quality is also something that can't be ignored in full unless you're actually not playing solo matchmaking.\n\nI think Dota 2 has more grievous balance issues for sure. Compare Talon with Clockwerk as an example. Talon's mobility is consistent and expected. Clockwerk's is unreliable, flamboyant, aggravating, and incredibly toxic if I'm being honest. There are a lot of totally BS heroes in Dota 2. Yes, there are typically answers for the BS, but it's not always easy to get to those answers when your team is being uncooperative. At least in LoL, people can be reasoned with. In Dota 2, you are surrounded by psychopaths. Yeah, there are crazy and sensible players in both games, but I find the Dota 2 community to be a lot more toxic which makes their insane heroes that much more aggravating to deal with, and it also makes hero reputations stickier than champion reputations.\n\nWhich brings me to another point. Don't be afraid to screw the meta in LoL. The more you learn about the game, the more the meta expands. In Dota 2, you're a lot more likely to get grieved for messing with the meta than you are in LoL. If you think something seems weak, then don't do it. Try something else. It doesn't matter if you don't see other people doing it. Experimenting is the only way you'll get out of your rut in LoL. There are too many horrible, horrible players in LoL and it gets to the point where the meta actually becomes a huge newb trap unlike the meta in Dota 2. The meta is actually not only more reliable in Dota 2, but it's also not as holy as many meta sheep think it is. Just some food for thought.\n\nI like Dota 2 as a game more than LoL, but I play LoL significantly more in recent years(I barely played it in the past although I played it in beta) because Dota 2 has the vastly inferior community quality.","replies":[{"poster":"r41p41","date":"2018-12-03T08:01:37.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2018-12-03T09:19:02.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"15 mana from Phantom Assassin deals about 2500 damage(and at a long range I should mention). People exaggerate about getting one shot in League of Legends when really it's a full rotation of abilities being used. But a fed Phantom Assassin barely does anymore than so much as looks at you and you die. I'm not going to give you more examples. The game is very volatile. \n\nYou seem to be misreading what I'm typing. Yes, I see dumb stuff like Infinity Edge Bard in LoL. And in LoL, there's a lot more room for ridiculous item purchases. That's entirely the point. In Dota 2, the builds are vastly more flexible than in LoL. And yet, players have very little to no tolerance for deviation from meta builds from their allies. The players that are building meta are the ones that are grieving, not the other way around.\n\nDota 2 ensures flexibility with its robust stats system, which has only encouraged even more flexibility with relatively recent stats and item reworks. The fact that so many players, honestly the vast majority of them are still grieving games because allies build stuff that's off-meta just goes to show how incredible toxic their community really is. There's was nothing in all of Dota's and Dota 2's history of items even close to as troll as a Manamune Zed(basically should only ever happen in demo mode or versus bots) or even Infinity Edge Bard(obviously not viable, but not completely useless either and clearly trolling/throwing) for Dota 2 heroes. That's just how the stats system works, and how their heroes are designed, when heroes are functional as either support or carry. Meanwhile, in LoL they just reworked Ezreal so that he can no longer trigger Summon Aery defensively, flushing out the last bit of impact he could ever have as a support. Champions are far less flexible than heroes. And the intolerance of Dota 2 players for others thinking outside the box just goes against all logic.\n\nIf you really meant that Hero X buying Item Y will not generate a report from that player's allies and that their ally/allies will not in fact intentionally feed half of the heroes or everyone on their team to the enemy in fights, then you're just a liar. It's not me being misinformed when it's happening to me. I'm not reading some random stuff on the internet to come to conclusions about how a community feels, and the fact that you can't tell that I've played Dota 2 means you've done absolutely no research on my time spent online.\n\nAnd for the record, it's not only hatred towards me in a team. So don't even bother trying to explain away whatever stuff I may or may not buy when it happens to everyone, that includes me of course but also includes allies on the team. It's not uncommon to do my job well and then 1-2 people start making horrible mistakes and all of a sudden a 3rd person begins throwing the game and can't be convinced to stop no matter what because 'Slardar didn't buy Blink Dagger' and guess what? The Slardar can 'apologize by purchasing a Blink Dagger' but it won't help. The player just keeps on doing it. I haven't played that hero in years and you want to know why? That's why. It was a couple months ago or so it happened when I was on the same team as him. I haven't been playing Dota 2 regularly lately and people trolling the ranked games and losing on purpose is exactly why I don't and can't take the game seriously. Not going to pretend that LoL doesn't have a corrupt matchmaking system also, but however severe the corruption, it's far less in my face than Dota 2's matchmaking system is. I can't even stay out of low priority for crying out loud, despite my most recent punishment in LoL coming from when someone that got fired was in charge of their punishment system and I'm always a nice guy in my games. I always have more reports than commends when the Dota 2 report card comes in, but at least I'm still able to get those commends. The fact is that bad people hate good people and in Dota 2, the good people are phenomenally outnumbered.\n\nI've seen streamers again and again lose games by trying to farm Blink Dagger on Lion or whatever champ it can be pretty good on, and you know why they are losing their games buying that item? Because in Dota 2, you lose gold for dying. If he spent his gold on stats items to stay alive and kill instead of saving it and losing it again and again then he'd not only potentially get to Blink Dagger faster, but even prevent the enemy from getting to their desired items faster. The concept of use it or lose it is completely foreign to many Dota 2 players that obviously didn't do well at Starcraft if they've ever played it. They even added a gold lost stat to the end of game scoreboard in recent times and hopefully that will help their community to stop being so toxic but it's going to take some time if it ever does. They need to do something else besides provide better information. They need to...start censoring propaganda. But I don't think they'll ever do that. I think they want the propaganda because it helps pro players stay relevant even when big changes come to the game. The incompetency of the 'guides of the game' is intentional because it allows them to keep average players from organizing functional teams.\n\nClaiming that someone is winning a 1 vs 9 is disrespectful to their teammates. If someone is truly playing a 1 vs 9,(where their 4 allies are losing the game on purpose) they aren't winning. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it. It doesn't matter which team strategy game they are playing. You're disrespectful in other parts of your post, but that is the biggest point of disrespect and  I just realized that I couldn't let that slide at the least.

Yes, as of late it's fairly normal to get one-combod by Lucian at level 3. He's fairly disgusting right now, and has been for a little while. It makes no comprehensible sense for an ADC to literally kill someone in a combo at level 3 but hey, he usually can.\n\n2. If you can, I would absolutely recommend playing a snowball champion. The game is in a massive snowball meta right now, with things like turret plating and league of Dark Harvest. (BY THE WAY: IF YOU CAN, PLAY A CHAMPION THAT CAN ABUSE DARK HARVEST. I legitimately see dark harvest on 3-8 people in every game; I saw it on 9 people in a recent one, though that was an extreme.) It's god tier right now, I've been taking it on Lissandra mid for about 30 games and it's the strongest I've EVER felt on her. An early lead can end a game before 20 minutes right now, so that's what I'd play for.\n\n3. It is 100% absolutely the most viable option to pick a burst champion. Damage is king in league, but that's not really a recent thing. Picking anything but a burst champion has been kind of stupid since preseason 8. For instance; look at the newly added stat shards which replaced tree bonuses. You can start the game with either a total of 20 ad/20 ap, or a total of 10 armor/magic resist. Damage has just been inflated to such a disgusting degree, legitimately every champion has become a burst champion (with some doing it waaaay better. Again, go dark harvest.) Burst is essentially a rule of league right now that we've kind of had to live with.\n\n4. This one made me laugh. I haven't had a game of League feel \"close\" in weeks, maybe a few months. That's simply just League. The only possibility you'll have of getting a close game where one side doesn't crush by 20 minutes is if NEITHER team picks a real ADC. Those are the only games where I've truly felt both sides had a chance, but that's very rare for people to do. (I'm talking like... Swain bot on one team and Rengar bot on the other; where you don't feel like it's a ticking time bomb as to who's carry will hit 1-shot auto attack god mode first.) Don't expect even games in league. You will ALWAYS be dissapointed.\n\nagain, if you enjoy dota then stick with it. I personally hate it, and have been searching for literally anything to fill the void I'll have once I finally quit league. If you've found that, I'd recommend staying with it.

Only a few of the carries are able to do a lot of damage early such as juggernaut, but are usually tanky enough to survive by themselves for the short time the supports are away ganking.\n\nMid laners are early to mid game powerhouses and are usually more level dependent then gold dependent. The supports are most likely to gank mid since the mid laner that wins is going to generally decide how the mid game goes.\n\nOff Laners are generally tanks or characters that have a way of protecting themselves, they are build to be able to survive against multiple enemies while doing a good amount of damage. The current lane meta is 2-1-2 so the offlaner will likely have a support to help them, but sometimes its 1-1-3 so you could be by yourself. if you can survive and get some levels and gold you can be pretty dominant in the midlane/lategame.\n\nSupports are the early game powerhouses, and will usually have the most impact on which lanes win. They will usually be either ganking or controlling the lane to protect their carry or put the lane in an advantageous state. Unlike League the supports have a lot they need to do, such as stacking camps, pulling waves, ganking, counterganking, and lane control. Supports are mostly squishy so bad positioning can get you killed pretty easily.\n\nMost of the heroes are pretty easy to understand conceptually like you said, but most are very complicated to play in practice because Dota has a lot more hard counters to heroes than League does. It's also very difficult to use some of the abilities correctly since they can sometimes screw over your own team. For instance Winter Wyvern's ult causes all enemies in a radius to attack a targeted enemy hero, but be immune to damage from her own allies. So you could get a great ult and cause all the enemies to kill their own support or you could save all the enemies from a huge ult from one of your allies if it's timed wrong.\n\nOne thing I had trouble with early in my Dota career was item knowledge. Most of the powerful heroes such as Phantom Assassin, a crit based carry, have an item that partially counters them. It took me a long time to realize that I could rush Ghost Scepter to prevent myself from being killed by her, Ghost Scepter makes you immune to physical damage for 5 seconds but makes you take 40% more magic damage, so it's a perfect counter to a physical based carry. So if you find yourself thinking that a certain hero is overpowered think about which heroes and items counter what there good at.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nausicäa ","date":"2018-12-01T23:15:58.529+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny cause League champions used to actually require items to do high burst damage too.

I also play a lot of support and nami is one of my favorite champions!\n\n1) Is it intended that burst ADCs like Lucian can almost one shot soraka with a combo at level 3 with no items?\n\nYes. It isn't fun or balanced, but the few ADCs that shine at the moment can easily burst early on. Pure supports like nami and soraka have very few base HP wich makes them vulnerable to begin with, and the ADCs that are popular these days are the one that are spell based like {{champion:236}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:81}}. Since infinity edge got pretty much gutted, ADCs that don't rely on crit have a great advantage in the early/mid game compared to other ADCs. Also, items that are not crit based have way more utility to them, so it makes them that much more efficient on carries that can build them. All ADC items just give crit and auto attack based buffs, while items like {{item:3142}}  {{item:3071}} {{item:3153}} give way more interesting side effects.\n\n2)  Am I doing something wrong as a support not being able to prevent this snowballing, or is this just the state of the game right now?\n\nThe only opportunity you have to roam as a support is if you get kills in your own lane or if your enemies back, so it can be pretty hard to help prevent snowballing if you are not doing well in lane. The answer would be: You can help prevent snowball if you are doing well in lane. Otherwise you pretty much have to stay bot lane and make sure your ADC doesn't get killed.\n\n3) It is simply more viable to play champions with high burst right now? Such as Brand, Zyra, or Lux, instead of Soraka or Nami?\n\nI'd say pure supports have pretty much always been very safe picks, but they do get challenged hard by supports that deal lots of damage. I think it really depends on the team composition. If you already have an AP midlaner, going AP support might not work as well in teamfights since you will sacrifice utility for magic damage, wich you already have. But on a team with lots of AD and tankiness, going AP support can carry the game. Everyone around you has access to farm and kills, and you get a shitload of assists so you can build almost as if you were a laner too. The enemy doesn't expect you to deal as much damage as you do since you are ''Support'' and they usualy won't build MR since the rest of your team is AD. Plus, Dark harvest is insanely strong and poke supports can abuse it. It feels very strong on Lux (wich I main), because you can proc it easily and if you are bot lane you can get 2 stacks for one if you win a fight.\n\n Also I must say building AP items always felt more impactfull to me, be it on pure supports or AP supports. {{item:3285}} always feels like more of a powerspike than let's say {{item:3107}}, that brings nothing but an active. Supports have some nice AP scalings, you can give so much MS with nami and heal for much more if you go AP rather than support. The utility you lack in item actives, you make up for it by having actualy usefull spells. Support items have been kept mediocre stat wise because if they are good, other AP champions can use them too (wich is bad apparently).\n\n4) Are games generally much closer than this and my games were just outliers? or are games generally so one sided right now?\n\nPersonnaly, as long as the enemy team doesn't have an inhibitor, I feel like the game can be turned around. I have seen many games that dragged on only for the team with the lead to end up losing. But yes, the game has been pretty much one sided for a long time. The new pre-season changes are helping a little from what I see, with stronger towers making early dives dangerous. They also don't get destroyed as early, wich gives you a little more time to farm and prepare for the mid-game.\n\nHope it helped!

If Lucian is pick/ban, the champion/game isn't balanced correctly due to his movement and solo kill potential. Right now critical strike carries are pretty bad, so that opens up Lucian as being a viable pick since he doesn't rely on the critical strike items to deal damage. Pair him up with a {{champion:201}} and they're pretty much unstoppable.\n\n2) Snowballing has been a problem for a while now (I'd say the whole duration of Season 8) and Riot is attempting to stunt the snowballing by adding a bounty system that can reward up to 1000G if you shutdown the person who's snowballing. On the flip side of things, Riot also reduced respawn timers awhile ago and recently up'd the stats gained from the dragons and shortened the cooldown of Baron/all elemental dragons including Elder so teams who are snowballing can absolutely crush their enemy.\n\n3) Ever since the new Runes came into effect, burst damage was immediately a problem. The shielding supports were also nerfed (which they needed to) so enchanters are still viable to shield some damage, but aren't broken OP like they used to be. A lot of the S+ champions being played now are also played in pro play ({{champion:7}} / {{champion:104}} / {{champion:266}}) so Riot likes to keep them viable for \"entertainment purposes\" since watching league is more important to Riot than the actual players playing the game. They're likely going to be nerfed now since the pro scene is in offseason right now, but new champions will rise and stay busted for a few months and eventually fall over the course of the new season like always.\n\n4) Games nowadays are all centered around early game pressure, damage, and scuttle control. If your jungler plays with his eyes open and happens to have his team assist him around those early scuttles, he's most likely going to snowball the game in favor of your team. On the flip side, if your team loses those early skirmishes around scuttle or they just get solo killed, you might as well just ff @ 15 unless you can somehow collect the bounty from your enemy after you or your teammates fed him multiple kills to rack it up.\n      \n\n_                                                                                                                                                                                      - Thoughts from your average Platinum player_","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noor Sakata","date":"2018-12-01T16:23:10.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would rather not , if they do , it would be copying Dota 2 which isn't good for the game's reputation","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Bearded Bard","date":"2018-12-02T05:34:59.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"1.
