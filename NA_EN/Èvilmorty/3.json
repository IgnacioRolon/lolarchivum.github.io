The first game it crashed then turned off league for a few hours then retarted my computer made sure everything was working fine and crashed again. They were both ranked games now as a result I lost 50lp due to this and its very frustrating. This may seem like whining, but lets be honest you would be upset and frustrated if this happened to you. Is this a bug with the new patch and if so can riot please restore my unfairly lost lp?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-09T23:46:30.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you give me more details as to what errors or behavior you saw when the crashes occur?
