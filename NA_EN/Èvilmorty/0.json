It just kept saying game in progress and said that that i was already in game. Well i was not in game, i was stuck outside the game unable to reconnect and as a result the game counted me as afk. Now this didnt happen once but twice in a row but, the second time it said it was a DirectX problem. I will probably get a afk ban for this but, something like this has never been a problem except now, so wondering why this is happening and could I get this possible ban lifted? Because this is something that is out of my control. I wont ask for a lp compensation since for these 2 afk games that i couldnt control, i went from 80 to 21 Riot please help","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-07T22:49:29.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was the directX problem resulting a bugsplat?
