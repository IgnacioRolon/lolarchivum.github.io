Skillshots by nature are something that once you fire them, you cant adjust them.  Your opponent has time to react (or rather can depending on reflexes) to the course of a skillshot. The caster of the skillshot can aim in 2 locations. 1 the target's current location, and 2 a probable location.  But unless your skillshot is a laser ( meaning this applies to lux and xerath only if i recall correctly, tho despite being lasers they have delays so their opponents can evade them if they want ) your opponent can adjust his position according to your skillshot.","replies":[{"poster":"OnanThaMan","date":"2018-04-14T21:00:31.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=VanaQuish,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EUWBviWs,comment-id=0002000100000000,timestamp=2018-04-14T20:10:37.734+0000)\n>\n> Not always.
