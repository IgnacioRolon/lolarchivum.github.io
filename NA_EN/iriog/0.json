Not just a generic support.\n\nHer passive fits the role of a tank very well, though. I'm no authority, but if I were to try to sum up the role of tank (which is orthogonal to the position of support), I would say that they have a few key traits. First is obviously that they need to survive a beating. The second is that they usually need to be able to initiate (which Leona obviously excels at). The third is that they typically want some way to redirect damage away from their team.\n\nThere's a number of ways to do this redirection. CC is obvious, as is direct absorption like Braum's shield. As anyone who's faced a good Singed or Amumu can attest, though, another type of redirection is just being a sustained, low level threat that applies continuous damage as long as they exist. Leona's passive fits this last category, as it applies a noticeable damage increase to her team for as long as she remains in the fight. Thus it makes her at least somewhat less ignorable in a teamfight.\n\nCertainly the passive works best from the support position in early game, but it's applicable in mid to late game regardless of what position she plays.","replies":[{"poster":"Hidden Sanity","date":"2014-05-01T07:23:55.912+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"But would it hurt to allow her to activate her own passive?  Even if it took her damaging the target with her passive on it three times to consume it to her allies one damage source, that'd at least make her work in extended fights and allow a viable jungle clear.  Would also make her consider things like sunfire more, which I feel is a great flavour fit on Leona.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainWednesday","date":"2014-05-01T13:37:43.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If she could activate her own passive, it'd be a little broken. Not in exactly in the sense it would be OP, just that it would be mechanically unhealthy. If she can activate her own passive, she could snatch kills from her laning partner without meaning to. It would also put a lot more damage on her kit than she needs. A Leona player is a team player. They set up the kills with her heavy disruption, engage, CC, and overall tankiness. It should not be Leona with all of that, plus more damage.  \n\nThat beings said if her passive read, \"Leona's spells charge any enemy unit damaged with Sunlight for 3.5 seconds. When allied champions deal any damage to those targets they consume the Sunlight debuff to deal 20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80 / 95 / 110 / 125 / 140 additional magic damage. This additional damage is counted as the ally's damage and it will benefit from their magic penetration. **If Leona consumes the debuff, the ability deals 50% less damage**.\" Maybe that could work? I don't know. Rito help.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-05-01T15:46:16.475+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was my thought as well.

He can both trigger his passive (albeit it's more about applying the stun, but it still does a fair amount of damage), and when it can't be reapplied, he does bonus damage on hit. Braum and Leona are both tanks who thrive on being close to an ally, and in similar ways. But Braum's seems to have more of an ability to secure a kill when his team isn't around, while still building tank. Every tank has some form of damage output that either scales with something, or is naturally available, stand and fight if need be. Leona can hold like a boss, but if no help is coming, she can't secure a kill (at least not well).\nIt'd be nice to see some hp scaling on one of her abilities (even if it's a 2.5% like Braum), or maybe she does a small amount of magic damage on hit to enemies afflicted by sunlight (since she can't trigger it).\nNothing that gives here a huge advantage, just something she can capitalize on if no one else is available. I mean, really, you can only stun-lock someone for what? 1 or 2 minutes before the enemy team finally comes over to help their teammate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-05-01T17:12:42.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's important to note that I'm not sure how much this would help her solo laning, as she wouldn't deal any more damage to champs.

Allied(non-Leona) damage sources add three stacks.  Leona damage sources add one stack, and refresh duration if it was one of her abilities that would normally refresh it now(An E>AA>Q>AA combo would reward Leona with one passive charge consumed and a target with no passive on it until she hits it with another ability). Her passive functions identically to now in any situation where there are allies present and dealing damage, and buffs her solo game slightly but noticeably.  As such this passive change is a minuscule buff to support Leona(Like... she ignited something with her passive on it as it got away?) and almost won't need any Nerfs at all to keep her support power in check, maybe a tiny shaving off her base HP.\n\nHowever, it's a substantial buff to solo-lane Leona and a a genuine buff to her jungle.\n\nI feel like this would reinforce an interesting play pattern for Leona as she'll want to pick windows to engage on her lane opponent where she can stay in and activate her passive one or even two times, looking for extended trades where a lot of laners look for short trades.  Jungling it just really throws her a bone on her clear times to bring her more in line with the other slow-clearing hard-ganking tanky utility junglers, which aren't in meta right now but I still like, and feel like Leona can and should be one of them.  But then, that's just my opinion as a player.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-05-01T07:34:53.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Randolph, I think that's a good overview of what a tank is.\n\nThe first issue is she's got such a power spike at 2-3 you are almost hurting the team taking her solo where that passive can't be reliably procced.  If she goes mid/top she can't expect to get a gank at those levels.  \n\nIf she goes jungle the lanes she wants to gank may not be ready.  And her jungle is terribly slow.  She can't justify FF at all, and that means she's just going to fall behind further in this jungle meta.\n\nSo she'd need to get something for that tradeoff to justify this as a regular (or niche) thing and I don't see it.\n\nYes her passive works fine mid to late game, but right now things are focused on early game.  Also the passive is a bit wonky in that it doesn't benefit her.  The real benefit is for teammates.\n\nFor awhile I've been saying that one she applies it, she should at least get bonus AD against that target or maybe sustain on hit so there's at least a little self benefit.  IMO it's design is parasitic.  Name one other champ who's passive ability is not self-beneficial.  \n\nThe biggest issue with her passive is that it is invisible power.  Some champs like Sona I think are fine with invisible power.  Sona is squishy, mute, and music based, you aren't supposed to see music and she shouldn't be drawing extra attention to herself.  She doesn't have that flashy personality.\n\nHowever with Leona you can't really feel or tell what that passive is doing.  You can never notice it directly.\n\nI think for a champ who is suppose to be in the middle of a fight, having a passive that's invisible (and requires coordination/communication to proc it) doesn't really fit with her theme.  She's supposed to be super visible so the passive is against her nature.\n\nYes bruiser Leona either top or in the jungle is a thing, but it's just pretty rare.  This is partly because she's kind of weaker when she doesn't build full tank.  \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"duniceline","date":"2014-05-03T14:40:47.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are focusing on the current meta though, the point of the changes people are suggesting are to bring her in line with champs like Naut and Amumu who gank super hard but clear slow.
