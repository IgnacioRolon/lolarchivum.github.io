I'm not even speaking about this from a post hoc 20/20 hindsight prospective either. This is a repeated pattern by riot for years now and the exact problems that now exist were obvious on the inception of the new system and are fundamental to it's design making them extremely expensive problems to attempt to solve working within the bounds of it.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/5I5HU8R3-with-the-new-rune-system-revealed","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-08-11T05:45:41.798+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, no, they don't just do it because it's new. They do it because they think something is better. To assume that they blindly move forward without understanding the merits and disadvantages of an older system is ignoring the fundamental of design in the first place. \n\nWith Old Runes, and this is my opinion, they were needlessly complicated for new players, and had plenty of noob trap choices along the way. There was also the hassle of having to use outside sites to see other players Rune pages, yet more barriers. I don't include \"They were expensive\" despite being an old complaint, since the argument \"they can be made free\" exist. Is a learning curve bad? Not at all, but just because you can learn to deal with a problem, doesn't mean we should just accept that a problem exists. \n\nThe Old Runes merit: They did allow a lot of choices, either to bandage a weakness, or to emphasize a strength. It had a bunch of fun choices, as people like SivHD can surely agree. The ol' 1% crit chance meme, Movement speed out the wazoo, full HP regen etc. The question remains however, does the confusion outweigh the learning curve and barrier for entry to Newer players?\n\nThe runes weren't perfect, and there's a reason to as why they were changed. *How they were changed* is a different problem all together, but it remains the fact that it is change.

Simply being new has no relevance to the system itself, only your perception of the system, which will change when the system has been out long enough to no longer be considered \"new\"... which is exactly what's happening a year later where people are now starting to take a critical look at the rune system now that the little depth it did have has been completely explored already.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lil Homie busta","date":"2018-08-11T02:23:45.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be nice, if the stake in hand wasn't said playerbase.

But every move cost resources, and they shouldn't be so bold when they don't have the playerbase fully supporting their idea (cough* cough* {{champion:266}} ). That's where SINCERE and DETAILED communication is so important. All they did back when they announce the new runes was showing some flashy and interesting stuff, without putting the whole perspective of the current rune system that we have today.

Dunno if anything came of that from the Aatrox playerbase during that roadmap, so enh. You also need to consider, that people hardly ever like change, as seen with the plants.\n\nYou don't know how something will work until it's released on a mass scale, playtesting can only do so much. You also can put too many eggs in what the community thinks, especially something like Runes, because they've been a thing for so long that most people just accepted them as a fact of life. How do you go taking in player feedback in something that's second nature to them? How would they know something better exists?\n\nI think a lot of shit EA get's is deserved, but one thing I agree with them is a less \"excuse\" version of \"Players don't know what they want.\" EA uses this as an excuse to disregard players opinions about a fanbase (Saying fans that want a real C&C game don't know what they want). The truth is, Players can only see so far in front of them. \n\nHow would they know, something is better? Metroid Prime was criticized for leaving it's 2D platforming for it's 3D FPS aspect, but Metroid Prime is an amazing advancement of the series. Not a lot of fans from the 2D age would tell you \"You know what I want from my 2D game? Make it 3D and first person.\" Same goes for Mario Sunshine, a far relative from the usual gameplay of Mario, but still a great game. \n\nSo, my point, is how does a company strive to make their change Metroid Prime level of Success, when also striving to keep the familiarity of something old? It's hard, and doesn't always work, but the chance is worth it imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2018-08-11T12:14:41.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People generally don't know exactly what they want until it's right in front of them.

The old runes were great in concept, and it was easy to customize and create unusual options for various champions.\n\nIt's funny, some people complain that the old runes were complicated.  They really were not complicated, except maybe for 6 year olds trying to master the game.  They were easy to understand, and fun to manipulate, as long as you could read.\n\nIt's not fun to be forced into a cookie cutter with the new masteries/runes.  There just aren't many choices for us any more.\n\nRiot, you need to bring back runes, maybe keep the new system as a revised mastery tree.
