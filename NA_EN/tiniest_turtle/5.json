Now.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":34,"down_votes":11,"body":"Now I'm not gonna say Master Yi is underpowered or overpowered because I understand that if he's behind he can be useless and that hard cc destroys him. On the flipside, he can literally Q auto someone to death while being strictly too fast for them to run away from and all the while having a skill on a very low cooldown that allows him to go completely untargetable.\r\nI don't care if he's too strong or too weak, he's stupidly designed. If he's either a low to zero counterplay oneshot bot for entire teams that does so in just auto attacks and targeted abilities or simply just not a champion at all then there's obviously something wrong with him.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-07-25T06:41:03.143+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the problem with Yi is that he has the design of a really old melee carry, in which champions were basically just empty vessels to put items into, and watch as they scaled out of control. He has a hint of slayer-like defenses, but they're not implemented in a manner that allows for the greatest skill expression, and don't do a good job of protecting him. His Q in particular is so notoriously buggy and inconsistent that even dedicated Yi one-tricks struggle to dodge properly with it. On top of all this, most of his power is dependent upon on-demand steroids which all boost his autoattacks, which leads to him offering few to no options for his opponents to outplay his damage (especially since he gets enough movement speed to outrun most champions as well). Because of this, I think he'd need some of the following:\n\n* His steroids should be conditional and interactive, in exchange for giving him more catchup potential. There should be ways of outplaying Yi, and so there should also be ways for Yi to recover from behind.\n* His defenses need to be cleaned up and made crisper, so that they can legitimately protect Master Yi. Alpha Strike should work as a proper dodge, and Meditate should be valuable at higher levels for more than just the hidden auto reset. With this, he should be able to fight without having to either blow everyone up in a couple of seconds, or get blown up himself.\n* He should probably lose the slow immunity on his ult in exchange for some other defense. Slow immunity simply reduces what little counterplay exists against Yi, and it would help if he had access to other, more active (and hopefully interactive) means of avoiding getting stopped in his tracks.","replies":[{"poster":"SugeMinPikk","date":"2018-07-25T23:12:12.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Teridax68,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZdH5ruHE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-07-25T06:41:03.143+0000)\n>\n>  His Q in particular is so notoriously buggy and inconsistent that even dedicated Yi one-tricks struggle to dodge properly with it. \n\nIt's actually mostly fine.. \"I was in alpha\" clips are usually him dying to something that hit him during the cast time, or a DoT, or something that doesn't care about whether or not you're untargetable, like electrocute.
