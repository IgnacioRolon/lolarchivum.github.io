Early crits can be pretty strong but considering his kit, it's pretty much a requirement for him to be successful. He doesn't really have much going on for him outside of his early crits to make him useful, and attack speed isn't going to help him in the laning phase, where he just wants to get one big auto off and then back off. A Tryndamere isn't gonna run up to you and just keep auto attacking you early game. If you wanted him to have a better suited stat for him, lifesteal based on his fury would be better, but there are too many champions with some form of lifesteal in their passives that this would make Tryndamere even less unique.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VorpaltheFox","date":"2018-10-12T04:24:10.798+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"then he would be discount olaf","replies":[]},{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2018-10-12T01:22:23.909+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh i'd remove crit from the game entirely outside of similar mechanics to Stormrazor when you know when it will hit not have RNG like this in the game.\n\nChampion kits would have to be changed or items replaced to compensate.
