If it is, then yeah, that sounds reasonable.\nWhat really made me consider a visual update for Ashe is this fan art that I really love.\nhttps://www.artstation.com/artwork/JPYYz\n\nTo be honest, the thing I want more than visual changes are some new animations for Ashe, she just seems really stilted to me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rowanstar","date":"2019-04-09T21:36:49.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AlienMV,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=sMTNJiBq,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2019-04-05T19:47:50.510+0000)\n>\n> They did in fact, use to make purely visual updates. I don't exactly remember the reasoning they gave to why they swapped over to full VGUs since it was so long ago (prob back in like Season 4-5 when they stopped it). I don't think it was for monetary reasons as someone stated (although that's probably something Riot wouldn't admit to if that were the case). I am happy they are going back to it with the recent Ezreal and Morgana update though.\n> \n> \n> As for champions I do think need VUs. I do understand that some of the champions I list have had some visual work in the past, but with the way the lore has evolved since those times, I don't think their \"theme\" holds up as well as before.
