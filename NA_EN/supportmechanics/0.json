I sat in champ select wondering for a good few minutes what do I do next. The other players started exiting the lobby.\n\nSince it has happened to me before and I knew if I closed it I would be put on the dodge timer, so I waited a couple more minutes and I was taken back to the screen where you select your roles before queuing up for ranked. And what happens?, it tells me I'm on a DODGE TIMER.\n\nI DIDN'T EVEN DODGE. WHY AM I PUT ON A DODGE TIMER I DON'T UNDERSTAND?!\n\nI know it's just 5 minutes but this is the third time it has happened and none of those times it was my fault but someone else not picking their champ in time.\n\nI don't know if this is bug or something else, but please fix it.\n\nEdit; Just happened for the fourth time!!!!!!!! And now the dodge timer is 25 minutes. I have no idea why am I being punished when I didn't do ANYTHING!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-08T04:14:37.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If someone leaves the match lobby while you're picking champions, you won't ever actually see them leave the lobby.
