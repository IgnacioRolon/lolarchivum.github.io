Problem is, a lot of the time, lot of time, rules get violated in the process. We have seen a LOT of folks 'just defending themselves', as if that should be an excuse to be out of line. Under no circumstances is that true. When you are faced with a situation where you feel the urge to defend yourself, consider these things.\r\n\r\n* Is there reason to defend yourself that might contribute to the game?\r\n* Will anyone listen to what you say?\r\n* Are you in control of youself?\r\n\r\nValid reasons to defend youself includes promoting others confidence in you, acknowledging an error, promising you can use different tactics, or sharing your intent. Whatever your reason, it needs to apply to the game, purposed toward winning. Try to avoid nullifying statements, no matter how incorrect or offensive they are. You are nobody's instructor, disciplinarian, or entitled to 'put somone in their place'.\r\n\r\nConsider your team. Are they total tilts who are trashing on anything? Ignore them. Are they upset with you? Apologise. Are they just criticising? Acknowledge them and declare your intent. You are responding to people, consider what effects your chat has, and behave accordingly.\r\n\r\nThat's not something you should always do. If you can't think reasonably, just mute all. If you're red in the face, mute all. If you're too tired, just don't hit enter. If you can't think of how to handle your defense, let it go. But if you can see a reasonable person gaining from what you have to say, then you're good to go.\r\n\r\nRemember the rules of the rift. Defend youself with reason and self control, and you shall be better off for it. And remember, the only shame in muting is in your allies for losing the privilege of speaking to you.\r\n\r\nHave other good ways of defending youself or have stories where it worked out? Please share.","replies":[{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2020-02-29T01:12:34.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"what does defending yourself to strangers on a video game going to do ? \n\nlike really?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-02-29T01:25:17.163+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you actually read it, you'd see that I spoke of that already.","replies":[]}]}]}
