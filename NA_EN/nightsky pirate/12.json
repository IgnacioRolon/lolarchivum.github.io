At the end of the day Riot is not a babysitter, and players need to take responsibility for their actions rather than look for ways to abuse and harass others consequence free, which is what this idea sounds like it's for (yes I know you said ZTP stuff wouldn't be allowed but that's beside the point).

Winning is most intensely rewarding- in other words, the most intense moments that cause addiction- when having gotten angry in the match and the player's focus and problem solving contributed to victory. However, to get the fullest satisfaction from this, a person needs to get past the frustration and move on to the problem solving part. Sometimes, league is frustration. The build isn't working. The support is working against me. Their JG is oppressing me. My team isn't grouping for a teamfight. The chance to problem solve isn't being given, and the ability to use anger productively is being denied.

So the designer would have to come up with something to make his passive feels powerful and interactive. \n\nFrom an in-game design perspective, this problem space can be solved through the change of mechanics, change of visual effects, change of sound effects or a combination of everything. In this case, the designer opted to use the change of mechanics and a visual effect to tackle the problem space. Whether it hits the mark is another question.\n\nIn design, it's a good habit to constantly remind yourself of the problem space you are trying to solve. Having a clear problem statement or a well defined problem space will help keep you on track in designing good solutions. Keep in mind that the problem space you are trying to solve should align with entity's values, else you'll end up designing something that the entity feels is wrong and won't further explore your design.\n\nSo if I'm reading you correctly,  the problem space you are trying to solve is to ... reduce anger from the game? And your solution is to create an opt-in flame channel that allows people to flame without others seeing it?\n\nIn a sense, the game already has a similar feature. You can type something and press ESC to cancel what you typed, or you can use /n (aka /note) to type stuff that only you can see. It will even be saved into a txt file where you can open in notepad later.\n\nIf that's not the problem space you are trying to solve, or the current solution is not something you are satisfied with, then you'd have to redefine the problem space to further understand what you are trying to solve and why the current solution is not working.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-25T04:27:48.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Understood!\n\nSpecifically, the problem I'm pointing at: players do not have an in-game way to vent in a way that does not cause other problems.\n\nDue to the nature of the game, a player is required to be operating with nearly full attention on the game- incidentally, my example earlier demonstrates that outside factors often can cause stress because it is distracting.

If they have to vent through text then they can use Notepad or a Word document or something. There are plenty of options available to do so, but LoL isn't and shouldn't be one of them. Rather than trying to give these players an outlet to vent in the game (and thus be essentially immune to any major consequences) we should instead at the very least encourage them to vent elsewhere if need be.
