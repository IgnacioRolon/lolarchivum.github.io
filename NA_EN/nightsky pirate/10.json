Rather than bemoan the misfortune, I poke the Ashe with pressuring banter ~ \"Time to show off what a 1k advantage Ashe can do! Don't disappoint!\" I continue the pokes until she responds with apparent confusion when I indirectly reference Ashe's husband. Despite my performance turning out to be the weakest on the team in lane phase, I'm being positive in chat with thanks and encouragement. Both JG and mid come to my aid, unlike most games where I'm more silent. Really, despite the muddled invade, everyone else does pretty good and turns things around. \n\nWas that just my teammates being cool, or did I help them be cool? This isn't an isolated incident, but I don't see this behavior much. Are you helping?\n\n\n*bonus edit* Lux might be positive, but... _burn_...\n{{champion:236}} {{champion:99}} \"I'm sure your wife forgives you for getting her soul taken by a remorseless creature of darkness.\"","replies":[{"poster":"ClevelandfCj","date":"2019-11-05T18:13:39.135+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"No one likes fake positivity tbh.

Seems like someone who would do that, especially over the interent, doesn't have a lot to gain from it.\n\nI suppose that also means there is that fake negativity right?\n\nI don't know about you, but even if people are \"fake\" with their positivity, it's still refreshing from all the \"fake\" negativity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-11-05T21:30:42.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Such an assumption!
