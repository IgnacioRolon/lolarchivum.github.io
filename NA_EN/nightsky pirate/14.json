I am not a recipient of punishment, but am very dissatisfied with what the current system is built to do and the results on players. I understand it's intent and merits. I have a meddlesome self-taught level of programming, making and altering mods for RPG and strategy games like Fallout 4, Distant Worlds: Universe, Stellaris, and Pathfinder: Kingmaker (among others). I strive to understand players with compassion while keeping to the objective goal - forging a more healthy encouraged behavior.\n\n* Primary goal: Actively Encourage Reformation and Resistance to Toxicity\n* Secondary goal: Mitigate the Effect of Toxicity as it Happens\n* Tertiary goal: Develop Leaders and Examples of Good Behavior Among the Players\n\nFirst toward these ends is to impose immediate punishments in-game in such a manner that does not interfere with the game, starting with immediate 5-minute chat restriction. A player's mood can be measured by their actions- which I won't detail here- and a nullification of penalty for performing respectably to their own history will actively encourage tilt-free behavior. Inversely, succumbing to poor personal performance will have tiered 'punishments', starting with chat ban for the remainder of the game, increased placement point loss, and post-game delay to que for next game. I do not intend to stop player bans, but to mitigate the effect of consistently toxic players on the way to becoming banned. Additionally, a simple mandatory reformatory game, similar to a tutorial, will be forced on players displaying repeated toxicity. There they will see a replay of their own behavior showing exactly what the system detected, and then providing them an option to replay the scenarios, with tailored tips to help them understand how to correct themselves. The scenario will be unambiguous: \"This behavior will get you banned. Here's some general tips to help you.\" First reformatory game is free, but subsequently will also have increasing punishments similar to the current system, in which they must review their behavior again.\n\nThen, reformation island. Continue to be toxic and they'll have to play to earn honor with other toxic players until they've been given enough honor for good behavior. And not just carrying, just as easily detectable as bad performance, *but also stricter standards* that can also result in a permanent ban far more easily than normal. This is not prisoner's island, it's reformation island, and the game itself will whisper individual players periodic encouragement to do well based on what kind of behavior got them there. Permanent bans can still happen from outright unacceptable behavior, but the intent being that many come back from reformation island. You only go once- if the toxicity continues after reforming, permaban awaits.\n\nIt's also a toxic-grinder. I expect as many as half of those who get there will get chewed out and banned without subjecting honorable players to it. In other words, there is intent to avoid impunity while achieving the above goals.\n\nIf I'm allowed enough freedom, I'd also include so-called paragons of virtue to play with them. Friends of the toxic players, volunteers, and players given incentive who have high honor or have been honored out of reformation island. A simple banner for proven paragons who help those on reformation island- a true badge of honor that you can't just farm.\n\nI wish to seek this with a passion, and I'm afraid I don't know where to begin. I'm a humble coffee shop manager. I really want a replacement for the current punishment system, and don't want to see League reach the end of it's years with a player base encouraged to be silent and stoic. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-07T23:23:24.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if replying is the right way to ask this, should I post this on another part of the boards?
