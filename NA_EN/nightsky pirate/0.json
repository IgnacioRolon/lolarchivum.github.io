Examples for clarification would be welcome. **The why doesn't matter here, just the facts. The intent is not to open a discussion to opinions on what is good or bad, just the facts. Morality, good strategy and etiquette are irrelevant in this thread.** It's not meant as an exhaustive list of all things behavior, but if anyone wants to add to the list, feel free, so long as its with the intent to be sure that your facts are correct, and *not* to make a player's version of the code of conduct.\n\n1. Context does not matter at all when it comes to behavior.\n1. Regardless of the degree that a belligerent violates the rules, the player *must be reported* to be processed by the system. \n1. It subsequently does not matter to what degree a violation is, if enough reports of the violation occurs, the belligerent will be punished. Any degree of \"offensive, including language that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, or racially, ethically, or otherwise objectionable\" (aka negativity) is punishable.\n*edit: Enough _reported games_, as multiple reports in one game are equal to one report.\n6. The behavior program is actually two programs; a zero tolerance filter and a dictionary-based machine learning program.\n3. The dictionary-based machine learning program assigns positive and negative values to terms and phrases based on the arbitration of reports and honors. \n*edit: Not saying honors nullify reports or slow punishments, see responses.\n3. Repeated use of the same phrases and terms in subsequent reported games by an individual receive increasing negative values.\n3. Positive values, compiled in the same way based on honors, can nullify negative values to some extent.\n4. The same program also adds terms and phrases on the same arbitration, both positive and negative.\n5. The same program is incapable of understanding context.\n*edit: Incorrect- it does identify sarcastic comments to deaths. So far, no other examples of contextual understanding have been shared, so I'd restate it to \"The same program does not understand context outside of death times and chat timestamps.\"\n7. Zero tolerance words are strictly zero tolerance, regardless of language, region or even common use of the term: the program for zero tolerance words being a filter. \"MB for not knowing\" or \"It's just a 320 MB video\" is literally as bad as \"You n%%%%r c%%t\". I remind you that this is only fact seeking.\n*Edit: Region and language _probably_ matter. \"MB\" was a red herring, and even the Dutch Kiss ('kys') was overturned from a Zero Tolerance issue.\n8. When it comes to punishments, Riot Support is primarily there to assist players in understanding *why* they were punished. Riot Support will not help overturn the judgement of the program except in unusual circumstances outside the user's control, such as a hacked account.\n12. A player may select any champion in any role in any game mode.\n13. A player does not have conform to the meta with regard to build, strategy, spells, warding, etc.\n13. A player may not make *any* build and/or use *any* strategy- it must bear some semblance to playing to win and not take away from the game from others. Example: six Tear of the Goddess is not approved, nor is Counter-Counter Jungle Support Smite Nunu.\n15. A player does not have to communicate, except when using a strategy that will disrupt the team's strategy. Example: Singed going into enemy base during laning phase to take mid and top minion waves, resulting in many deaths but is ultimately an effective strategy in some situations.\n*Communicating intent does not override the previous fact.\n14. A player may not *deliberately* play against their team- *intentionally* feeding, avoiding team fights, not contributing to objectives, etc. A player technically does not have to cooperate with the team otherwise.\n17. No camps, minions, kills, towers, etc, belong to any role. \n*Edit: Not true! Leash belongs to jungle, CS belongs to ADC/Mid/Top, generally speaking. Purposefully stealing camps under the JG's nose or CS from laners is a no-no.\n18. Situation and context does not matter. Always play with respect to the rules.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2020-01-22T01:27:01.753+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 1) Context does not matter at all when it comes to behavior.\n\nCorrect. There's no situations in which breaking the rules is acceptable, and the context of a situation (whether it be other people misbehaving, a match being a downhill one, etc.) does not matter.\n\n> 2) Regardless of the degree that a belligerent violates the rules, the player _must be reported_ to be processed by the system.\n\nAlso correct. With the exception of disconnects/AFK's, a report _has_ to be filed in order for the IFS to review and punish their behavior. No report = no review = no punishment.\n\n> 3) It subsequently does not matter to what degree a violation is, if enough reports of the violation occurs, the belligerent will be punished. Any degree of \"offensive, including language that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, or racially, ethically, or otherwise objectionable\" (aka negativity) is punishable.\n\nThis needs a bit better clarification. Do you mean this being about number of reports in a given match, or that any form of infraction, including minor ones (like report rallying, \"gg ez\", etc.) can ultimately lead to a punishment when reported?\n\n> 4) The behavior program is actually two programs; a zero tolerance filter and a dictionary-based machine learning program.\n\nCorrect.\n\n> 5) The dictionary-based machine learning program assigns positive and negative values to terms and phrases based on the arbitration of reports and honors.\n\nIf by this, you mean \"does the IFS weigh number of Honors/Reports into its review\", then no. Otherwise, this question can't be reasonably answered, as it would require more insight into the system than is available to us.\n\n> 6) Repeated use of the same phrases and terms in subsequent reported games by an individual receive increasing negative values.\n\nAs with 5, this question can't reasonably answered. If I had to guess, the negative values of a given phrase would remain the same regardless of how many times it's used or reported for.\n\n> 7) Positive values, compiled in the same way based on honors, can nullify negative values to some extent.\n\nNo. Honors do not influence reviews in any way, shape, or form. A punishment can still be given for a match in which a player was honored.\n\n> 8) The same program also adds terms and phrases on the same arbitration, both positive and negative.\n\nLike with 5, I'm not sure exactly what you mean by \"arbitration\" here.\n\n> 9) The same program is incapable of understanding context.\n\nSince context doesn't matter; yes. The IFS reviews a player's behavior in a vacuum, so it neither sees nor needs context.\n\n> 10) Zero tolerance words are strictly zero tolerance, regardless of language, region or even common use of the term, due to the program for zero tolerance words being a filter. \"MB for not knowing\" or \"It's just a 320 MB video\" is literally as bad as \"You n%%%%r %%%%\". I remind you that this is only fact seeking.\n\nFrom what I know, there _might_ be regional differences in what's considered zero-tolerance, but in general, yes, zero tolerance chat is strictly zero tolerance.\n\nIf \"MB\" is considered zero-tolerance, though, I have to ask; what'd I miss?\n\n> 11) When it comes to punishments, Riot Support is primarily there to assist players in understanding why they were punished. Riot Support will not help overturn the judgement of the program except in unusual circumstances outside the user's control, such as a hacked account.\n\nYes. Players _can_ appeal punishments, but protocol is that if a punishment wasn't issued in error, then it will not be overturned.\n\n> 12) A player may select any champion in any role in any game mode.\n\nWith some exceptions. Unusual (but reasonable) picks (such as Taric or Leona toplane) don't really need to be cleared with teammates, but more wild off-meta stuff (or things that would directly impact another player's gameplay) need to be discussed with the team, and can be punishable if the team disagrees with the strategy.\n\nAdditionally, some Champion Select behaviors can be indicative of trolling, including some Champion/role combinations.\n\nReally, this can't directly be answered as a solid \"yes/no\". Gameplay misbehavior tends to be like that.\n\n> 13) A player does not have conform to the meta with regard to build, strategy, spells, warding, etc.\n\nAs above, this isn't something that can be directly answered \"yes\" or \"no\". In general, yes, players don't have to conform to the meta, but there will always be trolling behaviors and other quirks that tie into that samesuch behavior that it's not going to be a universally clear thing.\n\n> 14) A player may not make _any_ build and/or use _any_ strategy- it must bear some semblance to playing to win and not take away from the game from others. Example: six Tear of the Goddess is not approved, nor is Counter-Counter Jungle Support Smite Nunu.\n\nAs with the two above, there's no definite answer to this. Counter-Jungle Support Smite Nunu was a case of the player not discussing their strategy with their teammates or allowing their teammates a say in whether or not they play it. They were punished because they forced their teammates to adapt to their strategy with zero consideration or discussion.\n\nAnd, to even further muddy the water, do remember that Deathsiege Sion is considered valid and acceptable as a strategy (if it's even still applicable in 2020), and it is _very_ arguable that that strategy bears some semblance to playing to win.\n\nThough, six Tears is a clear-cut example of something not approved, and similar-such behaviors that serve to handicap the team are punishable.\n\n> 15) A player does not have to communicate, except when using a strategy that will disrupt the team's strategy. Example: Singed going into enemy base during laning phase to take mid and top minion waves, resulting in many deaths but is ultimately an effective strategy in some situations.\n*Communicating intent does not override the previous fact.\n\nCorrect. Unless you're doing something that will impact your other teammates (such as the Singed base-proxy described above), communication is not mandatory.\n\n> 16) A player may not _deliberately_ play against their team- intentionally feeding, avoiding team fights, not contributing to objectives, etc. A player technically does not have to cooperate with the team otherwise.\n\nCorrect.\n\n> 17) No camps, minions, kills, towers, etc, belong to any role.\n> *Unclear: Does this include a laner intentionally and without approval taking the red/blue buff in a leash?\n\nIntentionally stealing a buff during a leash is punishable if it can be proven as intentional.\n\nAs for the main point; **Yes** to all, and simultaneously **conditional no** to Jungle Camps and Minions.\n\nAs with the gameplay related misbehavior mentioned from 12-14, there are cases in which actively stealing lane minions and jungle camps is punishable; I.E, following the Jungler around and contesting their camps, Support actively CS'ing to steal from the bottom laner, or one lane moving into another's (particularly early on) and actively contesting lane minions.\n\n> 18) Situation and context does not matter. Always play with respect to the rules.\n\nThis is essentially a rehash of 1, but; yes. The situation doesn't matter and the context doesn't matter; if one breaks the rules, they are subject to punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-22T02:38:36.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for taking the time.\n\n3- Any form of infraction, like being reported for \"ggez\" in repeated games, but not multiple times in one game.\n\n5- Not what I meant- the IFS assigns weights to phrases and terms, both positive and negative, outside of any given review. It uses those assigned weights (as a dictionary-based program), both positive and negative, and determines the 'overall negativity' of the player's log under review.\nI caught onto this by reading quoted commentary by the designers of the program, unfortunately, I haven't been able to retrace my steps to where I read that information. It was published as commentary about online behavior conventions sometime in 2014. There were 3 separate articles in which I saw all the information about the inner workings of the program that I could find. Of course, such commentary can't be used as being definitive, and honestly, its probably better that the general knowledge of the IFS' inner workings remains in the dark, even from Riot Support.\n\n6, 7 and 8- are derivative from the same information. That information I saw did not suggest that honors counter or reduce the impact of reports directly, but affect the values given to positive terms and phrases. Which in turn would result a less severe negative score if the player in question were actually negative, leading to more required reported games for punishment of less severe infractions.\n\n10- Apparently, 'MB' is a Chinese term referring to a sort of boy-whore, or the behavior of such. Some recent thread, a guy claimed to get zero-tolerance slapped for it. A point that might matter, the OP is a self-claimed \"china-man\".\n\n12/13- It appears the answer you're suggesting is that by itself, no pick is punishable by itself, but paired with other infractions, helps to determine troll behavior.

Boards Wisdom (as well as some Riot comments) suggest that there are some infractions (such as \"GG EZ\") that aren't in and of themselves punishable, but can contribute to a punishment.\n\nWhether this means that, in pure isolation, such a minor infraction can ultimately be punished (assuming that's the only misbehavior the account has), or that there are infractions that do actually follow that \"valid but not punishable\" idea, I have no idea.\n\n> 5- Not what I meant- the IFS assigns weights to phrases and terms, both positive and negative, outside of any given review. It uses those assigned weights (as a dictionary-based program), both positive and negative, and determines the 'overall negativity' of the player's log under review.\n\nHm. I'm not sure if that would be the case, though really the only information I have to go off of is conjecture based off of what's known about the system. (Kei143's description of how the system likely works being pretty much as accurate as anything we've got.)\n\nIf I had to guess, the values are determined as based on context clues in the chat. So stuff that IDs as general, undirected (or impersonal) negativity is lower value when read than a direct insult or comments surrounding a player being addressed.\n\nThough, that supposition in and of itself is a little biased, as that's more-or-less how I peer review chat logs, so there's zero guarantee that the IFS functions that way.\n\nWith that being said, I'll have to say that between current understanding, lack of information, and the commentaries in question being 5-6~ years old, there might not be a reliable ability to answer questions 5-8. Interesting to think about, either way.\n\n> 10- Apparently, 'MB' is a Chinese term referring to a sort of boy-whore, or the behavior of such. Some recent thread, a guy claimed to get zero-tolerance slapped for it. A point that might matter, the OP is a self-claimed \"china-man\".\n\nHuh. I think I might've glossed over that thread. I'll look around for it again, though besides, I'm definitely curious if ZT is universal across regions or if there are regional differences.\n\n> 12/13- It appears the answer you're suggesting is that by itself, no pick is punishable by itself, but paired with other infractions, helps to determine troll behavior.

Lots of variables, but the general rule is anything goes as long as you play to win.\n\n> 14- So Nunu could have been good if he did #15, good to know (I thought that might have been the case). I was going to use the example of Deathsiege Sion as well, in #15, but it became mainstream enough that it didn't really need to be explained anymore.\n\nYup. Sadly, though, the lesson of point 15 is probably one that will have to be repeated a few times still, given that we've now three examples of players punished for failing to respect their teammates while pulling off-meta tactics. Counterjungle Support Singed, Counterjungle Support Nunu, and Teemo Mid-Support.\n\nHere's to hoping it doesn't need to be repeated this year, though.\n\n> 17- \"Support actively CS'ing to steal from the bottom laner\", is this really true? I thought the community consensus was that CS did not belong to the ADC, let alone anyone. Thought it was merely etiquette not to? Is there a case where someone got punished for CS-stealing?\n\nYeah. Community consensus might be \"CS belongs to nobody\", but in reality there is a point where that isn't actually valid. Outside of coordinated, off-meta shenanigans (bottom+support being on comms), the meta function of bottom lane (Bottom Laner farms minions and works towards items to make an impact, Support assists Bottom Laner through pressure, assisted CS'ing, etc.) is something of a real rule.\n\nI've seen cases (though finding them after so long will definitely be taxing) where players were punished for trolling, and it ultimately turned out that they were in the Support role and had been actively depriving their bottom laner of CS and \"stealing\" the carry role.\n\nThe biggest signs I'd seen in those few cases was a notable absence (or sometimes even a rare inclusion of) a Support item on anyone, ambiguous roles (often Mage Supports, for example), high CS counts, good KDAs (with the actual bottom laner having the opposite more often than not), and of course the kill map showing the players' activity on bottom lane.\n\nIt could of course be argued to fall under role theft as a form of trolling, but all the same, the point of the Support role is to be able to thrive without a reliable line of CS - hence their having gold income items - and so actively stealing CS from the bottom laner can constitute trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-23T01:52:06.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks again for your responses!

However, as Umbral mentioned, they are 5-6 years old now, and the program may have changed since then. Riot has not been sharing what they've done with the system very much in the years since. Further, it is only commentary by the original developers of the program, and might not be representative of what the program actually does. Still, when I do find it...\n\nMost of the others are based on my interpretation of the EULA, adjusted by the history of punishments and debates on the forums, and further tempered by public statements by Riot developers- NOT representatives- over the years. I've incorporated wisdom shared from countless articles with commentary by developers, from videos and documentaries on online behavior conventions, and research documents about online behavior including data and cooperation from League of Legends. I've rejected comments by representatives because they know about as much as you or I could- with the unfortunate reality that they could be told to tell the public anything and believe it. Riot Tantrum (a developer) has said the most about the behavior system and is probably the most reliable source on the boards. There's no need to link anything- it's all within your reach.\n\nI do not believe this makes my opinion special, but rather, because I have spent so much time studying this topic, I wanted to fact-check to make sure these assumptions were accurate. I have nothing to gain but to aid me in trying to help improve online behavior in the future- and I think others might benefit from these understandings as well- I do have specific individuals in mind who I hoped would show up if they had facts that contradicted anything. ~~cough rujitra~~\n\nDebates on the forums (aka Boards Wisdom) are generally a good source to understand the behavior rules.

It would show that the system can identify particularly spiteful sarcastic remarks thanks to reports and the heaps of existing data. It can only identify sarcasm based on what it has been shown. It does not understand that the user had a different intent from what was actually said. It doesn't understand what was said at all. It just knows \"you sure showed him\" is included in reports often enough- it appears one of the modules includes recognizing when something is said right after death, which gives some context and correlates to being negative. Incidentally, it probably gives \"It's okay\" a positive value.
