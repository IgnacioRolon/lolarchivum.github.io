Please understand and stop glorifying the sacrifices. Verbal abuse isn't the worst and it shouldn't be grounds for permanent bans. However, the focus is how to improve player behavior. Which is what this forum is all about, but posts like this are sparse. What is the best use of chat? Coordinating? Trash talking the enemy? Seeking tips and advice? Understanding your ally's strategy and items?\r\n\r\nWhat about trying to prevent or stopping tilt?\r\n\r\nThat last one is a doozy. Some have a gift for it- and I daresay, that gift might be more powerful than the support's R in some games. Yet, there's a problem, not all of us have the gift, but try to do that anyway. It just plain makes sense to do so. In the words of someone else, \"tilt-feeding is more powerful than carrying\". Unfortunately for most of us without the gift of ... nauseating kindness ... or without the patience to be so careful with words, our current system is as likely to get such efforts punished as it is to un-tilt someone. Makes sense- with the number of shamers out there, it's a good idea to just /mute all as soon as you make a mistake. We're primed to trigger on words, the expectation to get flamed for making the game harder to win.\r\n\r\nThis is bad.\r\n\r\nI leave you with a question, what encouragement can be made for those who don't have the forbearance of a saint but still want to help?","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-11-27T21:54:51.655+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I leave you with a question, what encouragement can be made for those who...still want to help?\n\nHere's a start.

The more you make remarks like \"needing the forbearance of a saint\" or \"nauseating kindness\", the less you incentivize actually communicating with people.\n\nAll of the examples you listed above as uses for chat are easy to do without issue;\n\n> Coordinating?\n\n\"Yi, you solo baron while we keep their attention mid\"\n\n\"I'm going to split-push, defend base, but don't chase them if they come for me\"\n\n\"We need to group\"\n\n> Trash talking the enemy?\n\n\"That flash\"\n\n\"9 HP left\"\n\n\"Man I'm popular\"\n\n> Seeking tips and advice?\n\n\"Are my runes decent?\"\n\n\"What items should I build?\"\n\n\"What mechanics should I focus on?\"\n\n> Understanding your ally's strategy and items?\n\n\"What's the Lethality for?\"\n\n\"AS on Garen?\"\n\n\"That's an odd rune choice, how's it work?\"\n\n> What about trying to prevent or stopping tilt?\n\n\"Just breathe, we got this\"\n\n\"We scale harder, we just need to play safer\"\n\n\"We can take them next fight\"\n\nIf you're somehow getting punished for trying to communicate in any of the ways you described, then you need to reevaluate _how_ you're communicating, because clearly, there's an issue on your side if that becomes the case.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-11-28T06:29:41.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for this reply. Talking normally by one's own standards can be viewed as rude by others. Perhaps the most common case, an individual has difficulty understanding that people don't like to hear what they have to say- looking at Paladins- or such as people with social disorders. I'd like to specifically regard these sorts henceforth. I suspect I'm an adjusted(ing?) paladin, myself. Apologies for making it sound extremely difficult. Sometimes, it is hard to find the right words, or to understand how the person is thinking/feeling/viewing the situation. Often times you can tell just by how the champion moves, but it would be better if they actually chatted.\n\n(discontent glare at witch-hunter white knights causing so many players to just be silent)\n\nMy intended focus was on \"What about trying to prevent or stopping tilt?\", as it deals with the emotions of another player *and is important to be effective*. Those are good staple examples you listed for it. I think it goes much deeper, however! Those minutes in the pregame lobby are often spent in silence or on nonsense, but are golden opportunities to establish some kind of connection.\n\n*pregame lobby*: \"Good evening!\" \"How are you guys?\" \"I'm feeling confident!\" \"I'm a bit weak at map awareness when the enemy is on screen with my champ, but...\" \"if you spam on me I'll snap out of my obsession, so please ping your heart out!\" \"How are you feeling about the matchup?\" \"Anything you'd like to see from me?\" \"I'll do my best!\"\n\nI think this helps others wake up from the droll silence and be more resistant to tilt. It can be hard when nobody responds, and especially when confronted with negativity, senseless ego-boasting, or put-downs. In my experience, this happens about as often as people respond *very* well to it. It seems to me that feeling someone is hopeful, open and positive playing alongside them gives them a bit of a boost themselves. Feelings aside for a moment, knowing another's agenda at least displays anticipatory competence when a strategy is effectively carried out. Then what about this...?\n\n*pregame lobby*: \"Anyone feeling tilted or upset?\"\n\n(anticipating gaze)\n\nI think these carry into the game to a smaller degree- there isn't time to carry on a discussion without voice. What do you think?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-11-27T22:46:52.467+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think you should stop glorifying the ability to control yourself as if its some grand amazing feat of strength. Youre building it up so much in your mind that it makes it seem like such a difficult task. I think its important to put things in context. \n\nYou are playing a video game for fun. The video game has rules. All you gotta do is figure out those rules, and dont break them. Before you type, think how it could be considered breaking the rules. If it seems like it could be considered breaking the rules, dont type/do it. \n\nYou dont need sainthood. You need a little bit of reason and a little bit of logic. You can think and say all the rule breaking shit you want. Riots rules arent about whats in your heart. They arent trying to mold you into a saint that only thinks positive thoughts and wants to help people. Theyre just trying to prevent toxicity IN CHAT, to clean their reputation of having such a toxic community that drives away potential players and causes some players to quit the game.\n\nIts not about morality. Try thinking of it in that context. Just dont put it in chat. You can go punch your mother, Riot wont give a shit. Their rules arent a moral code to live by. They apply only in the vacuum of the game itself, and become a part of the game. So if you play league, youre also playing the game of 'the chat has rules, dont break them'. Treat it like another part of the game. Or try at least. Thats all you can do.

I untilt by focusing on the game and typically muting the flamer is good enough for me. \n\nThis case happened when I was in bronze2. \n\nThere was this one Sion up against a Riven, getting dumpsters 0-3 in lane. I looked at the way he was playing, seeing that he was getting his Q interrupted all the time and running out of mana, clearly didn't know how to play against Riven. \n\nWhen he died the 4th time, I told him that Riven's main damage comes from her 3rd Q, so he needed to save his shield or release his Q/ult just for when Riven is in the air about to land the 3rd Q, that way he mitigates alot of the damage and can trade back when she has no mobility left. \n\nA few minutes later, I hear a Sion ult and swiftly followed by a shutdown announcement. Sion killed Riven under his tower and then said \"I can't believe that worked, thanks for the tip\". \n\nRiven kept on trying the same thing against Sion, but Sion adapted and kept reverse killing her. Sion was now untilted  and we proceeded to win the game.\n\nI give the tip once regardless if they want it or not. If they show hostility once, I back off and don't say anything more.
