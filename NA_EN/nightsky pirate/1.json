I appeal to the wiser! I appeal to YOU, dear Gameplay League players! WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE TAUNTING? These are some taunts that CHAMPIONS IN GAME say!**\r\n\r\n_\"Lowly blasphemer! You are in the presence of a god!\"\r\n\"Are you even trying?\"\r\n\"Amateur hour.\"\r\n\"Come back when you've collected all the bits of yourself!\"\r\n\"Only two jokers in a deck, and I got dealt you.\"\r\n\"Smile, child, or I'll shove your jaw into your brain.\"\r\n\"You are mediocrity. My genius will supplant you.\"_\r\n\r\n**I believe taunts SHOULD be personally directed, even if indirectly. It is, after all, \"a remark made in order to anger, wound, or provoke someone.\"**\r\n\r\n_\"I've seen Support Nunu do a better job in JG than your JG... Sorry (insert lane opponent), better JG wins!\r\n\"You do know Sion's passive, don't you? I mean, I'd assume in ranked, a player would know the champion they're playing, but you make me wonder.\"\r\n\"I'm embarrassed to be matched against you. I thought I was better than this... This is ranked, isn't it?\"_\r\n\r\n**...and maybe even harsher. These are probably too far.**\r\n\r\n_\"Are you guys a couple? Because I'm seeing an ADC with anemic girlfriend support.\"\r\n\"SCRUB- you thought you could flash into a 1v1 against a fed Morde?\"\r\n\"For a Vel'Koz, you're not very good at zoning... Actually, you seem a shame to Vel'Koz players... You should try Yasuo, he's more your style. Brash.\"_\r\n\r\n**SO, where is that line between good taunting and unsportsmanlike torment?

Did you really think reposting the same exact thing would get different results?\n\nNo, the 'taunts' you have suggested are still not acceptable.\nNo, Riot will not change their policies because you think you sound cool when you decide to belittle others with your half-baked roasts in a video game.\nNo, tilting someone in this manner is not a viable strategy to win/climb in league. You'll most likely just get muted or banned. Maybe just git gud instead?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-08-05T11:53:37.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I was hoping wording it differently would.

That's where the line is.\n\nThings I will routinely say include:\n\n* \"Nice gank\" or \"Thanks for the red\" to the enemy jungler after they failed a gank.\n* \"Great dive\" when they try to dive me and I get a kill.\n* \"Good TP\" if they TP bot and I take 4 plates Top while they just die on my bot lane.\n\nAnd I'm Honor 5, never got punished a single time, got all the Honor rewards, the special icons, everything. Behavior-wise, I'm probably in the top 10% of the community. Not bragging, just explaining that yeah, the above examples are perfectly acceptable by any measure.\n\nOn the other hand, all your examples attack the player directly and their general skills. (And what the heck is that line about an anemic girlfriend?!)\n\nActually, I use the \"we are matched together (so we must be the same level)\" line, but not as a taunt, instead as a put-down when someone is being arrogant and condescending. Basically, no, that's not acceptable small talk, but if someone is being an ass, they deserve it.\n\nEDIT: that's basically what The Djinn told you in your previous thread, though https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/7KoXFpbk-legitimate-taunting?comment=0002\nAnd I can't help but notice you argued with all the others but didn't reply to him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nm1010","date":"2019-08-05T12:27:58.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imagine living a life where posting this thread, twice, is the best thing you have to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-08-05T12:35:57.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"There's the kind of taunting I wanted to see.
