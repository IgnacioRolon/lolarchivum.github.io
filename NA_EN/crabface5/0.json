I think that EU will have a definite strength at MSI due to recent EU victory at S5 Worlds, sending 2 teams to the semifinals\r\n3rd: Yoe Flash Wolves - TBH, haven&#039;t seen any IWCI games at all, but I have distinct memories of YFW dominating the group stage in S5, would not be surprised\r\n4th: CLG - Good team, but I think NA is still lagging a bit, although NA has shown improvement this year, including homegrown talent. Maybe TSM won&#039;t actually go to worlds this year\r\n\r\n5th: Royal Never Give Up - Recent Chinese showings at IEM&#039;s and S5 worlds don&#039;t give me much faith in them. The Korean Exodus definitely changed China for the worse, especially in homegrown talent (Although I think their matches will be close no matter what, as the entire group seemed cohesive and well composed in the LPL finals). Might get 4th but betting on 5th\r\n6th: SuperMassive: I really wish I knew more about the IWCI and their teams, and what their strengths are, but its just hard for me to even place them 5th. Yes, they have some of the best Turkish players, Yes, they will fight to the bitter end (IWCI group stage tiebreakers?), but keep in mind, they start off against SKT! It&#039;s definitely going to have a mental impact, and the following teams are still difficult to play against. I do, however, have hope that they will have at least 2 surprise wins though. 1 vs SKT, on their second matchup, and 1 vs CLG, because NA throws. \r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"tplegs0708","date":"2016-04-29T09:13:22.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LCS - i think G2 is per player more mechanically gifted then CLG but both teams are a new sparkle to their respective region as they played well this split, \n\nSKT will unless they play/perform poorly will more then likely win this year,\n\nLMS flash wolves are LMS 2nd best team... AHQ is beyond WAY better then FW however AHQ played bad against FW and FW won fair and square and earned their trip... just noting that AHQ is/will be the better LMS team for worlds.\n\nLPL is very far from both ends... not close to good but decent team fighting skills to hold them middle of the pack, not impressed yet not disappointed either, meh.\n\nIWC - from what i hear/see this superMasive team has very strong and aggressive early games that look to snowball their mid and late games which they are very clean with WHEN AHEAD.  They struggle a bit when behind and i'll be looking for other regions top teams to once put them behind dont let up and finish it out.\n\n**PREDICTIONS**\n\n1 SKT\n2 G2\n3 FW\n4 CLG\n5 IWC\n6 RNG\n\n\n{{champion:17}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-04-29T05:20:30.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like a decent list. Would say that Royal is capable of doing well but they didn't do well at IEM so there isn't a real reason to believe they will here. A lot of people are placing them higher but I think your assessment is fair.\n\nAlso worth noting that it doesn't look like there is gonna be an overall 3rd / 4th match according to the schedule so I guess 3/4 are also interchangeable.\n\nRight now I would say that my outlook goes like this\n\nS tier:\nSKT\n\nA tier:\nG2\nFW\n\nB tier:\nRNG\nCLG\n\nthen not sure where to put the wildcard because we don't see the other regions match up vs the big ones often enough.\n\nThere has been a patch cycle since the teams last played though so it will be on who can adjust to this patch the best.","replies":[{"poster":"B00B00","date":"2016-04-29T07:19:40.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think CLG are better than G2, G2 have glaring weaknesses and while are certainly a great team i don't think they pose much of a threat internationally, i would actually think CLG would do better, we will see!","replies":[]}]}]}
