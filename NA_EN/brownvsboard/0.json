Everything else is subjective...\n\nIt needs to be connected to society. Assuming toxicity is defined objectively as anything that drives away players, then Riot needs to find what drives away players. I highly doubt retaliation does.\n\nWhat drives away players in that scenario would be profanity and racial slurs and whatnot. Although I would still personally disagree with it, it would be tolerable.\n\nBut I don't think people are driven away by retaliation. Everyone retaliates, because everyone gets angry. Riot employees, you, everyone on Boards, and everyone in game. Stats are needed, but stats cannot be obtained.\n\nPeople can retaliate differently, but they will retaliate. Riot placing a block on retaliation and asking people to just mute and play the game is a bad practice that only builds up negativity, which needs to be vented. \n\nIf you see toxicity in the game, whether it be with words, inting, or trolling, are you going to absolutely stay quiet, and say or do nothing in response other than mute, report, and move on? I highly doubt that even you could do that every game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HeyBigGuyHeyBudd","date":"2017-12-20T06:48:32.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=VulDread,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=9LTAIRcL,comment-id=000100000001000000000001,timestamp=2017-12-19T01:32:12.151+0000)\n>\n> First, get rid of 0 tolerance policy.
