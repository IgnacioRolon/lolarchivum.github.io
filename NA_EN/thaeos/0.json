I get that they said it was event related, but I believe a lot of people would love for it to be permanent, a lot of people disagreed with emoticons but they still went through and added them which is their choice to do so, but consider adding back the star guardian mastery and making it permanent, either with star guardian skins or emotes? Also maybe consider adding project mastery, I'm sure this would make a lot of people happy!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-12T01:41:35.276+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure that one was event only, but with the latest launch of the new emote system we could get any of those old emotes back at any time!","replies":[]}]}
