If you buy Merc Treads or Banshee's Veil, you completely shut down Veigar's ability to combo you. Making his stun less reliable and nerfing his damage isn't the correct way. I mean, have you even played Veigar recently? He can't keep up with the League of Mobility, and instead of giving him some sort of movement boost, you kick away his crutch and push him into a wheelchair. It's not cool Rito, don't mess with the disabled.\r\n\r\nI swear, people QQ about Veigar for all the wrong reasons. It's like they have the ability to build some MR, but would rather just build AP and cry when Veigar's ult destroys them. I once fought a Kat and I felt sorry for her because I destroyed her every time she got back into lane. When the game was over, I was telling her that she should have bought MR, but she thought I was so far ahead of her that building more AP was the answer and MR was useless? It boggled my mind, like when LeBlanc use to run rampant before she got maliced, if you didn't build some sort of MR against her, you'd get blown up. Why can't people just do that for Veigar? Or just play Zed and rolfstomp him early.","replies":[]}
