Now we'll try to patch it up to the latest version.\" and after that the Play button is greyed and I can't click on it.\r\n\r\nIts literally every week and the only solution I've found so far is reinstalling the game, which is for me hours and hours of downloading. I know this topic is here already a few times, but nobody cares, even when this continues for months. I have tried everything people suggested in previous discussions, nothing helped.\r\n\r\nIt's not the first time I have problems with this type of bugs, I already stopped playing League for half a year, when similar thing happened to me back in season 4. I'm really tired of finding solution, please if someone know how to help, feel free to write it down. Thanks.\r\n\r\nAlso, excuse my english.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-17T18:05:12.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering all things in this detailed issue, it sounds like your League directory might not be deleting after uninstalling, so corrupted files are persisting each time you install.  My suggestion here would be to download the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and use it to perform a clean reinstall.  This will remove and fix-up any persisting, bad files and get you set for future patches.","replies":[]}]}
