It only shows the regular teemo splashart. I&#039;m not sure if this is the same with the other chroma skins for cottontail teemo or any other of the newly released chroma skins.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-09-07T22:24:12.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue was only with this chroma pack - the assets weren't implemented properly.
