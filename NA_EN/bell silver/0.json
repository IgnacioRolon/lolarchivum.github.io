So now I have Top AD, Top AP, Top AD Tank, Top AP Tank, JG AD, JG AP, JG AD Tank, JG AP Tank, Mid AD, Mid AP,  ADC Crit, ADC AS(Attack Speed) , ADC Caster, Supp, Supp Caster, Supp Burst. \r\n\r\nIdk if Mid should have something like what I have for Top? And i&#039;m not sure if ADC Crit and ADC AS, ADC Caster would be right for ADC mastery pages. Along with the Supp caster and burst\r\n\r\nCan someone help me with this? Should I add something else to mid, and what do I need to change for ADC and Supp since my top is the only one I feel like those 4 pages are right but not sure about the rest.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-03-29T23:14:24.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I only have 7 mastery pages. One for each combination of 18/12 (and a 6/6/18 for specific tank junglers).\n\nI just choose the appropriate page then just switch a couple masteries around.
