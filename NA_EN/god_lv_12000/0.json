The update screen then pops up and absolutely nothing happens? Can anyone tell us what is going on? Plz don't say it's a connection issue because that is absolutely not the case at all. My internet connection is perfectly fine and everything else is working just fine. Is this going to be fixed anytime soon or what's the deal here? I'm trying to play this is getting extremely frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Furious Shuvo","date":"2017-02-24T06:35:12.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem from yesterday and i try to uninstall and reinstall but now its not installing and stuck in riot client patcher and my download speed seems ok from other side except lol...\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-24T05:27:27.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked and wasn't able to find any service issues that would be causing this to happen from our end. I understand you don't believe this can be caused by a poor connection, however, it's important to note that each service/game you access online, hosts servers in different geolocations. This means you could experience issues to one site, while not having issues to another. I recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure there isn't a bad configuration on your network that is causing an unstable link to our patching servers.\n\nLet me know if this resolved your issues.","replies":[]}]}
