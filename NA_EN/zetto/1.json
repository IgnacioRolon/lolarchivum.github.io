For the most part, if a solo lane DCs, I&#039;m usually gonna spend my time clearing camps close to that lane and just straight up playing in that lane. Sucks that you don&#039;t have a jungler, but deal.  If the support/adc DCs, expect me to spend my time around there, farming my camps and looking for opportunities to gank mid/bot. Play safe, ward, and don&#039;t overextend.\n\nSecond of all, if I have to spend the majority of my time camping a lane that has DCd, and you lose lane, you do not, in fact, get to cry and bitch about how I haven&#039;t come to save your ass. You knew that my presence was gonna be slim to none, and you shouldn&#039;t expect me to be able to help recover your lost lane. If I have to choose between letting zed freefarm mid and going top to try and help you cause you&#039;re 0/3 due to your lack of an ability to ward, I&#039;m gonna sit my ass in mid and try and keep zed under control.\n\nI understand that not every single laner out there needs to be told something along these lines, but jesus Christ some of them do.\n\nAlso, thank god riot has finally started working on a way to remake games with a DC.","replies":[{"poster":"Daedric Etwahl","date":"2016-05-04T17:28:00.319+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"This reminds me of one game I played, last guy to call in champ select was given adc, but he proclaimed \"I DON'T WANT ADC\" and instalocked {{champion:157}}  after everyone else locked in.\n\nThen he went top alongside {{champion:86}}  without a word, leaving me as support {{champion:37}}  vs {{champion:202}} {{champion:53}}  in bot.\n\nThankfully our jungler {{champion:11}}  was a pretty swell guy and promised to gank my lane and get us some kills, and told me to play safe.

Now, I'm not saying this is the correct way to go about it. If the jungler is there, they are weaker than you. However, the reason they usually just trade farm is because a jungler's presence is extremely variable, and chunking a jungler at the cost of your own HP usually isn't worth it. The jungler can still farm the jungle perfectly fine, but if you're at an HP disadvantage for free in lane you can get bullied hard.\n\nAnd on the same token junglers often overestimate their own power against the laners in a 1v1. In nearly every situation a laner will run from a jungler. So the jungler isn't used to taking heat as well as giving it and they are often taken off guard at how much damage minions do combined with a higher level champion.\n\nIt's a give-and-take situation that can't be grouped into one situation as \"this is the go-to response no matter what.\" Each situation is different and should be treated as such.\n\nTL;DR I said literally nothing but each situation is different.

It is actually junglers like Evelynn, Skarner, Noctourne, Rek'sai, to a lesser extent Rengar (and Akali even though for some reason people put her in lane) who can't lane well because most of their benefit comes from the fact that they are in the jungle (whether it be surprise factor, or that there are things in the jungle that they utilize)...\n\nSejuani is actually a pretty solid toplane bully that can harrass a Renekton in the early game.
