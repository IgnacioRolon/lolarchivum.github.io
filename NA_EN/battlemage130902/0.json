Now, in these situations I HAVE CHECKED and my internet is working perfectly fine and peachy, yet the game simply does not connect. I've tried closing the game and reconnecting from the client, I've tried waiting for the \"Attempting to Reconnect\" in the {{champion:67}}  hope that it will actually do something, I've tried closing the client and opening it again, I've tried restarting my computer, I've tried resetting my router, and I've even gone as far as to run outside and reset the modem. I've checked around and it seems like I'm not the only one suffering from this, yet in no post do I see an official Rioter response or any attempt to resolve the issue. Honestly, it appears that they've given the players suffering from this issue the classic not us tech support response:\r\n\r\n1: Have you tried restarting the game? \"Yes.\"\r\n2: Have you tried restarting your computer? \"Yes.\"\r\n3: Have you tried restarting your router? \"Yes.\"\r\n4: Have you tried re-installing the game? \"Yes.\"\r\n5: Is your computer up to date and does it have the right hardware? \"Yes.\"\r\n6: Can you send us your game logs? \"Sure, here they are.\"\r\n7: Hmmm it looks like the game can't connect to PvP.net. \"Yes obviously.\"\r\n8: Take it up with your internet provider. \"What was i expecting.\" {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \r\n\r\nExcluding this issue, Riot Support has been EXCELLENT regarding fixing technical issues and I don't know whats going on but it seems like they've turned a blind eye here for some reason or another. For me, the issue comes every once in a while so it's not a daily problem but in those times where it occurs IN THE MIDDLE OF MY PROMOS it really really sucks. So please, Riot Support, {{champion:64}} to us suffering peoples and find a fix for this problem :c","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-21T09:44:23.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Here you go.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj\n\n\nIf you continue to experience connectivity issues;\n\n[Utilise Riot’s Log Reader to see what’s happening with your network.]( https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader)","replies":[{"poster":"BattleMage130902","date":"2016-07-21T15:23:36.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the classic not our fault response I was talking about...","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-21T18:48:45.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it may not seem like it, there are some very crucial steps in the connection guide that are necessary in order to troubleshoot the issue you're seeing. When the client is not able to connect to the game server, it's usually caused by either an unstable or a poor connection to the server. A poor connection can prevent you from connecting to the game server or crash your client entirely. There are a number of factors that could cause connection issues, however, the most common are addressed in the Connection Guide. \n\nShould you still have issues after taking the steps in the guide, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"BattleMage130902","date":"2016-07-21T20:38:31.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The connection guide has a number of steps, which I can go through here briefly:\n\nCheck the Server Status: In all of the instances where this has happened to me, the servers were up and running fine\nSwitch to a Wired Connection: I'm always on a wired connection\nFirewall Troubleshooting: My firewall has been turned off during games where this has occurred in an attempt to play league without the risk of these issues\nConfigure Your DNS: I did this the first time i had the problem, and have kept it this way since, but it has no effect\nPacket Loss: I have no packet loss issues after running the test.\nPacket Buffering: All applications that could cause packet buffering are closed, in fact ALL applications are closed entirely. \nPort Forwarding: Followed the instructions, and all the ports are forwarded\nUpdating OS: My Mac is updated to the most recent OS (El Capitan)\nAdministrator Settings: I am the Admin, and have full privileges\nVPN and Proxy Use: I am not using a VPN or a proxy \n\nEverything is compliant with the standards stated in the connection troubleshooting page, and its not simply me but THOUSANDS of players with this problem. I think that if this many players have the same issue despite most of them probably having followed these instructions then its time to consider that perhaps its not a problem with the user but with the server. In some instances I can see everything around me going on but I cant move myself and after a while of that the game disconnects entirely, which sounds... iffy if its an all-round internet problem. Just pointing out quickly, even if you have Packet Loss and Packet Buffering, the page points to other applications and your network provider as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-22T15:19:59.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you've taken the time to ensure your connection is aligned with the guide, it sounds like your connection issue is more advanced than what we normally see.

I have checked my side nummerous times and I always find that I have perfect connection to everything else on the net, except the LoL server.\n\nThe pattern is obvious too, I never have issues with the client, or with the game itself once it is loaded, but I repeatedly run into issues with the Load Screen.
