After waiting I would end up restarting my computer and when I would come back into the client, there would be an update to the client which wasn't there a few hours prior when I logged on. The several times that I have DC'd like this, there was an update to the client and I just feel that it is extremely unfair to kick me out of games, especially ranked ones, when there is an update available.\r\n\r\nI haven't heard of this happening to anyone else but it has caused me to lose several important matches for me. And there is really nothing I can do on my end about fixing the problem because I do not control when the updates come out.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T03:55:49.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A legitimate update will not continuously out of a match to download.
