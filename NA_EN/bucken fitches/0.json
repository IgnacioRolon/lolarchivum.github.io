Not to mention, the choice of words the other players were using were so much worse than my own. Context: a player on my team said in /all that I told him to get a brain tumor. I did not. I would never. I never have. I said a few cuss words not mentioning any brain tumors or anything else bad. I said some bad words. If a player is going to try to get me reported by saying that I told him to get a brain tumor then yes I will react and tell him to f off. I cant believe this. Note: Zilean was the one who started it but Lux jumped in and was saying that I said it as well.\r\n\r\nRiot you lost a customer and a player, I have been harassed before by so many players in games who have said things that are unrepeatable, but with your old system they never faced consequences, but if a player now says sh*t and f*ck a few times because they are in a ridiculous situation, they get 10 games.\r\nAnd it was only one game that they showed chats for... 1 bad game and I get muted 10 games.\r\nRiot F*ck you.\r\n\r\n\r\n10 Chat Restrictions\r\n\r\nSydint,\r\n\r\nYou have received restrictions following an audit of your recent in-game behavior.\r\n\r\nIn your recent games, you used in-game chat to create a poor experience for others. As a result, your account has received a number of restrictions. If your behavior does not improve, you will continue to receive more severe punishments eventually leading to a permanent ban.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that there&rsquo;s no excuse to be rude or hurtful to others.

That comment, like the words used in it, is s\\*\\*\\*. Period. Like many of your other comments. Whether you're willing to realize that or not is none of Riot's concern. Whether you continue to pollute chat is. The player lied about you in response. Whatever. He might get banned too. But regardless of what HE said, you earned your tribunal stripes, and I'm not going to waste time here explaining why what he says doesn't matter, like I've done in the past. I'm just going to copy/paste my \"banning principles as they are, should be, and will continue to be\" synopsis from another thread. You can figure out for yourself which details apply to you. I'll give you a guess, it's somewhere in the middle.\n\nThings that aren't bannable:\n\n* **Ignoring role calls**: The meta is not law. It's just preferable.\n* **Double top**: He wants to go top. You want to go top. So do it. You think split exp sucks? Yes, it does. That's strategy. You end up taking another role to save split exp? Fine, you made your best judgment. He made his WHATEVER judgement. No emotions to it. It's rando queue. You get random results. Duh.\n* **Strategic choices you don't agree with**: Welcome to the world of people that aren't you. It's out there. It's not that hard to find, it includes EVERYONE. Well, except you of course. \n* **\"Auto-locking\" (Why is this still a term)**: It doesn't matter whether you take 1 second to lock, or 10 seconds to lock. It takes the exact same sequence of actions, and therefore is the exact same thing. Whether you feel like passing your champ choice by your team or not is up to you. It's your pick, your choice. If Rito wants to get around to having democratic votes on these things, I'm sure they'll add that feature some day. I wouldn't hold your breath though.\n* **Proxy farming**: Someone thinks the wave clear and gold farming will outweigh the disadvantages of repeated deaths as singed? Maybe they're wrong, maybe they're right. Maybe they're stupid. Maybe it doesn't matter because it's their call, not yours. Stop acting shocked at rando tactics. Stop comparing proxy farmers to people who repeatedly walk into the enemy team, stand still, and wait to die while spamming \"end the game please\".\n\nThings that ARE bannable:\n\n* **Immediately harassing someone for ignoring role calls**: Your allies don't even have to HAVE roles! IT AINT LAW! They can go soraka and jungle/roam/farm botlane for all anyone cares. You think those tactics are unbearable? (I mean, they really do suck...) Then why are you still queueing in randoms? Go get a ranked team together.\n* **Continuing to harass players for not following nonexistent rules after game starts.**\n* **Continuing to harass players for harassing you back:** \"He started it\" is something most people grow out of in kindergarden (or so I've been told, but the internet leaves me doubting.)\n* **Using the word \"report\" and THEN harassing players**: NOOOO, that doesn't give an \"official air\" to follow-up \"troll\" insults, and therefore it does NOT nullify the toxicity of said \"troll\" comments.\n* **Basically... harrassing ANYONE EVER**: Yes, you thought it was just people you sort of liked. Or people that were nice. But no, you are legitimately not suppose to harass people IN GENERAL. \n\nExtremely obvious things that every League player should understand by default, but many refuse to:\n\n* **You prefer predictable champ-select outcomes that are agreeable to you?** Get a team together of peeps with predictable champ-select behaviors that are agreeable to you.\n* **You have emotions?** Great. Use them on something other than people not doing exactly what you want them to do in a videogame. You were already ticked before your allies started replying with things you found offensive. If they started first, fine, report them and ignore them.\n* **Does the negativity bother you?** Well... now you know how you come off to other people.\n* **Does anyone expect you to turn off your emotions?** No, they expect you to use the mute button. Hold tab, mouse over, click, done. If you're genuinely pissed at people's chat, you get rid of it. No one fans a flame with a diesel-soaked towel while crying \"WHAT ELSE AM I SUPPOSE TO DO, IT BURNS!\" expecting people to understand what on earth is being said. You responding to offensive chat with offensive chat, that's flame-fanning. It's also flaming.

So yes 10 games is a big deal to me.\n\nOkay, first off, if you want to have a reasonable discussion then you need to stop with the name-calling and insults towards those who disagree with you. Second off, we understand that it's a big deal to you, but ultimately it was your poor in-game behavior that got you that punishment in the first place. Again though it's not the end of the world. If you have to scream then scream at the monitor and not at your teammates/enemies. Just work off the chat restriction in a positive manner and I'm sure that you won't get punished for that again. Remember that this is only your first warning, and the majority of people only need one warning/punishment in order to change their behavior for the better. If they can do it then I'm sure that you can do it too.\n\nEDIT: Yes, Riot has been known to escalate cases to higher punishment tiers if they feel it's extreme enough.  You should consider yourself lucky and fortunate that they only gave you a warning right here and work hard to prove that they weren't wrong in doing so there.","replies":[{"poster":"BUCKEN FITCHES","date":"2015-10-31T22:49:32.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have never received a punishment so when i read this a few hours ago I was pissed.

If you don't like that then either don't respond to them, or at the very least don't respond in a way that makes come off as an uncaring jerk with a \"my way or the highway\"/\"I'm right and everyone else is wrong\" type of attitude, or just don't post a thread, it's that simple. Also, like it or not this was your first warning, so there's no point trying to argue about it. If you're really gonna get so bent out of shape because you're mad that Riot caught and punished you for being a jerk that you're gonna leave the game over it and result to harassing and insulting those who are trying to have a reasonable discussion with you then so be it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2015-10-31T22:53:41.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sydint,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=FEFq9xat,comment-id=000c00000000000000010001,timestamp=2015-10-31T22:49:32.058+0000)\n>\n> I have never received a punishment so when i read this a few hours ago I was pissed.

But like I said before, millions of people play this game. What the minimum action required to change someones behavior is simply not a viable concern. It has to work for most people.\n\nMaybe a warning would have stopped you, maybe not. But if 1000 people get 10 game chat restrictions and 5 of them would have changed after only a warning but the other 995 would have ignored it, is it worth giving those 995 that extra chance? Especially when we are talking about a very minor punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"BUCKEN FITCHES","date":"2015-10-31T22:45:37.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll respect that.

Having never received a ban from Riot myself, I cannot say whether or not they provide links in some way or another to additional flagged behavior in the games PLURAL that they refer to. Generally, I've seen ban reports that include multiple games, but I've been told Riot generally displays with their ban alert the \"last straw\" match only. Can't say where you can find the other matches if they exist.\n\nAlthough, I bet you, given your response just now to SmokedAlmonds, and some of your other statements in this thread, that whether you think so or not, this match is likely not the only one for which you were reported and then flagged after audit. There are far less toxic ways of saying \"you completely ignored what I just said\" to SmokedAlmonds. For example, \"you completely ignored what I just said\". Preeetty simple.\n\nI guess there's also your \"no warning\" beef. I get \"you've been reported\" warnings all the time in the League client. Nothing ever comes of them. They're all probably crap \"why didn't you gank top more?\" reports. If you didn't get those alerts at least, that's surprising.\n\nEDIT: Also, if you're looking for BAN as opposed to REPORT warnings (i.e. \"We audited. Our assessment: If you keep this up, we're gonna can your ass.   >:P  \". I need an Officer Vi emoticon.) I'm not so sure Riot can always wait through a warning before a ban. It's probably in their best interest to nip any possibility of near-future, extreme chat-toxicity in the bud. \n\nMaybe you don't think what you said was that alarming, but believe it or not, plotting these chat histories on a spectrum aint an exact science, and when you have to be conservative, a comment that MAY be calling a person garbage (i.e. \"ur s\\*\\*\\*\") has to be put pretty far over on the danger side (along with sexual slurs). Whether you were just referring to skill levels, or showing your disapproval of lies, nobody cares. Riot cares about what you said literally, what it COULD mean in the worst case to some people, what it's intended meaning MIGHT be in the worst case, and what all that, in the worst case, MIGHT entail in the near future.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2015-10-31T21:08:05.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They face consequences, you just can't see them.\n\nAnd really, you deserved it, this is pretty rough stuff, but if it's only a 10 game chat restriction, it's not that bad.
