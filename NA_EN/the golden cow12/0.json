I was using zoom hack at the time, the only thing I was using. I got a two week ban, after the ban I removed the zoom hack. Why would I not? It was very obvious that it could be detected and there was no reason to use it again seeing as it would be a free permaban. I removed it, continued to play League for about a month until im kicked from the client and slapped with a permaban. \r\n\r\nI asked Riot why I banned through a support ticket, they told me I was banned for zoom hacking again. I found this complete bullcrap because not once have I used zoom hack after the initial ban. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH YOUR HACK/SCRIPTING DETECTION RIOT, TAKE NOTICE! There are only two other things I use alongside League of Legends, BaronReplays an WTFast. \r\nSo i'm sitting here, unable to play League, for no reason. I cleaned up my act, learned zoomhacking was unfair, and I learned to play without it. How am I responded to? A free permaban, thanks Riot.","replies":[]}
