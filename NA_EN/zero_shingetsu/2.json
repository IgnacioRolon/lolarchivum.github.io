It's so simple. Well I mean it's simple in theory.\r\n\r\nEvery computer that downloads League must download a software key with it. That key allows only one account to access League. Multiple accounts in the house? You'll either have to share or use different PCs. This is the price of billing yourself as a serious competitive game in which every player in the ranked system could theoretically rise to the ranks of a pro.\r\n\r\nIf someone cracks the key for multiple accounts, lifetime ban and a report to their country's authorities for technically hacking a company's (Riot's) security software. If someone wants to buy multiple PCs to get past the key restriction, well, they _really_ want to smurf and they've literally spent money to do it, so they're probably not quite sane. At least the vast majority will think twice before having to shell out actual money.\r\n\r\nIt's not fooproof, but nothing is. There isn't a 100% flawless way to prevent anyone from doing anything, but this would be more effective than just shrugging and letting people make however many accounts they want.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-09-18T17:02:08.628+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"But, riot never said they were against smurfing?

So with your 10 iq idea, if a family has more than 1 person who is playing league, they need to get more computers. Also if i'm at my friend's place and want to play league, i can't play on my own account, so more account sharing\nAlso many people use internet cafes, with your idea, they can't play league at internet cafes anymore. Same with multiple events that have computers you can play on, can't do that anymore either\n\nAnd what would you idea fix? Poor people can't smurf anymore. But rich people? Absolutely","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-09-18T17:26:14.218+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congratulations, you have invented DRM!
