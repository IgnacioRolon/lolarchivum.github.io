When your attack hits an enemy, it applies a corrosive chemical that deals your base AD as physical damage over 2.5 seconds. Sustaining the spraying animation stacks the damage and duration each second, up to a maximum of 400% damage over 10 seconds. Continuing to sustain the animation beyond this will refresh the effect at its maximum values every second.\n\n**[Q: Glassblossom]** (Mana: 45/50/55/60/65) (Cooldown: 10s)\nGrow a glassy northern flower at a targeted location that lasts for up to 60 seconds. When an enemy champion or jungle monster steps on it, they begin to bleed for AP-based damage over 5 seconds. Bleeding champions leave a trail of blood when they walk. You can auto-attack your blossoms to extend their duration by 1 second per mister tick, but can only plant up to 6 at a time regardless.\n\n**[W: Ionian Guilebloom]** (Mana: 60/70/80/90/100) (Cooldown: 10s)\nGrow a beautiful flower at a targeted location that, after 0.75 seconds, expels a sweet aroma in a moderate radius. Any champion, ally or enemy, in the area of effect becomes disarmed for 1.5/2/2.5/3/3.5 seconds.\n\n_Also works on jungle monsters._\n\n**[E: Serylda's Horn]** (Mana: 80) (Cooldown: 20s/19s/18s/17s/16s)\nGrow a thick, woody vine at a targeted location that springs up, grabbing any champion or jungle monster standing on its tiny area of effect. The vines stun the affected champion for up to 6 seconds, growing up the champion's body as they do so. The vines have a health bar which begins at 100/200/300/400/500 (+50% of AP) and increases by half the base value each second. Half of all incoming damage is transferred to the vines, and if they break, the effect ends early. Your own basic attack does no damage, but instead heals your vines for the amount of damage you would otherwise deal.\n\n_Allies can target and attack affected champions. 100% of this damage will be taken by the vines._\n\n**[R: Cross-Breeding]** (Mana: None) (Cooldown: None)\nBy spending a Wild Seed, which occasionally spawn in bushes near you and can be collected for later use, you can combine any two abilities to create a new ability. You can hold up to 1/3/5 Wild Seeds at once. The mana cost and effects of each ability created through Cross-Breeding are affected by the level of Cross-Breeding itself.\n\n* **[Q+W: Siren's Mirror]** (Mana: 80/100/120) (Cooldown: 10s for both)\nGrow a pinkish, reflective flower at a targeted location that lasts for up to 60 seconds. When stepped on, the flower emits a maddening aroma. The affected champion will run to and auto-attack their nearest ally for 3/4/5 seconds, however far away that champion may be. The champion is chosen when the effect triggers, and doesn't change when relative distances shuffle.\n\n_Siren's Mirror has the same mister interaction and planting limit as Glassblossom._\n\n* **[Q+E: Avarosa's Bow]** (Mana: 135) (Cooldown: 20s for both)\nGrow a hearty vine-plant with jagged, glass-like thorns that spreads across a targeted line over 2.5 seconds and lasts for 3 more. Enemies who walk across the vines are tangled and immobilized for the rest of the plant's duration, taking magic damage each second based on AP. You can mist the vines to extend their duration by 1 second per mister tick, up to a maximum of 6 seconds after full growth.\n\n* **[W+E: Zaun Viperleaf]** (Mana: 80/110/150) (Cooldown: 15s for both)\nGrow a glowing green plant at a targeted location that persists for 5/7/10 seconds. Enemy champions or jungle monsters who pass near will cause vines to grow across the ground and seek them out, following their path, which persist as long as the flower does. Enemies who walk across these vines are slowed by 70% for 1 second and take damage based on your AP. As long as they continue to stand on a vine, these effects will refresh each second.\n\nIf a vine reaches its target, it stings the prey. The vine will stop chasing that target, but the sting applies a poison that deals 50/100/150 (+15% of AP) magic damage per second over 6 seconds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CytheGuy","date":"2018-04-28T21:47:49.232+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The first thing that pops into my mind when I read this is a wise, black grandma.\n\"Mmm child, mama will take care of *you*.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Zepper","date":"2018-04-29T01:21:36.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"MILF SPRAYS UNDERAGED CHILD IN THEIR OWN HOUSE","replies":[{"poster":"CytheGuy","date":"2018-04-29T02:26:43.670+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah there buddy","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2018-04-28T17:00:33.990+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old lady champion...

Instead, you have a selection of items you can buy for 100 gold that take up your trinket slot. When used on an enemy champion, these items provide a unique debuff for 1 minute. Planting an item on a champion with an active plant will overwrite the debuff with the new one.\n\n* **Faulty Power Converter:** (2 + Level)% of the target's bonus AD is converted to bonus AP, and vice versa.\n* **Rusting Agent:** The target's bonus Armor and Magic Resist decrease by 5 every 10 seconds.

The second fires it into another piece of terrain, a champion, or the ground, with a moderate maximum range (about the width of a lane). Once both are cast, the rope persists for 3 seconds, stunning enemies who walk over it for 0.5 seconds. Enemies may only be stunned by this once every 3 seconds.\n\nIf a champion is hit by one of the harpoons, they take physical damage and are anchored to the other harpoon for the duration, unable to move away from it beyond the maximum length of the rope. The rope will move with them, and enemies touching it are still stunned for 0.5 seconds. If two enemy champions are hit, they are unable to move away from eachother beyond the maximum length of the rope.\n\n**[E: Ripcord]** (Energy: 25) (Cooldown: 12s/11s/10s/9s/8s)\nYou fire your harpoon as a narrow skillshot, with an attached chain behind it. If the harpoon collides with terrain, you are pulled to that terrain and launched forward a short distance, allowing you to clear walls. If the harpoon collides with an enemy champion, they take physical damage. For the next 2 seconds, you can either recast E to pull yourself to them, or cast Q to pull them to you. Either way, the target is stunned for 0.25 seconds on arrival.\n\n**[W: Flash Bang]** (Energy: 20) (Cooldown: 5s)\nYou throw a flashbang as a targeted area cast. Within a small radius around the point if impact, enemies are blinded and have their vision distance reduced to a small radius around them for 3 seconds. Within a larger circle outside the point of impact, enemies are blinded for 1.5 seconds.\n\n**[R: Armorbane]** (Energy: 20) (Cooldown: 1s)\nA targeted attack with a very short range that fires an imbued harpoon, dealing half of your AD as physical damage and half as true damage.","replies":[{"poster":"FloRaider42","date":"2018-04-28T18:38:10.255+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:sg-lux}} \nNice work, but I hope you don't mind some nitpicks:\n\n---\n\nI feel like Energy is too closely tied to Ionias Ki user. For a hextech user Mana (ammunition) makes more sense IMHO\nI also don't feel like giving him Energy is relevant gameplaywise as he isn't cycling through combos like the others and doesn't regain energy in any way.\n\nPassive: Losing the trinket slot seems annoying, since you lose wards or sweeper that are quite important for gameplay. Most of these options are just plain boring, as they require little gameplay and only affect stats, and have no counterplay (and thus are unfun for the enemy)\n100 gold for a 1 minute debuff also seems really cheap to be honest.\n\nQ: Love the ability since it just fits (smuggler fighting diry and utilizing the harpoon). The anchor mechanic is way too powerfull, unless counterplay is introduced (rope has health/reaching maximum length tears the rope, but deals high damage). Minor complaint is that it isn't a Q ability, which usually have low CD and are more damage oriented.\n\nW: Now that is a Q ability (5 sec CD). A 1.5-3 second blind every 5 seconds would probably make this Teemo level of annoying for AA champions.\n\nE: The visuals seem very similair to Q, which feels a bit lacking. Tying Q and E together would eat a lot of power budget, but makes more sense (in that case you would ALT Q/E to chain yourself to the harpoon). I imagine an assassin/smuggler as athletic, but not exactly beefy, so pulling enemies sounds wrong. I feel like having a reactivation in both instances would make it more consistent.\n\nR: Honestly that doesn't sound like an Ultimate and more like a basic ability.\n\n---\n\n**I hope I don't seem ungrateful.

Probably in Targon shouting at the Aspects and getting smote in 30 seconds.\n\nIf we're going to do the idealized version of myself.\n\nSERVE\n\nDemacia.  I'm a medieval historian.  I like medieval stuff.  Plus Demacia has the whole small but most elite army thing going, and isn't dependent on magic to do things.  Sounds good to me.  Could do without the xenophobia though.  And the decor could get monotonous. White is a pretty boring color for every damn building.\n\nCONNECTIONS\n\nThis is kind of tough.  I like the concept of Demacia plenty, but have no actual attachment to any Demacian champion.  Jarvan is pretty boring for a leader.  Garen/Lux have their own thing going on.  \n\nI'd probably just respect Garen without getting too wrapped up in his personal affairs.\n\nI'd never really understand his like of Taric, who I'd see as a waste of talent and opportunity who should have been punished more severly for his gross incompetence.\n\nAnd I'd probably respect the hell out of Darius and Swain.

So, there are multiple ways I could go with this.  Technically the weapons I am actually trained in using are pistols, rifles, knives, longsword, and rapier and buckler.  The first two don't fit Demacia.  The last one wouldn't fit my body type in a game (besides it's easily my worst).  That leaves longsword.  However, LoL already has a lot of guys with big swords.  None of them actually use them well, but they have them.\n\nSo, again going for idealized version of myself.  I have always loved the medieval pollax.  It can stab, it can cut, it can hack, it can bludgeon.  Ahh, so much fun.  The few times I got to handle one felt great, too.  So that's my primary idea.  Being my favorite weapon and all.\n\nThe other idea is to go back to my own life.  I started poor and worked my way up to comfortably upper middle class.  If I wanted to go that route with my character's story arc, I'd have him start as a pikeman.  It'd be interesting to see how Riot would handle the concept of a pike in the game.

Actually, two of our abilities are fairly similar (Q and W).  While I personally think Energy is a far more interesting resource than mana, which is just a boring limitation on how long you can stay in lane.  I think Energy has been relegated to the characters influenced by Asiatic martial arts, the ninjas, and warrior monks and the like.  I picture the pikeman as being a very down to earth style champion.  And I went with a pure cooldown system for my go.\n\nI would say the pushing aspect of the Q and E is a bit too similar.  Though the rest of it seems interesting.  Though I think the Ultimate could use work.  As far as I can tell, it just means now the champion can attack really fast, but can't do any of the things that made the champion interesting originally. \n\nHere's what I had.  I should point out my version of the character was named Wat (after Wat Tyler).  So I'm not going to bother rewriting things replacing the name Wat with \"the champion.\"\n\nStats\nReach: 300\nAttack Speed: Ridiculously slow\nHealth/Damage/Armor/MR: Middle of the road tank.\n\nPassive: Combined Arms: If an enemy is damaged by Wat 4 times within 15 seconds that opponent is Marked.  All allies near Wat that damage an enemy also proc Combined Arms once. So, if 4 allies each damage an opponent once then that opponent is Marked.  However, if Wat damages an enemy once, then one ally damages that enemy 3 times that enemy is not Marked.  Marked enemies have lowered Armor and Magic Resistance.\n\nQ: Set Spear: Can’t attack during the duration. The spear is a long line in front of Wat. Standing in the “pole” deals damage, standing at the point deals more damage and slows and grounds Marked opponents but ends the Mark.  Once damaged by Set Spear the opponent cannot be damaged or slowed/grounded by it for .5 seconds.  Lasts for 2 seconds.  Cooldown 10/9/8/7/6\n\nW: Hold the Line: Wat’s speed is slowed, but gains Armor/MR.  For the first .5 seconds of Hold the Line Wat cannot be displaced.  If a displacement attempt is negated by Hold the Line in this first .5 seconds the immunity to displacements lasts for the remainder of the duration and the Armor/MR gained is increased.  Lasts for 6 seconds.  Forced March cancels Hold the Line. Cooldown: 16/14/12/10/8\n\nE: Forced March: Wat gains a small movement speed bonus so long as he is moving toward enemy units.  If Wat uses Set Spear simultaneously to using Forced March his damage is increased.  In addition, Marked opponents hit with the tip of Set Spear become attached and move along with Wat, this ends the Mark.  Hold the Line cancels Forced March.  Lasts for 3 seconds.  Cooldown: 13/12/11/10/9\n\nR: Pike Line: Wat calls for the rest of his regiment, which stand at his sides.  His regiment will use the same abilities as Wat.  In addition, when using Set Spear the entire length of the attack slows and grounds marked enemies.  If any of Wat’s regiment are killed the formation shrinks accordingly.  Wat and the rest of his regiment cannot change the direction they are facing.  Each of Wat’s regiment has roughly 1/3 the health, and half the Armor/MR of Wat.  Lasts for 10 seconds.  Cooldown: 130/110/90","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2018-04-29T02:38:29.464+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, okay! I like these thoughts.

On second cast, strike a target location within a short radius, dealing your half your basic attack damage plus a bonus based on AP as physical damage to enemies at the point of impact. This also applies a stack of Searing. Enemies take 2% more magic damage from your abilities per stack of Searing.\n\n_Searing stacks disappear after 8 seconds, but the duration refreshes each time Searing is applied. Searing stacks up to 5 times._\n\n**[W: Brushfire]** (Energy: 55) (Cooldown: 16s)\nStrike a location with your whip-blade, using the spark to ignite a different effect based on the terrain struck. Any enemies at the point of impact are dealt magic damage in addition to terrain effects.\n* **Lane:** No effect unless the attack hits an enemy, in which case the enemy is blinded for 0.5/1/1.5/2/2.5 seconds as dust is kicked into their face.\n* **Base:** Create a crack in the ground at the point of impact, causing enemies who step on it to trip and fall stunned for 0.25 seconds. If you strike cracked earth with Hot Lash, heated rock will rise from the location and fall after 0.25 seconds, pelting enemies in a moderate radius with heated stones for additional magic damage over 3 seconds and applying Searing stacks each second.\n* **Jungle:** Sparks a fire at the point of impact, dealing magic damage each second to enemies who stand on it. The fire burns for 3 seconds.\n* **River:** Creates fog cover twice the radius of the area of impact for 5 seconds. The fog blocks line of sight, and restricts the line of sight to champions within to their very immediate vicinity. Champions within the fog don't share line of sight with allies.\n* **Bush:** Sparks a fire at the point of impact that rapidly spreads across the entire bush, burning for 5 seconds. Enemies who stand in the bush take magic damage each second.\n\n_Striking Brushfire on a bush that Ivern has connected to another will spread across Ivern's bush to the next. Ivern's bushes count as a continuous stretch of bush for this ability._\n\n**[E: Noxian Lash] (Energy: 40) (Cooldown: 22s/20s/18s/16s/14s)\nOn first cast, throw a skillshot with a short reach and a moderate width that collides with the first enemy unit hit, rooting them for 1 second. Recast within that time to move that target to the location of your choosing within a radius determined by the maximum range of the skillshot, dealing magic damage on impact.\n\n**[R: Whirling Flame] (Energy: 25 per second) (Cooldown: 160s/140s/120s)\nSpin your flame imbued whip-blade around you, generating a flaming tornado in a small radius around you after 1.25 seconds. Until you recast or run out of energy, the tornado will persist, lowering your movement speed to 60/70/80% and draining energy each second. Nearby enemies within a moderate radius are pulled towards you at a speed of 650 (running away thus slows the rate of suction). Any enemy who touches you is lifted into the air and buffeted around you, becoming untargetable, but taking magic damage each second for the duration.\n\n_Effects that remove slows entirely, such as Cleanse or Master Yi's ultimate, negate the suction entirely.

Tied to a big name religion pretty strongly (NOT the Glorious Evolution. Accented scientists who like to remove limbs and \"remove human weaknesses\" are always evil. Hollywood has told me so), as my father is one of the, uh, priests of said religion (even if, right now, he's a teacher and not a preacher). \n\nLike Ezreal, I can be smart, but haven't always lived up to it. I've enjoyed learning about my Scottish ancestors, so give me a kilt and accent to match. Sticking to the Highland theme, maybe a claymore and a targe, with a dirk as a backup/alternate. I do not shout \"There can be only one\" while beheading people though. That's a different franchise.\n\nSo, belief in a religion (associated with mages, typically), weapons (warrior), and nomad (often a thief, or at least rumored to be) all add up to what, exactly? A Paladin? A Barbarian Paladin (because the Romans thought the Picts were Barbarians)? \n\nFriendly with? Uh, the not evil champions? He started off as a nomad, so he isn't apart of the Everyone Hates Noxus Club (though he might smite some Noxians if he gets the chance, especially the Undead Juggernaut). Bilgewater is a wretched hive of scum and villainy, Zaun full of evil scientists, Piltover has plenty of corruption, and I'm unsure of the other regions. Oh, wait, the Void... yeah, that's undeniably alien and needs to be destroyed.\n\nHe'd probably like Demacia though. He finds himself agreeing with a lot of their ideas and principles, but maybe not their execution (as something might well exist on paper that doesn't exist in practice). He certainly would not care for their treatment of mages, as magic is likely considered a gift from whatever god this fellow follows in this particular universe.\n\nTLDR: A male, sword and shield wielding, tartan wearing wandering barbarian Paladin who serves his god faithfully and is an ally to good and a nightmare to you (err... well, evil, I guess) who has no particular quarrel with any of the nation/city-states on the continent, and seeks to root out evil and behead it. Any Void creatures he comes across also get beheaded. \n\nGot anything for that?","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2018-04-28T21:39:38.439+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll be ambiguous on religion as the religions of League aren't my forte, but I do like the paladin angle, so that's what I'm... well, angling for.

You gain +10% Tenacity at 75% Health, +20% Tenacity at 50% Health, and +40% Tenacity at 25% Health. Your maximum total Tenacity from Bloody Conviction is limited to 80%.\n\n**[Q: Dirk and Targe / Claymore]** (Mana: None) (Cooldown: 6s)\nSwitch between a dirk and targe or a claymore, altering both your basic attacks and your other three abilities. \n* **Dirk and Targe:** Your attack speed is increased by 15/20/25/30/35%, and you take 10/15/20/25/30% reduced damage from ranged basic attacks.\n* **Claymore:** Your basic attacks cleave your target's defenses, reducing Armor by 3 per swing. Stacks up to 3/4/5/6/7 times.\n\n**[DIRK AND TARGE W: Cloaked Strike]** (Mana: 40/45/50/55/60) (Cooldown: 14/13/12/11/10s)\nCharge forward along the path of a skillshot, shield raised. While charging, reduce all incoming damage from the front by 30/40/50/60/70%. If you collide with an enemy champion or jungle monster, you stop immediately and stab them for a moderate amount of true damage.\n\n_Cloaked Strike's damage reduction replaces the passive ranged attack reduction from Dirk and Targe while in effect._\n\n**[DIRK AND TARGE E: Warrior's Retort]** (Mana: 70/75/80/85/90) (Cooldown: 15s)\nBecome immobile, raising your shield for up to 3 seconds. You become immune to displacement and ranged basic attacks from the front during this time, and take 50% reduced damage from melee attacks. If hit with a melee attack, immediately stop channeling and unleash a counter thrust that stuns the target for 1 second and bleeds them for magic damage over 4 seconds, scaling with AD.\n\nIf not hit with a melee attack, release a wave of energy that heals nearby allies at the end of the channel, scaling with your bonus Health. You also heal for half the amount.\n\n**[DIRK AND TARGE R: Interpose]** (Mana: 90) (Cooldown: 180s/140s/90s)\nTarget an ally within a large radius and sprint to them with +20% movement speed, ignoring collision. Upon arrival, unleash a shout that stuns enemies within a moderate radius for 1.5 seconds and heals your targeted ally for a large amount based on your bonus health. For the next 5 seconds, so long as you remain close to your ally, all single-target damage directed at them instead goes to you, using your resistances.\n\n----\n\n**[CLAYMORE W: Mighty Cleave]** (Mana: 30/35/40/45/50) (Cooldown: 14s/13s/12s/11s/10s)\nSwing your sword in a short 180 degree arc in front of you, dealing physical damage to all enemies in the radius while knocking them back a short distance. Triggers on-hit effects on all enemies.\n\n**[CLAYMORE E: Pommel Strike]** (Mana: 45/55/65/75/85) (Cooldown: 15s)\nYour next basic attack deals bonus damage based on your AD and stuns the target for 2.5 seconds.\n\n**[CLAYMORE R: Behead Evil]** (Mana: 150) (Cooldown: 250s/230s/210s)\nTarget an enemy within a moderate radius and call them out, channeling. After 2 seconds, charge across any distance to that enemy and swing your sword, dealing 250% of your basic attack damage plus another 100/150/200 physical damage for each takedown that enemy has gained since the last time Behead Evil was used on them.\n\n_Assists are divided by 5 for this calculation._","replies":[{"poster":"revliledpembroke","date":"2018-04-28T22:48:29.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice.
