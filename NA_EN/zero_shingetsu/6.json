Is it the right call?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"Is it always a bad thing during laning? I know mid does it a lot and no one cares, but I&#039;m sure that comes from it happening at the pro level or something. There seems to be a consensus that whatever happens there is supposed to happen, and whatever happens in normal play isn&#039;t, so if I had to guess...\r\n\r\nAnyway, a scenario from my last game: I&#039;m playing Taric with Teleport and Exhaust. Don&#039;t ask why, it&#039;s a long explanation that makes me seem like more of a hardcore gamer than I really am. The point is that I was running Teleport, not Flash.\r\n\r\nAt about the 12 minute mark, our jungler got caught around dragon and we went to back him up. As I went to go back to bot after the skirmish, I noticed a teleport going in from the other side right near our low Ekko. So being nearby, I ran to assist. Things happened, Ekko survived and had to back. I checked bot. Not a soul present, so I figured I&#039;d hold mid for Ekko until he got back.\r\n\r\nSix seconds later, a fight breaks out 2v2 top, and Kat goes to engage. I ping my team away but they&#039;re ignoring it, so I follow to back them up. Eventually one fight ends but rolls right into another, and then that fight rolls into another. Now I&#039;m up there with Shen trying to keep Yasuo and Katarina off of him long enough for me to go back to bot and him to go back period, because he&#039;s quite low at this point.\r\n\r\n&quot;taric&quot;, Shen says between dodges. What does he want? Impossible to tell from that, so I start looking for pings. Maybe he wants me to go on one of the two opponents tightening the noose on him. At this point Shen decides to take the time to stop under tower and nearly get caught by Yasuo&#039;s Q to say &quot;retard taric&quot;, and later &quot;go bot&quot;.\r\n\r\nAha. So he&#039;s... pissed that I&#039;m trying to help him survive what would otherwise be a 2v1, and that every time I&#039;ve ducked into the bush to leave, either he&#039;s nearly been killed or I&#039;ve been followed and chased out. He continues every chance he gets. &quot;taric. noob to bot&quot;\r\n\r\nNow Ekko chimes in, slinging mud at me and asking why I&#039;m not bot. Of course I can&#039;t explain at this point because we&#039;re skirmishing constantly. But rest assured, the _second_ Kat goes back to her own lane, I get into the bush, teleport bot, and keep Lucian from dying to a Cait Q. All is well.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s a long setup, but all that to say, the situation made me wonder. Was I really in the wrong? Is it ever okay for a support to leave their lane? Effective teamplay in any game is about strategy, and the man who literally wrote the book on strategy is Sun Tzu. He states that no plan is absolute, and that the ability to adapt to any situation, often in orthodox ways, is the key to gaining victory. But what do you think? Maybe I&#039;m a League illiterate.\r\n\r\nI could have run away and left Shen to die. He probably would&#039;ve cursed me for it, too. And for good reason if you ask me. Their Mastery 7 Yasuo was already 2/0 with an edge on CS, and he&#039;d have another kill or assist with the better part of a minute to free farm. We won the game, by the way, and I wound up with a 6:1 assist-to-death ratio. So I don&#039;t think that one play hurt my capacity to support all that much in the long run.","replies":[{"poster":"TequilaZombie","date":"2016-07-12T20:22:47.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"First: I wanna know the reason for Ex+TP.

There are a lot of features in foreign games that Japanese gamers find to be too easy, and won't use because they think it will make them worse players in the long run. Flash is one of those, because you start to feel like you can make stupid decisions as long as you have a flash to get you out of trouble. Or like you don't have to fight too hard when you engage because you can always Flash-Ignite. (Ignite is another by the way.)\n\nSo I have a choice. As a support, I basically have two valid options for replacing it: Teleport or Heal. Since Heal's effect is reduced each time it's used within a short span, I've found Teleport is more useful, as it allows me to do things like this: Help out lanes that are struggling, then quickly port back to bot.

Generally supports take Flash instead of TP (because _everyone_ uses Flash on NA...) and I'm not sure how that makes my lane stronger, unless I'm playing someone like Rammus where I can flash to get a taunt that secures a kill. If it's a matter of helping me not die, I'd honestly rather keep my mind trained to not overextend, rather than subconsciously getting myself thinking it's okay to do so because I can just Flash out.\n\nAnd I understand the lack of pressure for sure. Trust me, I don't just decide on a whim \"oh, our lane is pushed, let's TP top and see what I can do\" lol. I take teleport specifically to allow me to roam mid if bot is strong and mid is struggling, and then TP back as soon as the momentum starts to shift. (At least as far as laning phase goes.) In this case, ending up top was purely a matter of shifting circumstances and adaptation, and no one was in bot until the last minute or so of my roaming period. We never really lost ground; in fact, I'm pretty sure our bot never lost a tower all game.\n\n> If you want to help your team (you are focusing on this too much); the best thing to do is dominate your opposing matchup then extending your lead to help your team that way.\n> \n> Here&#x27;s where you should start until you get better at understanding the game.

At this point in the game I reference, my Lucian was something like 4/1 with about a 30 CS advantage.
