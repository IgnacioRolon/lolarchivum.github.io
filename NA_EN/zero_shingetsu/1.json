Absolutely, a hextech heart would gave you physical capabilities beyond others your age. If you're 60 with an ageless heart, you're gonna be able to exert yourself way harder and way longer than other 60 year-olds. But that's not what the tidbit referred to. Personally, I think it would've been more interesting to see a woman who visibly looks later on in her years doing incredible things, because it drives home not only the sharpness of her mind, but the _power_ of hextech augments.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-09-29T17:12:14.013+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">It refers specifically to her youthful looks in the loading screen tidbit.\n\nYes... and?

It is magic, I don't see a reason why having literally a magical stone transplanted in the core of your body shouldn't be able to let someone retain their youthful looks.\n\nIn theory, no reason at all. But there's a difference between magic and believable magic. Good lore has a structure with rules that are uniform, which often plays off of real science. This allows the viewer to \"believe\" what they're seeing or reading more easily. On the matter of outward aging, usually the explanation as to why magic prevents this is that the magic in question is somehow tied to \"life\". Elves, for example, tend to be written as being a part of the very essence of their world. They often have strong ties to the forest because of their metaphysical link to the same energies that cause the woodlands to thrive. This would explain why they age so slowly. Lifeforce itself flows through them, continually counteracting the aging effects that normally plague humans. Without this believable anchor in the lore, a power, species... Any concept loses its plausibility and the lore suffers.\n\nIf Kubo just told you Shinigami can fly, sure, whatever. But it doesn't really fit the rest of their lore. It feels forced. However, when he actively explains it by saying reiatsu is everywhere, and Shinigami can concentrate it under their feet to \"walk\" through the air, that makes sense with established lore. It's grounded. It fits. And Bleach isn't even the best-written series I can think of when it comes to lore.\n\nSay in another example... Iron Man has a heart of metal. An ARC reactor sits in his chest, \"powering\" his heart as well as his suit. This reactor is pure science fiction. It's a supers series, so why not just say that it gives him the ability to fly? Well, they could. The Marvel universe does basically say science and magic are the same thing. But they instead forced him to use jet propulsion, because it makes more sense and is more believable. This is good writing; it grounds Iron Man's powers in something of substance that we can easily bend our minds to believe. It still doesn't make much sense that he could fly with jets from his hands and feet, let alone withstand the g-forces of such a flight. There are still things that are handwaved, but there's enough grounding in logic that it's believable.\n\nNow let's look at Camille's heart. Let's assume it's pumping magic into her bloodstream or something, since it is a heart after all. Could I believe it gives her super strength? Sure. Heightened reflexes? Absolutely. The magic is coursing through her body. It can do all sorts of things. But it would be more \"believable\" if there were still logical limitations. Why does magic coursing through one's veins outright counteract the aging process? On her organs, I could see that, since the bloodstream interacts with organs directly. If her heart is magical, her blood is magical, and that means her organs are also imbued with magic to some extent.\n\nBut the aging of the organs and the aging of the exterior are entirely different matters. Organs age because of wear and tear. Being used for many years, being exposed to various chemicals and substances through food, air, and such. While some of these things can indeed cause the skin to age more quickly, the primary \"sag\" of the skin we see in the elderly is a result of years of gravity pulling on the skin. Even old folks in the best of shape still start to sag. Likewise, wrinkling in the face is caused primarily by the furrowing of the brow, the angling of the corners of the mouth, the squinting of the eyes... None of this would logically be counteracted by magic in one's bloodstream.\n\nThe body also begins to compress over time as a result of gravity and constant movement. Even if Camille is walking on hextech stilts, her spine still compresses a tiny bit every time her weight drops onto one of them. Gravity is still pulling her body downward and encouraging her shoulders to fall, her neck to drift forward, her spine to hunch. Additionally, her jawline is still going to recede over time a bit. Those bones that aren't replaced with metal are going to wear down, unless you believe that blood flows into the bones as well.\n\nLong story short, there is nothing in Camille's state that suggests she should be liberated from the outward effects of aging. Indeed, she would probably be a more impactful character if she could do the amazing things she does while carrying the outward appearance of an older woman. If there _were_ such a thing, we would have to imply that no one frequently exposed to hextech ages. Piltovans should never die if this is the case, hextech power is all around them.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-09-29T20:14:58.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fun fact: Blood, in fact, **does** flow through your bones. Bones need to get nutritioned for growth and repairing.\n\nAnd I am honestly kinda surprised by your lack of imagination. You said it already yourself, there are some kinds of magic which can explain these phenomenons, like elves which have a magical flow of life force and therefore don't age so fast. Camille's heart has a hextech crystal, which is (in her case at least I guess) the soul gem of a brackern, Skarner's kin.\n\nIt would not really surprise me if the Brackern are outliving humans by ages. And this could _maybe_ be, because they have a magical source of life force. Which is now given to Camille, thanks to the transplantation.\n\nAnd no, this does not necessarily mean that everyone in Piltover doesn't age. Camille has a hextech heart directly implemented in her. That does not really apply to all the other Pilties we have as champions. Caitlyn, Jayce, Ekko, Vi... they are all using hextech devices outside of their own body. \n\n_______________\n\nThe only argument you have here in my opinion is that Riot is not really communicating with us _how exactly_ the heart is stopping her aging. But you can explain it by thinking about it yourself, it is not something as impossible as you make it out to be here.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2019-09-29T21:23:47.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chembaron Yamada,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=YfepnJJE,comment-id=0002000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-09-29T20:14:58.194+0000)\n>\n> Fun fact: Blood, in fact, **does** flow through your bones.

This is why the vast majority of science fiction that deals with humans living primarily in zero gravity lay it out so that characters appear youthful for a longer span. Obviously your organs still age, so I don't think it'll extend your lifespan any to live in zero gravity, but if you were floating in space from age 20 to age 80, you'd likely have only wrinkling (caused by movements of your face over time) to contend with from an appearance standpoint. Your posture would suffer minimal wear, your body wouldn't compress and \"shrink\", and your skin wouldn't sag because there's no gravity to do all this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Emperor Talquin","date":"2019-09-29T15:14:12.034+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is league of legends not the real world.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2019-09-29T15:39:46.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Emperor Talquin,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=YfepnJJE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-09-29T15:14:12.034+0000)\n>\n> This is league of legends not the real world.\n\nAh, so heart condition affects posture and skin in League of Legends.
