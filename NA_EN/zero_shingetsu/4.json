This simple little item, which can be purchased by the 6 minute mark, single-handedly wins games. Yet no one, and I mean _no one_, buys it. Ever. I am literally the only person. I have to buy this as fucking Galio because there isn&#039;t a soul who takes my advice. We hang with the most fed of Yi&#039;s in teamfights, until the other team realizes I&#039;m the reason. Then I die and I watch as my full crit Yasuo pokes their Yi for nothing, Yi&#039;s health rising by the millisecond. This is the drawback of being a generation of followers. A generation of &quot;computer/iPhone/other device said it, that&#039;s what I do&quot; folk. People don&#039;t think for themselves, and because of it, they fail to realize they&#039;re harming their own enjoyment.\n\nSticking strictly to build guides, virtually _none_ of which call for this little sword, is ruining games for more people than realize it. If I could so much as count the times I&#039;ve seen someone bitch about Nasus, Trundle, Yi or Garen... And every one of them is shut down with Executioner&#039;s Calling. It&#039;s so simple. Particularly now, in this meta of tank-shredders and massive lifesteal, this is a _crucial_ item in any build. I mean _any_ build. Tanks. Casters. I don&#039;t care, you will benefit by having this in your build.\n\n&quot;WHY DOES NASUS NOT DIE?!&quot; He doesn&#039;t have a lot of health. It&#039;s because he&#039;s ripping 900+ health for himself with each Q.\n\n&quot;WHY DOES GAREN TANK SO HARD?!&quot; Because of his regeneration. Leave him the gift of Grievous Wounds when he dips back to recover some health, and he&#039;ll think twice before going back in.\n\n&quot;WHY DOES &lt;insert ADC here&gt; LIFESTEAL FOR SO MUCH?!&quot; Because Riot&#039;s HR team is fucking horrible. That said, you can put a stop to that with Executioner&#039;s Calling.\n\n&quot;But Executioner is a shit item!&quot; I hear you say. &quot;+15 AD?! Why waste money on that when I can get a BF sword for a few hundred gold more?!&quot;\n\nLet&#039;s put it this way. Say you&#039;re reliably doing 800 DPS. Now let&#039;s say your opponent is lifestealing for 1000 per second. Don&#039;t laugh, it&#039;s very plausible in the current meta. You could get 120 AD. Then you&#039;re dealing 920 DPS to his 1000 healing per second. _Or_... you could inflict Grievous Wounds and cut their healing down to 600 per second.\n920 DPS vs. 1000 LSPS.\n800 DPS vs. 600 LSPS.\n\nI know they teach next to nothing in school these days, but _surely_ anyone over the age of 12 can do this math. Executioner&#039;s Calling wins games.\n\nAnd before anyone brings up {{item:3075}}, no, it&#039;s garbage on anyone but Rammus. It used to be amazing, but since the changes, it&#039;s literally pointless for anything but more armor (in other words, in this meta, pointless). One second of Grievous Wounds will not cut it when you&#039;re dealing with a halfway decent opposing team that won&#039;t focus the tank. {{item:3165}} is viable for casters. However, it&#039;s also _considerably_ more expensive. Better to grab Executioner early and be stifling lifesteal and self-heals before the other team starts to steamroll.\n\nI literally couldn&#039;t convince a single other person on my team to buy this item in my last game when we were up against Yi, Trundle and Soraka. And no, they didn&#039;t buy any other item that inflicts Grievous Wounds, either. Wake up, people. Think. Adapt to the situation. You&#039;ll keep having a garbage time until you start reasoning for yourself as to what you need to buy in a given match.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-26T02:49:26.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People also refuse to use dark harvest in all my ARAM games.\n\nI take it every game and typically get 1.5-3 times the damage of other keystones. often 15-20% of my damage.\n\nMeanwhile {{champion:81}} runs electrocute and has 0 damage with it at 15 minutes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Die Wei√üe Rose","date":"2018-03-26T01:58:34.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would upvote, but I'm not level 30 yet on this account, so... here's my comment of approval.","replies":[]}]}
