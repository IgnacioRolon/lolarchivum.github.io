All gaming rigs are welcome, although since the client won't be perfectly optimized at the alphaâ€™s start, players with lower-spec machines won't be prioritized early on.\"\n\nI'm sure just like the PBE, we look for really active players who are a positive influence on the community. Wait time will not directly impact how quickly or if someone will get accepted.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"BattleOoze","date":"2016-10-20T20:44:40.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Makes sense.
