Assassins in general have a high /normal pickrate so their winrates matter Also in response to the LB with q silence thing. Leblanc had clear weaknesses and was useless when behind. She was a 100% feast or famine champion","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"T4underbolt","date":"2018-03-31T21:15:08.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Taking win rates as a prove of something being broken, good,bad or terrible is stupid.

You clearly have an agenda here, though, and I know that I'm not serving it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"R7 Factor","date":"2018-03-31T19:12:27.867+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WaifuCatcher69,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EYbUykIU,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2018-03-31T19:02:46.899+0000)\n>\n> Winrates for midlane assassins\n> \n> Fizz 52.92%\n> Kassadin 49.02%\n> Talon 51.89%\n> Ekko 51.89%\n> Katarina 51.97%\n> Leblanc 51.19%\n> Ahri 51.84%\n> Diana 50.77%\n> Zed 49.5%\n> \n> &quot;Assassins have been pretty weak for a long time now.&quot; Sure they are.\n\nso Ahri is an assassin but not Akali?","replies":[]}]}]}
