Or heck, even some more hours/resistances. Something to give him viable survivability. Dude hardly has to even be kited at all before he gets blown up in team fights these days.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-09-26T16:52:58.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=T34M5RH34VY,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=I6KKG3bJ,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-09-26T15:05:25.531+0000)\n>\n> &amp;quot;As a valuable counter pick to tanks in top lane, we&amp;rsquo;re looking to help Darius cleave through some of that armor to encourage teams to think strategically when drafting top lane champions.
