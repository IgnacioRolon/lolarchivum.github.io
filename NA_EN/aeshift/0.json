Upon reaching the destination she reveals who she really is, a petrifying Demon. She then casts a spell and rips their soul out of  their body, obtaining their spirit giving her all of their strength and power that her victim once had to her. Her passion of killing men came from her childhood. Her Dad Giovanni killed her mother when Seduttore was at a young age of 8. Ever since then she has had a strong hatred for men and was in desperate need for revenge. She was so consumed by vengeance that she went in seach for  Thresh to aid her in killing her father. Her Dreadful intentions were exactly what Thresh was interested in. Since Seduttore was only a human she could not obtain the souls like Thresh so she was given an Amulet from the vault Thresh used to guard when he was a human. Thresh knew the risks that came with wearing the amulet but he did not inform Suduttore of them. They began their quest looking for Giovanni to bring her mother justice. They scoured the lands and on their way they killed many people. Since no one knows the powers that Seduttore held she used that to her advantage. She would dress in silk dresses and high heels and go out looking for men. Once she found a suitable man for the job she would lure them to a destination outside of the city and lead them to thresh. The two of them would kill them gain souls. This plan worked until what Thresh has always feared would happen. The amulet became to strong for Seduttore to handle. It began to control her and slowly but surely began to make her psychotic. She could turn into a demon using the power of the amulet. While she was in demon form she could scare anyone that layed their eyes on her. Using the power of the amulet she made an aura that made her appear to be a super attractive female but in reality she was a restless, demented lunatic that craved killing. She no longer worked beside Thresh. Seduttore now scours the lands of Runeterra luring men into traps so she can feed off their souls and become even more powerful.\n\nRole: \nMage/Tank\n\nStats:\nHealth: 475 (60 Per level)\nAttack Damage: 50 (+2.3 Per level)\nAttack speed: 0.635 (+2.30% Per level)\nMovement speed: 340 (+1.36% Per level)\nHealth Regen: 5.125 (+0.6 Per level)\nArmor: 23 (+3.25 Per level)\nMagic Resist: 35\nMana: 400(+50 Per level)\nMana Regen: (+0.125% Per level)\n\nPassive:\nSoul Extract: Seduttore gains souls from killing enemy champions and enemy units.

Her next auto will deal an extra 30/40/80 (+40% Ability Power) as Magical Damage.\n\nIdeas for what she could look like:\nI was thinking she could be more of a sex appealing champion since her lore is based on luring men. And also we havent really had an appealing champion come out in a long time.\nI was thinking she could wear a semi revealing dress and high heels then when she turns in to Demon form she transforms from the bottom up and it becomes torn up and black and she would go from a Hot sexually appealing female to a still sexually appealing female but instead she would look frightening. Her voice should sound sexy and then when she turns into her demon form its deeper and sounds more of a monster rather than a female.\n\nSome other Info:\nSuduttore is Itailan for Seducer (since she Seduces men and lures them to kill them) I chose Itailian because I thought of how Paris is the city of love and Paris is in Italy and etc.\n\nShe would most likely be played in the mid lane building Ap and Mana since she is fairly mana reliant\n\n\nTeaser\nFor the teaser you can have her lure a  man into a forrest, then she starts laughing and hides behind a rock. The man approaches the rock and then you could show her transforming and as he gets closer to the rock he gets trapped. She then appears from out of the rock and she is in her Demon form. She starts demonically laughing and then levitates to him and takes his soul and then it outros.\n\nThese are some of my Items for a new champion. Obviously its not perfect so I would enjoy some feedback of any kind. I think this is a good concept but can definitely be touched up. Let me know what you think by voting with the poll :)\n","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2017-05-12T01:00:44.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"love how you add the teaser concept, combos and visual design!","replies":[{"poster":"AEshift","date":"2017-05-12T01:41:40.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you :) I spent a few hours thinking and making this champion and I would love to have it in game.
