However he is still a very fun champ to play, and with friends can be a terror because of his strong team wide CC combo Engage. I won't lie and say learning him now will be   a pain. However, it is also a good time to start. By learning him when he is weak, you can catch mistakes, and learn who and who you cant fight. So when he gets buffed, you already master a bit of him at his worse, and now you can play him better when he gets stronger. As for helping, it does help to learn a champion who IMO Ultimate is in Top 5 Engages. He also can shred tanks, and have a ton of movement speed to kite Bruisers...unless its {{champion:24}}  because lol Q. Tho he isnt seen much top. Point being, play him, and it will take a few games to master his kite and playstyle, but he is also a ton of fun. Never hurts to try","replies":[{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-08-01T01:14:12.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find that Gnar is super satisfying to play, both in mini- and mega-Gnar forms.

What keystone do you typically take?\n\nThere are a couple of ones.\n\nPress the attack is pretty good as it works well with Gnar's W, since after he procs it he gains AD and movements from W allowing him to make very great use of the increase damage, really helps against Tanks. \n\nI am also a fan of Grasp as it can make Gnar very tanky, if you can proc it alot in mega and mini, use overgrowth and rush Frozen mallet. Nearly 3 k health alone.\n\nSummoner aery helps him with early game poke but its meh late game. Not enough testing with it myself. \n\nGlaciar is fun because its a giant middle finger to your enemy, Elec is fun for AP Gnar, and Lethal is fun for Crit if you dont want PTA. Cause a tank's worse fear, is Gnar autoing them with Bork and near 4.0 attack speed","replies":[]}]}]}]}
