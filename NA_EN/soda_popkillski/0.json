I purschased some mystery chests, and obtained 2 legacy skins. Legacy skins are technically at lower prices, as riot has had an easier time developing more advanced skins as they have progressed (which is why they retired). Though I am very happy with the molten rammus skin, the warwick skin really just seems like a lame Recolour. It takes him from a werewolf, to a slightly different colorized werewolf (with barely visible shackles)\r\n\r\nI wonder, is it possible for these to be refunded if I contact support, or do they follow the same rules as the normal skins? I&#039;m not trying to be a brat here but I REALLY don&#039;t like this warwick skin.\r\n\r\nPS: I am out of refunds, though. So I do very much doubt I will be allowed to do this.","replies":[]}
