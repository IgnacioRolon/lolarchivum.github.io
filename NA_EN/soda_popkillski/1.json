Randuin's will still be able to slow you and gives hp. Frozen Heart will still slow your autos and gives its owner cdr and mana. Thornmail does nothing if an enemy doesn't hit you or only hits you with magic damage. Thornmail also already has a really high combine cost and a build path that's very commitment oriented.

Normal crits are about 700, yes, BUT Thornmail does it based on the damage the attack WOULD HAVE done prior to armor. If they have 300 AD, you have 200 armor.

New Thornmail, you'd do 45+50=95. On crit, it'd do 112.5+50, which is 162.5. On crits, it's noticeable lower, but that's only on crits. This makes normal ADC builds more potent while Vayne, Yi, and other On-Hit based builds considerably weaker to Thornmail since they won't be critting enough.\n\nTheoretically, you only have 55% crit with PD and IE. Say you have 300 AD. In 4 attacks, 2 of those will likely crit, 2 of them won't. That means it'll do 190 on the two non-crits and 325 in total on the crits, totaling 515. Old would've done 180+450, totaling 530. A difference of 15 damage in total. If you have more armor items, you can easily make up the difference since to make up for 15 damage, you only need 60 armor extra to total the 15 (Using the basic math formula for .25 times X equals 15, so you'd divide 15 by .25, totaling 60).

Vayne doesn't care about Sunfire or the like, she cares about things like Thornmail and Frozen heart. And you're nerfing them.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDuelist999","date":"2015-08-04T06:00:34.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"except now thorn plus 5 warmogs now one shots vayne her silver bolts will proc on herself for like 500 dmg.... really only like 150 but her aa's and botrk also get reflected at her.","replies":[{"poster":"kayakninja","date":"2015-08-04T06:59:23.290+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not how that works.
