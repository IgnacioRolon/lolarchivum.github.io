I then try to reconnect to the game and the loading screen tried to load but it came up as a black screen and then said that the game was over and now i have a 5 game lower Que for 20 mins each. This is not the first time this has happened and its beginning to get really annoying when its not even my fault and im not exactly leaving the game. \r\n\r\ncould someone please help me either find a bug somewhere with my connection or help me find the problem to this as i dont want to keep randomly getting disconnected and then getting penalised for it. \r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\n{{item:3070}}{{item:3070}}{{item:3070}}{{item:3070}}{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-22T16:49:22.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry about the lower priority queue.  :(  The circumstances are not fun especially if it's out of your control.
