By banning people permanently for talking doesn&#039;t make sense, when riot could easily just chat restrict them indefinitely or shadow mute them, making their teammates unable to see what they&#039;re saying. This would actually help player retention as well as help riot be a nice safe space for gamers :) \r\n\r\nIn my situation, I was permabanned for saying the f word (new f word), but had never been chat restricted. I got banned for homophobic language, but everyone who&#039;s played videogames for the past 5 years knows this word isn&#039;t meant in a homophobic manner. It&#039;s literally just people attempting to offend someone who has provoked them. \r\n\r\nNow, I&#039;m okay with riot not wanting people to say it, but if that&#039;s their goal, why not just perma-chat restrict people???? This is like someone having gangrene in their foot, but instead of amputating just the foot, cutting off their whole leg. I dont understand what riot gains from permabanning players, that wouldn&#039;t be accomplished by just perma chat restricting them. \r\n\r\nOther than that, please unban me !! &quot;  :))))","replies":[{"poster":"mack9112","date":"2018-12-02T03:58:39.024+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Permanently chat banning people has shown an increase in those individuals toxicity multiple studies have shown this. \n\nI feel like when a rioters tells someone to come on here and ask to be unbanned they are hoping you will recognize your actions where bad and this would be a heartfelt try to convince the community you changed for the better. \n\nInstead you come here and say the system sucks and what you didn't wasn't wrong .
