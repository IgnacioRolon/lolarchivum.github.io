We get through champ select and then my game refuses to start. Keeps telling me a direct x error has appeared. so I tried  re launching the game and then I get to the point where i reset my pc. I come back to see a remake and 5 20 minute waits. I was just curious about this directx bug? I understand why I got leaver buster bc my power had went out in a norm the day before. But Was just curious how to prevent this from happening again.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-08T20:18:02.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Direct X error is usually due to a graphics card update needing to take place! It's best to reinstall, since there was probably an update that took place and you didn't get it.

I had a graphic card update but it was weird that that had happened since I hadn't logged out and was literally in a game 5 mins prior to this event occurring.
