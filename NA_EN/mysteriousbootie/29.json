It&#039;s like a caitlyn trap, it has cake, it&#039;s takin up space, and you just wanna get rid of it, but you can&#039;t. You touch that cake, and you take a crit to the face, and you also don&#039;t even get cake. I know, it&#039;s SO HARD to hold back when you see a cake with such curvy hips, and perfectly trimmed frostin, but you CANNOT afford to try to eat it. It reminds me of my own protein sammich. I know, it&#039;s a strange concoction of peanut butter and tuna, the weirdest sammich you ever done seen, and it brings into question the nature of the human race with it&#039;s more than questionable design and origins, but trust me, it&#039;s really fuckin weird, like a fish with human legs. It&#039;s beyond comprehension, it&#039;s otherwordly, but strangely attractive, and also very very unwashed and greasy. You ever washed dishes before? You probably have, and in your history likely touched a pan and had to clean it up. It&#039;s slimy, it&#039;s filled with an odd black substance, and smells like the devil&#039;s pits, but oh god don&#039;t even get me started on eatin it. &quot;Why the fuck would you eat that&quot; I hear you wonder within your mind. Look, I wasn&#039;t myself on that particular night, and I skipped lunch and dinner wasn&#039;t ready for another 5.344.222222222 minutes and 5 chromosomes. I just had to devour it, like that peanut butter and tuna sammich, I could put literally anythin in my stomach, even an entire horse. Oh god that reminds me of the time I watched Brother&#039;s Grim, that scene where the kid gets eaten by the horse alive, because its mouth is filled with spiders. Why ever the dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago? Why are spiders so freaky? They got dem 8 legs, GIANT EVIL BLACK SOULLESS eyes, not even good hip bone structure. I&#039;m tryin to understand why god would create such an entity, for it is an abomination of creation, like a massive cock roach. Those things are so big I don&#039;t know how the fuck they even breath, it&#039;s like, wouldn&#039;t their lungs by crushed by their very mass? Oh fuck it, not even a nuke can take them down hilary clinton isn&#039;t a very good candidate imo she&#039;s a giant apple tree biscuit made with white frostin and black substance. That&#039;s right, the same stuff as I saw on my pan, and ate. I wouldn&#039;t eat clinton though, not even with salt or vinegar, I&#039;d rather massage my PC speakers for a publix sub, oh god daddy please don&#039;t touch that, I didn&#039;t mean what I said about your mom it was all the protein sammich, FUCKS SAKE MAKE IT STOP MAKE IT STOP OH GOD, it&#039;s gonna puke on the roach omfg the sour dough was right, it was always right, the protein sammich was a whore that just wanted my nasal spray for it&#039;s allergic reactions to aliens from spacey places in outer space where is trump what even is he, it&#039;s hot in here, I need a fan. It&#039;s all orge shrek has found me. I remember the day of my birth longitude 3.5666, I remember my mother lookin surprised as I poked my head out into the world for the very first time.\n\nWait what were we talkin about?","replies":[]}
