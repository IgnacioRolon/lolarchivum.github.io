The ONLY time it ends before that long is when every lane is feeding out of their minds. If even 1 guy is fed or most lanes are breaking even you&#039;re looking at a loooong game. Often times i would find my team pushed up to the enemy inhib turrets and then....we can&#039;t really do much other than hope to make picks. Turret dives on inhib turrets are super rare, especially when the enemy ADC&#039;s or burst mages are still alive. Sometimes one good tank like garen or darius ALONE can discourage us from diving. I think the core issue of these long &quot;stalemate&quot; games is people get to just hide behind inhib turrets.\r\n\r\nInhib turrets don&#039;t have an attack delay like normal turrets, they&#039;re constantly shootng beams of DEATH AND DESTRUCTION at your FACE! So here&#039;s my idea to nerf inhib turrets: let&#039;s make them function like every other turret in thegame, in fact let&#039;s have that apply to nexus turrets as well. Another thing i feel is largely impacting game time is &quot;homeguard&quot;. I mean come on, at least in season 5 it was an optional thing you had to kinda invest in, now it&#039;s free and everyone automatically gets it by 20 minutes. Homeguard makes it too easy to defend your base and capitalize on picks by taking inhibs, etc. So i think we should just remove it. \r\n\r\n**THAT IS ALL THANKS FOR YOUR TIME**","replies":[]}
