My ping is typically 67-80 as worst but now it's mysteriously spiking between 120-200 ping, and i'm makin' sure there's nothin' running in the background that could lag the game out, and I know nothin' is downloadin' to slow my ping. I j'es don't understand what is happenin' and it's so annoying. I want to play league, but these FPS drops are drivin' me BONKERS!\r\n\r\nUp until 6.18 my game usually runs pretty smoothly.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-18T20:24:43.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unstable FPS issues are usually caused by a malfunctioning driver or power settings that prevent your video card from performing at its peak power output.

My fps has slightly improved but my ping still hovers around 150-200 consistently in normal games. Usually if I have any ping increase it occurs even when i'm alone in a customs game.","replies":[{"poster":"ah bin tbk","date":"2016-10-31T01:44:37.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao it's because you're the host : P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-19T15:36:09.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad to hear your FPS has gotten better after those steps.
