Seems like it would be fun to do every once in a while. Though if I don&#039;t have a mic i&#039;m not too sure how I could make it entertaining. I mean I could type in the chat but that would be about it as far as communication goes. I don&#039;t even know how to stream though, or how to use twitch or even if my computer can HANDLE playing league at 60 fps while streaming at the same time. It tends to be really laggy even when I&#039;m just tryin to record with fraps/bandicam.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas/suggestions on how to make a better stream that&#039;d be great too.","replies":[]}
