This is an LP series I may or may not do, dependin. Last night I created 2 versions of the same video, both of them with their own style of commentary. One is my old fashioned subtitle text commentary, the other is somethin different I am tryin out: a synthetic voice. Basically I use one of em robotic text to speech thingies, like microsoft sam etc. Understand, synthetic voice is specifically to express a CHARACTER, not replace a mic or some other nonsense. Like idk if y&#039;all ever seen Arby n the chief but they used synthetic voices a lot for their characters.\n\nAnyway, it would be much appreciated if y&#039;all checked it out, because I need to figure out which style of commentary I should continue BETWEEN THESE TWO.","replies":[]}
