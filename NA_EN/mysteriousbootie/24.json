I figured it&#039;d be a fun lil experimentation to try out for a couple days and I just uploaded it. Here&#039;s the video if y&#039;all are interested, brought to you by the power of MOVIE MAKER:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiPPaOfo4kQ\n\nI used the english dub and the english title in this case (I personally like the dub a lot anyway), uh I put the songs in the trailer in the description too.\n\nOooo this was tricky to make, had to make sure the voices were synched, had to fish throughout episodes for scenes to use along with the music, and movie maker has this habit of buggin and slowin down so that just made it that much more tedious. I really enjoyed workin on this regardless of difficulties. Oh, and I discovered the power of usin star symbols in titles so i used that too, to mix it up and hopefully make it pop out more.\n\nWhatchu guys think? o.o\n\n**EDIT: Ok I sent out a dispute, it should be watchable now lol**\n\nYoutube pls","replies":[]}
