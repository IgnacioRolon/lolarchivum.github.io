Language issues are not a problem there.\n\nAnd tbh I don't really understand why it's considered anime? It's closer to Toy Story than anime, as it's 3D CGI rather than 2D animation. It just has anime stylings, much as Toy Story has western cartoon stylings. It's okay not to like that style of art, but let me foist my annoying pedantry on you to make sure you dislike it for the right reasons! >.>\n\nOr ignore me. People who are unfettered by pedantry are probably better off overall anyways. Besides, anime 「アニメ」 is lit. \"animated film or cartoon\", so technically if we're speaking Japanese it's a mostly-correct usage of the word. It just has a different meaning in English.\n\nObviously this is all very important in M&G. M&G is all about correct inter-lingual grammar, after all.
