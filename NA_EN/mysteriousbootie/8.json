What about other builds tho? Let&#039;s say I go {{item:1416}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3031}} . I run around doin crit damage, and obviously shiv helps my waveclear, and IE boosts the chance and power of crits. I could also try {{item:3046}} if I really wanna push out crit damage.\r\n\r\nOther build ideas I have are &quot;lethality jax&quot;, {{item:3142}} {{item:3147}} {{item:3814}} . Ghostblade gives me extra MS when I need it, I got the spell shield for goin in on a team with CC. I could also opt for bruiser jax: {{item:1416}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3065}} . \r\n\r\nAny experienced jax players gimme insight on these build ideas? How good can they be? What situations could they be weak or strong? I don&#039;t layout entire builds because generally it doesn&#039;t seem like you ever wanna go full damage jax, you want at least a tank item or 2 and obviously that differs per game.","replies":[]}
