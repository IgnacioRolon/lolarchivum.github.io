I was just mindin my own business when suddenly there was music playin throughout the hospital. My mom came into the room hearin it, describin it as &quot;music that plays as a dark ritual occurs&quot;, or somethin along those lines. I peep outside the window and see antelopes ridin trees like they&#039;re pogo sticks, jumpin so high they can reach the roof of the hospital, but when they fall they fall to their deaths due to the height X_X\r\n\r\nThe music got more intense as more antelopes did that and basically suicided for no reason, then a swarm of black birds came to infest and destroy the hospital and everyone in it. They were so fast that their mere speed could cut you to bits, and they were preparin their invasion. They could come at any moment, and then we activated the hospitals defensive systems, triggerin metal doors to block off every window and door in the place to keep them out. My family hid inside the safe room while we waited for the swarm of birds to leave us alone. The music got louder and louder as they became more angry that they couldn&#039;t get inside.\r\n\r\nWeird asf O_o\r\n\r\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN!?","replies":[]}
