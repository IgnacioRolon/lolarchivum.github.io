Meanwhile, his Q is not only good for harass, but gives him a heal, and he can cripple you so you can&#039;t even walk away from the Q before it goes off. Oh yeah and he can always bleed you out, and in general attempting to 1v1 him seems like a completely impossible feat, especially when he&#039;s level 6 and can just ult your head for an execute. Jungler can&#039;t even help you because he can just 2v1.\n\nI can&#039;t even fucking FARM vs a darius because he can just pull me in, how am I supposed to kill him??? He just completely ruins top lane for me -__-\n\n","replies":[]}
