I wanna be able to apply my E and Q combo more often, get access to my W and ult more often, so in theory I could get a little more micro potential in teamfights and skirmishes. I just wanna make sure I&#039;m balancing it out so my late-game damage doesn&#039;t get hurt too much, and maybe it could give me some sort of edge in the mid-game.\n\nSo this is my first idea for a CDR build: {{item:3508}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3036}} , then I can mix in either a {{item:3142}}  or {{item:3071}}  to cap off the CDR instead of getting a defensive item like GA or QSS. Y&#039;all think this is a good build for ADC tristana? Should I get CDR glyphs for this build? Maybe I can avoid having to get an extra CDR item if I did that but at the same time that would sacrifice my MR glyphs.","replies":[]}
