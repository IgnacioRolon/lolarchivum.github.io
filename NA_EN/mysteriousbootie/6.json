Oh and then you get the teammates that refuse to group when their team is ahead (the classic nasus syndrome of FARM FARM FARM FARM FARM), and lemme tell ya every single second that goes on in silver league is another second you can throw, so you REALLY want to end it as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nOf course in late game spots, 1 person pops = GG in most cases, or free baron or free elder drake, so this means you need to constantly spam ping and tell people in chat to stop going off alone in the middle of the map, or don&#039;t get baited into a team fight because X teammate is MIA or dead. Oh and YOU YOURSELF have to keep an eye on every single teammate so you don&#039;t end up forcing a 4v5. Inhib pops? You pretty much must turtle until the inhib is back up otherwise the nexus towers fall. Meanwhile you want to defend stuff like baron and dragon BUTTTT (lel butt xd) teams have a habit of aram dancing before actually engaging, and every second passing is a second super creeps are barring down on your nexus towers.\r\n\r\nSo you gotta BACK, and then you LOSE BARON AND DRAGON, and then the game gets stalled even LONGER. Then inhib respawns and it&#039;s 40 minutes into the game, so you REAAALLY don&#039;t want anyone getting caught because you will lose most 4v5s in the late game and 60 second death timers OP. Then you get this magical ace that feels like total luck at this point, and you just want it to end because the game is 40 minutes long and you&#039;re crackin&#039; under the pressure. Woopsy can&#039;t dive the nexus turrets because they deal a million damage per second for some reason herp derp derp. IDK why these things can&#039;t function like the outside base turrets and give teams a chance to end a game, So the games goes on for EVEN LONGERRRR.\r\n\r\n15 minutes later everybody is one edge, starting to get pissy at each other, teams ARAM dancing left and right, people want to split push but you CAN&#039;T SPLIT PUSH 40 MINUTES INTO THE GAME BECAUSE THERE&#039;S A HIGH LIKELYHOOD YOU GET CAUGHT AND SCREW YOUR TEAM OVER......there&#039;s like 5 baron pushes throughout the entire game ya gotta hold off, luckily the enemy team isn&#039;t very confident and gragas won&#039;t just ult me into his team the second i walk into range lol\r\n\r\nPeople losing their minds, everyone from the support to the nasus grabbin&#039; a GA O_O\r\n\r\nMaybe like 30 minutes later a clutch teamfight happens. I don&#039;t even know HOW we win, lag spikes and stuttering and all of a sudden master yi cleans up 90% of the team. Then we bum rush the nexus and barely win!!!\r\n\r\n..........And then after that str8 up WAR I get like 2 LP to show for it. WURF???","replies":[]}
