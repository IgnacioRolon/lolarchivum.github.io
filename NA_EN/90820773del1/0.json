I supposedly have been \"earning BE every game \"but I yet see that my BE balance is zero.\r\n\r\nI have been mostly playing intermediate co-op vs bot to work on my combos. I feel i am close to moving to pvp games, but I see a lot of hate about BE and I understand some of it now. I feel even I should have at least SOME BE earned even though I am just practicing still and getting to know the game.\r\n\r\nThankfully the only champions I was interested in went on sale this week and I bought them all half off. But I honestly don't want to spend any more actual money on rewards since we are supposed to earn rewards.\r\n\r\nPS. Some of the Skin prices are pretty ridiculous\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-29T17:45:17.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there!  Your first win of the day missions is planned to reward you with 50 BE.  You also have a ton of leveling capsules you haven't opened yet! >< You'll get rewards along the way just for playing be leveling up, more info [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/hAaYMrEs-leveling-and-rewards-early-impressions-and-adjustments).\n\nWhen you get a chance, login and select the Loot tab.  You have a lot of capsules waiting for you to unlock, content that you've gained while playing.  You'll find lots of goodies and shards.  If you get anything you don't want, you should be able to disenchant them for resources like BE.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"90820773DEL1","date":"2017-11-30T01:03:18.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello there, \n\nI have seen that I earned rewards and capsules for the last two weeks.  But it wasn't until today, after you posted, that I got Blue Essence points.  I have won plenty of games for the last 2 weeks and there was zero Blue Essence awarded to my account, even though it said I earned \"X amount of Blue Essence after every match\" but there was never any amount added until today, it looks like I am missing probably over 1k of Blue Essence since I played plenty of matches and gotten top score in a decent percentage of the matches.\n\nNot sure if there is way you can check and add retroactively any Blue Essence that wasn't added to my account  that I started over two weeks ago. I could be wrong but I was pretty sure, it said I was earning Blue essence on top of the loot rewards I was earning.\n\nCheers,\n\nT","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-30T16:46:17.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, BE is not rewarded after each match.  You will only receive BE after a match once through your First Win of The Day Mission.  This mission that includes BE just went live this week, so looking into your account personally, I wasn't able to find anything out of the ordinary.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
