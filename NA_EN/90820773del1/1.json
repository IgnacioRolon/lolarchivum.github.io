There's 0 things wrong with choosing a main, but it's always wise to broaden your horizon to other champs or even other roles in order to assure you always have someone or some place to play. Banning is just part of the game, so it's something everyone needs to account for.\n\nIf you're a Zed mid main, Akali and Talon or both very solid alternatives right now if he gets banned. Try acquiring them and seeing if they work well for you too!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valeeva","date":"2017-11-15T01:44:09.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"May I suggest you pick up other champions like Akali, Diana, Talon?\n\nHaving a broader champion pool, even if you wish to limit yourself to assassins means that when champs like Zed who you main gets banned you have fallbacks.","replies":[]}]}
