It is the general consensus that the mode is essentially slightly flavored version of 5v5 Summoner&#039;s Rift. Only in this mode, there is a significant amount of toxicity and cancer. Much more than any previous featured game mode. Perhaps the ones that usually only play the fun modes have popped out and shown their true nature. In the past, it was considered that Katarina was overpowered in most modes because she was the one getting the insta-pentas and the like. However this mode seems to encourage early counterjungling and invading due to the kraken gain by killing enemy monsters. While this isn&#039;t terrible, it does spawn some very depressing moments for the ones that try to be more neutral in their picks. All you seem to see is the carry junglers, which is mostly the fault of sated devourer. I am not going to go into anything specific, but overall this mode is poorly balanced and sadly because of the kraken currency system there is almost no comeback potential. The same argument could be said of Ascension, well, I enjoyed Ascension, it wasn&#039;t the best but it was fun. Unlike this mode, where half the games are rage-inducing and the other half tends to be stomps. In 30 games, there has been only 1 or 2 that wasn't a stomp or getting stomped. Simply put, extremely poor balancing.","replies":[{"poster":"Siyther","date":"2015-08-02T16:59:34.265+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"what ive seen on this mode is everyone picks a carry period. If ur team picks a supp or tank u will lose. That why i dont like it i like the minion upgrades and diff items but ppl have figured out that this is a straigh kill fest and through strategy out the window therefore it is garbage   dont play it if u main support or play supporty style jungles or mids it wil be a waste of time","replies":[{"poster":"Melvear","date":"2015-08-03T02:36:26.890+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Siyther,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=N9xajWtK,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-02T16:59:34.265+0000)\n>\n> what ive seen on this mode is everyone picks a carry period.

But what else is that these new modes are giving us too much lag. The client can't handle the new map and the new mode. If I try to play on Butcher's bridge I get unplayable lag in general that I can't even get out of the base.
