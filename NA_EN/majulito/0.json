However in LOL it never feels that way. Assassins just seem to come at you and do so much damage you just die. Their outplay potential is supposed to be tied to creative uses of their mobility but often its just used to come at you head on or run away. And in the case of zed and leblanc they do both at the same time.\r\n\r\nPeople say that assassins fall off but I disagree. The longer the game goes on the more valuable picking off a person is and who is better at doing that than assassins. Now I&#039;m not saying lets nerf the class across the board or anything like that. But I think its time to think about what is fair for an assassin and their target. Sion for example is loaded with cc but theres tons of counterplay to that. Assassins are load with damage and mobility and unfortunately the counterplay seems to be don&#039;t be near them or be tanky enough to survive.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"CR4ZYRONDH4VI","date":"2016-06-07T00:18:03.462+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":8,"body":"I mean i guess, but i feel as if tank champs do that more, like darius, garen, volibear, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"majulito","date":"2016-06-07T00:24:32.134+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":5,"body":"Those champs also have a harder time catching up to a target and sticking to one.

I feel that unless there is a reasonable way to counter something, then it just becomes frustrating and obnoxious to deal with.  If the counter isn't too hard for anyone to access, then it might even make the playerbase of what is being countered stronger, since they'd have to use their abilities more carefully. \n\nCourse I'm of a different perspective.  But if you are correct, then I'll be sure to remember that whenever I hear a {{champion:238}} spam, \"Skillz!\" whenever he ults a low health enemy that doesn't have the items required.\n\nCause, you know, having to buy a particular item to counter one champion is perfectly fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2016-06-07T03:37:08.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":15,"body":"I don't think there should be  a perfect counter for everything, some champions just out right lose to Zed and thats 100% okay.

Back when Evelynn was made, though, the \"assassin\" class was far more based around sneaking up and killing someone from surprise, not \"outplaying\" your opponent to kill them. (Which is why Eve and Shaco are two of the most consistently balanced assassins in the game-- they're simple, but effective. They do their job without being overly oppressive, but just annoying enough.)\n\nWith Evelynn, they have to keep her on a really tight leash ~~(she probably likes that anyways)~~ because of her passive, as previously stated. The problem is, even if they rework her, they _cannot, in any way, remove her current passive,_ because THAT is what defines Evelynn as a champion more than anything else. Not her hate spike spam, not her ult shield/slow, it's her passive. No other champion can be invisible as consistently as her, only Twitch coming in second place with his impressive stealth duration. So when it comes to changing her kit...\n\nQ? It'll have to be pretty much the same due to her playstyle fantasy of \"running along the enemy (no matter how fast) and constantly being able to attack them without stopping.)\n\nW? Could change, but it's what allows her playstyle fantasy to work so well, her speed.\n\nE? Could easily be changed.\n\nR? Was thrown in to give her more survivability. Funnily enough, there's one other champion who has this ultimate on a normal ability-- Ekko. Except his is far stronger, at the cost of a delay. Ekko's _stuns_ all enemy champions hit if he goes in it, or _heavily slows_ them as long as they're inside of it. Evelynn's _slows_ all enemy champions hit when it comes out. There is no lingering field. Ekko's gives him a _massive shield_ (that's almost a second HP bar) _that scales with his AP._ Evelynn's gives her a fairly strong shield that scales with _each enemy you hit_ instead, making it FAR weaker in 1v1 situations, and only comparable when you hit 3 or more people at once with an AoE that's far smaller.\n\nSo what does Evelynn have that the infamous Ekko doesn't? Well, naturally, her invisibility. 1 for Evelynn. Second, would be her mobility. _Except,_ Ekko SLOWS her (which overrides all speed boosts) and _speeds himself up_ every 3 hits, slows her on a Q, OR slows/stuns her on a W. (If you have Rylai's, congrats! You slow her on every ability in your kit.) Even though Evelynn's W cleanses slows, it cannot come off cooldown fast enough to get through all of those. So there's 1 for Ekko. Damage? Ekko far beats her in that, even when building tank. 2 for Ekko. Survivability? ...Do you really need to ask? 3 for Ekko. \n\nSo you've got Evelynn who has... stealth.\n\nAnd Ekko who's got... everything else. \n\nThis isn't really an Ekko hate post, just more of that he's the closest champion with similar mechanics that I could compare her to (aside from maybe Hecarim? But Hecarim is tankier than Eve+Stronger Teamfight Potential+More CC.) \n\nI personally think Riot's terrified of changing Eve because she might turn into a second Ekko.
