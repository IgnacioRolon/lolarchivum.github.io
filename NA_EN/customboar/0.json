After this happens you can of course zoom out but if it happens during a team fight or trade this can cause lost trades and really bad team fights. No option in in-game settings allows you to turn this on or off. Naturally some players have looked for ways to unbind the mouse wheel or turn off zoom. Below i have collected a list of threads that were all started to deal with this kind of problem all of them are unsolved except for by directly changing keybindings using the notepad. Unfortunately these changes have in some cases caused further problems for some users so I am hoping that riot will address this problem the way it could have been addressed back in 2014 (the date of the oldest thread about this problem i could find). Put in a option to turn zoom on or off. This is a simple permanent solution.
