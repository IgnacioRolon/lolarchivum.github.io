When my client crashes at champ select I then log back it to play a game and have to wait 15 minutes before I can get in que. I did nothing wrong yet you punish me for this. Help me out and take me off that whatever it is where I crash that I get banned for 15 minutes. It makes me want to not play league anymore and I like the game. I buy skins and I enjoy playing so could you please help me out here. It is seriously frustrating that I have to wait for something I can't control. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSilentSoul1289","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-24T20:30:52.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leaving champion select will count as a[ queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging), and place you in a lower priority queue for one match.  Dodging or leaving games do cause other players a negative experience, so it's important to resovle whatever is causing that crash.  I'd be happy to help, but I'd need more information about what you're seeing such as any error messages.  Let me know!","replies":[]}]}
