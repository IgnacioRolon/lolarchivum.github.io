It&#039;s supposed to be the twice(ish) a year event to bring everyone together and have a ton of fun. Right?\r\nThat&#039;s how I always saw this gamemode. Loads of fun. And I&#039;m not here to complain about the AR part of ARURF. I actually enjoy that more as it removes the stale and irritating meta there used  to be.\r\nI&#039;m here to talk about a growing problem I&#039;ve seen in several of my many URF games. It seems the &quot;fun&quot; aspect of the gamemode has been taken so literally, that several people take the gamemode as an opportunity to troll, and go out of their way to ruin mine, and other player&#039;s game. And the worst part? Everyone seems to be okay with that. I&#039;ve asked many times in all chat or post game: &quot;report syndra for afk&quot; or &quot;report ashe for inting.&quot; And no one gives a damn! The responses I get are &quot;this %%% actually cares about URF? what a loser&quot; and &quot;punish someone in ARURF? kys dude.&quot; Several of those people on the other team actually claimed to have HONOURED our trollers. That, to me, is appalling.\r\n\r\nLike yeah, I get it&#039;s a fun game ... but that shouldn&#039;t justify RUINING the fun of it for me or my teammates, much less ENCOURAGING this behaviour. \r\nI don&#039;t know exactly how this could be fixed or addressed, but it&#039;s something that definitely needs to be given attention, as its a recurring issue.","replies":[{"poster":"acehole76","date":"2017-02-28T08:37:01.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"it's the ar part.  you force me to play a champ I don't want to play and you're going to get a very low effort on my part.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolftastic33","date":"2017-02-28T09:08:27.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=acehole76,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=XEREOO9v,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-02-28T08:37:01.976+0000)\n>\n> it&#x27;s the ar part.  you force me to play a champ I don&#x27;t want to play and you&#x27;re going to get a very low effort on my part.\n\nYou're going into a game knowing that you can get any champion that you own and/or is free!","replies":[{"poster":"acehole76","date":"2017-02-28T12:03:30.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wolftastic33,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=XEREOO9v,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-02-28T09:08:27.200+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re going into a game knowing that you can get any champion that you own and/or is free!\n\nyes but i want to play urf i have to play arurf.  so when i get a champ i dont like you as my teammates get my poorest effort possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolftastic33","date":"2017-02-28T12:46:50.760+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=acehole76,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=XEREOO9v,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2017-02-28T12:03:30.591+0000)\n>\n> yes but i want to play urf i have to play arurf.  so when i get a champ i dont like you as my teammates get my poorest effort possible.\n\nUrf aint here.

Just report them. Implications that you may be punished for asking others to report aside, it's hearsay and adding more reports to the pile makes little difference so long as they are reported at least once in the game.","replies":[]}]}
