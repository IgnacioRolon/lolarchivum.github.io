If you were frequenting the boards a month or two ago, you may remember the time when I asked for people's personality types and what their favorite champions are. As it turned out I wasn't the only one really curious on this and I got *a lot* of responses. Which is awesome! Except for the part where I couldn't analyze the results well simply because I didn't expect to have enough results to really draw anything from.\n\nSo here I am again, prepared this time, to see what happens. The only thing I need now is your all's help!\n---\nTake a personality test from this site: \nhttp://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test \n(It's better to have everyone take the same test)\n---\nFill out this survey: \nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/10uiEnixPqfHWpC6HGmghEQOOH18CWUuy4Q0h_MDSvnA/viewform \n(It's only 3 questions)\n---\nWatch the results here: \nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/10uiEnixPqfHWpC6HGmghEQOOH18CWUuy4Q0h_MDSvnA/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm\n\n---\nThis can be a very interesting set of results if enough people answer (and of course, answer honestly). So help me out! results will be shown this time next week with the responses thus far! ^_^\n\n---\n\nFAQ  \n\n*Why only one champion?* \n\nMy thinking is that it's easier to get insight of a preferred playstyle of a personality type of you're limited to \"that single one\". Allowing more choices will provide more variance, but at the same time inflate results (which in this situation is a good thing, as a high sample is required). I completely admit that allowing multiple choices may have been a better option, but I do have reasoning behind choosing the one.\n\n*So many introverts!*  \n\nThat's a sample bias. Right now I'm pulling off of r/leagueoflegends, vBulletin and the Boards for responses, which, by the nature of these medium's audiences will primarily be introverts. A lot of people have noticed the discrepancies between the given test's site's statistics and the ones here, and I assure you this survey's stats are the ones that are currently off. I will probably be revisiting with a validation survey of personality type stats within this subreddit. \n\n*Why are the results are so....messy?*  \n\nIt's all raw data right now. I'm planning on re-posting in a week with a trimmed and cleaned update for the results (as well as a call for more responses, never enough!). \n\n*What about Roles?!*  \n\nI've gotten several requests for this already, so I will definitely be coming back around with a separate survey on this. I got burned before on having too many questions so I wanted to keep this one as simple as possible. I'll more than likely hand that survey out in this survey's update post next week (don't want to spam surveys after all!)\n\n*What's wrong with the percentages?* \n\nCurrently the results for each answer are being shown against the entire voting population (all types), this was not intentional. So for now, just ignore the % numbers.\n---\n\n>Edit 1: Forms should be unlocked now, sorry to those of you who tried in the first few minutes. Should be working now!\n\n>Edit 2: Due to the high number of data points in selecting a favorite champion a graph will not show up unless enough responses happen, so bear with it! Either way, all the responses are being recorded to a spreadsheet that I'll be able to work with later.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-09-22T19:36:42.393+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"PotD and frontpage r/leagueoflegends......\n\nSo..many....responses......","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Baconhawk","date":"2014-09-22T22:50:46.760+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're welcome :DDDDD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flintfall","date":"2014-09-22T20:40:03.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Front page?\n\nDude....I'd be swamped :P\n\nAlso, what's your personality type?\n\nEDIT: Over 6000 from reddit, hey zues!","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-09-22T20:57:13.570+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"INTP, favorite is Renekton. \n\n>EDIT: Over 6000 from reddit, hey zues!\n\nIKR????","replies":[{"poster":"Flintfall","date":"2014-09-22T21:09:54.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda funny how I'm drawn to writing, and the famous INFP people are:\n\n* William Shakespeare\n* J.R.R.

If you pay close attention, the most popular champions in every personality closely match LoLKing's list of champions sorted by popularity (Thresh, Vayne, Lee Sin, Yasuo, Lucian, Zed). Since practically every personality type favours what is already considered widely popular, it means people prefer champions that are perceived as powerful or have the capacity to make \"flashy plays\".","replies":[{"poster":"333lom","date":"2014-09-23T10:52:07.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then I'm not one of them!

Even looking at the results this is true, as by far most ENTP's tend to gravitate towards the Champions that go FULLY in, such as {{champion:64}}, {{champion:157}}, and {{champion:238}}. \n\nYou would think someone who tends to avoid confrontation would play someone safe and long-ranged like Caitlyn. The reason I prefer to play Caitlyn is not only because I just generally prefer the Marksmen role, but because I LOVE the harass she brings. I play her not as a safe ADC, but as a thorn in the enemy's side, one they just can't reach. I challenge them from afar, goading them to come closer, to get them to *try* and close the distance. If they can, they can have me, because they deserved it. If they can't, well, they're mine, and they'll have to try again.\n\nI don't know, I'm thinking too far into this I think, but I do find this fascinating, why some personality types choose certain Champions based on their styles of gameplay.\n\n\n**I DONT mean trolling in any way, we really only like to, as the site puts it, play \"devil's advocate\" so much to get other people thinking, even if what we're defending is wrong. If they can't defend their own points of view, even if they're right, they need to improve how they express and how they believe, and according to that site again with the descriptions, ENTP's are all about self-improvement. We care about the improvement of others as well.

This can be seen with Thresh and Lee Sin who although they have high skill caps, they show the battlefield control and ability to contribute to their team while creating less stress for the team (( Lee Sin's ganks and kicks towards/away from the team and Thresh's hooks and Box )). \n\nHowever, I'm slightly different, enjoying unpredictable or tank-like damage dealers for their role such as {{champion:150}} and {{champion:104}}. Mostly because I like to be able to help my support with not needing as much healing with Grave's passive or being able to CC an entire team and then kite safely with Gnar. I like to take care of my team, even if I'm doing awful, by at least trying to not make myself a burden they have to carry. However, I will admit I also love playing {{champion:117}} who is possibly the striking image of an INFP who likes to; 1) Avoid conflict with the shield and MS boost. 2) Control their surroundings with Pix and Polymorph. 3) Have that almost dream-like quality of making one of your team members this giant, magical version of themselves that knocks nearby enemies into the air.

There were a few questions that I found myself thinking \"Well, I kind of agree with this statement if I think about it one way, but I would definitely disagree with it if I think about it another way.\" I decided to take this test three times with 10 minutes in between them, I got ISTJ, ISTJ, and INTJ, all because I answered the questions slightly different yet still true when pertaining to myself. It's not like there aren't more detailed versions of the MBTI available for free online, I'm curious whether you chose to go with the first thing they found or if they chose this because it took significantly less time.\n\nFor what it's worth, this test is the only one I've ever gotten something different than INTJ, and I've taken various forms of the MBTI for therapy, classes, and internet shits and giggles.
