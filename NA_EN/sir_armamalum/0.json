I get through champ select and everything fine but as soon as I leave client and go to the game (loading screen) I cannot connect. The error message blames my firewall but I have not only made sure LoL has exception but I have also flat out disabled my firewall and anything else on my comp that could possibly interfere with a connection and still do not get a connection through. The most frustrating part of this is it doesn't happen to every game, just what seems like every other game now.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming this has something to do with the network/ISP fiddling that is happening on NA servers and that's completely understandable, but could I possibly get an ETA on when I can go back to a reliable connection? And hoping beyond hope if there's a way I can fix this on my end?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-01-10T02:39:02.549+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sir ArmaMalum,\n\nGetting through Champion Selection, only not to be able to connect to the actual Game and Loading screen is a pretty awful experience.  There are quite a number of reasons as to why you cannot connect through the Loading Screen normally.  Typically, these issues are caused by a 3rd party security software (such as a Firewall) that is actively blocking your connection to our Game Servers.  While I know you mentioned you directly disabled your Firewalls, make sure that you try all of the steps found in this Knowledge Base Article:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/22114820-Firewall-Configuration-for-League-of-Legends\n\nIf your issue still persists, we will need several logs in order to determine why this issue is occurring in order to continue troubleshooting.  To that end, I will need you to create a new Support Ticket (found here:  https://support.leagueoflegends.com/tickets/new) and provide the following logs:\n\n1) Network Analysis: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20103436-obtaining-a-network-analysis\n\n2) NetworkInfo Log: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20132863-obtaining-a-networkinfo-log\n\n3) Process List: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20132988-obtaining-a-process-list\n\n4) Please send your most recent r3d log where you experienced the problem (You'll notice that the file name starts with the date/time and ends with r3dlog.txt): https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/22128450-League-of-Legends-Logs","replies":[{"poster":"RhodeXLX","date":"2015-02-25T11:03:49.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just made a thread about the same issue, but I just recently used the search box (my bad....).

And with my game it doesn't allow me to load with everyone else. it pops up firewall error and i wait until everyone is in game before i am able to load in. Sometimes it will allow me to load but the game is half way in and now i have low priority queue for 20min which is incredibly annoying and unfair.","replies":[]},{"poster":"roflSong","date":"2014-12-10T02:12:51.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got the same error.

So far it hasn't happened again, so far so good.

I suggest following dArtagnan's directions in the other comment and hopefully that'll help. Good luck!","replies":[]}]}]}
