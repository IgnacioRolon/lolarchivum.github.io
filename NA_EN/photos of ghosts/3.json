So bm to everyone who prefers her Mid, Top, or Jg.\n\nBut the buffs supports got were better than the buffs that mages got. Having better mana regen is way, way better than having a slightly bigger mana pool, especially now that Doran's Ring scales off of your base mana regen. Karma and other people like Zyra now get more from Doran's Ring than the vast majority of the mid lane pool (at level 1 they get 4 mana per 5 rather than 3 per 5), and will similarly get more from Grail and Morello than the others. \n\nYou should be glad that Karma got the regen buff because it's WAY BIGGER than the base mana buffs given to the traditional solo laners. Mana regen buffs double dip because it improves your base stats -and- what you get from your items. Base mana buffs? Only double dip with Mana Font, and even then the effect is null at level 18 while the regen buff is good at every single level. As someone who plays Zyra mid occasionally, I am very happy that Riot is treating her as a support in this case, because it means she gets a much bigger buff than the people they're treating as mages.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-11-10T19:31:39.606+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Base mana regen is better for bursty champions who have decent cooldowns and don't spam their abilities.

I won't really say Karma is a machine gun like Ryze or Cassiopeia but she definitely needs to use her all of her abilities quite frequently in lane.\n\nNo, mana regen is better. \n\nIf you get the mage buff you get 50 extra mana. That's it. If you get the support buff you get 2.5 mana per 5 seconds. That's 5 mana per 10 seconds, aka 60 mana over the course of two minutes. If you stay in lane for even two minutes after you first cast a spell, you are getting more from this buff than the people getting base mana pool buffs.\n\nMana pool only matters if you have a kit that needs to burn huge amounts of mana at one time, to the point that regen cannot possibly keep up. This basically boils down to weirdos like Kassadin with abilities that cost hundreds of mana and people like Anivia where their abilities consistently drain mana. Karma on the other hand is a completely standard mage without excessive mana consumption either via high numbers or consistent drain. \n\nEven if base mana is better than mana regen on a poke mage, it becomes worse when you take into account how it interacts with their itemisation. Karma will get either Morello or Grail, which are both better if your regen is higher. She will also have a Doran's Ring in mid lane, which is better if your regen is higher. Her item in the jungle if she goes there will also be better with higher regen.\n\n*There is no way in which she'd be better off with a bigger mana pool than better regen.* Same for Zyra. I don't know how I can make that clearer.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2015-11-10T14:51:02.086+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Miss Fortune,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=B4tHvemI,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-11-10T11:31:50.027+0000)\n>\n> Karma only got the support buffs as well.

The passive is what allows you to use your ult multiple times in a fight. As it is right now, late game if she hits 5 people with her ulted Q in a teamfight, her ult cd goes by 15 seconds per part of Q hit. If you hit both parts of the Q on 5 people your ult is already back up and you can use it again immediately. During lane, you use your autos to harass and lower the cd on your ult so you can use it more often. \n\n- When she goes carry role, she's a utility support on top of a carry. She kites, she provides ms and shields, and she typically shuts down most top laners. Carry Karma is all about forcing the enemy team into fights they can't win, and poking when the enemy team refuses to fight. \n\n- Her mantra'd W is what makes her so deceptively hard to kill in 1v1s. If you use it right, that thing's going to heal you for over half of your health and snare them for a total of 3.25 seconds. Sure, it doesn't increase your damage directly, but with the extra snare time you'll land more Q's and take less damage. It's not meant to do more damage, it's meant to provide more sustain and cc. Same with the E, massive shield for your entire team and a movement increase. Again, not meant to do damage so it feels lackluster, but it's not. Q is for damage, W is for sustain and cc, E is for utility. It's a choice every time you ult. I'm sure you can get by just picking Q every single time, but know that you're not a good karma player if you do that. You're wasting her potential. \n\n- And finally, squishy and mana hungry. Have you ever played Karma? This one statement makes me think that you haven't. She's got a massive shield that gives ms, a Q that slows aoe, a W that snares and heals her for 40% of her health, base. Not only that, but her core items are liandrys and rylais. She's definitely not as squishy as she seems. As for mana costs, I get by building only morellos just fine.

Microsoft Word tells me it&rsquo;s over 1500 words long**\n\nLet me preface this by saying Rito is way too busy doing marksmen and AD item changes to make any serious changes to other champions right now; however that doesn&#039;t mean we can&#039;t get the ball rolling. Also, while I&rsquo;ve done some research into old Karma (a champion released far beyond her time), all of my firsthand experience is on &ldquo;relaunch&rdquo; Karma. Still though, here are my thoughts on bringing Karma up to scratch, combining the new and old to make one cohesive kit. Please note that it would be absolutely resource intensive to make all the changes I&rsquo;m proposing below at once, I just want to open up some good old-fashioned discussion.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/clMEu39Iydc\n**Here&rsquo;s the release Karma champion spotlight, watching it could help give you some context, but I&rsquo;ve done my best to summarize old and current Karma below.**\n\n**TL;DR/DW I&rsquo;ve only played post rework Karma so I don&rsquo;t have first-hand experience with pre-rework karma**\n\nPassive &ldquo;Gathering Fire&rdquo; reduces the cooldown on &ldquo;R-Mantra&rdquo;. Her old passive would increase her AP by an amount based on her missing health. While her new passive is not especially exciting, her old passive was just a big ball of stats (a passive style I&rsquo;m not a fan of). Beyond that I feel that the spirit of that power (a heal that increases based on missing health) is somewhat preserved through the Mantra-W, a power I want to see increased.\n\n**TL;DR The passive is pretty okay in my opinion, we just need to touch up some other areas so that Mantra actually feels powerful.**\n\nQ-_Inner Flame_ and _Heavenly Wave_. Karma&rsquo;s old Q was a conic AOE spell, with the Mantra Q also healing allies in the cone. Some of Rito&rsquo;s older champions really enjoyed small AOE heals _(Ezreal&rsquo;s W used to heal allies too)_. While I like the mechanics of a cone spell, at this point in time changing her Q back to a cone would take way too many resources (art, sound effects, yeesh) and I personally like the longer range missile. **At any rate, this is a nice spell that could maybe use a better AP ratio, or more damage from the first hit of its Mantra version.** I&rsquo;m also partial to a version of Mantra where each rank in your ultimate increases the power of your empowered spells in a non-numbers fashion. **Specifically each rank of R should increase the explosion radius of Q and its secondary detonation field, OR decrease the delay before Q explodes.** Beyond that, my suggestion is to move the slow down/speed up effects from Q and E back onto W so we should remove the slow from Q.\n\n**TL;DR Changing Q to a cone may take too many resources to realistically pull off, this spell could possibly use more damage. Also move the slow back to W **\n\nR- _Mantra_. The release Karma Mantra didn&rsquo;t level up and Karma&rsquo;s QWE had 6 ranks like Jayce&rsquo;s current ultimate and skills. It also held 2 charges instead of 1. I think it was way ahead of its time when it came out, and it&rsquo;s one spell that I think should be dialed back towards its original style a bit.\n\n1.\tI think we should keep the cooldown at 45 at rank 1, reduce it&rsquo;s cooldown to something like 30 at rank 2, and instead of lowering the cooldown we should add a charge at ranks 3 and 4. This would make the late game Karma actually useful with a cycle through Mantra Q, Mantra W, and Mantra E. \n2.\tIf we made Karma&rsquo;s skill set up similar to Jayce&rsquo;s setup we could tie the power up bonuses to ranking the basic skills up instead of the ultimate. I think we&rsquo;d get a negative trade-off with this set up, unless we mega-boosted all the mantra effects.\n3.\t**Each rank of R-Mantra (beyond the free one at level 1) increases the effective power of the Mantra version of the spells. Each rank increases Q&rsquo;s explosion radius range OR decreases the secondary explosion delay, increases W&rsquo;s leash range, and increases E&rsquo;s burst range. That also ties into the offensive version of her &ldquo;E&rdquo; that I have proposed below.**\n4.\tCasting R could also cast the Mantra&rsquo;d version of the spells on their own cooldown (think Rengar&rsquo;s ferocity enhanced spells).\n\n**TL;DR A bunch of functional changes but ultimately the same spell. Add a charge system back to Mantra&rsquo;s level 11/16 level ups. I propose an idea where we increase Mantra&rsquo;s &ldquo;effectiveness&rdquo; without increasing raw numbers&rdquo;**\n\nE-_Inspire/Defiance and Soul Shield_. This spell didn&rsquo;t change a lot from release to relaunch. The movement speed bonus was new, but functionally very little changed until they got rid of Defiance&rsquo;s AOE damage in [patch 5.10](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-510-notes). Moreover, losing the damage on her shield shoved her poor mage/poor support kit further into the niche of &ldquo;mage that doesn&rsquo;t do any damage&rdquo; and &ldquo;support that nobody wants to play&rdquo;. **I like the AOE shield, and I completely agree that an AOE shield shouldn&rsquo;t have AOE damage attached to it**. So here comes one of my favorite Riot sayings: **Meaningful Choices**. Do you want to shield your team mates for this fight? Or do you want to explode your enemies?\n\n1.

It does single target damage but can be Mantra&rsquo;d to do AOE damage. **_Meaningful choices:_ do I want to hurt my foes or shield my allies?

With the Mantra bringing a &ldquo;non-numbers&rdquo; buff to empowered spells, the AOE &ldquo;burst zone&rdquo; should have a bigger radius for both the defensive shield and offensive damage zones.\n\n**TL;DR Make E capable of targeting/damaging enemies. Mantra E used offensively damages enemies in a burst, while Mantra E used on allies is still a shield, but no movespeed. This gives the spell &ldquo;Meaningful choices&rdquo;.**\n\nW-_Focused Resolve/Renewal_ and _Spirit Bond_. **This is a spell that I think should be reverted mostly to its old functionality. **A spell way ahead of its time: Karma creates a tether between herself and another unit (or ward). Any **&ldquo;allied anchors&rdquo;** are sped up and any **&ldquo;enemy anchors&rdquo;** are slowed down. The tether also damages and slows any enemies hit by the beam, while speeding up allies. The Mantra&rsquo;d version doubles the speed up and slow down on allies and enemies, while rooting the primary target (if it&rsquo;s an enemy).  The leash lasts for 5 seconds.\nI **love** the original incarnation of this spell and its potential application in a teamfight. It, like most of Karma&rsquo;s old spells, was considered far too confusing to keep around. I agree with that assessment: Karma was confusing and incredibly far ahead of her time in a lot of the mechanics she employed. However, the atmosphere has changed significantly. Nowadays we have champions like Bard, who play with very unique spells with very unique rules. We have champions that have 2 part passives or an active and a passive component on spells. I believe that Karma was too confusing on release, due to how new the game was and how different her mechanics were; but I no longer believe that is the case. \n\n1.\tMantra-W leash range increases with ranks in R\n2.\tAdd a heal that scales with target&rsquo;s missing health to this rehashed Spirit Bond. Have the heal be a heal over time that affects all friendly targets between Karma and her &ldquo;anchor&rdquo;. **The missing health scaling on the heal is important as it is the only &ldquo;spiritual preservation&rdquo; of old Karma&rsquo;s passive**. This would also enable her to be a good team-fighter and a better support. Leash a front line ally (or enemy) and move to the back of the pack to try to heal and speed up your front liners. Or tether it to a juggernaut and help each other slow down and engage a team (Karma would probably die in this scenario, but it could be a worthwhile tradeoff if the slows are strong enough). \n3.\tMove the root from something that happens all the time to something that only happens when you use the Mantra-W; and only on the primary target. The doubled speed boost/slow still occurs to all enemies affected by the beam. \n\n**TL;DR Revert this spell most of the way back to its release functionality as the game&rsquo;s landscape has changed significantly since release. The tether heals friendly units based on their missing health. The tether is something Karma&rsquo;s allies will love and Karma&rsquo;s enemies will strive to avoid.**\n\n\n\nI hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed reading my Karma re-rework suggestions. I believe she is in a very poor place right now and I think we can fix that. I believe we should move the slow/speed up from Q and E to W, making that the ultimate &ldquo;support karma&rdquo; spell. Multiple charges on Mantra will give Karma some of that late game effectiveness that she sorely lacks right now, while making a damaging version of E will both help Karma&rsquo;s passive and give Karma a meaningful choice beyond &ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;re fighting, I guess I should shield now?&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2015-11-10T13:46:47.625+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I suggest to make a post out of this?","replies":[{"poster":"IGotScuttleCrabs","date":"2015-11-10T17:13:29.525+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just started reading.

My build is typically {{item:3151}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3157}} and runes/masteries takes me to 40% cdr.  \n\nAdding any more damage to this will one shot any immobile squishy that can't get away from the second explosion. And if she roots first, you got yourself a kill. \n\nNow IF I were to change this spell, I'd agree on the quicker second blast as Mantra ranks up. But overall I think Q is fine. It's her main damage skill and does it VERY WELL.  \n\nI agree with your comment on bringing her old W somewhat back. I'd love to be able to tether an ally to heal them someway.

Change passive to something that promotes her to use something other than Mantra Q 75% of the time. \n\nSpells now work with each other depending on how you use them. (Think Syndra smacking her spheres to extend range on stun. Or Jayce Q through his gate.)\n\nUsing RQ on a tethered enemy causes root to go immediately. \nUsing RW with shield on yourself gives bonus heal. Shield on ally splits HP between you. \nJust 2 examples but you get the idea.","replies":[{"poster":"AvatarRoku22","date":"2015-11-10T19:20:39.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">  It's her main damage skill and does it VERY WELL.\n\nits her ONLY damage skill so it better do very well","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"koager","date":"2015-11-10T18:14:54.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do miss her old W tether to help speed up allies or just run around and trying to lariat people with it.

And it was a huge issue to play against her  because of it.  That is why i would love to see her pre rework and post rework fused.  Imagine aura's that provide constant buffs but have set time limits to them (even with bonus time added per ally tagged).  Higher range then her current aura's but not that 1000 range \"LOL you can't ever touch me\" BS that she use to have.\n\nEach ability has a very clear and powerful skill, Q gives your team a few seconds to just beat on the enemy team super hard.  W can be used to soften the blow of a team fight OR heal up after a bad bit of damage (thinking either an aura that negates a % of damage or a mini Janna ult that pulses out healing every second or so).  E could give flat movement speed bonuses for a more prolonged period of time, no perma +20 MS, but also no more 14% bonus movement speed for 1.5 seconds on a 12 second base cooldown.  The auras fall off instantly if Sona is stunned/silenced/ or switches spells.\n\nIt would likely mean an increase in her cooldowns.  But i know i would gladly trade a chunk of my personal offensive power & \"LCS Big play\" one time use large buffs on super short duration, for some legit aura usage and power windows.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IAMS4T4N","date":"2015-11-10T13:51:45.917+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"stop trying to get sona superbuffed","replies":[{"poster":"only zhule","date":"2015-11-11T01:06:32.147+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IAMS4T4N,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=B4tHvemI,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2015-11-10T13:51:45.917+0000)\n>\n> stop trying to get sona superbuffed\n\n\nWhat super buffs?

I've played all 4 of these champions post-rework, but only Mordekaiser pre-rework. I'm expecting some downvotes, but here's my perspective:\n\nKarma is, in her current state, both healthy and fun to play. Her main problem is that she occupies a very similar niche to Lulu, who can do most of what Karma does better, which is why Karma has such a low play rate (0.3% from the site I'm looking at). I think some minor adjustments are definitely necessary to give more distinct reasons to play her, as well as changes to help her solo laning. I don't think a flat-out revert of her rework is the answer, though. Old Karma's duality-themed kit seems pretty interesting, but Karma's new kit doesn't have enough problems to warrant removing it entirely. A few months back, I saw a boards discussion about re-releasing an updated version of Old Karma as a new champion, which I think would make the greatest number of people happy, but I have doubts about whether Riot would realistically consider this.\n\nSona is, in her current state, a little bit weak. I feel like she could use some _slight _ numbers buffs, but shouldn't be overbuffed to the point she becomes broken, because if that happens Riot will then gut her. From where I am in lower Elo, Sona is definitely a viable pick. Her main problem lies in the fact that her kit is easy with very little counterplay. If she gets too much of a numbers buff for low Elo, she'd become overpowering in high Elo. This would not be changed by reverting her rework. I have no strong feelings one way or another for temporary vs. permanent aura for her skills, but I feel like the temporary aura is easier for Riot to balance and thus will probably stay as is.\n\nNow, this is where my level of experience with these champions goes down.\n\nI don't feel like I can say much about Cass, considering that I've played her maybe 3 times total, all post-rework. What is indisputable is that she has a low play rate and an even lower win rate, and she desperately needs changes. I'll leave it to the Cass mains to say what kinds of changes they'd like to see for her.\n\nIn my opinion, Mordekaiser does need to be reverted. Post-rework, his solo lane is nearly unplayable, he's broken, and he's unfun to play against. He had problems pre-rework, but now he's worse. I'm sure everyone saw his pick/ban rate at Worlds, and anyone who visits the boards with any regularity has seen the Mordekaiser mains begging Riot to fix him. What Mordekaiser needs is for his rework to be reverted and for Riot to work with his mains to make a better one.\n\nTL;DR: Karma and Sona are alright, Cass and Mord have serious issues.","replies":[{"poster":"only zhule","date":"2015-11-11T01:02:47.527+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to disagree with you on Sona.  She has a lot of potential to be fine.  But when you have other champions who do her job better 95% of the time, she stops being viable.  Why play a champion X when you can play champion Y who does all the same stuff but better.\n\nI honestly think it would be pretty easy to fix her.  make the aura's about 50% bigger (525 is not a huge range but its enough you can do your job without super pile ups/ running around like a headless chicken), Make the bonuses last longer.  A damage boost that lasts 4 seconds is not unheard of, a shield lasting 3 seconds isn't crazy.  So why is Sona expected to work when her abilities last such short periods of time?  Lower the base mana cost of her heal, but raise the amount per level.  a heal should never cost more then the amount healed.  And finally make her freaking faster.  You can not have a champion be super fragile, lack a gap closer, and only have their ultimate as a means to engage/disengage.\n\nPeople claim she lacks counter play.  I don't see it.  It's basically like complaining that {{champion:51}} does too much damage because you let her keep landing Q's and auto attacks on you without fighting back.  Sona really doesn't do that much damage until you manage to build a ton of bonus AP and artifical enhancers like {{item:3100}} .  Even when she lands a full combo it's not all that impressive when you consider that she's not doing 50% or more of your health, she can't do it again quickly without running out of mana SUPER quick, and if you trade even a bit Sona is going to lose (no mana and a moderate damage taken will drive her out of lane and you are still rocking 35% or more of your total health.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rico Nasty","date":"2015-11-10T21:47:40.688+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"People need to stop complaining about Karma, she's just fine, I main her for god's sake..","replies":[]},{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2015-11-10T14:46:25.943+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a fairly recent Karma main and although I know she CAN be strong, her kit feels very unreliable compared to other champs.
