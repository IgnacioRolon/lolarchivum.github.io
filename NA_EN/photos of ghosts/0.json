Freezes until I'm forced to restart every time I use something intense (LoL, WoW, even YouTube sometimes)\n2. Chkdsk used to stop in its tracks and not finish, last time tho chkdsk /f worked to the end but only lasted 10 minutes.\n3. Before this mess, I already had started having connection issues that other devices didn't have.\n4. Avast!+Malwarebytes+CCleaner can't find shit (except my router having issues)\n5. Some programs need several clicks to start, or start one process per click...\n6. The CD unit does its clicky on startup thing several minutes later than it used to.\n7. Ctrl+alt+del/ctrl+shift+esc very rarely work, never during freezes. Twice I found myself in front of a different UI than normal for the task manager\n8. When I managed to get my Task Manager out, the resource consumption was average at worst.\n9. It's winter so it can't be heat.\n10. I already had to throw away two hard disks last summer, my original one and the brand new, freshly installed replacement.\n11. I have about 400 free GB on my disk.\n\nThis sounds like malware, but the holy trinity can't find any irregularities...","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-19T02:24:37.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're having issues outside of League, it definitely sounds like a bigger issue such as a corrupt OS or hardware failure.
