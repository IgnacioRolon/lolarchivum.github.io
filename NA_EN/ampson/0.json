Through development and beta, the audio team was very happy with where the musical themes for TFT landed, which mainly consisted of synthesized musical instruments. In our effort to make the music as high quality and polished as possible, we decided to go into the studio to live record extremely talented musicians to capture real human performances of the music for TFT.\r\n\r\nAs a quick primer into the adaptive music system in TFT, the music will change based on what phase of the game you're in. For instance, during shopping phase the music is calmer and less busy, but as battle phase starts the music transitions into a more energetic combat driven style. There are also 3 different “chapters” of music: the first chapter goes from the beginning of the game to when first player is knocked out. The second is from that point until there are only 3 players left. Then the final chapter brings us home.\r\n\r\nWe’re still ironing out some bugs so please bear with us and let us know if you notice any weird things like volume spikes or musical stems playing over each other. We hope the new music makes your TFT games that much better!","replies":[{"poster":"Ampson","date":"2019-09-06T00:40:09.535+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ha, that's a great analogy!\n\nWe definitely wanted a game of TFT to have an emotional arc. So the first Act is pretty relaxed and exciting. The second Act adds a little bit of conflict and drama. Finally, the third Act is epic with a sense of drive to a resolution. It was really awesome working on this system with Kole, the composer for TFT. I'm sure he can go into much more details. :)\n\nWe share your excitement in experiencing it with y'all soon!","replies":[{"poster":"Larriet","date":"2019-09-06T21:54:43.958+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Music is one of my favorite parts of the games I play, and League doesn't really have a lot of in-game music; champ select is really the only time the music has pathos.  So I'm pumped to read that!  I'd definitely like to hear more about it!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zemasu","date":"2019-09-06T17:11:57.627+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ampson, to give more feel to the game i would suggest putting more quotes from champions during/after/before a fight, maybe not random quotes like now, but appropriate for the moment","replies":[{"poster":"SentinelOfLight","date":"2019-09-07T07:01:52.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually fighting a specific champion and have yours yell something at them would be cool, not just random quote that may or may not play when you  aa them but while fighting them in general","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JoanneNatt","date":"2019-09-06T16:16:25.730+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Where was this energy with Nexus Blitz?

It reminds me of something by Akira Ifukube.  Where the tempo is energetic and exciting, but the melody/chord progression sounds subdued, making it feel dramatic and effortless, like a strong wind (hope I don't sound weird using an analogy like that).\nAdaptive music is really cool when it's used to make an experience feel \"complete\", so having the three \"chapters\" really excites me.  It helps frame the whole game as a singular, complete drama.  Kind of like the opening/ending credits of a film, or the title screen of other video games, or even just the act of opening up physical media.\n\nI'm SUPER excited to hear the whole thing!","replies":[]}]}
