I was thinking instead of having 5 item suggestions in his Forge Menu, the left most button could be a icon that opens the shop, then have 4 item suggestions to the right of that. This would also make it so you don't have to pan away from where Ornn is on the map to open the shop. \r\n\r\nIt took me a while to realize I could forge items besides the 5 suggested ones in his Forge Menu. A shop button would explain this to new Ornn players, AND be a convenience/help not having to pan away from where you are just to open the shop.","replies":[{"poster":"Ehhhh","date":"2020-01-06T18:16:45.418+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"You mean like 'P' which already opens the shop and then has all the forge items?","replies":[{"poster":"Klythor","date":"2020-01-06T22:01:29.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"not everyone knows every single hotkey","replies":[{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2020-01-06T22:33:45.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, it seems pretty standard to learn hotkeys in games you're playing","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2020-01-08T14:26:16.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really, no.

And when they're handed a solution to the issue they're trying to resolve, they say \"thank you\" instead of getting snippy and trying to sound proud of their ignorance.","replies":[{"poster":"Klythor","date":"2020-01-06T23:54:41.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The point is to make the interface intuitive/cleaner for new players, learning hotkeys is not a solution let alone one to be thanked for....why even have a interface at all?

How do you even get those I've never seen one? You missed the point again.\n\nPersonal quests are available in Intro co-op vs AI, which is where new players are expected to go after the tutorial. Players who lack the information provided by those quests should probably go back and check them out.\n\nYour first point was that there should be a way to open the shop without panning the camera to it and clicking on it. There already is such a way, so that point is moot. Your second point was that players shouldn't be expected to go through the list of hotkeys to find important ones like the shop. New players are explicitly given that hotkey along with a few others, so that point is moot as well. Do you have any additional points to make?","replies":[{"poster":"Klythor","date":"2020-01-08T05:08:38.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"hmm, if that's what you got out of the post I'll try to explain it again so anyone could understand.

The existing shop hotkey is perfectly fine (and you can even change it to something more convenient if you want - you did know you can reassign hotkeys, right?). \"New players\" have probably played intro co-op and thus would already know how to quickly shop. The game isn't designed around players who pride themselves on knowing less about the game than a new player would.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2020-01-06T20:01:21.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What I was gonna say lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2020-01-08T14:24:26.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So that's an interesting suggestion.
