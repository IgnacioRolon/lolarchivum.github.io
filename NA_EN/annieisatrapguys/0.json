In fact, he explicitly said that there was no other choice but to give you the punishment you received.\n\n The punishment ladder is as follows: 10 game chat restriction > 25 game chat restriction > 14 day gameplay ban > permanent ban. As you repeatedly break rules, your account is placed on thinner and thinner ice meaning it requires less and less evidence to receive punishments. Also I would still like to see the chat logs because I still feel like you didn't just say \"idiot\" and cop a 14 day ban. It's possible but I doubt it.\n\n So yeah, unfortunately this punishment was justified as you've already had 2 punishments for toxicity and a warning on your reform card that said \"Continued behavior could result in more chat restrictions or even account suspensions.\"","replies":[{"poster":"AnnieIsATrapGuys","date":"2019-01-26T22:26:53.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"If you don't understand the exchange that's fine.

And your current punishment is due to recent behavior along with your previous record.\n\nIf you've recently had a 25-chat restriction and do something that would hand you a punishment, you get a 14-day ban.

While what the person you're replying to said is true, there are a few exceptions that can cause you to jump straight to a 14 day ban without any prior punishments: \n\n* You were banned for a gameplay related offense. Whether it was intentionally feeding, griefing, trolling, etc., the first punishment for all gameplay related offenses is a 14 day ban. This is because chat restrictions wouldn't make sense to give to these players since the problem is not in chat.\n\n \n* You used certain zero-tolerance phrases in chat. Things like racial slurs or death threats/encouraging suicide skip over the chat restrictions and jump straight to a 14 day ban because Riot feels you shouldn't need to be told that these things are not okay to say in chat, thus the harsher punishment.\n\nIf neither of these applies to you, then I would recommend contacting Player Support and try to get an answer from them as to why you received the escalated punishment.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AnnieIsATrapGuys","date":"2019-01-26T22:20:49.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Lol okay ill underline it","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2019-01-26T22:15:18.430+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Haven't seen your chat logs and don't know your punishment history.","replies":[{"poster":"AnnieIsATrapGuys","date":"2019-01-26T22:16:46.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Would have posted them but didn't want to spam","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2019-01-26T22:36:55.784+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not spam.\n\nAnd, as I suspected, you had a 25-game chat restriction before.

You broke some rules to get punished. As the Rioter answered to you, you were already previously warned about your behavior with a 10 and 25-game chat restrictions, and the next punishment from those is a 14-day ban. That's why you got a 14-day ban instead of a chat restriction, since the system saw that you were already issued chat bans 2 times and yet you haven't improved your behavior enough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vesarixx","date":"2019-01-26T23:30:15.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I'm aware most punishments are not the result of a single game unless there is something that stands out as particularly offensive.

From the screenshot you posted there is nothing from the support person stating that you should \"post on the boards to draw awareness\" and the claim that they agree with you about the ban being unjustified doesn't seem to be the case either, since the line you are referring to does not say that the punishment \"should\" have been less severe, but that it would have if you didn't have the prior offenses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Modi","date":"2019-01-26T22:33:07.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> He said I can post on the board to help bring awareness to a faulty ban system and maybe reach out to Devs.\n\nYeah, I stopped believing what you wrote as soon as I read this.
