She&#039;s in a really good spot right now, with the only tweaking I&#039;d give her being actual buffs, but meh.\n\nYasuo gets bursted down pretty well. If your team has two forms of CC he&#039;s probably dead. Pantheon... heck even Darius will just shut him down. I will not deny that conqueror plus infinity edge is really strong though. Yasuo isn&#039;t the main abuser of this AD burst however. The worst offender of this is Fiora, Master Yi, and Tryndamere coming in close behind. Yasuo's kit as a whole is fine, not to mention interesting.\n\nZoe is not a problem. Ignite is a problem. I&#039;m assuming everyone&#039;s seen the wukong level 2 kill with ignite electrocute proc? Rune damage combined with ignite procking electrocute is the problem. I play Zoe with klepto and she&#039;s quite healthy. It&#039;s nothing like Nidalee. She has to castbackwards, it&#039;s her ONLY reliable damaging ability, Nidalee has Pounce, E, Q, and the CC setup can be blocked by minions. The way I see it, a lot of players just don&#039;t respect her damage, so they don&#039;t play around their minions and when they get caught, suffer for it. Not only that but she&#039;s weak as fuck to ganks.\n\nA lot of the complaints I&#039;m seeing over and over again on these champs I&#039;d think wouldn&#039;t be as severe if they just played the champs and saw their weaknesses. \n\nYasuo for instance has a ton of weaknesses that&#039;s not just CC. He has a very unreliable CC ability. His knockup only starts once he hits his Q twice before. He&#039;s also melee. You&#039;re supposed to harass him. If he&#039;s dodging your abilities via E, which DOES have a cooldown between dashes, then you&#039;re playing worse than he is and he deserves to kill you. W is on a 20 second cooldown rank 1 and is maxed last. He doesn&#039;t build CDR... He also has no innate sustain. So many weaknesses... so many. Since he has to attack minions to get Tornado he pushes hard inadvertently so he&#039;s weak to ganks. He can&#039;t E to ally minions. So many weaknesses... so many. His core items are zeal items and are quite expensive so his powerspike comes at a decent point in the game. AP casters are generally stronger after first back then he is by QUITE a lot. His first back is just crit chance and attack speed. Godamn he has weaknesses. If he&#039;s kicking your ass, plz understand that the yasuo is legit an objectively better player than you.\n\nThat&#039;s just Yasuo. Zoe... whoo boy Zoe... Only one reliable damaging ability. Relatively high mana costs with no passive way to regen mana. Hyper telegraphed CC spell that will not work if you are behind a minion. Needs to pick up summs from minions so she gives you an opportunity to harass her whenever she wants to make her W actually do anything. If the W she gets is not a damaging ability it will contribute nothing to her damage as the orbs and movement speed boost is barely enough to kill a caster minion. \n\nSo like for real. Plz... just play them for yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2018-08-07T20:54:21.050+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"I try (mostly because I'm the sole narrative writer for the skins team) to get play on every champion, but dip into the pool of more infamous characters when I'm thinking about special interactions in lane. They tend to appear in games more, and a lot of people have very strong opinions about them -- so those lines will be heard more frequently and get more laughs, as far as special interactions go (mostly I aim for lore and lane matchups). But in order to _really_ insult a character, you have to know them. Here's what I've anecdotally found as a guy better at tank supports and top lane mages:\n\n**Zoe:** I cannot for the life of my aim her god damn skillshot. I understand how her kit works, I see how it _could_ be super oppressive, but everyone I play against dodges the bubble and I'm left with an OK-damage nightmare projectile that controls like Master of the Flying Guillotine. Love the hole from The Yellow Submarine, though, that's kinda fun. I picked up this Flash, neat, guess I'll burn it and my second flash to escape and _now I am dead._ Why are people so afraid of this rainbow haired child blogger. Why am I so angry.\n\n**Zed:** I have never been good at playing Zed, and this was established once more to me when he got spam-selected in a one for all and I had to die a billion times to a team of Extremely Master Yis. The sheer skill it takes to not bop yourself like a dumb dumb and keep all your positioning in order is crazy, so like Zoe, while I don't appreciate the experience of dueling a good Zed I do understand the level of skill it takes to get him right.\n\n**Yasuo:** It took five games for me to figure out how to shoot tornadoes and besides that I know one of his voice lines is \"Make it quick,\" like he's talking to me, Jared, and I've bothered him in the middle of a pleasant afternoon. Well screw you, Yasuo. At least I'm not an alcoholic with spike shoulder.\n\n**Ivern:** I have played two games on Ivern and I can tell just by how his kit kind of, sort of worked that he is completely busted. Just unequivocally _busted_ good. In the right hands Ivern could be a _monster_, but I don't think many people have figured him out quite yet. Also, Jesus, those cooldowns. I'm a HUGE TREE with WEIRD FEET and I'm in this BUSH I MADE throwing FLOWERS, somebody HELP ME.\n\n**Akali:** Man, this donut is huge. I love this smokey donut. It's kind of like a vape shop where I stab you. I hope my opponent is dead by the time the donut ends- oh. Oh no.\n\n**Ahri:** Ahri is extremely easily countered because she has to get in _relatively_ close to secure solo kills. Sure, she can poke you a little, and you can choose to stay in lane, and maybe your friends come down from the river because you stayed in lane, and I'm way too far out. Stop pinging me. I know I'm dead. Please stop pinging.\n\n**Quinn:** Okay, so I shoot whoever the bird pecks? And I bounce off them like Puck from the Canadian X-Men? Sweet. He had Puck powers. I think one of the other guys was a Sasquatch. Oh holy wow this damage is high. I hope my trend of messing up my itemization won't _totally cripple_ my ability to contribute in _any meaningful way._ Nope, wait, it did.","replies":[{"poster":"grarrrg","date":"2018-08-07T21:19:33.702+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I only regret, that I have but one upvote to give for this post.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-08-07T09:08:14.022+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":8,"body":"LOL NO.

One having a universal stun that cannot be blocked cause if it doesn't hit it doesn't get used up, attached to 2 really powerful nukes. Not to mention an ult that can annihilate an entire team, and continues to deal a lot of damage even after she dies. \n\nAnd lets not forget about the other guy, 2 point and click powerful CC abilities. A silence that bounces around and can hit up to what, 6-8 targets. Along with a fear that he has to do nothing but click to use, and a move that sucks health faster than you can deal, because you cant attack cause your feared and silenced. And then there's his ult, a giant aoe that does so much dmg and if he ults just one person they are almost for sure dead cause you can't flash or move if he hits his fear and silence, and oh wait he can't miss those, hmmm.\n\nI'm not saying Yasuo is perfect but just because he is hated please don't try to compare him to these two shit champs, their kits are horrendous and need work. There's a lot that goes into being decent on Yas, if you let one walk up to you without there being a minion wave and he kills you, unless hes super fucking fed, or you had no health, that's on you. It took me a decent bit of time to get to the point I'm at with Yasuo, and hate me if you want, but I can tell a good yas from a bad one, and there is a difference. I wouldn't mind if Riot made it a bit harder for new yas players to run at people like everyone thinks he can, but the fact is, there's a lot to yas and boiling him down to a piece of shit champion because his strengths usually give him an advantage in this meta (low cc, just raw dmg) don't blame the champ. Every champ has a game where they excel because there's no champ on the other team that counter them.

Just because you dont know how the champ works or how to play against it doesnt mean that it is broken, thats on you","replies":[{"poster":"Somber Rites","date":"2018-08-07T19:06:24.602+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just because you know how the champion is played doesn't make them any less aids to fight.\n\nI know all the ins and outs of Singed and Teemo, but that doesn't magically make them fun to fight.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Emerald Fang","date":"2018-08-07T20:42:11.617+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean I love Zoe (even though I think she's not an issue).\n\nAkali is so weak right now and she definitely isn't the problem.\n\nYasuo is also weak and he has to powerfarm for 20 minutes, or snowball HARD to do well.\n\nElectrocute and ignite are the problems. Electrocute does undeniable amounts of damage early-game. PBE nerfs aren't going to do much IMO, it's just going to make assassin pressure worse because the cooldown is halved and the damage isn't even close to being halved, and assassins already overkill so mages are being pushed out of mid lane a lot harder.\n\nChampions like Talon, who can miss both W hits and still deal 70% of your health with one Q+auto+auto+electocute, are the problem.\nChampions like Quinn, who are super duper frustrating to play against and make you powerless, are the problem.\nChampions like Nocturne, who can ult you with tether + spellshield so you're completely powerless and can't do anything.\n\nIgnite is just too useful right now, the heal reduction is really nice and prevents you from avoiding ignite at all because you can't recover from it.
