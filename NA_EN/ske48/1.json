Let's check for that really quick since it's so simple, and that will decide how we should go about fixing your ping. \n\nHit up our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) and toss in some game logs where you had ping spikes. Take a screenshot of what the image it gives you using something like Gyazo and post it here for us to go over together!","replies":[{"poster":"SKE48","date":"2017-06-10T20:41:03.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://gyazo.com/026667dc376cbaa8718e08e1bad3c1db.png\n\nYeah.. packet loss for sure lol.\nMy normal ping is around 50.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-10T21:02:36.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eep!
