It&#039;s quite strange to be playing with the Omega Squad skin and hearing a happy &quot;hut, two, three, four&quot; when moving. It&#039;s not a serious game changing bug, but it&#039;s quite annoying when your trying to play as a deranged spec ops Teemo.{{champion:17}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-22T21:56:20.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey MagicFungiLord! \n\nThanks so much for the report! We'll take a listen and see what's going on here! (Not sure why you'd want to hear Teemo in the first place, though. <3) Seriously, though, we'll check this out! :D","replies":[]}]}
