I got in the game, got my champ, and got into the game. It was laning phase, and I was wrecking my lane opponent as Darius. One of my family members needed my ethernet cable and I decided \"hey I am ahead so it should be OK if i dc for just a minute\". So I disconnected the cable and had wireless internet access. I didnt leave the game or anything. My game wouldn't reconnect me so I left and tried to come back. Still would not connect. I eventually gave up after numerous tries, and a few minutes later the game ended because I was the only lane winning at 4-0, while my bot lane and mid were both down 0-2. The game was over because my team surrendered due to my disconnection. I got low priority queue as a result. I'm starting to question this system. The same thing happened on my other account; my router restarted one unfortunate day and the game ended. As a result, well you guessed it, I got low priority. What is this? Someone help me please.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-09T02:39:54.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Low-priority queues are added to an account as a result of a **recent and consistent trend of disconnecting**.
