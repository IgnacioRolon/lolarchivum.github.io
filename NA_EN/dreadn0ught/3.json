I don&#039;t have any IRL friends who follow league esports so I&#039;m glad I have u guys lol)\r\n\r\nNot even going to watch half these matches. But I&#039;m still curious about the outcome.\r\n\r\nI call it the boring group because there is no doubt EDG is going to win at least 2 of their games. AHQ and H2K are not as good as we would hope them to be, so plenty of sloppy, chaotic games coming ahead I think. And I wouldn&#039;t even be surprised if INTZ pulled an Albus on everyone and made it out of groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far, 1 KR and 1 IWC teams are set for the knockouts.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, it&#039;ll probably look a little like this:\r\n\r\n out of 8 teams in knockout, we are going to have\r\n\r\n 1 IWC (ANX)\r\n 2 KR (SKT &amp; ROX)\r\n 2 NA (C9 &amp; TSM)\r\n 2 LPL (RNG &amp; EDG)\r\n 1 LMS (AHQ)\r\n\r\nAs much as I love INTZ and their early upset, odds are against them (again, I could wrong, we all know that now), FW are dunso, SKT won&#039;t let them win again, and Cloud9 is pulling out 2 wins at least in my opinion. TSM and RNG are each going to beat SSG, and even if TSM is unsucessful at that, they are pulling a win from Splyce. Anything goes in that group. Most likely going to be a tie breaker for 2nd place. \r\n\r\nANX are known now, and they will be studied by other team&#039;s analysts. Their strats are not impossible to counter or adapt to. They are an impressive team, but they won&#039;t leave the knockout stage in my opinion. But that is a debate for next week I guess.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-10-07T21:56:28.001+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not even sure TSM will make it out tbh, SSG/TSM/RNG there's no telling what will happen there","replies":[{"poster":"DREADN0UGHT","date":"2016-10-08T00:04:09.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it could be the case. But I just can't stop hoping for a strong TSM to come into play tomorow. We need TSM to make it for the spirit of NA to not die for another year. Having 2 good teams make it into Knockout and further would give even more hope for next year's worlds. If they fall in groups tomorow, it'll just kill them.","replies":[{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2016-10-08T00:18:33.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the real and possibly the last year that NA will ever be this Strong and if they can't get out of Groups I have 0 reason to think NA will ever make it out.  I know 2014 TSM and C9 made it out of groups but Looking at the TSM group SK Gaming had Svenskeren banned for 3 games and really a downhill TPA team.  Cloud 9 needed a Tie-breaker just to make it out of groups in 2014.  \n  TSM Idk if I just over hyped them but they have hints of greatness but overall I look at the possible teams that could also make it out of Groups ( ROX-SKT-EDG-RNG) it doesn't look good for TSM as their possibly going to face either ROX Tigers or EDG if they don't get the 1st place in their group.

Yes I know IWC Albus got out of Group A and upsets do happen but look at the Group A it was exciting with the teams in the group. \n  Group B just looks like a EDG W W W with 3 lower tier teams in it.  \n\nX  EDG vs INTZ.  EDG \"should\" win this just like ROX vs CLG and ANX they wont lose again to this team and should be a 27 min game. \nX  AHQ vs H2K.  Coin flip and that is who will win.  I flipped and it said H2K. 35 min game. \nX  H2K vs EDG.  Again EDG shouldn't lose another game today and while H2K looks \"ok\" at the start of games they are gOD awful after 10 mins.  EDG wins 33 min game. \nX  AHQ vs INTZ.  AHQ looks to good to lose to INTZ, while they have Revolta I just dont' see them winning against AHQ they always seem to make Group stages harder on themselves then it should be.  Tie Breaker in 2014 and 2015 against EDG and C9. AHQ wins 29 min game. \nX  H2K vs INTZ.  H2K will put out a win against INTZ but it shouldn't be easy, I'm expecting a 37-40 min game. \nX  EDG vs AHQ.  EDG will most likely get 24 kills on AHQ in a 34 min game. \n\nEDG 5-1   AHQ 3-3  H2K 3-3  INTZ 1-5.  \n\nAHQ vs H2K ( TIE BREAKER) Like I said earlier AHQ is always in a Tie-Breaker, but I see them advancing after a 45 min game with them being the 2nd seed and EDG the 1st.","replies":[{"poster":"DREADN0UGHT","date":"2016-10-08T00:02:09.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=III BAKURYU III ,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=GA7K2RHc,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-10-07T22:30:32.555+0000)\n>\n\n> \n> EDG 5-1   AHQ 3-3  H2K 3-3  INTZ 1-5.  \n> \n\n\nThat is pretty much what I was thinking myself.","replies":[]}]}]}
