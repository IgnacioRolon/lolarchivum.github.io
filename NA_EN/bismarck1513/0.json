It's counting both how much is downloaded AND how much is being changed on the disk. The actual patch size is around 1-2 GB, but there are about 6-7 GB of content changes happening in the game files, hence the reported 9 GB size. Sorry this is confusing. We're going to take a look at it.\n\n**TL;DR:** Actual patch size is only 1-2 GB.","replies":[{"poster":"aezeldafan","date":"2018-03-08T05:42:52.566+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure why, but my bro is having the problem that even after installing the update, it says there is a problem with the installation. \nwtf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maaz1001","date":"2018-03-17T05:32:48.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sir, Now is there any solution for this?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kuroSaKKiXC","date":"2018-03-23T17:22:41.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"step 1 ; uninstall\nstep2 ; download Fortnite\nSTEP 3 ; here you  go!{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"OddFelloe","date":"2018-03-08T02:34:59.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same issue, Would sure be nice if Riot would let us know why we have these huge fricken patches for no reason.
