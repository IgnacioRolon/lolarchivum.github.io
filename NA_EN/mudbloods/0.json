Then i remembered the \"Overwatch\" function in CSGO. For those unfamiliar with the system, it basically lets experienced players review gamefootage to see if reports of hacking are actually true. \r\nHave you ever thought about implementing this for League? This is how i see it working:\r\n1. You will have a computer function reviewing every report of griefing/inting very roughly (meaning that every case of griefing/inting will be caught, but there might also be some instances where it is not actually griefing slipping through).\r\n2. Players above gold 1 with an honor level of at least 4 will be able to review games that have been flagged by the system.\r\n3. After reviewing the game, the player will either flag the play as \"not grief\", \"definetly grief\" or \"unsure\"\r\n4. After a game has been reviewed 10 times, and have been rated \"definetly grief\" 9 out of 10 reviews (with \"unsure\" not counting as a review) it will be sent to a Rioter, who will review the game and be able to punish the player accordingly.\r\n5. To get players to review games, there could be made a weekly mission of reviewing 5 games which will grant an EXP or BE reward. \r\nPlease let me know what you think about this proposition - constructive criticism is welcomed with open arms.\r\nAnd if you too would like a less toxic environment, please make sure to upvote this post.\r\nSorry for my bad English\r\nAlso: Please stop calling bad plays for \"int\" plays. Inting is short for intentional feeding and just because you play bad does not mean that you int. \r\n// Mudbloods -  a concerned League player.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-12-21T20:54:14.909+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"This idea comes up a lot so will just quickly address some points.\n\n1. It is easier to judge CS:GO for griefing than it is for League. The community is largely divided on even defining exactly what griefing is. Is my Reksai support griefing or simply off meta? Is my AD Donger griefing or offmeta? Just some examples.\n\n2. Honor resets at the beginning of the season. Meaning a few months won't have anybody reviewing. \n\n3. Rank and Honor level does not mean good judge of griefing.\n\n4. The Tribunal existed for just chat logs and I don't think it had a restriction and it was still months behind. This would be more so.","replies":[{"poster":"Mudbloods","date":"2019-12-21T21:06:02.761+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"So when I talk about griefing it could be someone refusing to play - e.g. My bot lane got ganked twice, so my Nautilus refused to go bot and instead followed my jungler around and tried last-hitting his camps. Then he sold all his items and bought 6 longswords. I don't necessarily think of weird champion picks - also i wanted this most of all for the \"inting\" feature. \nI believe that higher-ranked people will be better at spotting someone griefing, as they have greater game knowledge, and therefore have a better understanding for for instance a support player roaming top lane lvl 3. \nIt doesn't really matter that honor resets - you could just go off last season honor lvls  for the first couple of months. \nThis would be kind of like the Tribunal system, but an improved version.

Hasn't funnel Kassadin with Taric been a thing recently? How would it handle strategies like such? What would happen if it became a mainstream tactic after x players already got punished for it?\n\n> I believe that higher-ranked people will be better at spotting someone griefing, as they have greater game knowledge, and therefore have a better understanding for for instance a support player roaming top lane lvl 3. \n\nNot even joking, have you seen some Iron IV games? Fiestas happen. Plenty of bad judgement calls that someone higher rank may identify as inting.\n\n> It doesn't really matter that honor resets - you could just go off last season honor lvls  for the first couple of months. \n\nI'll give you that much just for ease of discussion.\n\n> This would be kind of like the Tribunal system, but an improved version.

I do, however, think there are some cases (as you also pointed out) which will be subjective, in which I think the \"unsure\" button is great. Also, I know it is just an example, but \"funnel\" is a pretty known strategy, and I am sure that most high elo players know of or have at least, heard of it. I think there is a clear distinction between griefing and trying a new strategy, however, I do not think it will be hard to see the difference. In other words, I personally think it is easy to see if someone is playing to win or not. I do not know how many reports get in the system daily but I could imagine that there is a lot. This will help a bit with these reports and hopefully, the system could also scare some people from griefing.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-12-21T22:06:28.236+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">  I do not know how many reports get in the system daily but I could imagine that there is a lot.\n\nTake the number you're thinking, and multiply it by a million.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-12-21T21:07:07.564+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"I think you forgot the biggest reason not to copy CS:GO system - it doesn't work worth jack shit.

The hard thing is to be able to distinguish between intentional disruptive behavior and bad decisions/plays cos someone is either tilted, distracted, or just bad in general. \n\nThe process for disruptive gameplay reviews/punishments are already slow without the player's input. It will be even slower with the player's inputs, and speed was one of the main reasons why the tribunal got shut down. \n\nAlso, from what we see on these boards, people whom complain about intentional disruptive gameplay behavior happening  close to every game typically are the ones that have it wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NF Remilia","date":"2019-12-21T21:33:23.101+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And who is gonna judge and how?

Those volunteers would then vote on whether to punish or pardon the reported player's case. This system's main flaw was that it simply took far too long due to LoL's huge playerbase. Participants would often be reviewing chat logs that were several months old, with a growing backlog. In addition to that, not every participant took the task seriously: some would spam the same verdict for every case without even reading the chat log, or even invert their verdicts on purpose.\n\nThe current system, called the Instant Feedback System, or IFS, is automated software that uses machine learning to determine what behavior should be punishable and when a player's behavior should be punished. It started with data from the Tribunal, and has been learning and adapting for years. It operates on the same basic principles as a spam filter: get a corpus of data (emails/chat logs), have humans categorize each item as acceptable or unacceptable, find patterns within each category, and then finally look for those patterns to automatically categorize new items without direct human evaluation. Each report is like clicking the \"spam\" button. When a new pattern starts to get lots of reports, the IFS recognizes it as a new form of toxicity.\n\nThe IFS is efficient and unbiased. The Tribunal was not.","replies":[]}]}
