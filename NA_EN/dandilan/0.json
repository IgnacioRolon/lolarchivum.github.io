We got used to not having it, and now would rather have you not fall behind. \n\nThe Blue also makes us a big target for a gank, and with all the damage these days we don't want to die with it!\n\nWe'd rather you give us a gank than the blue :) get me their blue :p","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-11-30T17:03:57.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"last time i played the best mids were champion like {{champion:84}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:266}}  none of which need blue\n\nalso.. because there is no way in hell as a jungler i can afford to lose the exp of one of my camps now..","replies":[]},{"poster":"DM For Rat Facts","date":"2018-11-30T17:12:15.085+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:3802}} {{item:1056}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DerZermetzelte","date":"2018-12-01T16:51:19.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's alright. Not op, but ok. You can actually use more than 3 spells per laning phase, but it's not spammy either.\nLost Chapter / the following items get you into a pretty ok spot. And if you're a hard spammer you buy Archangels, which gives 1400 Mana and makes you 25% more mana efficient.\nIf I really want to spam I'd probably take it when offered, but having a useful jungler that isn't underleveled is usually the better choice. I guess if you are planning to shove hard, it's pretty neat. Like for example an Anivia that is after your turret plating or something.\n\nOh yes. And Manaflow band became practically non-competitive, due to the removal of Ultimate Hat from that Rune Tier. So you're usually decked out with Doran's Lost chapter, and a carefully stacked Manaflow Band","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2018-12-01T14:59:14.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3003}} and {{item:3040}} users.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Super Galaxy","date":"2018-11-30T23:48:05.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blue buff makes me more of a target.
