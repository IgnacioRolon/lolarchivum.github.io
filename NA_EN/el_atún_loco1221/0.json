Also could you make it so their isn&#039;t a limit to wards and are able to buy wards in the store again?","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2017-09-20T02:31:25.342+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Err....

Just the same as people can take a Yasuo or a Yi to be the team's main AD carry and make it work with some coordination, Supports have every right to build straight damage, use cheap ass combos to nail kills or perform obnoxious shenanigans to distract the enemy team.\n\nYour definition of 'support' seems to be a damage-impotent ward-bot who can't stand on his own for two seconds without being destroyed, but makes it's presence worth somehow by using Redemption/Locket/Mikael's repeatedly.\n\nMy definition of 'support' is to AP scale my Sona so goddamn much she becomes a massive damage threat, a powerful healer, and an MS goddess. Who also happens to be amazing at helping out her team because her scalings are beautiful.\n\nA lot of people disagree with both versions, and that's fine.

My best games of support are with those that actual communicate with me a.k.a the guys that i tend to play with on a weekly basis.  we may not always have the best builds but the fact that we can do a double support bot or 2 tanks bot for shiggles is half the fun for us.  we actually started getting good at taking champs out of the normal route.  now sadly i had to go back to the normal routine of just support as his happy self went to college.\n\njust build what you think you need and if you have a suggestion say hey this item would work better.....insults don't work and tend to cause them to leave.\n\nMay the stars guide you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2017-09-20T03:00:40.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so what you're saying is that bad players will have bad builds\n\nisn't this how it's supposed to be?","replies":[]},{"poster":"jwebb0113","date":"2017-09-20T02:57:12.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a support main since season 2 ... \n\nhow about...
