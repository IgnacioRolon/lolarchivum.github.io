But he stands around over 5+ seconds taking cs, and XP after the kill gets me so far behind I can't do shit then argues...\n\nThe result is a lost lane phase + Lost game couldn't do jack shit ( I Believe this is report worthy under griefing.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-01-29T00:42:41.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, That's basically harassment...
