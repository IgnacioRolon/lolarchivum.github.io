Been trying to get into 3v3, but it's just not the same. It's like trying to settle for soda after quitting the sauce. Ascension is the only thing that comes close, but unfortunately it's only available a couple times a month (if that). LoL could really use a  permanent mode that's just focused on fighting/objectives, without having to deal with tedious laning.

Even Riot admitted that understaffed balance led to a lack of popularity, which led to further understaffed balance, which led to a further lack of popularity, and so on.\n\nRiot claimed a lot of things in their reasoning for retiring Dominion. Most of them were questionable at best. Actually, in hindsight, it's sorta fitting that even Dom's retirement was handled in such a messy way.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Around999People","date":"2017-03-28T02:06:31.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARSR is completely different from ARAM.
