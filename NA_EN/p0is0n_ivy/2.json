Imagine if you'll have 2 premades made up of nothing but equally skilled players between them, but one is just a bunch of people that don't even know eachother yet just decided to queue up together for some reason and the other is made of people that practiced together a lot and are all sitting physically next to eachother. The second premade will be a lot stronger than the first, but as far as the system can tell they're on the same level. \n\nIn this case I'd say there's a premade in your team so the system paired it up with a higher skilled team to make up for the presumed premade advantage. Yeah it's shitty and all, and that's why I'm not touching Flex q with a ten foot pole next season.","replies":[{"poster":"P0IS0N IVY","date":"2016-11-03T05:00:45.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought if there was a premade on one team, there's supposed to be a premade on the other. Regardless of how many ppl are paired up on my team tho, it doesn't warrant facing against two Plat 2's. The highest ranking person is Plat IV on our team. It makes no sense.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"P0IS0N IVY","date":"2016-11-03T04:16:28.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's another:\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/2c457ae06ad672484a2c01a7e61d5e70.png","replies":[]}]}
