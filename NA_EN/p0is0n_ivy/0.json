She can be built as an **offtank** and works well with a team that has a good amount of CC.\"\n\nNow it's, \"There is no reason to pick Elise because her damage output is **meager**, she offers **very little CC** and is **squishier than most offtanks**.\"\n\nEver since Elise became the most played champion, she has continuously been chain nerfed. She's hit rock bottom. Her win rate is **42.51%**. She needs to be either reworked or buffed.\n\n* Buff Option:\n\nSo the problem with Elise previously was that she did too much damage while still being tanky. Both of those things have been nerfed and one of them needs to come back. If Riot were to give her back her damage, that would restore her early jungling presence, but her power may be too overwhelming. Therefore, I would suggest giving her her Spider stats back as well as some more utility. Her human form E (Cocoon) needs its duration to be restored to 1.5. The max damage of her Q against monsters should also be increased.\n\nAlso fix the Rappel bugs. Please.\n\n* Rework Option:\n\nIf we were to rework Elise, we might as well also take a look at the theme of a spider. Spiders take time to spin their webs and lure their prey in. They have venom to paralyze their victims and prevent them from moving. Spiders are not meant to be extremely mobile.\n\n**Elise's damage ratios will be increased and her base damage stats reduced.**\n\nI've introduced a new feature called the Neurotoxin debuff in Elise's suggested rework.\n\n* **Passive - Spider Swarm: **Current passive as well as generating one spiderling every X seconds.\nAddition: The Neurotoxin debuff lasts for 2 seconds.\n\n* Q: \n**Human Form - Jumping Spider: ** Costs one spiderling. Elise sends forth a leaping spiderling as a skill shot. It sticks to an enemy champion upon contact and causes the Neurotoxin debuff. If the enemy champion has already been debuffed, they will be dealt extra damage. If the spiderling does not hit a champion, it will remain in the area for X seconds. If Elise reactivates the ability or X seconds pass, the spiderling will explode, applying Neurotoxin to everything in X radius. **No longer does % health damage.**\n**Spider Form - Venomous Bite:** Elise's next attack will cause her to leap at the target. Increased range if enemy is debuffed. If the enemy is within normal range, Venomous Bite does X extra damage. Cooldown decreased by 1 second every time a spiderling attacks. Cannot occur more than once every X seconds. **Does % max health damage.**\n\n* W:\n**Human Form -  Skittering Frenzy:** Increases the attack speed of spiderlings.\nPassive -   Attacking enemies with the Neurotoxin debuff restores X amount of health/second for X seconds. Duration is reset upon each attack.\nActive (Passive disabled while on CD): Increases Elise's attack speed.\n**Spider Form - Paralysis:** Targetted ability. Can be used with Jumping Spider. The closest spiderling will shoot a jet of venom at the target and cause the Neurotoxin debuff. If the target has already been debuffed, they will be stunned.\n\n* E:\n**Human Form - Cocoon:** Fires a cocoon that stuns and reveals the first enemy it hits, applying the Neurotoxin debuff. Only does damage if the enemy is already debuffed.\n**Spider Form - Web:** Costs one spiderling. Spins an invisible web of X radius that lasts X minutes and reveals the area. Enemies that walk into it are slowed and given the Neurotoxin debuff. Enemies that already have the Neurotoxin debuff are stunned. There may only be X webs on the map at once. Elise receives additional movement speed while on a web.\n\n* R: Unchanged\n\nComments on rework: Some of Elise's % health damage has been reduced and she now offers a slight bit more utility.  She can be built as a damage mage, but if the player chooses to go the tanky route, she can still help with crowd control. She has lower base damage stats with higher AP ratios, preventing her from being a jack of all trades.","replies":[{"poster":"19 19 19","date":"2015-01-06T05:16:08.004+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"Riot said it plenty of times, Numbers don't matter.","replies":[{"poster":"P0IS0N IVY","date":"2015-01-06T05:24:32.152+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mr Deceiver,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4vmOq3Lc,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-06T05:16:08.004+0000)\n>\n> Riot said it plenty of times, Numbers don't matter.\n\nYou are correct and I am generally not one to look at numbers.

Too early to tell whether or not Elise is just one of those champs that does better professionally than in solo queue.\n\nI have seen some competitive play with her in the off-season, and she seems to be more of a comfort pick than anything.  Just look at J4 at the moment.  J4 has gap closing and huge burst along with a shield and slow.  Elise has a somewhat clunky morphing combo for the stun and bite that is much harder to pull off.  She is really only useful if she lands a late game cocoon for picking off the enemy.\n\nWhile I'm by no means a great player, it seems that Elise's early game carry ability is for the most part gone.  As a result, she is so much utility that you really need to trust your team to win.  At lower levels in solo queue that is an impossibility.  The better players in a team must be the carries because the team as a whole is generally terrible.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-01-06T10:47:31.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The rework idea looks pretty cool, but I think the neurotoxin system seems way to much like the Nidalee rework.\n\nWhat if we changed it so that instead of all this neurotoxin stuff, those additional effects take place if the target is in one of Elise's webs?  If the web ability had a charge system (or a long cooldown) and wasn't so easy to use in the middle of a fight (such as having some delay before it appeared, as if spiderlings were taking time to make it) it would work well to create a trap based play style.\n\nI think the resulting kit could look something like this:\n\n* **Passive:**  Current passive.\n\n\n* Q:  **Human - Paralyzing Venom:**  Same as your spider form W, but comes from Elise, does damage, and stuns for a short duration if the target is in a Web.\n**Spider - Venomous Bite:** Same except it has increased range while Elise is in her Web, but no increased damage.\n\n\n* W:  **Human - Jumping Spiderling:**  Same as your Q idea except if it is attached to a champion and in a Web when it explodes it will knock the champion a short distance towards the center of the Web.  The spiderling would grant vision much like the current Volatile Spiderling.  The ability does not cost a spiderling and should have a more lengthy cooldown.\n**Spider - Skittering Frenzy:** I would keep it the same as she currently has but the AS bonus is increased if Elise is in a Web when she activates the ability.\n\n\n* E:  **Human - Cocoon:** Your Cocoon idea but also increases the effect of slows on the target by some amount for 5 seconds if the target was in a Web when hit.\n**Spider - Spider's Web:** Elise's spiderlings disappear and spend 3 seconds spinning a Web in targeted location (think a 3 second delayed Trundle Frozen Domain).  The Web would work similarly to your idea, but would only grant vision while Elise is in *a* Web and would only slow while Elise is in *that* Web.  The area of the Webs should be visible and somehow destroyable while Elise is seeing through them (if the enemies have vision there, they should also be able to hear Elise if they are in the Web because that would be really cool).  To keep the Webs from being permanent no go zones they should expire 8 seconds or so after Elise uses an ability in *that* Web.  **Costs all of Elise's spiderlings, minimum 2**.\n\n\n* R:  Current ultimate.\n\nI put her venom and spiderling related abilities together simply because that makes sense to me for thematic coherence.  I don't give her Webs vision all the time because that would just be free wards and terrible traps.  The spiderling cost and the delay on creating the Web is so Elise has to actually set up instead of being able to drop a Web whenever she pleases (unless she trades a decent amount of power for it).  Hopefully the kit would make catching people in your web worthwhile, but not so ridiculous that they are automatically doomed.  I think most of the damage should be put into her spider form since most of her cc and utility is in her human form, this would make it so she would probably draw enemies into her trap in human form before locking them in and then going spider on their face to finish the job (which is what I think her play style should be).\n\n\nPS:  Sorry for the wall of text.","replies":[{"poster":"P0IS0N IVY","date":"2015-01-06T20:44:56.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Baron of Bread,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4vmOq3Lc,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2015-01-06T10:47:31.258+0000)\n>\n> Snip\n\nI don't see a particular issue with the Neurotoxin thing being similar to Nidalee, unless you mean it sounds OP.\n\nWhile I was thinking of a rework for her, I considered making the Web ability her main one, but that would make her ganking rather difficult.\n\nYour rework would be good if Riot wanted to make Elise a top champion.

Why do you pick Elise over, for example, Gnar?\n\nI feel like if their jungler is on top of me, yeah I'm either straight out losing or going toe to toe.  But unchecked, I find her jump in power at three beats most tanks/tankier champs early.  The only champion I'd say I've had a real issue with is Shyvana, because she can just be like \"no\" and then W away.  \n\nTransitioning into mid game I tend to play the split pushing/jungle roaming type of top laner.  I sometimes pick up the sight stone and just take control of the opposing jungler's jungle (for some reason in my recent memory I've only played Elise on blue side).  If my team needs me to come in, I usually do my best to be an assassin-type team fighter, approach from behind, and disrupt their carries.  I also build her a bit tankier, albeit still an apc/bruiser build (liandry's, sunfire).  I do admit I rely a LOT on her W.  If they leave me alone for too long I can take half a turret before they can stop me.  This usually means they also have to dedicate someone to me full time, and not in a fun way either because if they choose to engage on me I have their entire jungle warded AND can go over walls to jungle creeps.\n\nAs for going into late game...well that gets tricky.  It's a lot like her late game in the jungle.  She just sort of exists.  Usually I pick a lane and stick with it, help set up objectives, etc.  You can probably assassinate a carry but by now they are onto that plan (and so you hope your distraction of 2 of their members for 1 of you gives your team an edge).\n\nAs for comparisons to similar champions, for example Gnar, I reserve him specifically for heavy armor champions (have you played Gnar vs. Ryze in lane? It is just silly).  Otherwise I default back to Shyvana or Quinn, who basically share the same purpose but fall under \"bullies\" more than \"traders\". \n\nBut I will stand by my belief that Elise + early liandry's + sunfire + morellos = the *mundo killer*.  Trademark/copyrighted. Mine.\n\n\nEDIT:\nAlso,\n{{summoner:14}} ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lt Cuddles","date":"2015-01-06T07:17:19.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Well...](http://na.op.gg/statistics/champion/)","replies":[]}]}
