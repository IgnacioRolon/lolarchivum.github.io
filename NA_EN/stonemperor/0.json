However, today the exact same problem arised again, for what reason I don't know. I'm capable of running any online game, stream etc. without having any issues, yet only League is giving me problems. So clearly, the problem is on your guys' end. No one else in this household is experiencing problems so I'm really at a loss here.\n\nEdit: I ran the hextech repair tool and the connection seems stable again, will report if I re-experience any issues","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-16T22:04:19.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There hasn't been any issues with access to the servers, though I'm glad the HRT was able to assist.

Let me know if you still have issues after going through it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
