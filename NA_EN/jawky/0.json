I was playing as thresh and never once sat at the fountain afk or left the match. After i came back from my class i got the punishment and now have to wait 5 minutes before every que. \n\nBut i never went afk or left the game!! Why did i get this punishment?!?!?!\n\nAnd i NEVER got any type of warning prior to this punishment telling me that i had done something wrong.\n\nThe last time i left a game was back in December but it was only 1 game that i left","replies":[{"poster":"asuzukii","date":"2015-01-15T22:58:40.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same thing as you.
