Is there a way to get in more direct contact with Riot or a way to get my account unsuspended?\n\nedit: after reading some of the posts here, i would only assume its because of being accidentally banned with the mods or whatever or due to being toxic. I have not used any kind of mod or addon or anything for league and how would they see that i havent used any or have any stuff on my computer? i also have never had a ban for being toxic, only having been chat blocked for a few games a while back. \n\nupdate: still no word on my tickets or anything of the sort, though i did get an email confirmation email yesterday, so that is hopeful. hopefully riot will fix fast so i can buy a few champions and remember what league is xD","replies":[{"poster":"Shadowas","date":"2016-05-18T17:39:30.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"u had 2 weeks ban before?","replies":[{"poster":"grifxdonut","date":"2016-05-18T17:48:44.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"no, the only thing i have had has been a 3 or 4 game/day chat ban like 1 year or 2 ago","replies":[{"poster":"Shadowas","date":"2016-05-18T17:51:07.592+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here, got banned after 5-6 years of playin lol, feeling really bad atm.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-05-18T20:53:13.765+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shadowas,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ra5e61om,comment-id=000100010000,timestamp=2016-05-18T17:51:07.592+0000)\n>\n> same here, got banned after 5-6 years of playin lol, feeling really bad atm.\n\n+1","replies":[]},{"poster":"UNCjer","date":"2016-05-18T20:13:05.248+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here.
