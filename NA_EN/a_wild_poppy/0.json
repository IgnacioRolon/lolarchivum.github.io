I dont know how LP gains in plat works but that would be my assumption.\n\nFeeders and trolls? Did you not make even one mistake? Even professionals make mistakes every game, even missing a minion kill or missing a skill shot is a mistake. Focus less on what you can't change (other's mistakes) and more on what you can change (your mistakes). Sure, some games a player might make many more mistakes than others, but every loss or win is attributed to every player.\n\nCalling out a teammate for a mistake is more of a mistake than whatever you were calling out your teammate for. A feeding teammate can make it harder to win, but feeding isn't as big of a deal as some think, the problem is the reaction to the feeding and is what causes a loss more often than the feeding.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2016-12-09T01:14:29.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When your ADC keeps picking Vayne with my Soraka, top and mid lanes wont stop dieing for 2 minutes, and have Ziggs support and Velkoz top, then yeah I think im going to stick by what I said with feeders and trolls.

You're not going to be placed at or near your previous rank, it's supposed to be some what of a reset. A G3 player should have no problem getting out of Silver. Also, while you may be placed in S4, your MMR might be in the Gold range, so you'll earn a lot of LP per win and won't lose much as much for a loss. Just realize that your own actions are what result in your League position, making excuses will just hold you back.","replies":[{"poster":"Breaku","date":"2016-12-09T02:56:00.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, I'm not worried about it, 5-1 and in promos already BUT I would much rather be playing with silvers.... in silver rather than with plats in silver. \n\nLike, what even is this match: http://prntscr.com/dh5cap (for the record, 8 of the 9 other players were plat s6)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pavello2","date":"2016-12-09T01:11:30.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tsugaga,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fqVMudYg,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-12-09T00:14:32.385+0000)\n>\n> Placement isn&#x27;t a big deal, and is more of a safe than sorry system.

A lot goes into LP gain/loss, and I'm sure the potential of a lucky win streak is factored in.
