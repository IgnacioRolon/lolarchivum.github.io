Old lore had depth and its own story with champions having connections with eachother, but now... its so BORING!\r\n\r\nPlease bring back the new lore and change the newer champions lore to be in-depth! \r\n\r\nNew lore can be compared to the phrase \"1st rule of Tautology club is the 1st rule of Tautology,\" because it basically boils down to \"X champion is X Champion because he just is.\"\r\n\r\nIts boring, and maybe, JUST MAYBE, if enough people support this idea then they will change the lore back.","replies":[]}
