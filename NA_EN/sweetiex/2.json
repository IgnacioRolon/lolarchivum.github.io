All the changes in the last 10 patches pretty much destroyed all the fun in the game for me. In just over 6 months Riot made me go \"I don&#039;t feel like playing this game anymore\" instead of \"Can&#039;t wait to get home so I can play some LoL.\"\n\nI&#039;ve never felt so limited in the number of champions I can play. I&#039;ve never before felt like I need 20+ bans in draft to be able to have fun playing. I&#039;ve never seen this much raging and afking ever before. All these new items, yet it feels like there&#039;s even less build diversity than before.  I&#039;ve also never felt like the game was already lost in champ select this often. \n\nSince Bard came out, this game has slowly and steadily gone down the drain. I honestly feel like Riot has absolutely no idea what they are doing with their game. Riot keeps constantly adding retarded OP items and then nerf the champions most benefiting from them, leading to these champions being forced to only play the one role that uses these items. If these champions don&#039;t have the new OP items, they are now useless.\n\nOR\n\nRiot keeps steadily buffing \"underplayed\" champions only because they are \"underplayed\" and sooner or later these champions become meta because of all the buffs and new items and boom, gutted next patch. Or worse, champions get adjusted to make sure they aren&#039;t op with the new items thus forcing them to use the items. \"Oh we added an item that gives movement speed. X, X and X champions now have 15 less movement speed to compensate. What&#039;s that? You can&#039;t catch up to anyone anymore? I know, get the new item.\" \n\nRiot keeps constantly introducing new items and it honestly feels like they don&#039;t test the items at all. \"Hmm, this champion that we have buffed 10 times in the last 10 patches could become way too strong with this new item. Maybe we should change the item or tune down the overly buffed champion\" <- feels like this doesn&#039;t happen. Ever. It&#039;s more like \"New item, didn&#039;t test it. Have fun.\" \n\nSorry riot. I just can&#039;t have fun playing this game anymore. I might play a normal or two from time to time, but I doubt I&#039;ll be logging in every day anymore.\n\nCya later. Or maybe not. Will see.\n\nEdit:\nI remember a time, when I would think \"What should I build this game?\" But now all I think is \"I build this and this item in this exact order, otherwise I'm useless.\" ","replies":[{"poster":"Pengrin","date":"2015-08-28T07:48:00.414+0000","up_votes":103,"down_votes":19,"body":"You probably weren't here during season 1 and 2.

If anything, the game was slowly dying (in terms of balance) right when Darius was released. Everyone knew that this champion was an atrocity at the start.

Ever since Season 3 with Renekton + Shyvana top forever, Ziggs stalling + Leblanc one shotting mid, and Thresh Thresh Thresh Thresh and Thresh bot lane (did I mention Thresh was picked?), the number of picks have been at an absolute minimum.\n\nThe fact that less than half the roster (around 50 total) was chosen last worlds (did I mention Thresh was most picked support?), this shows that this game is disgustingly unbalanced. \n\nIf Riot doesn't pull up their pants and start NERFING rather than REWORKING, they would actually get something done. \n\nDon't give me the \"ohhhh they are all balanced, they just arent picked!!!!\" bullshit, they are not picked plainly because they are straight up weaker than the other champions. Why isn't Trundle picked? Because he will get out-jungled, he will get out-top laned (*cough*Gnar*cough*) and he will increase your chances of losing.\n\nI am plainly ashamed of what this game and how accepting this community is to everything Riot is doing. If you feel something is wrong, say it as soon as possible, because Riot will think what they are doing is correct.\n\nOh, but, don't try to critique CertainlyT, he will be a crybaby and sink back into his corner designing some overpowered piece of crap, or just ruin some classic champion for no reason at all, then he will just not look at the forums.","replies":[{"poster":"LaceUp23","date":"2015-08-28T14:28:03.516+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":3,"body":"You know what happened?

I feel like everything is competing to be put up to par until it gets too strong and then it gets nerfed. Most stuff gets thrown around and other stuff stays stable. Whenever I open up the Patch Notes, I cringe. Sometimes it feels like a hurricane just went through. At the end of it all, it's temporary, and no actual balance is being created.\n\nI remember that, at one time, your main would be safe. Just because it was underplayed doesn't mean that it would have to be reworked into a state where its original identity was distorted. (There are cases where this doesn't apply, like Sion, but then there's Skarner, whose even his Lore has been changed horrifically). Your main wouldn't be picked up once by the pros and then immediately have his silence removed in the following patch and then left to rot in a place of obscurity even worse than where it was originally. Nothing like that would ever have happened to such an extent.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is... Contrary to popular belief, {{champion:121}} change is not always good. I'm not saying it was perfect, but it was still fun. There was more diversity, more champions being picked, and more fun in general.\n\nBy more fun I mean just more chill. No one was expecting so much out of everything to such a point where they expected more than anyone could hav ever done, they themselves included. That was when the game was much less competitive. I feel like the main point where League excels at is its casual side. That side is diminishing more and more everyday. It's so much harder to enjoy everything with everyone so tense and out to jump at you for doing something you know you did wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-08-28T19:04:23.750+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are actually very, very wrong about the game needing nerfs and not reworks.\n\nThe endless cycle of nerfing is exactly what has led us to the current problems we have. First of all, there are too many champions. Straight up. That's not a problem that can be fixed, however. What CAN fix this problem is having vastly different kits from champion to champion. This is Riot tried to do with Skarner and Mordekaiser. They don't really compete with anyone, because they have their own niche (well that's what they are trying to do anyway). Sure, they might not be played as often as a more generic champion, but that's ok as long as you can say ''In this situation, I really wanna pick Skarner'' (2 days ago that situation would have been always lmfao).\n\nIf you just keep nerfing anything that ends up on top, you continue the cycle of ''Who's got the biggest dick this patch?'' because too many champions compete to do the same thing. Say {{champion:16}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:44}} are the only viable supports because they heal like crazy and ALL THEY DO IS HEAL (this is total bs but just follow the example) you'll always end up picking the two best healers. Oh, Taric pulling ahead in healing? Better nerf him and have Soraka become n1 and Sona n2. Now, no one picks Taric. But there's more to each champion than healing. Taric is tankier, has a point and click stun, armor aura and armor shred and is melee. Sona has her auras, poke and engage while Soraka is THE healer. They don't really compete for the same spots in a team. \n\nThe ultimate goal is to have most champions fill a niche and not have 6 champions compete for the same niche and just pick whoever's the best. Of course, some champions like {{champion:412}} are generalists and fill more than one niche, but as long as they don't do EVERYTHING too well, they COULD be fine. Thresh is not fine because of the number of tools he has. He's just TOO MUCH of a generalist. Getting to the point where each champion as a role they can fulfil best is a very long, arduous process and tbh I'm not sure this dream will ever become a reality, but it's a far better long term goal than the absolute short-sightedness of ''nerf everything''. If Riot had started doing this 4 years ago, we'd have a magnificent game right now instead of what LoL has become.\n\np.s. If you think FoN deserves a place in this game, you're clearly out of touch with how shitty this single item made life for every single mage back then. It might as well have said ''Do NOT try to interact wtih me, you WILL waste your mana and probably die''.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Betawerewolf","date":"2015-08-28T18:00:14.727+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing League for almost 5 years (Every since MF was released in Sept. 2010).  So back in the day we had as many issues as we do today (Xin Zhao, Akali, Irellia) and while these champions were ridiculous to compete, they were still somewhat fun to compete. From what I remember, things were still pretty bad but not as bad as today. I agree things started to go to bad around the time when fighters such as Darius and Jayce came out. Then you have Zed, Thresh, and Kalista. \n\nI'm ignoring a lot of champs like Lee Sin and Riven but S3 was when it started to fall apart and S4 was when I realized it. When Riot halted the Lee Sin changes for the sake of LCS (Let's be real, that's why they did it) I thought it was stupid. You have edgy El1t3 playmakers that dominate LCS and yet they keep Kassadin (The most banned champion of the game at one point) down. They even reworked the jungle so that way they could appease both the Lee Sin fans and everyone else. There was still hope though, the jungle rework brought old champs back from the grave such as Warwick(Who then got nerfed righteously) and with cinderhulk. My favorite meta, the Tank Meta, might just return.\n\nOf course though you had champs such as Rek'Sai, Kalista, and Ekko coming into the mix. Then you have the Veigar nerfs, Zilean Nerfs, and Cass Nerfs. I refuse to call those reworks if they didn't really balance the champion. The thing that kept me playing the game were mages like Anivia and Malzahar and I'm glad they haven't been touched yet by Riot. The game honestly had a good start but it collapsed with three things.\n\n1. Champ Reworks that have Destroyed Champions\nLike stated above, Riot has consistently failed to rework certain champions and instead of reverting said changes, they leave the champion gutted and unplayable. Best example for this is Zilean. I'm sure Crazy Boris loves Riot for that rework. Morde is another example however since I never really liked Morde, I can't reallly sympathize one way or another.\n\n2. Chroma Packs\nI know what you're about to think, \"Oh geez another one of those whiners; the game's free to play get over it.\". It is free to play but come on this has got to be the biggest money grab Riot Games has made. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/31vuh0/hi_im_creating_whatever_chroma_you_can_want_for/\n\nhttp://heroesofthestorm.wikia.com/wiki/Progression_Level\n\nIf you're trying to get a chroma pack because you enjoy how your character looks just for you and no other, you can just make your own color variations or have someone more experienced do it for you. This level of modification allows you to expand upon what you want your champion to look like and you can do it all for free. This reminds me of how Minecraft for Consoles sell you skins when on PC you can just make your own or download one for free.\n\nAs for HotS, I know some of you don't like the game because you like to last hit or you prefer to carry your team. That's perfectly fine by me but even HotS offers you a way to unlock free color variations for a hero you play. They even give you the option to buy a Master Skin (If you get level 10 mastery) for the champion with its own color variations as well. \n\nThe fact that Riot hasn't talked about chroma packs being unlockable after its release (Even when they said they'd consider it) leads me to the reason why I left this game.\n\n3. Riot's Lack of Communication and Transparency to the Community.\nCommunity: When's Tribunal coming back?\nRiot: (Silence) / We're working on it.\n\nCommunity: Have you considered Chroma Packs being unlockable through progression?\nRiot: ....... / (Talks about how in-game data shows that we need more time to plan for the future about how to create skins that people want and a debate about how to create a system of progression which doesn't answer the question being asked)\n\nCommunity: Hey man, about that Morde Rework, can you add any solo potential.\nRiot: .......\n\nCommunity: Hey man how about that Garen rework\nRiotRepetoir: I'm fully listening to all of your complaints and will respond to even other issues.\n(Best Riot Employee for actually communicating)\n\nRiot Repetoir should be in charge of Riot since he understands what Communcation means.\n\n\nIn conclusion, I've had it with this game even Heroes of the Storm is a better MOBA. Just my opinion but hey. Sorry if anything I'm incorrect with some of the history of League. My memory is kinda fuzzy with some champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enosetc","date":"2015-08-28T08:43:22.029+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pengrin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EEgu3LpI,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-08-28T07:48:00.414+0000)\n>\n> You probably weren't here during season 1 and 2.

Sure it's bad, but back in the day it was hella worse. Remember release leblanc? or release Xin towerdiving at lvl 3? And don't anybody dare say season 1 was balanced. Sure the meta wasn't so locked in back then, but balance was practically nonexistant. I totally understand why people are frustrated by the lack of balance and how slow rito is to respond to op stuff, but balance has never been good. Deathfire grasp used to deal 10% of the enemies max health in magic damage every time you dealt magic damage to them. Malzahar could one-shot a team with his e. \n\nI can't speak for everyone but I'm guessing most of the people who say they stopped playing because of lack of balance probably just got bored of the game and didn't realize it.

I still hate seeing Le Blanc and Xin Zhao but I think it's not the balance of the game that's pissing people off. I think that it's their lack of communication about a number of things. Whether it's the Tribunal, Reworks, or even Chroma Packs, Riot has not really been transparent about any of these and make design decisions which make no sense.\n\nFor example, the Sandbox mode. \n\nSay you want to see if Sated Nasus actually works. Most people who wish to experiment would usually try a custom game to see if it works. The problem is is that Sated takes time to acquire. A lot of people have time issues whether it's college, work, or family matters and so this kind of experimenting eats up their time. If you were a game dev thinking logically, you would more than likely include cheats, or a sandbox mode to reduce the time spent trying to get sated or anything that requires time. It's a custom game, who cares?\n\nDOTA 2 has a sandbox mode (Custom game mode and then turn on cheats)\nSMITE is getting a sandbox mode\nHeroes of the Storm has a sandbox mode\nCall of Duty has a traning room\nBattlefield has a firing range\nHalo has forge\n(FPS's have competitive play which is why I'm referencing them)\n\nLeague of Legends does not. If Riot were logical, they would say they don't want to invest resources into a project such as a sandbox mode because they want to focus their resources into x,y,z. Instead they say \"Playing League of Legends (Normals or Ranked) should be the unequivicol way for players to improve\". This is the kind of stuff that irritates people about Riot. Chroma packs is another example, you can say it's a company's right to make money and I don't disagree but I will say it is a greedy move when you can create your own and other games (See HotS and SMITE) offer you these color variations for free through progression.\n\nIf anybody has played Vindictus, you probably loved the game but despised Nexon.

I will say S2 did a lot of things right though.  The jungle was extremely accessible, the meta had started to develop and Riot was very in tune with community feedback and quick to fix things that were off.  Though there were highly dominant picks that ended up staling out worlds as with every year since Riot's policy is to leave things alone after a certain patch and they didn't figure out nerfs they wanted to do until later in the next season.  Though one thing that wasn't an issue S2 was mobility creep since there was an actual discrepancy in power levels, if you were mobile you had a price for it.  Now as long as they put some limiting factor on it they feel its ok to give some of the best utility and defensive options to characters that are already mobile while leaving most immobile characters where they are.  \n\nThey don't seem interested in reworking someone like Brand anytime soon and what does he have to offer in terms of reliability and AoE damage compared to the likes of Ekko, Fizz or Viktor?  Or someone like Galio stacked up against Sejuani, Rek'Sai, Maokai or Nautilus?  Mind a number of these champs are older designs that have been massively buffed in reworks to compensate, but in their current state are problematic.  I think if Riot takes time to rework at a more consistent rate and balance more aggressively they can put old designs in a place where they're competitive with modern power levels but at the moment the discrepencies that exist are pretty dramatic and there doesn't seem to be a call to action on them.

However since he does have mobility, he's played a ton in the LCS despite him being mediocre in everything else but mobility as an ADC.

Sure you can argue that those champions shouldn't have been released the way that they did, but give Riot a chance to fix them.\n\nI think Vayne is a result of these new juggernauts and items.  Thresh, Lee, Irelia, and Riven will always be complained about until Riot reworks them. Ahri and Jinx have received nerfs, and people still complain. Zed as well. In Ahri's case, I think it's the mobility put on her Q. They should move it to the W, which thematically is the most boring and somewhat unfitting of her kit.\n\nMobility and stat creep are things, but also overblown. The worst thing about Ekko imo is his W. Putting a slow that can be a stun and a shield is too much, especially when people are making him tanky. One of those things should either be removed, changed, or shifted over to his ult. Gnar has issues, but I don't think he's as bad as people make him out to be. He's more divided among the community. Azir has slows, range, and a dash, but I think he's ok. Didn't they remove his knockup E? Yasuo....it's his passive. Even his fans say it's his passive. Change it, and you'll see less complaints. They have nerfed Rek'Sai so many times that I don't think people play her the way she was intended to anymore. Everyone hates Kalista.

Yes, things are a little messy right now, and no, a lot of Champions are not in the best place. Things are in a state of transition - they have been on a long term scale, but more recently it has began moving rather quickly. The AP item sweep, the Juggernaut changes, new items (how many new items have been put into SR in the last year, compared to the year before it?), and the upcoming changes - Riot has said that they're working on Marksman changes next.\n\nI'm glad that League is changing - it's what has personally kept me playing over the years. Most games will tweak or balance over time but Riot has actively kept the game an ever-evolving creature. Part of this plays into their idea of a \"cyclical imbalance\", basically the entire *point* is that no one strategy ever stays on top for very long. Some game facet - Element 1 - from a single Champion or item build to entire team-wide metas might become dominant, and players flock to it. In turn, other players find that Element 2 counters the strengths of Element 1, and then becomes the dominant force. By contrast it makes Element 1 seem weak, so players start to find counters to Element 2 instead. And the cycle continues.\n\nExtra Credits did a great video in this theory of \"perfect imbalance\" in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e31OSVZF77w)\n\nSo for me, I like it because it keeps things changing. I don't *want* everything to stay the same. I love it when I see Champions play in new and different roles. Vayne in the jungle? Sweet, that's new, let's see how that goes. Nautilus support? Awesome! I love Naut, now there's a new role I can play him in.\n\nOn an individual level, I've always enjoyed playing off-meta picks or comps just to see how it goes. I have a friend, Maribel, and we often run goofy themed bot lanes if we end up filling in the bot lane together. Our current favorite is Pantheon/Leona bot. Both start with a Runic Shield for sustain/gold. The double (or triple) stuns makes it easy to get kills, and its outside of the traditional ranged ADC meta. It is fun. Another one we've done is what we called \"Terrors of the Deep\", Nautilus/Fizz. Again, lots of CC and quite a bit of damage - and that level 6 lockdown is too much fun.\n\nOn a larger level, I appreciate that Riot has slowed down their Champion releases and has started putting more attention into the items and gameplay itself. New items, new jungle options, giving Champions more unique identities - are they all perfect? Absolutely not. Are there going to be some misses, some false starts, some failed experiments? Abso-frakkin'-lutely. But hey, it's going to be fun to try out.\n\nLet's look at the number of Champs released over the last few years:\n2015: 3 (so far, about 3/4 through the year. So let's call it 4 just in case)\n2014: 6\n2013: 8\n2012: 19!!!\n\nHoly crap, look at that. Riot has really pulled back the reins on Champion releases and has been focusing on other elements of the game. This is exactly what I, personally, want to see. It was getting a bit out of hand when there were 1-2 Champions *a month*.\n\nSo I don't think you should take it too hard that things are changing. That's one of the hallmarks of League, and having been around since the beginning I can tell you one thing.\n\n______________________________________\n\n**The only constant is change**","replies":[{"poster":"Beldori","date":"2015-08-29T13:27:44.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Change can be good, just depends on the changes. Runeglaive, Sated and the tank item nerfs were bad changes with either no point for the changes or just blatantly terrible cause they could and the player base  pointed it out before it even hit live but Riot doesn't listen. \n\nSated should have never hit live due to how broken it is. Runeglaive came out to solve ap jungler item issues which really did nothing to help, it limited the pool of ap junglers that can benefit from it while creating more problems than it solved. Tank item nerfs including Cinderhulk were given bs reasons with only two patches till worlds quickly bringing back assassins and burst mages which were the most complained about for the past few seasons on top of quite a few carry junglers coming back again.\n\nThe Ap item changes were good and needed, Juggernauts seem to be hit and miss so far and the new items added seem ok so far but i am skeptic on how useful some of them are. Marksmen item changes is something that is very needed but I'm worried it might go the same way of Botrk did all over again or how the change to bloodthirster went causing most adc's to rush IE, don't want to see it go like that again but keeping hopes up as it goes.\n\nProblem Riot has is they change things while ignoring a good chunk of feedback regardless of how it is presented with the mentality of they know best and it tends to bite them in the ass because of it while causing misery for the player base.
