While i'm in champ select for the third game I don't pick my champion fast enough because i was asking my team what they think I should play , I get removed from the lobby and leaver busted for 5 minutes. After the timer is up I go back into que and win my third game, the result of my series being 2 wins and 1 loss. However in the loading screen of the last game I get the message that i've qualified for a series. Did getting leaver busted give me a loss for my 3rd game, is this a bug, because right now im pretty irritated that I spent 3 and a half hours grinding games and am now being forced to do it against because I didn't click my champion fast enough.\r\n\r\nAny answers would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-25T18:27:52.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you and do see that you had a [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) during your series.  It's not a leaverbuster, but works the same way by putting you in a lower priority queue for a single game.  It will count as a loss, though, with LP loss.  Continued dodging can also result in more LP loss as well as a longer timer.  Regardless, it looks like you've been prompted since then so congrats.  :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lew","date":"2017-07-25T06:16:26.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you dodged the game and dodges when you are in a promo series always counts as loss.","replies":[]}]}
