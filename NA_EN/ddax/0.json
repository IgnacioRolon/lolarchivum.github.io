They took a mediocre champion and gutted him for no reason other than \"his q was oppressive.\" So instead they make it impossible to land? They just about removed it from his kit. And that stun? Oh please. ROFL \n\nAnd now your W doesn't work on your ult - literally the ONLY decent part of his kit, and your slow also lasts less time. \n\nAll because apparently (news to me) Zilean was super OP and in desperate need of balance.

The bombs you throw just have to outplay your opponent. Think like your opponent, toss a few bombs to see their reactions. Even when you learn about their movements, slow them at lv 3 and then bomb them. Slowing then bombing them will really help you land the bombs. Even then Reviving an ally at lv 6 is a game changer. He is a walking, stronger GA for ANYONE. Carries, tanks, bruisers, himself. you name it.","replies":[{"poster":"balbraaksel","date":"2015-11-08T22:20:13.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upvoted.\nI was just about to make a similar reply.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChoNuff","date":"2015-03-20T02:30:36.456+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"NO POKE IN LANE NOW...how is that fun?  I think riot has ruined him for me.  Only fun style now is troll style where you play only for his slow and speed boost.  This type of champ is already out there.  Traditional support like taric or janna or soraka.  Zilean was different because he had great poke and potential for very good damage if you could position well and not get caught.  How is no poke fair?  How is can't play mid anymore fair?  Try dueling someone mid where you try to land two bombs in a row...ha.  Agree with the post.  Zilean is not fun now.  Boring support.  How can he compete on lockdown when he is not tanky?  So he is basically an ap lockdown mage that is squishy and has no reliable damage.

You have to aim and throw a Q, then hit W then aim again and land another Q. During a teamfight when you also need to ult and slow enemies this is just too awkward.

What happens 90% of the time is that I have to speed up myself to get on range and trying to land the two bombs on the same champ. As I said, it's hard and a 1s stun is not so rewarding.\n\n* His new passive is not so well planned in my opinion, as you could give 300 or barely 20 exp on someone and you don't have any way of knowing which of your mates is more profitable because ou don't know how much exp is left for them to get on the next level.\n\nThese are my thoughs so far.

First of All his First ability was fine the way it is idk why you guys change it to skill shot, please revert back the way it was but leaving the \"stuns when apply 2 bombs on the same target\", Second of all HES ULT SHOULD OF BEEN WHAT ekko ult does instead of having it it on the new champion that looks oP, 3rd of all hes \"w\" should affect items c/d hes a freaking Time wizard ffs, and lastly i believe that the \"E\" should of been the Area slow, throwing a time Disruption making units turn back in time anything thrown zilean path after using the E for ex:Ashe uses ult, zil uses \"E\" ashe ult get stuck or revers direction making it safe for Team fights. this is what i think Zil should of been please leave comments i wanna hear your thoughts...cause this Zilean is more useless then Evelynn used to be","replies":[]},{"poster":"Siyther","date":"2015-03-01T17:06:20.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"he does not suck not even close. go practice some more. or ur trying to play him wrong.

It's got such a slight delay that it takes awhile to notice and adjust to it. But it's great otherwise. Once you start to build him up I'm shocked at the amount of players that can take the damage but refuse to. It's a really strong ability right now. His stun is great tower defense. \n\nThe one gripe I have with him is that his time warp (E) is really short-ranged.\n\nedit: Reading some of the negative responses is hilarious.
