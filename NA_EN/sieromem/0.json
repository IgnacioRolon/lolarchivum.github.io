I think that mission not having been counted is what's got me stuck on the \"Complete four missions\" one. I'd love if a rioter could free me from this limbo.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-26T02:55:30.682+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did go ahead and check your mission progress and everything seems to be lining up.
