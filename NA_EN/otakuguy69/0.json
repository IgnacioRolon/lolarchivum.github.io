I am using an razer kraken 7.1 and what happened is that I was playing with my friend on skype and I couldnt hear anything for 2 sec then it became normal but it did the same thing again and also my mic wasnt working. I tried to resolve the problem but I cant find what is wrong and how to fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-06T18:21:24.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a solid headset, so it should work fine.  :D  Have you recently updated your drivers?  Is the sound just not working for the game, or the entirety of your pc?  I'd suggest double checking your drivers or synapse if you have that installed to see if anything might be going haywire.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"OtakuGuy69","date":"2017-05-06T21:23:52.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did the update of synapse and my drivers but it still does it but less then before. It's not working for the entirety of my pc so do you think that my headset can be broken? I had it for a while now.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-06T21:36:03.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope not!  The best way to know for sure is by using a different source for your audio.  Do you have another headset or speakers you can try out?  By the way, that would be a good time to double check your primary audio to make sure it's your Kraken.  Right click your volume icon on the bottom-right of your taskbar then Playback Devices to check your Default.  Good luck. :X","replies":[{"poster":"OtakuGuy69","date":"2017-05-06T22:24:33.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But I can still use it It's just annoying that it does that","replies":[]},{"poster":"OtakuGuy69","date":"2017-05-06T22:17:53.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tested my earpods and they worked fine.
