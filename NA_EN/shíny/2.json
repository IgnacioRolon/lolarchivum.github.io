In particular, the maximally frustrating thing is:\n\n1. Type up a couple paragraphs of post\n2. Accidentally click the preview pane rather than the edit pane when you want to delete a word (because preview and edit panes look quite similar)\n3. Hit backspace to start deleting your word\n\nThis sequence results in you actually using the browser's back button, and because Boards doesn't keep the state, you just lost your post.  Over at Reddit, the full page post editor maintains the state of your partially finished post, so this mistake isn't fatal; you just hit forward again and continue editing.","replies":[]}]}
