Riot says ABSOLUTELY nothing about champions, other than \"we're making one\". Then, they slowly release more information. This relationship is a \"Time-Hole\", magicians use this trick to make you think they can read your mind.

No matter what I ask- you have to remember this card. \nQ1- Think of a color, and I will write that color on this paper.\n-I write down the card I made them choose, ask their color and crumple the paper.\nQ2- Think of a City, and I will write it on this paper.\n-I write the color from the previous question, ask their city and crumple the paper.\nQ3- Think of a person, and I will write the name on this paper.\n-I write the city from the previous question, ask the name of the person and crumple the paper.\nQ4- Think of your card, and I will draw it on this paper.\n-I write the name of the person from the previous question, ask the card and crumple the paper. \nThen I ask the person to retrieve the crumpled papers, and read them.

This champion is certainly not based off of your concept in the slightest (it's a dude that shoots people, not a nature spirit healer/debuffer), and if you were trying to farm upvotes or hijack the thread, it's backfired hard. If you weren't, then I'm sorry you're just arrogant, ignorant, and misinformed.\n\nAs an actual artist and designer, I can tell you from first-hand experience that a design (as in a real, innovative/creative and unique creation) takes days and days of brainstorming. That is only to get the initial conceptual work done. Then you have to prototype several versions, then you have to finalize the design. Okay, now you have a design that you like, that takes a week or so to get finished. However, that is still only the initial design. Now you go to producing the design, which takes a fair bit of time depending on resources required. Then you have to continue testing, and fix problems that you didn't find initially. Sometimes, and this is actually a frequent occurrence, you have to scrap a concept and choose a different prototype. Once you finalize that part, you have to polish your creation (which in the case of a champion in LoL would be things like VFX, VO, and fine tuning the models and textures. Then you have to market it (which as you can see is already very far into the process, and in this case is directly analogous to these \"deadeye\" teasers). Once you market it you test it (PBE) and then once the initial screening is complete, you release it to the general public. \n\nThis is no \"Time Hole\" this is just the standard design process.

It's also possible that the organic shapes of the Kindred masks will forgive some mistakes, while the more angular and humanoid mask we see above would be easier to model (for papercraft or 3d printing) but less forgiving of any slipups.\n\nMaybe they're better suited to different skillsets of crafty-type people.
