Generally, using macros to automate more than 1 key-press is not a good idea. We typically suspend accounts that gain a competitive advantage from macros. I suppose using macros at all are a **try at your own risk** situation, and I'd personally advise *against* using them but it's ultimately up to you.\n\nLet me know if that cleared this up for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Sad Tyrant","date":"2016-09-07T00:05:21.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what you are saying, I can use Macro's but at my own risk to my account\n\n* I cannot use it to scroll through my allies f2 - f5\n* I can use it as a replacement for the Tilde key to make it easier for me to press","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-07T15:41:02.336+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct. In the instance of mapping the Tilde key to the Macro 5 button, you're only remapping a single key. Since this isn't automating the action of multiple key presses, it's fine. However, I cannot map something like E>Q>R>W to be pressed with 1-second intervals to Macro 5, since it's automating multiple key presses and could grant me a competitive advantage.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
