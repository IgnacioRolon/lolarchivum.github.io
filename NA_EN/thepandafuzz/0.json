All 4 of my chests are available. This has happened before during the preseason where me or someone in my party scored S- or higher but I still haven't gotten a chest.","replies":[{"poster":"Hextech GunBun","date":"2017-06-26T03:52:51.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As per an older post, I was looking through to see why I wasn't earning a chest for the champions that had not gotten them yet, and I checked my match history. Per that post- Earning a S ranking garners a chest- I should have earned them for {{champion:99}} , {{champion:201}} , and {{champion:40}} . Here's my  match history, filtered for SR, as that was where I earned the rankings: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA1/50818874?map=1\n\nIs this an unintended bug due to the Dawn/Dusk event?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-07T23:17:51.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's definitely good to make sure you have chests available, but there are other factors for chest availability too.  Per our [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide, you can only receive a chest once per champion per season.  It looks like you already received a mastery chest for Renekton!  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"ThePandaFuzz","date":"2017-03-07T23:34:25.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh didnt know it was one champ per season.
