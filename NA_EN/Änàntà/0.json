I looked around and found out that I have match history from games I cannot have played. I've changed my password word. But I still am suspended for things I didn't do. I need some help ASAP. It seems like someone got into my account a few days ago. I have match history from about 4 days ago. I don't even have a computer to play League atm.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-20T23:46:31.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if you accidentally selected the wrong language, your ticket will get sent to the right place.
