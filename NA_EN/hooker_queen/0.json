My ping never stops changing, ranging from 40-350 ms depending on the mood. As you can see from the picture, it's completely periodic, but I'm not really sure what to make of it. My wifi otherwise is perfectly fine and stable, only League seems to be having this issue. I tried to do the 'network analysis' thing the Connection Issues page recommends, but since literally no browser supports Java anymore, I haven't been able to.\r\nAny help? Really would love to get back into league but I just can't with these issues. :'(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-05T22:32:18.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That screenshot you linked is showing an awful lot of packet loss spikes which is the main reason you're getting those ping spikes probably. Packet loss occurs when your connection is traveling to our servers so often times there's not a lot we can do on our end other than suggesting to reach out to your ISP. \n\nGo ahead and run a traceroute to get a better idea of where your connection is running into problems by using a program like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to the NA servers at 104.160.131.1.","replies":[{"poster":"Hooker Queen","date":"2017-12-06T01:08:31.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so while most of the results seemed fine, two hosts didn't seem to respond at all\n\n(https://imgur.com/a/Ptipj )","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-06T01:50:05.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeeeep that's what I was afraid of. Those \"no responses from host\" are where your problems are stemming from, and it seems like it's happening before it hits our servers. I'd suggest reaching out to your ISP with that traceroute as proof that something might not be working properly, but you can always hit up our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see if they might have any other tricks up their sleeves.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
