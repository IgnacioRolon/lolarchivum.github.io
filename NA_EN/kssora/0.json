The system isn't just something Riot made in a couple of hours with no though behind it. No, the system is the product of YEARS of experimentation and tuning. \n\nI'll break your argument down:\n\n> The report system does nothing but create a toxic environment for players. The game itself like every sport is a competitive environment, That said banning someone for making a statement to their teammates like you need to play more passive, or please stop feeding is not toxic behavior.\n\nI kind of agree. Depending on the context and the person you are speaking to, the sentence \"please stop feeding\" may or may not be considered toxic. But it doesn't mean that it's a smart sentence.\n\nWhen you say that, what do you think happens to the recieving player. Will they suddenly realise \"Oohhhh... I'm feeding! I'll just start playing better!\" or will they think \"I already am trying, fuck you\"?\n\nMy guess is the second one. That one sentence contributes to a negative environment, and adding \"please\" doesn't change that.\n\nFor the second one: \"play safe\".\n\nI agree, it's in itself not toxic, but the tone comes off mean. This is a case where adding a \"please\" WILL make a difference. \"Please play safe\" and \"play safe\" has very different tones.\n\nAgain, it's not necessarily toxic, but it has a high probability of being viewed as such. \n\n> yet statements just like that get reported and are successful in chat restricting or banning a player.\n\nBut, your chatlogs didn't display these. You straight up harrased the Zed and told others to report him for trolling. Will you doing this make him play better, or do you just use him as an excuse as to why you are losing the game. You were being deliberately derogative! \"get some kp **kid**\". Why add in 'kid'? It does nothing but make the Zed more negative. While yes, the system might view the things you mentioned (please stop feeding), as negative, it's going to view your chatlogs much differently and punish them much harsher, because they are much more toxic than just a \"play safe\".\n\n> This does nothing but create a toxic player, when the person gets chat restricted or banned for something that is not toxic they become a toxic individual because emotions get involved.\n\nThere have been **VERY** few cases over the last year where I have been on the Player Behaviour boards almost every day and seen someone who truly wasn't toxic get banned for it. So few that I could probably count them on one hand. Out of those, I remember atleast 2 people getting unbanned. The other probably did get unbanned aswell, unless they were lying in their original OP's.\n\nThis means, that if you've been punished you VERY likely are a toxic person. You can't then blame the system for *making* you toxic. You are just toxic. \n\n> When someone who was calm gets chat restricted for comments like those above they get angry and then they make worse comments and then get banned which leads to cycle of toxicity.\n\nI would like to see the facts. Not anecdotal evidence, but concrete objective facts. Like statistics. Like, did you know that most people don't get punished more than once? Which of course means, that your entire argument is false because it builds on the assumptions that getting punished makes you toxic. \n\nYou aren't toxic because you got punished, you got punished because you are toxic.\n\n> The ban/suspension report system needs to be completely overhauled you should be not be penalized for speaking when the other players can mute you.\n\nBased on the fact that your previous statement was completely false, I would like for you to actually explain why? The mute button isn't here so you can be toxic. The mute button is here because you *are* toxic. \n\nThe only reason we have the mute button is because removing toxic people in the middle of a match is dumb. You can't just kick them out, so there needs to be a temporary solution untill the system can remove the toxic players completely.\n\n> I understand a report for racism, feeding. cheating, afking, intentional loss in some other manner of speaking, however No one should be punished for venting their frustration when everyone else can easily mute them to not hear it.\n\nOrrrrr, you could just easily not vent your frustrations on your teammate. People do it all the time. Talk out loud, write in a notepad. Venting your frustrations on your teammate just makes everyone demoralized.\n\n> Your Current system does nothing but cause a cycle of toxicity no one reforms who gets banned ever.\n\nYou're right. If you get permabanned, it's because you are unlikely to reform. If you're mad you got banned, it's not the system that has to change, it's you.","replies":[{"poster":"KsSora","date":"2017-12-04T17:36:41.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"The zed in that example was harassing me first i am not quite sure what kind of saint you are as a human being but typically when people are met with negativity and conflict they do the exact same thing back.
