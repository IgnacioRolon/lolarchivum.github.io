There might be a setting within your config files that keep flagging that to happen, so let's try manually resetting those. Forewarning: this is going to reset most *all* of your settings, so be aware you may need to set those up again.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
