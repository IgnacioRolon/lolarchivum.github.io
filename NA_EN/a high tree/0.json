How many high school drop outs and stragglers will wanna give this a shot? Also pro players that are not in a professional team from other MOBA&#039;s will be attracted to league cause they make money by being good at the game. I thought of this because, so many challenger players sometimes don&#039;t want to go professional and play on a stage. It would give those with the incentive that this is just a stupid game a purpose to try harder and thus engaging more players into the game? It would be a good deal for those people who are really good at the game but don&#039;t think they can make it as  Streamer or a professional player to grind harder to reach top 5.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-02-08T22:07:51.156+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"it would take away the motivation to get hetter and replace it with the motivation to get money.  i can imagine the toxicity levels raising","replies":[]},{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2017-02-08T19:30:00.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should pay me for keeping their support team entertained... xD\n\nBut no... paying you for just playing a game and having better teammates than the other few thousand players is stupid.","replies":[]}]}
