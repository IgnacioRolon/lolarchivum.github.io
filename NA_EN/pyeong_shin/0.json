Taking into account the time the first minions do spawn, your first cannon would show up after 4 minutes.\r\n\r\nThis means you would get only get about 7 cannons during laning phase, giving you a max potential of 140 bonus health if you dont miss any.\r\n\r\nAfter the twenty minute mark you get one every other wave, which is makes it much better, but after that 20 minute mark your not going to be in your lane farming as much as you were since you&#039;ll be roaming and what not.\r\nWhile it would make it easier to stack at that point, with games tending to close out sooner, I feel like the mastery would just not be worth to take into lane at all. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I know it may already feel like it doesn&#039;t work in lanes for some, but there are some niche picks that can really use it well and can be used to try new and different play styles.

It would be kinda silly for the top laner to never influence other lanes, if he just makes sure to time it with the cannon wave for that lane and if he pulls it off one time he's already at a net positive for the rest of the game compared to before the wave changes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-07-25T16:38:36.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you considered how these asymmetry changes are reinforcing a particular meta that you want to see?
