Your username would be reverted to the original username, and the summoner name may have become inactive.  Verifying your email, though, should not reset your password.  If this is still an issue, you can reach out to us directly via support@riotgames.com.  We'll be able to directly reply back to you there and assist with recovery.","replies":[{"poster":"Jack Mana","date":"2017-09-16T18:25:02.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for the reply, will try what i can for a few more hours if not a day.
