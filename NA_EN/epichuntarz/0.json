Is she some sacred cow or something?  I get not releasing skin for champs like Taric (who has a complete overhaul coming soon), and Yorick (who Riot has admitted needs a rework but isn&#039;t really touching for a good long while)...but why Diana?  What&#039;s the hold up?  \r\n\r\nMany champs (including champs released after her) have gotten MULTIPLE skins in the time it took her to just get ONE.","replies":[]}
