While in a 1v1 scenario it would be better to be smaller and dodge skill-shots assuming your enemy has any (as targeted abilities go to the center and not the hit-box when deciding range) it is almost always better to have a larger hit-box then your allies when trying to peel or body-block an enemy by standing in their way forcing them to take the time to walk around you. {{champion:31}}  for example is very good at displacing enemies and peeling because of not only hit kit but also his sheer mass.

(Morg Q, Nidd Q)\n  \nBy the time Nidd has that kind of build I'd hardly say it's early game 30 kills or not. >-> (You should be tanky enough to deal with anything at that point)\n\nAs far as tanks go the ones that need the increase are fairly mobile compared to the likes of Cho'gath or Mundo, who have no mobility.\n({{champion:111}} Has Q grab to terrain)\n({{champion:54}}  Has Ult and Move-speed steal on Q)\nBuy Swiftness or mobi boots, between Iron and masteries you don't need mercs like you used to. Alacrity is even decent now if you don't need home-guard.\n\nAlso on the thing of early game. The tanks in question (Naut Malph) Are more often junglers and top laners then support or mids. (not that they can't go there) But a tank has much lower chance of dealing with skill-shots in the jungle, since nobody counter jungles anymore.  Or they go top where they often are against another tank, or somebody that doesn't have skill-shots to begin with. and even early game it's better you take the hit then your adc. \n\nAnd one last thing. As a Cho'gath main myself I can easily say that dodging skill-shots is just as easy when I have six stacks as when I have none, or when I play somebody like Soraka. Predicting a skill-shot is 80% of dodging one and anybody can do that regardless of hitbox.\n\nAll your arguments are Invalid unless under very specific scenarios.

This is wrong. Like I said but you seemed to ignore model size end up mattering very little in the long run as most skill-shot dodging is done before the skill-shot even fires.
