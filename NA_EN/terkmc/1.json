I didnt paid any attention to it. He got first blood on Gnar, and i congratulated him on his ballsy start paying off. Next i ganked his lane. Unknown to me there was a Rengar who snuck in the the bush before and jumped out mid fight. I was thinking of backing off when I see Darius keeps fighting to I went a long with it and got a double kill with a silver of health. All well and good we both b and refill our stuff. And then in the middle of me killing jg camp i see the notification that Darius had purchased Sword of the Occult.\r\n\r\n Bastard actually did it. This is ranked so I was ready for rain hellfire on him for that purchase while hes not even that ahead, putting at risk everything and not playing the game seriously, asking \"ARE YOU SERIOUS\" to which he responded \"I'm completely serious\". Right then, for some reason I had this feeling within me, that same feeling of recklessness and balls-to-the-wall fun I once had when I first started this game, the kind of no brake death-or-glory that got me gamming in the first place. I haven't felt like this in a year or so, instead resulting to a very tryhard mindset, meticulously evaluating each descision and what it meant and how to optimize and what is safe for the sake of winning, not of having fun. So for the first time in around a year, I went with it, I didn't held back all these precaution that made ranked a stressfull and mentally tiring exercise for me. I joined with the Darius \"balls to the wall eh? I like that, gonna camp top until you get those stacks\". And I had fun, I had fun camping the ever living shit out of top lane, I had fun charging blind straight down river to slam into the Gnar and deliver him into Darius hand, I had fun ulting into the enemy team without a second thought, even if it meant Id explode in a shower of blood and glory. In the end, although he lost all his 20 stacks and sold it to get another item, the lead Darius created was enough to win us the game. And in the ending screen, I felt sastified, energized, a 'WE FUCKING DID IT\" feeling instead of the usual \"One step up the ladder\" empty feeling, and it felt god damn amazing.\r\n\r\nTL:DR Darius rush Occult in ranked, went with it, rediscover the joy of gamming","replies":[{"poster":"Rhyto","date":"2015-03-17T14:02:13.545+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's quite rare to see those stack items being used in ranked I mean that really shows a player's confidence in their ability so its more like a threat or a warning to the enemy team \"Is this guy a smurf?

So im like ooooook well ill wait to rage to see how he does, well it was apparent very soon actually that this was not going to work. Riven was feeding the living hell out Zed top and refused to switch with me even though as Malz i would have had a much easier time (specially when Fizz took cleanse against me). So we lose and i was frustrated that not only did he pick Taric jg but also blamed everyone else, typical troll behavior honestly. \n\nThe next game my pref lane Top was instalocked by first pick, Hecarim, and my Malzahar was banned and the enemy was Katarina. So my next best Mid against Katarina is Karma, weird i know and i take full blame for not shutting her down (we ended laning phase 2/2 each... but she actually got ganks). Hecarim is getting his ass handed to him by Garen bot lane is just not winning... this was looking like another terrible game. It was a long and painfully slow loss...  \n\nThe irritation at this point is beyond me caring anymore about my rank, i was like 5 seconds from just instalocking Garen top (my main) regardless of what anyone said, since so far i havent been able to top and in all games my Top has lost a lane i thought i might have been able to win. Then i stopped. I thought to myself, lets just have fun, soooo i picked the one champion i ALWAYS have fun playing, Mordekaiser huehue. I go top and booooy did i have fun. Not only was i doing pretty good but my opponent, Vlad, was very nice and friendly throughout laning phase. I was able to ignore mid Kass feeding Diana and look past win or lose, Diana being overly strong was a little annoying because i was her main target lol. We did end up winning thanks to our Udyr finally evolving into his final form The Godyr and him and Ashe CC'd the hell out of their team while i layed down the deeps, we pushed to their nexus and finally won.   \n\nLesson learned, winning and losing is not as important as having fun. Having fun while still trying actually increases your odds of winning i guess. Evidence is that the first game i won i was irritated that my team did know how to play with a Malz leading to me getting left behind a lot or them blowing all their abilities on a champion i have ulted despite the fact im going to kill them (its not about KSing me its wasting abilities in a teamfight on a champion who might as well already be dead). That attitude carried over into my next games and got worse and worse which is why i lost and gave up so quickly.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-03-19T05:40:59.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just saying, but I have seen a terrifyingly effective Taric jungle.
