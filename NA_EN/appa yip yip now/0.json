It freezes my whole computer and i am unable to do anything. I have to restart my whole computer, but by that time the game is remade  and I have a leave. I have been in low priority for 5 min because of this once, and I am now in a 10 min low priority for 5 games. It has not happened as often before, but now it&#039;s almost everyday. After I play the first game and restart it&#039;s usually fine for the rest of the day. I need help fixing this please. :(","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-10T04:13:58.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you already run the repair tool for LoL?\n\nAlso run CHKDSK on the commandline to ensure your drive is not corrupted, if you are on windows, and consider doing a clean reinstall of your graphics driver, with DDU (https://www.wagnardsoft.com/ ) and a fresh installer (from Nvidia, AMD, or Intel website, depending on what you have)","replies":[{"poster":"appa yip yip now","date":"2018-12-10T04:57:25.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have run the repair tool, but it didn't fix the problem.\n\nI will try your other recommendations though .
