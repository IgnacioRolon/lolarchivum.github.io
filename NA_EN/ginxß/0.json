These disconnects last for just a few seconds. \"Attempting to Reconnect\" pops up, i cant move and after 2-5sec it works again. Sometimes i dont dc at all, sometimes every few minutes. My ping is constantly on 38ms.\nI have reinstalled Windows 10, i currently have no firewall, i have a LAN connection, i have changed the DNS Server, i have no third party programs for league, all of my drivers should be up to date as well.\nI also disabled a Windows Service called \"Superfetch\" which made it better, but the problem is still there...\n\nDoes anyone have a suggestion, is there something i can do?\nAny Help is appreciated :)\nGinxß\n\nEDIT: Since I created Port forwarding entries for all the Ports LoL needs, i dont have the Problem anymore...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-16T01:43:30.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been checking around and it does seem that there have been a good number of EUW ISP issues relatively lately, so I'm wondering if these dc's might just be related to random hiccups here and there. I'd still absolutely try some of the other steps outlined in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a basis, but go ahead and try running a quick traceroute to the EUW servers at 185.40.65.1 for me.

I don't want to miss anything though, so be sure to shoot the techs a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with this traceroute info too.
