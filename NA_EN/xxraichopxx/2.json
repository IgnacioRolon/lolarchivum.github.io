Hmm.\n\nThis reminds me of a post I saw long ago in Player Behavior and Moderation. There was this guy playing Warwick who went 7/0/5 or something (most kills and least deaths) and lost. He was reported and but not punished, but he made a thread about how toxic everyone was to him in that game.\nHe got some sympathy on the Boards because trying not to die is something that is smart to do in League of Legends, but he also got flamed really hard by Boards members (\"I would have reported you too, you were such a liability to your team and you were the reason they lost\") because people said that because he didn't die, he had the plurality of the team's gold and did nothing with it, and since he was playing Warwick and was not dying, he was probably playing way too safe and not doing much.\n\nIt was an interesting scenario, really. I was more inclined to side with the side that agreed with him, but I understood completely why people would be mad at him.","replies":[{"poster":"winteriscoming97","date":"2017-03-21T13:49:02.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My answer to that is \"who cares, it's ARAM\" I always build weird stuff like AS Nunu or adc Janna","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gubaguy","date":"2017-03-21T08:28:10.740+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://media.tenor.co/images/cf6505816ec6c5f1e0c15023262014e1/tenor.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2017-03-21T07:58:29.494+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"One time, I got Lulu.
