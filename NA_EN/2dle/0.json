Well, during that time, I kept receiving an error message stating that the PVP.net Patcher Kernel has stopped working. So I waited and just now, I tried it again, and yet once more, I have received the same error. Any insite on what I can do to resolve this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-12T22:51:21.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's most likely happening due to League not having all of the correct admin settings in order to run properly.
