It is similar to most games' tier system: white/common, green/uncommon, blue/rare, purple/epic and orange/legendary.  \nExcept Champion Mastery follows an entirely different color tier code:  \nhttps://www.lol-smurfs.com/images/upload/blog/2016/08/MasteryIcons.jpg  \nGold being 1 to 4, Red for mastery 5, Purple for mastery 6 and Turquoise for mastery 7.  \nAnd Skin Tiers follow yet another color tier code:  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/bt4QilW.jpg  \nSo are the old systems going to be reworked to fit the new one or will they stay the way they are?  \nIf it&#039;s the latter, then is the &quot;Universal&quot; system really universal?  \n  \nEdit: As Riot Saiyaka (or just Saiyaka?) pointed out, the Honor levels follow the new color code as well as the Prestige (aka your summoner level).","replies":[]}
