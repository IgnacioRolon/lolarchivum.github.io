You truly are crooks!!","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":14,"body":"So after years of playing this game when I was younger I&#039;ll admit I was toxic.. so I understand my accounts being banned but as a grown adult really? I&#039;ve had my same account for over 4 years actually even named it Spare Im Banned because it originally was a spare.. but I am only writing this post so hopefully riot sees me saying thank you. THANK you for taking my money for skins and champions disregarding the fact i spent currency on the game and banning my level 50 account.. Least now I can grow up.. You guys make no sense once so ever.. And the reason I was banned I wasn&#039;t even toxic.. but okay.. Playing one for all.. teammate picks mals.. all I said was I hated whoever picked mals.. SAID NOTHING TOXIC TO ANYONE BESIDES THE ILLAOI BEING TOXIC TO ME so.. k.. Wish there was a way to refund my money but you guys don&#039;t care you already received it so fuck your community right?","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-04-09T21:13:51.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has become clear that the OP has no desire to actually have a constructive discussion on this or any related topic.

Okay then.\n\nJust fyi, being toxic back to someone else who is toxic first is not actually defending yourself. Defending yourself implies that you're taking actions to prevent harm from coming to you. Flaming and insulting another person does absolutely nothing to stop them from continuing to flame and insult you, so it is not defending yourself. It's actually retaliation, and it only adds more negativity to the situation, making it even worse, which is why it's punishable. If you want to defend yourself from someone who is flaming you, you mute them, and then report them after the game if you feel it necessary.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-09T20:55:49.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post logs or GTFO.
