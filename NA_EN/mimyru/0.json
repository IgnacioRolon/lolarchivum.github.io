Ping remains relatively stable at around 34. In addition to the FPS, I will occasionally freeze for a few seconds during games. I'm also experiencing audio cutting out around the same time that the game freezes. It then loads back in a few seconds later like nothing happened. Prior to this recent patch, I did not have these sorts of issues. I've been playing this game since Season 3, and for the last two seasons on this laptop and have never had a problem (unless riot servers themselves were experiencing problems). I have attempted repairing the client twice. As for graphics settings, I currently have them set at medium to see if that would help any, but I used to play with high graphics and had no issues whatsoever. \r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\nWindows 10 OS.\r\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-3337U CPU @ 1.80GHz.\r\n64-bit OS with x64-bit processor.\r\n12GB RAM\r\nNVIDIA GEFORCE 740M Graphics card\r\nIntel(R) HD Graphics 4000\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any informaton that could help me that would be great!! It's really ruining this game for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-12T00:45:21.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There may be background applications causing your issues, especially since a repair and changing graphics settings didn't cause an immediate change.

GTX 970 and I still hit a max of 40 FPS while recording and everything. I found this just now and was going to post what you did when I scrolled to find this, lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Mimyru","date":"2016-12-12T23:09:51.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems the Game Bar was the culprit.
