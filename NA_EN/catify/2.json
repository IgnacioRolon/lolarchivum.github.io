After I finish a game, it doesn't take me to the ending page. Instead, it just says im in the middle of a game. I've been having to restart my client after every single game. My client randomly freezes now, i don't know if i can communicate with my friends during my frozen session. I don't know how to explain it, it's not really freezing but everything just _stops_. If i look over to my friend's game time, it says something like 330 minutes. How can i fix this??","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-08T01:16:06.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you transition from the game to the after match lobby, your network needs to make a new connection to the client. It seems like it's having a hard time making that new connection for some reason, which is causing the client to freeze up while it waits for the new information. \n\nWe should be able to get to the bottom of why this is happening by running through the steps in our [**Connection Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).
