I've been experiencing latency in my games since yesterday. My ping seems to be consistently at 33, but the game sometimes appears to do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Sometimes it stops for maybe 1/10th of a second, almost like it's trying to re-sync or something.\r\n2. Animations sometimes don't show up. IE: I was playing against a lux today and sometimes her E just didn't show up.\r\n3. Skill shots sometimes go through objects. I played Ryze yesterday and some of his Q skill shots would hit a target and continue past the target.\r\n\r\nAlso, some of the home page tiles are completely black. I've logged back in a few times, but for some reason I can only see the \"Spirit Fire Brand\" skin and the \"Demon Vi\" skin tiles for the shop, as well as the spectate game tile on the bottom right. Every other tile is completely black.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-28T23:27:36.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Countersnipe, \n\nSounds like you are having a lot of issues.
