We&rsquo;re Riot&rsquo;s Playtest Team, a group of high ranking League players whose job it is to play the hell out of things (lane tests, competitive testing, etc) and give actionable, objective feedback to designers.\n\nEvery two weeks - concurrent with the release of [patch notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-610-notes) - we&rsquo;re going to be hosting a discussion here on the state of balance on the current patch. **Take this opportunity to ask us any questions about the state of the game.**\n\nThis patch sees the release of Taliyah, and Blake Soberanis (primary playtester of Taliyah) will be fielding questions about her. For in-game footage of Blake on The Stoneweaver, check out the [VOD from our recent PBE stream](https://www.twitch.tv/leaguecommunity/v/64410127?t=0h44m40s)!\n\nBlake &ldquo;_Sobe_&rdquo; Soberanis\n\n>Taliyah is one of my favorite champions because she&rsquo;s easy to pick up but difficult to master (I always feel like I learn a new way to play Taliyah each time I play the champ).\n>\n>She has some very high base damage and ratios, particularly on the Q; its high damage and low cooldown is scary, and is only gated by exhausted ground. This makes roaming on her extra satisfying; you get more damage because you won&rsquo;t have been exhausting ground in bot lane.\n>\n>Taliyahs that get ahead can use the extra AP they have to snowball extra hard, but Taliyahs that fall behind will tend to suffer more than usual. It&rsquo;s probably not super likely that Taliyah will get solo kills in most matchups, so to get the AP she needs to make an impact, she&rsquo;s going to have to make plays around the map.\n\nAlso, [Patch 6.9](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-69-notes) shook up the game massively with new items, champion reworks, and systemic changes. With so much new in the game, there will be consequences falling out for weeks to come. This patch has been our chance to see how 6.9 played out and adjust slightly. Feel free to leave any questions about the Mage Update or the 6.10 followup patch in the comments below!\n\nWhat do you think about Taliyah? Curious what it&rsquo;s like to work as a Riot playtester? Maybe some questions about [Patch 6.10](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-610-notes) as a whole? As usual, feel free to ask any questions about balance or what exactly our job is! We will be around for the next few hours and will try to answer as many questions as possible.\n \n\nAdam &quot;_Afic_&quot; Cohen\nBen &ldquo;_Cezium_&rdquo; Burkhardt\nShawn &ldquo;_I Am The IRS_&rdquo; Currie\nMiles &ldquo;_Daydreamin_&rdquo; Hoard\nBao &ldquo;_Bao_&rdquo; Lam\nMattias &ldquo;_Gentleman Gustaf_&rdquo; Lehman\nNicholas &ldquo;_Nickwu_&rdquo; Smith\nBlake &ldquo;_Sobe_&rdquo; Soberanis\nTrevor &ldquo;_ThEntropist_&rdquo; Thernes","replies":[{"poster":"Latex Choker","date":"2016-05-17T19:10:22.798+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"The patch seems nice for bringing some of the struggling champions back up to snuff, but it feels like most of the champions who are too strong were left as is.\n\nTop of this list is Alistar, who had changes on the PBE that seemed to have just vanished.\n\nOther outliers like Trundle, Zed, Ekko, Ryze, and Lucian who have proven to be extremely dominate this patch were also ignored. I know there has been talk of Lucian and Ekko receiving changes for 6.11, but that seems a far ways off and it feels bad having to deal with the same batch of powerful champions for another 2 weeks. (Especially in the case of Lucian, who is in 60+% of games if not banned.)\n\nThis all flies in the face of Aurelion Sol, a champion who barely sees play yet enjoys statistical success seeing nerfs before any of the above.\n\nLast point is just an interesting anecdote from the patch. Earth Drake was changed to not amplify True Damage for the sake of clarity (RIP triple earth drake Nunu), but at the same time Turrets now reduce true damage by 66% as part of their backdoor protection. Doesn't that seem a bit contradictory?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ThEntropist","date":"2016-05-17T19:32:46.273+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"Alistar nerfs should be in I believe. They were just left out of the patch notes due to a mistake. \n\nAs for the champions that are seen as overpowered, I agree that waiting can really suck. We all play a fair amount of solo queue so we definitely feel the frustration tied to waiting 2 more weeks to see this very strong guys brought down. However, I'd rather make sure we spend a fair bit of time to make sure we are hitting these guys in the right spot instead of overreacting and making these champions unplayable for their playerbase. \n\nPick rate and win rate both matter when the live team decides what to nerf. However, Aurelion Sol was grossly out of line after 6.9 and that is why he was a priority. 6.10 was a lot of cleaning up things that fell out of line due to 6.9.\n\nSadly, I have no info on the true damage thing. Does seem odd to me as well. Sadly I wasn't too involved with those changes so I don't have any context.","replies":[{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-05-17T20:52:29.017+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot ThEntropist,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=qNczTVI1,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-05-17T19:32:46.273+0000)\n>We all play a fair amount of solo queue\n\nlies.

And now you two are pretending they weren't going to get out of hand with the QSS changes, 'sitting and watching' as they get to wreak havoc with nothing to stop them out other than a coordinated team, which isn't 90% of matches.\n\nIt honestly feels like Riot has stopped listening to the community. The last time the community's feedback was taken into consideration was during the juggernaut patch, and a few Rioters admitted regretting having listened to the community then.

This is astronomically high for a single champion.

I think he needs better scaling for how unreliable his damage is and it would also be nice if more offensive Ziggs plays could be encouraged. Currently, Satchel Charge has only a 35% AP ratio so Ziggs will not be inclined to use it offensively given his 325 MS unless a fight is already clearly won. For how vulnerable Ziggs becomes when using it offensively, along with it's 26 sec. CD, a much higher ratio is warranted. There's a lot more discussion about this [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/mBL8eh6n-ziggs-feedbackproposal?show=flat). What are your thoughts on the state of Ziggs, especially for those maining him?\n\nBTW: I know he got some help in 6.9 but I think the ult. not 1-shotting waves is an underestimated nerf so it kind of balances out. Previously, you could just ult the incoming wave and back then meet your laner for the next wave without missing a beat. To do the same thing now, you basically need to run TP. Siege scenarios also aren't full blown stopped like before because the minions still live with a sliver of health and that's often enough for the enemies to take the turret.

These are long overdue.\n\nI read the Riot comments about them in this thread and to me they read like lame excuses. These aren't new issues, Riot has had LOTS of time. The fear of over nerfing seems silly when at worst they would be too weak for a couple weeks before you can give them some power back if needed. You often over nerf stuff despite not acting on it for more than a month at times anyways, are you really getting that much out of leaving blatantly obvious problems alone for several patches?\n\nI get that in both cases it isn't winning a high % of the time that's the real problem. It's being highly mobile, spammy, bullying jerks that make the person playing them feel powerful while leaving opponents frustrated. While his play rate isn't as high as Lucian's and his ban rate isn't as high as Zed's, Yasuo is firmly in this category as well. All of these champions have had all of these problems for a very long time (generally since their release). If you won't buckle down and commit to bigger changes to them to truly fix those issues you NEED to accept keeping them crappy enough that we don't have to see them all the time. We're tired of dealing with them through bans.\n\nNo Youmuu's nerfs?! -_- The 45 second active cd is so absurdly low that it's often used to get to lane faster because it's safe to assume it'll be back up in time for a fight. The base stats are good. The build path is great. The fact that this has gone on for this long with not only no change but no mention by Riot as even something being looked at is downright silly. It's a good thing so few have caught on to how good Pantheon still is...\n\nI'm sure you guys are aware of the current new Youmuu's + Black Cleaver based build for Lucian that seems to be catching on (at least I hope you are). When the most popular adc is building an assassin item and a juggernaut item while ignoring all crit something is probably wrong.\n\nEDIT: The talk about Illaoi on the patch rundown podcast despite the stance given here in this thread about Zed seems contradictory. Imagine if Zed had Illaoi's win/play/ban rates (44.6%/2.1%/0.88% at plat+ in 6.9) and you were like \"eh he's frustrating to play against so we've been a bit afraid to buff him.\" Instead he's at 50.75% win rate, 9.13% play rate, and 78.14% ban rate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LaughingStapler","date":"2016-05-18T04:57:55.588+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"After seeing some AP ratios sprinkled in for Nocturne and Shyvana, I'm been reminded that Mundo has only one ratio on his entire kit and that's a measly 10% AP for his W. Could we also get a little love for squishier but more offensive minded Mundos? Even a small AP ratio on Q could make Liandry's a lot more viable (especially when snowballing). It's strange that Mundo has almost no reasonable way of increasing his damage while champions like Malphite, Rammus, Nautilus, Sejuani, Amumu, Zac etc. all have decent ratios but simply shy away from them because it doesn't fit their primary task. Mundo's damage falls off quite hard late game and is basically just a nice lifesteal target rather than scary so I want to try some builds with more punch to them in order to make up for his lack of hard CC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Divine God","date":"2016-05-17T21:57:34.175+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why is it that a champion can build defensive items and be able to produce so much damage? I understand the whole scaling with health abilities and that's only on a few champions but shouldn't items that make you harder to kill make you do less damage? I've seen so many champions build sunfire cape into whatever other tanky item and they still are doing more damage than most carries. Shouldn't you balance it out? Instead of making tanks being able to build defensively and do a lot of damage still, they should have some defects to make it balanced. This may be a dumb idea but I think making some really strong items have some sort of defect it would make the whole meta better.

You nerfed his cc, I get that, the 2 second stun was ridiculous. His direct nerfs were well needed. HOWEVER, you nerfed homeguards and removed tier 3 boots in the same patch. I dont think Riot realizes that this destroyed Aurelion Sol's late game. The Q E combo down mid that the contaminators called \"Super Difficult\" during MSI is near impossible, and even more dangerous to even attempt, now.\n\nNow, you  nerf him even more by increasing W's CD and decreasing his ult damage with no compensation. You are nerfing what makes him a unique champion. You created a zoning champion with a big obvious weakness: Champions with gap closures. There are a lot of them, and once they get on him there is almost no counterplay Aurelion Sol can do besides his ult, which has a 2 minute CD. While most gap closure skills are back 20 seconds at most. The bluntness of that weakness is the reason why his pick rate is so low but his win rate is so high. His design is counterplay through zoning: no gap closures = safe pick, gap closures = the most unsafe pick.\n\nTry to think of Sol as a newer version of Heimerdinger(Whom hasn't been nerfed in a long long time and doesn't really need to). If you pick the wrong champ against him you won't be able to so anything solo. But, because he is new you nerf so that he is punished for being picked against his \"safe picks\" and punished for being counterpicked. We barely have had a chance to find a way to use him, and once we have we now have to find harder ways to pull off this champion, if they are even still possible.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterAK","date":"2016-05-17T22:28:03.587+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree completely with this.
