We&rsquo;re Riot&rsquo;s Playtest Team, a group of high ranking League players whose job it is to play the hell out of things (lane tests, competitive testing, etc) and give actionable, objective feedback to designers.\n\nEvery two weeks (concurrent with the release of patch notes), we&rsquo;re going to be hosting a discussion here on the state of balance on the current patch. Take this opportunity to ask us any questions about the state of the game because, as we said, it&rsquo;s our job to analyze it from all angles.\n\nToday, we&rsquo;re here with Scott &ldquo;Sickoscott&rdquo; Hong, ex-professional jungler and top laner, S5 Challenger, and playtester to talk about the state of top lane and what it&rsquo;s like to be a playtester at Riot.\n\nIn this patch, we have nerfs going through on Nautilus and Pantheon, two champions who have dominated top lane for two patches. On top of that, notorious lane bully Renekton is getting buffed. What do we expect the top lane landscape to look like going into patch 6.5?\n\n_Nautilus and Pantheon both destroy other melee matchups in trades thanks to their superior threat range. On top of that, they have frequent windows to all-in squishy ranged champions. Even if they fall behind, they bring point-and-click CC for ganks.\n_\n\n_I expect more passive champions with short melee range to become stronger, especially Rammus and Shen. While they have lower threat ranges, they take more time to ramp up.\n_\n\n_Melee tanks who end up with decent damage in the late-game but still bring initiation and gank assistance shine in the current meta, but those two are the two likeliest standouts.\n_\n\n_Graves and Quinn should also surface as bully laners. They have fallen in win rate in recent patches thanks to the all-in threats of champions like Pantheon or Nautilus, in part due to the point-and-click CC which nullifies their range advantage and ability to dodge skillshots with their move-blocks. With those two out of the way, these ranged champions should have more room to breathe and start abusing the other top laners who don&rsquo;t have the luxury of not having skillshots.\n_\n\nYou&rsquo;ve been playing League of Legends in Season 1; what has kept you interested so long? Do you have a favorite champion?\n\n_I like playing champions who have a lot of room for skill expression, especially champions with &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; mechanics. Nidalee has so many tricks that you can play her in 1000 games and still do something better in the next game.\n_\n\nYou&rsquo;ve been at Riot for around a year; what is your favorite thing about your job?\n\n_I&rsquo;m surrounded by passionate LoL fans. I get to play the game everyday and talk with my coworkers about anything League related, from the LCS to my terrible solo queue games.\n_\n\nWhat do you find hardest about working in Playtest?\n\n_Trying to stay impartial and not having your emotions get the better of you when you&rsquo;re having a discussion with a teammate or a designer. Just because you hate playing against a champion doesn&rsquo;t mean it needs a nerf; I try my hardest not to be biased.\n_\n\nIf you&rsquo;d never discovered League of Legends, what would you be doing?\n\n_I&rsquo;d probably be teaching English in a foreign country. I enjoy teaching/coaching people who are eager to learn, whether it&rsquo;s English or League.\n_\n\nDo you have any questions about what it&rsquo;s like to work as a Riot playtester? As usual, feel free to ask any questions about balance or what exactly our job is! We will be around for the next few hours and will try to answer as many questions as possible.\n\n\nAdam &quot;_Afic_&quot; Cohen\nBen &ldquo;_Cezium_&rdquo; Burkhardt\nIsaac &ldquo;_Azael_&rdquo; Cummings-Bentley\nShawn &ldquo;_I Am The IRS_&rdquo; Currie\nMiles &ldquo;_Daydreamin_&rdquo; Hoard\nScott &ldquo;_Sickoscott_&rdquo; Hong\nMattias &ldquo;_Gentleman Gustaf_&rdquo; Lehman\nNicholas &ldquo;_Drecker_&rdquo; Shapiro\nNicholas &ldquo;_Nickwu_&rdquo; Smith\nBlake &ldquo;_Ex Shepherd_&rdquo; Soberanis\nTrevor &ldquo;_ThEntropist_&rdquo; Thernes\n\nLink to [Patch 6.5 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-65-notes)","replies":[{"poster":"ZachOfAllTrades","date":"2016-03-08T20:24:48.562+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey guys! Just wondering if anyone wants to share their story on how they came to work for Riot as a Tester?\n\nThanks, from someone who wants to get there someday!","replies":[{"poster":"Skarnye West","date":"2016-03-08T21:19:40.100+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hmmm...in 2011, I graduated college with a Linguistics degree, and no clue what I wanted to do with my life. I'd started playing League of Legends earlier that year, and had found I had a knack for figuring out what was strong (that is, I was good at math). I was working for a language test design company, and I was **miserable** at work.\n\nI started writing a few articles on strategy, but nothing that really took off. I started a 5s team. Back then I was gold or something unimpressive, but I was convinced I was going to go pro. Really, I just didn't like my job and used League of Legends as an escape.\n\nIn the summer of 2012, I saw a posting on A Different View - a mathcrafting blog started by DiffTheEnder - looking for new writers. DiffTheEnder saw something in my writing and decided to bring me on as a contracted writer, and I started diving into mathematical analysis of things like \"which AD items are strongest?\" or \"do Corki/Kog'Maw/Vayne actually need Last Whisper?\"\n\nAfter awhile, though, I realized there was only so much math to do, and that - once people figured out the optimal itemization - LoL would come down to strategy, not item choices. As such, I started covering the esports scene. By Season 2/3, I was watching every major tournament, and playing in Go4LoL whenever I could (still Gold). Back in the day, Reign of Gaming actually was pretty big, so I started getting recognized in game all the time, and that was pretty cool. I think that's when I started to think that maybe I could make a career of this if I just worked hard enough at it.\n\nAt some point I wrote an article on gender in League of Legends, and this guy from some website reached out to see if I wanted to write for them. I was super excited, but I never heard back from him.\n\nIn Season 3, I lost my job in language test design, and that was all the motivation to go all-in. I dropped almost everything else in my life. Before, I'd been a pretty social guy, definitely an introvert, but the type of person who loved to go to board game nights or play D&D or whatever. But from that day on, I realized what it meant to **work** for something. I was solo queuing maybe 12 hours a day and streaming most of it despite only having like 25 viewers. My 5s team had been me and 4 friends, but I ditched my friends when I realized that they weren't as driven as I was. I started a new team with 2 guys I knew from Idaho, and we started scouting for other players.\n\nLike I said, I'd been pretty mediocre at the game, but suddenly it was like all the time I'd spent researching pro play had paid off. I cruised to Diamond in like a week, and Diamond 1 a few days after that. To pay the bills, I began writing more and more articles, coaching teams trying to break into the Challenger scene, and giving lessons on how to climb the ladder, as well as doing all sorts of freelance writing in the academic and corporate world.\n\nIn Season 4, a friend of mine noted that lolesports was looking for writers, and I applied - and was contracted - to write articles on professional play. At that point I had literally no income but writing articles. Before that point, I'd been making like $500 a month, and had been blowing through what savings I'd had leftover from my previous job. I don't think I should be talking about Riot's pay, but let's just say that it was significantly more than I was used to. I started *spamming* articles, writing sometimes 10-12 articles in a month. In less than a month, I'd gone from some guy who used to write freelance articles to the most prolific writer Riot had.\n\nAmusingly, one of the other freelance writers working with me was Taylor Cocke, the same guy who had talked to me about writing for that website before. I applied for a contracted position as a Web Content Coordinator at Riot, and apparently I'd built up a pretty good reputation for the quality and content of writing I was churning out. After a long interview process, I ended up losing out on the job to Taylor, but my supervisor at Riot made another offer, for a remote contractor position running the streams and the online videos and still writing articles.\n\nI took the offer, although I didn't really shine working remotely. When I'd been freelance, I could work at my own pace - 80 hours one week, 10 the next. I struggled working as a contractor, and I'm really surprised Riot didn't just fire me. I wasn't doing anything glaringly bad, but I was constantly making small mistakes. Worse, they were the same small mistakes again and again, and while I was learning and improving, it was quite slow. I've always been pretty good at most things I try, so I was pretty frustrated to be failing so consistently, and thought about quitting. My friend - working esports at Riot Berlin - told me I should move to Los Angeles and just start working onsite to see how that improved my experience.\n\nIt was just what I'd needed. I **loved** working out of an office and I began learning a lot. A bit of networking later and I met with the Manager of Playtest, and mentioned that I'd always been interested in Game Design. I went through two interviews, and started a month later.\n\nThe lesson I learned from all of this is that working in the video game industry is pretty much like working anywhere else. My job is still a lot of hard work, I need to keep consistent hours, and sometimes I have to work to get good at something that doesn't come naturally. This seems obvious, but it wasn't to me initially. I get up every morning ready to challenge myself and do something I wouldn't have been good enough to do a month ago.\n\nSometimes I regret having to wake up. Sometimes I dread having to bike to work. I keep hours that many might consider insane, and my friends have spent the last few years giving me shit for being so hard to schedule time with. But I'm never miserable to **be** at work, and that means the world to me.\n\nTL;DR - didn't want to work language test design, wrote articles about the math of LoL, tried to go pro, failed to go pro, worked as a coach/analyst for pro teams, got hired by Riot to write about esports, transferred to Playtest once I was here. Constantly improving your craft is **hard** but worthwhile. If you're driven to get somewhere, never take no for an answer, and always focus on your own improvement, you might not get where you want to be, but you will get **somewhere** and you'll find that you're pretty good at it.","replies":[{"poster":"FlacidGnome","date":"2016-03-08T22:31:29.877+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":29,"body":"\"Back then I was gold or something unimpressive\" I've read this from so many Rioters posts.

That's good for a lot of people, but in the context of the article it was a way to say you weren't quite adequate enough for what you had wanted to do, and that shouldn't have offended anyone. I guess I agree he should have the right to say that he was offended, but in this specific case there isn't really any learning point. Gold is just a ranking and if you put in enough time anyone can get there. If you're stuck in silver or bronze, no matter how it feels to hear, this is because you aren't good enough to move up YET. But it is JUST a game anyway. It's so silly to be offended over something like ranking in a game. :) I think both have a point, but at the same time, you've done nothing wrong. \"...but I was convinced I was going to go pro.\" is the part he left out, and that gives the former quote context.","replies":[{"poster":"Skarnye West","date":"2016-03-10T18:51:06.223+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't disagree with you.

However, it feels like he has very little synergy with the main jungle items. \n\nFor example, if J4 gets Warrior enchant he'll do great damage, but will be way to fragile to do his job (initation), while Pantheon, Rengar, etc. are just fine. If he gets Cinderhulk, his damage is negligible until he gets his next item, as opposed to Rek'Sai who wrecks people with it. \n\nBasically, J4 (and Vi, now that i think about it) rely on early ganks, but can't really do it effectively until they have two items.

Why do these 2 champions need such special focus, especially when graves is already so overwhelmingly strong? I mean, graves has everything he needs (except more shells in his gun): high burst, mobility, reload mechanic so he doesnt lose damage, tankiness. Graves has also had a ridiculous win rate since the pre-season. I highly doubt he fell below %50 win rate. I think they're just pushing the tanky-overwhelmingly-bursty-graves-meta as much as they wanted to push the adc-mordekaiser-meta and they're continuing to push it because they are receiving less negative feedback.\n\nCurrently it feels like graves doesn't even have to get ahead to become ahead.

Time for the math. \n\n* With no items, the old Kog'maw recieved 1.5% attack speed buff, and the additional 50% from his w. \n         1.5*18+35%= 62% attack speed with only a minimum 15 damage at level 18. \n\n* The new Kog'Maw recieves 3.5 attack speed growth per level, and instead of an attack speed buff on his w, he received a magic on hit buff of 25.\n         3.5%*18= 63% with 25 magic on-hit at level 18. \n\nSure it may only be 1 measly percent of an attack speed, but in return, you now have 30* magic on hit to add. \n\nWhile this may seem like a nerf, at level 18, he has more attack speed, more on-hit damage, and hey, his q is a little less costly. \n\nThis will be on the Test on Friday. Do not forget to study, have a nice night.\n\n**Edit**: *  The on hit is 30, not 25.","replies":[{"poster":"Skarnye West","date":"2016-03-09T19:38:05.085+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope more people read this :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"jazzerbone90","date":"2016-03-08T22:25:08.336+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Trying to stay impartial and not having your emotions get the better of you when you’re having a discussion with a teammate or a designer. Just because you hate playing against a champion doesn’t mean it needs a nerf; I try my hardest not to be biased.\" \n\nI do not think nerfing Nautilus is a good response to people finally realizing that he is a good and very versatile champ. As tanky as he is, his biggest weaknesses are consistent damage and good disengage champs. His cooldowns are high enough that if burned poorly, makes him a burden for team fight. As for his offense, I know his E has been nerfed once already, and the rest of his abilities do little damage anyways.  I can maybe see making his ult a skill shot ult, somewhat like braums (maybe even a combination of braum/nami). Also, the peel he provides for his squishier teammates is also mediocre. His passive shines in small skirmishes, but is greatly diminished, and almost irrelevant in team fights against backline diving compositions. Nautilus is my favorite champ in League and I truly think he is balanced. I do not think he has been given a fair amount of time for people to react to him strategically before being considered for nerfs. I cannot speak on behalf of pantheon players because I am by no means a pantheon expert, but nautilus is a great tank without being a total juggernaut. \n\nOn another note, all these champions keep getting buffs, nerfs, or unnecessary reworks (*cough shen), but 0 attention has been given to Yorick. Even skarner got reworked in the juggernaut patch. This is a champ that needs the  most work and I do not know why riot seems to be ignoring that fact.","replies":[{"poster":"krazy4golf","date":"2016-03-09T01:57:20.651+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realize Yorick's rework is scheduled for latter this year correct","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crovax II","date":"2016-03-08T23:12:32.345+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"because no one likes yorik.

A lot of the features that we Hecarim mains loved about him are gone, particularly early homeguard rush. It allowed him to snowball well so he could fund his expensive build, he could also stay relevant if he fell behind - giving him some elbow room in bad matchups.\n\nHecarim's gimmicks is what made him unique. Many people found him frustrating because he was an odd champion. Currently he doesn't feel like he's filling any niches. He doesn't have the damage to be a dive-assassin, when building full tank he feels extremely squishy, his engage isn't as reliable as other champions (he's very easy to flash away from, and his knockback + fear mechanic only pushes the enemy further away if they do flash). \n\nI can understand removing the ghosting passive even though it restricts him mostly to jungle, but it feels like the core parts of Hecarim are gone and something needs to fill in the gap. My friends and I joke that Hecarim should have Corki's package to make up for the lack of early homeguards. But I would be more than excited to see any unique interaction such as \"the package\" added on to Hecarim.\n\nBuuuuuut I think a simple QoL change to Hecarim would be increasing Onslaught of Shadow's missile speed. It isn't a very reliable engage tool which (from my understanding) is what you guys want Hecarim to be; an initiator.","replies":[]}]}
