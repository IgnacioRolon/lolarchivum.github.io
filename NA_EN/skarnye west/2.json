Think of us as your high-Elo friends who happen to have played the new patch, rework, or champion long before it ever came out.\n\nEvery two weeks, concurrent with the release of [patch notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-615-notes), we&rsquo;re going to be hosting a discussion here on Dev Corner. **Take this opportunity to ask us any questions about how we feel about the game or what it&rsquo;s like to work as a Riot playtester**.\n\nSeveral of our playtesters have competitive experience with lane swaps, so if you want to know how we think they will affect lane swaps - or just regular play - leave your questions below!\n\nIn competitive play, we expect to see fewer fast-push lane swaps. Specifically, we expect that lane swaps will now at least be contested, thanks to the value of tower first blood and the weaker bot side towers. This may change after the first five minutes of the game, but by then champions have their full basic kits (no ultimates yet) and can take better advantage of the mechanical aspects of the game in additional to the tactical.\n\nIn solo queue, we think that champions who can poke towers early on (Caitlyn?) might have the **option** of taking towers somewhat earlier, but that it probably won&rsquo;t have much of an impact.\n\nWe will be around for the next few hours and will try to answer as many questions as possible.\n\nAdam &quot;_Afic_&quot; Cohen\nPreston &ldquo;_Hinder_&rdquo; Bunker\nBen &ldquo;_Cezium_&rdquo; Burkhardt\nShawn &ldquo;_I Am The IRS_&rdquo; Currie\nDon &ldquo;_Aesah_&rdquo; Ding\nNicolas &ldquo;_Gleeb_&rdquo; Haddad\nDan &ldquo;_Penguin_&rdquo; Hardison\nMiles &ldquo;_Daydreamin_&rdquo; Hoard\nBao &ldquo;_Bao_&rdquo; Lam\nRobert &ldquo;_RobertxLee_&rdquo; Lee\nNicholas &ldquo;_Nickwu_&rdquo; Smith\nBlake &ldquo;_S0be_&rdquo; Soberanis\nTrevor &ldquo;_ThEntropist_&rdquo; Thernes","replies":[{"poster":"InTheory","date":"2016-07-26T03:36:24.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"playtestpenguin","date":"2016-07-26T06:50:54.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That change actually didn't go through -- Cannon minion functionality will be the same.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-07-26T12:07:18.002+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyway, it was already 1 every 3 waves before, no?

In other words, W would still be best used as a utility spell so it would feel worse to give up more damage in those cases.\n\nZiggs seems fine but middle of the pack at best due to his unreliability and squishiness. Still, buffing the satchel damage ratio to 40% or even 50% AP wouldn't be significant in actual gameplay. \n\nThe cooldown is too long to abuse this ability and he also depends on the utility. His all-in dueling would be better but it would still not be something he's good at. I think he deserves a minor bump in W damage because he leaves a lot to be desired late game and isn't really a lane bully either (he might poke you a bit but it's not a kill threat unless you choose to disrespect him). \n\nHis utility is mediocre so all he really has is decent consistent damage. Just compare Ziggs to the massive utiltiy and safety of Anivia. I'd say her damage is on par or better than his while she has far better zone control, more safety, more utility and more burst. Her poke is a bit better but I could use Vel'Koz and say the same thing.","replies":[{"poster":"The Last Ballad","date":"2016-07-27T18:13:16.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But neither of them can destroy towers that have been poked down with the defenders still near...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Newten","date":"2016-08-08T03:11:47.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So everything is based on win rates?

I'm not saying they can't add more, but the number is getting unwieldy from a balance perspective given how many different comps. can be created. You already see this because only about half the roster is used with any regularity so the number of champions, while large on paper, isn't really relevant. \n\nUntil League actually can claim to make use of its full champion roster, it seems silly to add more (at least from a game perspective rather than business). I still remember how Blizzard was actively removing units from SC2 early on due to lack of sufficient gameplay function to offset the balance issues they invariably create. With that said, it's too early to judge Kled.
