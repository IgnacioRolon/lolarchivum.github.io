We&rsquo;re Riot&rsquo;s Playtest Team, a group of high ranking League players whose job it is to play the hell out of things (lane tests, competitive testing, etc) and give actionable objective feedback to designers.\n\nEvery two weeks (concurrent with the release of patch notes), we&rsquo;re going to be hosting a discussion here on the state of balance on the current patch. **Take this opportunity to ask us any questions about the state of the game.**\n\nIt&rsquo;s been a few weeks of Patch Chat, and we&rsquo;re still iterating on the format. With three new members starting in the last few weeks, we welcome any feedback about the format of Patch Chat. What do you like about Patch Chat or want to see in the future? What do you hate?\n\n[Patch 6.12](http://leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-612-notes) is being called the ARAM Patch, but it also sees changes to ADC itemization, Youmuu&rsquo;s Ghostblade, Catalyst items, and Grasp of the Undying.\n\nWith sustain for tanks (as well as Catalyst mages like Swain) lower on this patch, and marksman damage upped somewhat, tell us how see the meta shifting!\n\nCurious what it&rsquo;s like to work as a Riot playtester? Have any questions about the patch as a whole? As usual, feel free to ask any questions about balance or what exactly our job is. We will be around for the next few hours and will try to answer as many questions as possible.\n\n---------------------\n**Playtest Team**\n\n* Adam &quot;_Afic_&quot; Cohen\n* Preston &ldquo;_Hinder_&rdquo; Bunker\n* Ben &ldquo;_Cezium_&rdquo; Burkhardt\n* Shawn &ldquo;_I Am The IRS_&rdquo; Currie\n* Nicolas &ldquo;_Gleeb_&rdquo; Haddad\n* Miles &ldquo;_Daydreamin_&rdquo; Hoard\n* Bao &ldquo;_Bao_&rdquo; Lam\n* Mattias &ldquo;_Gentleman Gustaf_&rdquo; Lehman\n* Nicholas &ldquo;_Nickwu_&rdquo; Smith\n* Blake &ldquo;_S0be_&rdquo; Soberanis\n* Trevor &ldquo;_ThEntropist_&rdquo; Thernes","replies":[{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2016-06-14T19:19:29.060+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":37,"body":"1) How has Nidalee been fairing with her recent, **awful**, nerfs? \n\n2) Can you guys actually hit Zed with the nerf bat instead of giving him love taps?

And emotional feedback is very good at helping to flag what champions need reworks. If a champion (such as Zed) on paper and in testing labs sucks: his winrate is garbage and is borderline Urgot tier, then what you've discovered is that it is the kit that is the balancing problem.\n\nLook, arguing with people saying \"your feelings on this champion are wrong, he is actually bad\" is never going to work, and you just paint yourself as somebody in the realm of \"I am a game designer, and thus I know better than you.\" And nobody wants you to do that. Firstly, we know that's not what you mean. But secondly and mainly, it is just as non-helpful to the conversation as the people you're arguing with. Just because you say Zed is weak and people are wrong to think he is banworthy, does not contribute to solving the problem of the differential between perceived strength and actual strength. All you're doing with those statements is fanning an anti-riot sentiment where people believe there to be some \"We know better than the players\" mindset.\n\nIt doesn't help the conversation and I think you can do better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ExplodinIndian","date":"2016-06-14T21:48:17.559+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":13,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"NewGuy101","date":"2016-06-14T22:58:19.906+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":2,"body":"If win rate determined who was good or bad, then we would see Amumu at LCS and not Poppy","replies":[{"poster":"kyll yo","date":"2016-06-15T02:00:38.460+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"this comment is just wrong, lcs is a lot more organized and differant champs can be played because they are way better then almost all players, and are always communicating so they can use their abilities to synergize and other stuff like that.","replies":[{"poster":"NewGuy101","date":"2016-06-15T02:16:22.244+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's what I said.

You've been given a great opportunity to collaborate/discuss with respected employees from Riot. So, I think it would be wise to take a second and ask yourself if what you're posting is going to fuel a positive discussion... and will it affect the appropriate changes positively that you want to see in League of Legends.  Before you ask a question, contemplate each question in relation to every other champion existing now and every match possible from start to finish.  I think that is what Riot THENTROPIST is referring to with Zed. His win rate is lower for many reasons, some of which are from his nerf, translating into diminished game tactics involving him (roaming, itemization in terms of gold efficiency, etc...).  So, statistically speaking, it is much more difficult to win with zed due to community feedback... good or otherwise.  Mechanically speaking, Zed's abilities allow him to be almost unrivaled to average players much like the damage in Katarina's burst if she manages to catch you.  This game highly considers reaction time, but it should consider reaction time and tactics for the average community/player.  Zed is a champion the average community has trouble tactically beating due to the average player's reaction time and potential with tactics.  In my opinion, the problem is not the champs. The problem is traced back to when you first play this game... the tutorials.  I believe if there were a much more detailed tutorial that could teach players game mechanics and punishing an opponent for grabbing cs, laning phase, structure of kiting, and we had open access to this material on a hosted Riot website... knowledge on how to play against a pk/roaming champion like Zed would allow us to shift our focus on more pressing issues like where does Riot intend on shifting the meta, why, and what do we have to look forward to seeing in the near future?  Remember, Riot employees should be respected even when you are so frustrated you could just slam your computer on the ground... Civility, eloquence, and structure will make Riot create changes more quickly and favorably for players like us. Thank you, Riot, for your efforts.","replies":[{"poster":"EasierZedThnDone","date":"2016-06-15T18:14:44.698+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very well said Sir!!!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lebna","date":"2016-06-15T02:48:08.320+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amen!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BADxW0LF","date":"2016-06-14T20:10:13.709+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":5,"body":"Well, to a lot of people he is the most toxic champion in the game so, yeah, a lot have people show hatred for this single champion.

The only way to counter this ability is if Zed does a mistake and goes in when he is low or if you use Zhonya. Otherwise he has a whole 6 second to blink back even if you manage to CC him through his mobility (for all I know no champion can lock down a single target for 6 whole seconds on his own).\n\nHaving to wait for someone to make a mistake to counter him is NOT healthy gameplay. The only weakness Zed would have is that he is squishy, otherwise he has all the range, safety, damage and mobility he could wish for.

Staying past one or two seconds actually makes Zed more likely to die trying to pick up a kill. Zed's ult takes like a second or two before it even activates, giving you plenty of time if your team is around to get right beside him so that you can destroy him the moment he appears. If it's a 1v1, you're dead, because you're supposed to be dead. You don't just walk around all solo with a Zed out there. He's an assassin and his job is to kill priority targets.

For instance, if Zed ults you while you are walking away from him towards your tower, your basic instinct is to keep moving right? This is the thing that people do to give Zed his maximum damage from his ult proc. All he has to do if w,e,q in a straight line and its over. The way to beat this is while his ult is casting (when him and his shadows descend on you) move in a straight line. But, as soon as he is on top of you and reappears, flash or move to the side. This makes it harder for Zed to hit you with two Q's and even one W because you arent in a straight line like he would thought you'd be.

So if you have anything in particular that you wanted to chat about, I&#x27;d be happy to discuss in greater detail.\n\nI think I can elaborate on this one. I play almost exclusively mages in mid, and have been around since Fizz's release (god those days were awful). Never before have I felt this \"forced\" into linear build paths as a mage before. The first few items most mages are forced to build are Catalyst, Tear, Seeker's, Lost Chapter, or Negatron Cloak. Out of these items, 2 of the give AP. And out of the items they build into, few of them give over 60 AP when completed.\n\nSure between Elder Dragon/other things, overall AP MIGHT (rng on dragons is not something I particularly feel is fun...) be higher at full builds, but prior to that at almost all stages it feels like mages do less damage. CDR itemization really just kind of hides this problem. Because every item (not really) has CDR you can throw spells more, but to throw more spells you need mana. But to get mana you need to give up on higher AP items.... So it's kinda a vicious cycle in midlane where nobody ever really feels good about anything they're building. Seeker's armguard is pretty much obsolete when your opponent gets serrated, and the double tap nerf to Zhonya's feels especially bad. \n\nAcross the board, you're right. AP is probably technically higher at full build. But I bet (and you can look at numbers that we cannot) that until roughly level 14+, at all stages of the game, AP is lower across the board. (meanwhile the only champions that have had changes to their ratios to compensate for all these item changes were mages who got updated.... meanwhile the rest of the cast sits on S1-5 ratios.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Adalvar","date":"2016-06-15T00:16:59.049+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the point is how low base AP is at the moment and how sometimes even high-end burst mages can feel underpowered because they don't get enough raw AP in their first set of items to fuel their burst combos causing them to be unable to burst down priority targets by a very small margin on several occasions. Cases like this include Brand, where despite having massive AOE dmg, has low AP scalings and requires too much set up to fully execute his combo in a teamfight and making him nigh-useless ir if he's even slightly behind on the item curve. On the other end of the spectrum this causes mages with either massive scalings but slow/delayed combos such as Anivia and Viktor, or sustained damage mages like Swain and Azir, or even mages with mixed scalings such as Vlad to step in and fill the void left by pure burst mages.\n\nThat also creates an over-reliance on AP multipliers like Deathcap and Void Staff, both items that have wonky buildpaths and stiff combine costs, or on the AP multipliers of Infernal and Blue Buff which are conditional on too many outside factors (dragon and buff steals and even the willingness of the jungler to give the blue to the mid laner). When comparing AP casters to their AD counterparts, they have a much heavier reliance on raw AP, unlike AD who can scale via armor pen, crit or attack speed, thus not requiring as much raw AD, unless you are Jhin ofc. In a nutshell it's not satisfying to have your core power curve be reliant on external factors.\n\nAlso the fact that even with stacking items, AP amounts won't scale up as much due to the mana and AP nerfs to ROA, causing a class of champions who already had troubles scaling into lategame, even more issues in scaling into lategame and creating an issue where the powerspike gained from a ROA/Seraph's fully stacked doesn't grant the same satisfying powerspike it did before. Case and point of the former, Twisted Fate who went ROA to get a potent spike and be more relevant mid-lategame. Case and point of the latter, Karthus, who went double stacking and ended up at full build with over 1000 AP, which generated a visible impact on his ultimate lategame. In other words the end game reward for the risk you took with going with stacking items isn't quite as good/satisfying from a pure damage perspective. \n\nA simple point to this would be to somewhat increase AP amounts on basic items and heavily increase AP on stacking items but lower the AP multiplier passives like Rababon and Void Staff (and perhaps streamline it's buildpath/lower its combine cost) so that mages can get their powerspikes in a more satisfying/organic/steadier way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"majulito","date":"2016-06-14T23:01:04.533+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"So mages have to rely on a temporary buff whose timer is known to everyone and a random dragon spawning? Ap values are lower with the item update. However cdr is plentiful to the point where its almost harder to not hit the cap or exceed it than be below it.

How can a champion that is intentionally frustrating to play against be justified as anything but bad game design?\n\nSure, dying can feel frustrating, but it should always feel fair - like you died because you made a mistake or the other player played better than you.\nNo one feels outplayed by Zed.  He does not feel fair to play against.  (There are a few other champions with the same problem.)\n\nHis laning phase is completely oppressive.\nHe can easily push most mana users out of lane.\nHe has strong waveclear and incredibly tower-killing ability - on a champion who is supposed to be designed to kill enemy squishies.\nHe has practically no costs - meaning he can stay in lane forever.\nHe is AD, making him much freer to take defensive runes, since AD does not conflict with MR, unlike AP.\nHe can rush Hexdrinker which makes him almost impossible to kill (while mages have no equivalently strong item to build against him.)\n\nHis assassination is top-notch and has very little counterplay.  He gets in range, and then either the Zed player hits all his skills, or he doesn't.  There's little space for his opponent to make skillful plays to avoid or reduce his damage, except if they have instant/skillshot hard CC or a shield.\n\nHe is relatively safe, both in lane (shadow escape) and even more so in all-ins.  His tiny 1-second window does almost nothing to make him vulnerable for someone with an untargetability-gapcloser and near-instant escape.  He can apply all of his damage in 1 second and then run away with almost no opportunity of counterattack.\n\n\nIn short: he is really strong at laning.  He is really strong at taking towers.  He is decent at roaming.  He is very good at assassination.  He can escape easily.  The item system also favours him heavily, especially against mana users.\n\nPeople hate having to deal with that.  Even in games where you win, you have to suffer being miserable for the entire laning phase until he finally starts to fall off a bit in teamfights (if he hasn't managed to get fed too much by then, and your team brought enough tanks.)\n\n\nExplain to me why a champion like this is considered to be a healthy addition to the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Black JesusV","date":"2016-06-14T22:32:32.040+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":28,"body":"As a platinum to another platinum - \n-Zed is an assassin it is his Job to have the amounts to kill/slay one person fast, Much like talon and Leblanc AND FIZZ? REALLY KID.\n-Zed punishes champions that can't keep a range from him or non-mobility champions BECAUSE: he's an assassin he's fast and deals DMG\n-Zed's waveclear is mediocre compared to meta mid laners right now, how dare you say something as stupid as that. He's rated as a low wave clear champion that has to expend a 18 second cooldown on his W to clear 1 wave as efficient as a syndra, azir, talon, zilean would do, your statementwas just stupid and un-true\n-Zed doesn't have cost, but he doesn't have waveclear without putting himself in harms way just like stated above ^ control mages easily out-push and can SUSTAIN so much easier than he can without Hexdrinker/3 pot start\n-WHAT AD CHAMPION DOESNT TAKE TOWERS DOWN FAST?

Assassination - Assassins are built around taking 1 opponent out at a time am i right? just like in the movies. SO WHY NOT ZED? HES AN ASSASSIN RIGHT PEOPLE? So here you have a champion built to 1v1 all the time RIGHT HERE, much like Leblanc. SO WHY BE ALONE? Zeds don't Ult dive into a team of 5v5 and come out clean unless you're in an elo below low gold. SO, WHY BE ALONE? HE WAS DESIGNED FOR THAT, NOT TEAMFIGHTS.\n\n2. He's safe with his shadow escape that is an 18 second CD AT MAX RANK compared to leblancs 12 Second CD WITH her R to mimick the ability for 0 Mana cost and you say he's safe? He expends the ability and is useless, all good junglers know to gank zed when he doesn't have W or to all in when HE doesn't HAVE W. 18 second window... UHM HELLO? S2 called they want their excuses back.\n\n3. in-short OR Summary -  Zed falls off hard at the 30 minute mark unless your team is extremely behind against him because of how itemization works as well as a simple exhaust or staying with your team, counterpicking against him etc. Zed is a very balanced champion and they keep spoon feeding idiots like you an excuse to say you lost cause \"They had zed ermahgerd GG\" There's so many flaws, It's really upsetting. I'm not a Zed fanboy either, just more champions need looking at than the champ that's been nerfed to the dirt BECAUSE THAT'S HIS PLAY-STYLE AND PEOPLE LIKE HIM.\n\n4. Health - The game meta shifts every 1.0 or .5 patches, it will pass, remember when Tanks were OP? Now they're not that OP right? There's always going to be scenes where there's the KING of the meta, but it will TOO pass. Zed is healthy because he's one of leagues stamps/children/iconic figure. He is more healthy than most mid laners. You're just upset because he excels and does his job and what he's supposed to do. Don't be upset kiddo.\n\nIf you're really this upset about Zed in general you don't belong in the elo that i'm in because you can't comprehensively figure out how to beat 1 champion like the rest of the Gold kids and below, MAN UP.

If you stay and fight, your ability to fight is debuffed; if you try to run, both your ability to run and fight are debuffed.\n\nTrynd can use his dance animation, which starts nearly the same as his mocking shout cast animation to force you to turn around multiple times while running away from him. Turning around a bunch of times in anticipation of the actual shout is tantamount to be slowed in the first place. It provides a false choice, has a ton of hidden power, causes Trynd to win damage trades that he shouldn't, and on top of that forces Trynd into a binary pattern of thrive or starve.\n\nYasuo's windwall is about as frustrating but is strictly superior from a design point of view because it doesn't make yasuo feast or famine-- its utility is game changing no matter what the score is, and you can position and play around it without making yasuo feel worthless. It allows him to make fights more complex, and meshes with the mobility of his kit, which is designed to thrive in complex fights. Yasuo generally cannot apply reliable damage to you without coming out from behind the wall, so its long lasting utility is gated in fights for which yasuo is the aggressor.\n\nI've said this before, but because people who don't play Trynd day in and day out don't understand what makes him tick, and because Undying Rage is much \"noisier\" than mocking shout, people cast it aside: if mocking shout were replaced with something that is actually functional for league of legends, Trynd would be half as frustrating to fight and twice as fair.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-06-14T19:25:02.141+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz's auto range kept at 175 but now his hitbox size was increased, does this mean he can now attack targets slightly farther away from his center?","replies":[{"poster":"SmashGizmo","date":"2016-06-14T21:55:41.760+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically, yes, but it also means that those targets can attack him from farther away.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-06-14T22:09:34.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does the increase in hitbox affect his skills (his E or his R?)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
