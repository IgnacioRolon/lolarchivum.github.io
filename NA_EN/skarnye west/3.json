Between us, we have experience as pro players, casters, coaches, analysts, and esports journalists. But above all, we are enthusiastic players of League of Legends, with an average of 3673 hours of gameplay each, and that&rsquo;s just on our mains. If League of Legends were a 8-5 job, we&rsquo;d be starting our 16th month on the job!\n\nEvery two weeks, we&rsquo;re going to be hosting a discussion here on the state of balance on the current patch. Take this opportunity to ask us any questions about the state of the game because, as we said, it&rsquo;s our job to analyze it from all angles.\n\nThis week, we&rsquo;re going to discuss sleeper picks on 6.3, whether they&rsquo;re the result of direct changes or a shifting landscape, or are simply champions that have remained underplayed despite strength in recent patches.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet&rsquo;s start with someone who&rsquo;s been strong the last few patches but hasn&rsquo;t seen much play. Feel like sometimes your team just holds you down? Try Nautilus; he&rsquo;s used to carrying a heavy weight and making it look easy! \n\nCJ&rsquo;s Untara has been rocking Nautilus in the top lane; check out [CJ Entus&rsquo; Week 4 games vs Longzhu Gaming](http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/lck/lck_2016_spring/matches/regular_season/CJE-vs-LZ) for more!\n\n**Nautilus Top - Mattias &ldquo;Gentleman Gustaf&rdquo; Lehman**\nGrasp of the Undying means it&rsquo;s a good time to be big and beefy up top. Trundle, Dr. Mundo, and Tahm Kench all had their time in the spotlight before the nerf hammer brought them down to size. Who will rise to take their place? Malphite has remained rock steady as the second-highest win rate top laner (behind the explosive Graves), and the second-highest play rate top laner (behind Fiora).\n\nBut what about a top laner nobody has noticed lurking beneath the waves? Nautilus smashes both Malphite and Fiora, while taking on old favorites like Dr. Mundo, Gangplank, Gnar, Jax, and Riven. He enables ganks with a ridiculous four CC abilities, and scales well into teamfights thanks to his initiation potential and heavy peel. He still loses pretty hard to Graves, but let&rsquo;s be real, we&rsquo;re all banning him anyway.\n\nOn the itemization front, a perfect storm has been brewing. Sunfire Cape got an armor buff in 6.1 and a buff to minion damage in 6.3, giving Naut an easy first buy choice. Additionally, the Iceborn Gauntlet preseason changes allowed him to itemize for damage, tankiness, and heavy CDR all at the same time. Add Boots of Swiftness and your opponents will be left with nothing but a sinking feeling as they try to escape.\n\nIf you do happen to run into a Nautilus top lane, don&rsquo;t try to out-CC him. Instead, pick a champion who will outscale him in 1v1 fights, and force him to lose split-push duels against you. Garen, Darius, Trundle, and Nasus should all do the trick with their sustain and relentless damage.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Runic Echoes**\nRunic Echoes gave a number of junglers a hearty bump, but other than Elise and Nidalee - the usual suspects - and a surprise visit from AP Udyr, most AP junglers remain underpicked. \n\n**Diana Jungle - Trevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes**\nDespite a nearly 5% win rate increase with the release of Runic Echoes, Diana&rsquo;s play rate still hovers at about 4%. The additional Movement Speed and burst damage from the Runic Echoes proc gives her huge snowball potential, and once Diana gets ahead, she eclipses the competition. With her fast and healthy clear she is able to get level 6 quickly and safely, at which point she has incredible ganks and dueling potential. \n\nThe thing that ~~shyvana ~~Diana does best in the jungle is farm. She is able to almost keep up with solo laners farm due to her near instant camp clearing. When you&rsquo;re not ganking, you should be speed clearing your camps because this will give you a level edge versus the other jungler, and allow you to seek them out and duel them. \n\nWith this large farm advantage and her great dueling potential she has the potential to carry games unlike most other junglers. On the other hand, if she doesn&#039;t \n\n**Jungle Fiddlesticks - Mattias &ldquo;Gentleman Gustaf&rdquo; Lehman**\nFor me, League of Legends is all about outsmarting my opponent, whether it&rsquo;s baiting somebody into a duel I know they can&rsquo;t win, arriving just in time to turn a gank into a countergank, or dying to a four-man gank bot lane while my team sneaks baron. If you want to play mind games, nothing beats the feeling of surprising your opponent by flying over a wall and turning a bad teamfight into a perfect crowstorm. Fiddlesticks is the type of jungler that can put the game on his shoulders or throw the whole game for his team. But with great responsibility comes great power.\n\nWith exception of the Runeglaive days, Fiddlesticks has consistently maintained a high jungle win rate. Despite the Runic Echoes change, Fiddlesticks&rsquo; pick rate remains low, but his win rate is back to terrifying levels.\n\nWatch out for knockbacks! Nothing feels worse than setting the perfect trap only to have it denied by a pesky Alistar.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Duskblade of Draktharr** \nOf course, we&rsquo;d be remiss if we didn&rsquo;t touch on AD Assassins, who are getting a brand new item: Duskblade of Draktharr, giving them access to new burst and tank-busting ability.\n\nDusk has some serious pain points and counters, however. QSS and Zhonya&rsquo;s both mitigate high amounts of damage against Dusk, just as they do vs Zed&rsquo;s Death Mark, and assassins who itemize into Dusk should find their scaling falling off as they progress into the late game and find more and more of their damage mitigated by Zhonya&rsquo;s, QSS, and growing shields coming from supports.\n\nAll AD assassins use Duskblade reasonably well, but the two biggest threats are Zed and Talon\n\n**Zed  - Blake &ldquo;Ex Shepherd&rdquo; Soberanis**\nI play Zed because killing other players is fun. Ult in, drop my damage, dash out, and walk away while my target dies to Death Mark like the badass ninja that I am. Zed is the end of the alphabet, and I am the end of your time on Summoner&rsquo;s Rift. So watch out for Duskblade because now Death Mark comes twice.\n\nSure, Zed nerfs hit live at the same time Dusk does, but 5% less Death Mark damage isn&rsquo;t going to stop me from killing you.\n\nZed benefits heavily from the Duskblade proc thanks to the damage amp on Death Mark. Either the Dusk proc will be amplified by Death Mark, or Death Mark will be amplified by Dusk proc. Either way, he ends up gaining more damage from the Duskblade proc than any other champions. Minor nerfs will be following him onto live as a result, but players who time their use of Duskblade well should be able to account for this.\n\n**Talon - Ben &quot;Cezium&quot; Burkhardt**\nDon&rsquo;t forget about Talon, though. With a 53%+ win rate over the last 3 patches, the release of Duskblade is almost secondary to his consistency, but nobody ever complained about too many good things.\n\nHis laning phase is weak, but Corrupting Flask allows him to sustain through the early game and pick up the items he needs to pick off squishy carries and supports.\n\n**Honorable Mention**\n**Jungle Gragas - Scott &quot;Sickoscott&quot; Hong**\nGragas&#039; early clear was a big reason as to why he hasn&#039;t been picked lately. With the 6.3 buffs he may make it back into viability and find a place in both solo and competitive.\n\nWhat do you think? Who are your sleepers for 6.3? Tell us below in the comments and feel free to ask any questions you have for Playtest Team at Riot, whether they be about balance or what exactly our job is! We will be around for the next few hours and will try to answer as many questions as possible.\n\nBen &ldquo;_Cezium_&rdquo; Burkhardt\nAdam \"_Afic_\" Cohen\nIsaac &ldquo;_Azael_&rdquo; Cummings-Bentley\nShawn &ldquo;_I Am The IRS_&rdquo; Currie\nMiles &ldquo;_Daydreamin_&rdquo; Hoard\nScott &ldquo;_Sickoscott_&rdquo; Hong\nMattias &ldquo;_Gentleman Gustaf_&rdquo; Lehman\nNicholas &ldquo;_Drecker_&rdquo; Shapiro\nNicholas &ldquo;_Nickwu_&rdquo; Smith\nBlake &ldquo;_Ex Shepherd_&rdquo; Soberanis\nTrevor &ldquo;_ThEntropist_&rdquo; Thernes","replies":[{"poster":"BanÄ±sh","date":"2016-02-09T22:15:43.515+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":6,"body":"I feel like you left Phreak out of the list there... he obviously had some influence","replies":[{"poster":"Skarnye West","date":"2016-02-09T22:21:25.171+0000","up_votes":75,"down_votes":4,"body":"I sat next to Phreak for a few weeks when I worked in esports.

For example, in Zed's case, the nerf means that you now HAVE to build Duskblade or you're just in a worse spot than before. Nerfing a champion due to a new item that's supposed to be strong on them enforces a certain build path. \n\nThere is no AP Zed or tank Zed so it's not that much of an issue for him but for other champions it certainly could be. For example, I plan on trying it with Nocturne but I'd hate to have him nerfed because of it since I play him in many styles. Sometimes I go Cinderhulk into tank, other times Devourer into bruiser, sometimes Devourer into all damage items, occasionally full AD assassin with Warrior etc. I love this flexibility but if an item is overwhelmingly strong on a champion, it just narrows their viable build paths by forcing that core since the champion is balanced around that particular item. Are you guys concerned about this at all?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DebonairCorgi","date":"2016-02-10T04:08:10.190+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like so much focus is being put onto AD champions in these last few patches. They are continuing to get better buffs and items, while mages continue to become easier to deal with. I main mages such as: Ahri, Karma, and Morgana, and continue to be forced to rush inefficiently priced items like Zonya's vs AD champions. You nerfed Mages a few patches ago by increasing the price of most of our strong items while leaving AD items virtually untouched. Mages have 3 items that have Magic Penetration and 1 Item (Abyssal) that lowers MR at close range... Then we have only 2 items that viably mitigate AD damage through Armor (Zonya's then Harbingers which isn't actually viable on mid-lane mages) and 4 items that provide Health, and 1 that provides a shield. Are you expecting us to change our builds to compensate for the explosive damage you're piling onto AD champions? Yes, we're bursty as hell, but you're making AD champions so bursty, buying Zonya's is a complete waste because we have to burn it EVERY time it's up only to be melted right after because AD champs have 5 items (all of which are viable on virtually any AD champion) that provide Armor Pen, and can be stacked (Ex: Maw + Ghostblade), Now duskblade so 6, 2 items that are again highly viable on virtually all AD Champs and provide MR, and 5 items that provide strong health options. All of these items are viable picks for most AD Champions WITHOUT disrupting their builds, whereas Mages have very few that are also easy to work against. Unless we ditch our normal build path and build defensive items galore, we're easily bursted down. \n\nIt's very hard for mages that are behind to get back into the game vs AD Champions now, whereas many AD champions just need to buy one or two items to get back in if they have a rough early game.\n\nI might just be bad at League or just inexperienced, but to me it seems like all the focus is leaning too heavily towards AD Champions, making Mages weaker.","replies":[{"poster":"FrostCloud","date":"2016-02-10T16:34:39.769+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just wanna know why riot never replies to comments like these.

Personally, I hope to see some cost adjustments similar to what recently happened to Morello's vs FQC. Even with the cost increases, though, the terror that was FQC was a really interesting meta in my opinion and serves to highlight a lot of the differences with AP vs AD itemization. The way I see it, AD is (typically) about stats first, actives second whereas AP items focus on either heavy utility for their cost or significant power-boosts in stats (massive CDR, for one). I'm kind of rambling, but this is how I see things.\n\nFor a vast majority of cases, AP burst will win out over AD, that's just the nature of the class of champion. AD Assassins being heavily bursty would feel awful if they could be countered without adjusting one's buildpath at all - League is a super dynamic games that for the mostpart requires you to play every game at least a little differently in regards to itemization, and this is just at a super low baseline of variance. \n\nIf you're burning Zhonya's every time it's up in fights, that's kind of what it's there for, no? Using Zhonya's to save yourself is why you buy it, and why you -should- be buying it. Similar to how AD's have something like Mercurial available, Zhonya's simply becomes a borderline necessity at some point if the gamestate requires it. You wouldn't skip out on a QSS / Mercurial against a hard-CC or massively impactful debuff oriented team (Malzahar, Zed, Warwick etc); Zhonya's is, in a way, an equivalent case to it, no? I don't think League would be anywhere near as fun or interesting if you could pick a Mage, heck, any champion and build the exact same thing every game while expecting the exact same results to come through. Granted there are exceptions and some champions can get by mostly by doing this, but it's in the minority.\n\nDuskblade also isn't super viable on every AD champion, at least not early. It's REALLY strong on certain things like Zed, Talon or Rengar, but a lot of other champions simply can't find a way to fit it into early(ish) builds or justify it over something like an earlier Ghostblade, BT, IE etc. It's a good item, but it's a lot more niche than you might think. Of course, this was just my opinion through initial testing and I may turn out to be totally wrong.\n\ntl;dr I don't really feel that AP is in as bad a spot as it's being made out to be, but I do agree that things like item costs need to have another look at them. Hopefully at the very least with the Mage update, you'll start feeling a lot better about the place they're in.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-02-11T20:46:26.231+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"My big complaint, on AD vs. AP, is that Hexdrinker is a much better item then Armguard. If Armguard had a mini-Zhonya's, that'd be cool, but right now I'd rather be facing an AP champ with a Hexdrinker than facing an AD champ with an armguard.\n\n(Also: AP champs have mana costs. Every gold spent on Armguard or Zhonya's is gold not spent on easing the mana burden. Zed (and to a lesser extent Talon) don't care about that.)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"nubblez","date":"2016-02-09T21:41:07.669+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":9,"body":"What are you guys' thoughts on AD Brand {{champion:63}} ?

While mages have to rush CDR/mana and have little mobiilty, they rush damage, apply tons of lane pressure, and can then roam and impact the map far more effectively. As such, what was the reasoning for this new item? I like it, it seems really cool don't get me wrong, but I don't see why they need another strong toy to play with.\n\nThey already kill squishies well (which is their job, and a very important part of the game), and tanks are usually the rock-paper-scissors counter to them. This item seems to make them even better at killing squishies and, as the very article says, help with tank busting. From what you all say it seems to not break the game, and I highly doubt it will 'broken', but surely my concerns aren't unfounded.

Both games do a lot of really cool and unique things, and with the level of mechanical differences it gives so much variety, I'm really glad to have played both as much as I have.\n\n**These are all my personal opinions, please do not misconstrue this as what Riot dislikes about League or features to come, etc.**\n\nWhat I'd like to see, ie where the biggest gains could possibly fall: \n\n* More meaningful decisions regarding mana usage - League feels kind of spam-happy at times; trying to explain the concept of CS'ing with your abilities on a LOT of champions to DotA players is often met with head scratches or general confusion, since as you know DotA is much more punishing with mana costs. However, basic abilities tend to be overall more powerful in DotA (imagine something like Paralyzing Casks on a support in League), so there's also that.\n* More unique / interesting active items. Something like Force Staff is so cool! Ghost Scepter has really powerful risk/reward windows - it can make or break a lot of escapes. You're giving up potential boosts to your stats for these really powerful item effects and I just think that it opens up a lot of really fun design space. League has a lot of awesome passive items (things like RFC / Phantom Dancer come to mind), but it's a different space altogether.\n* Interaction with the map - champions like Bard, Graves, Nautilus and Poppy showcase this in awesome ways, but since most of the jungle / tree terrain can be destroyed in DotA, it just opens the door for so much. If you're familiar with Heroes of Newerth, Silhouette had an ability where she was able to grapple a tree and literally rip it out by the roots as a missile towards her, stunning everything in its path. \n* The chat-wheel system is fantastic - being able to call out \"Stun!\" \"Go Go!\" \"Ultimate ready in X seconds!\" enables a lot of playmaking opportunities and helps general communication quite a bit.\n\n\nWhat I think LoL does extremely well, in comparison\n\n* Jungle accessibility. The jungle, to me, is the most unique and incredibly well-done facet of Summoner's Rift - it defines a class of champion entirely, opens up so many meta possibilities, allows a lot more around-the-map action... the way it's been implemented in our game just makes me so happy, as a long time DotA player. Jungling can be awkward and clunky at times in DotA, taking advantage of things like proper pulling / camp stacking, it's a lot to keep track of to optimize (look at Merlini's old jungle Beastmaster stuff, it's pretty nuts).\n\n* Support gold generation. Playing a true hard-5 support in DotA can be incredibly punishing, to the point that you're level 4-5 when others on the map are at times triple your level and you're literally being oneshot. Boots being the only thing you're able to buy in a game can feel awful, so the way League approaches supports is definitely a breath of fresh air. I started competitive DotA as a hard-5 support main (moved to mid lane or occasionally offlane 3 play), so while I really understand and enjoy the playstyle, I get why it's not fun for some.\n\n* Passive ability slot. Honestly one of my favorite things about League, the passive slot is champion defining in a lot of ways, and while some can feel underwhelming, others are just so cool that you play your whole game around them. It adds another level of character diversity to the game. DotA has a lot of passive abilities that just aren't fun to level up to a lot of players, but League can avoid this kind of thing because -everyone- has a passive!\n\n* Alternative stats, instead of base attributes (STR/AGI/INT). I think in a lot of ways, League's stat system is a lot cleaner than it is in DotA. Where DotA has a throwback to the (limitations) of the WC3 engine in the three-stat system, League has a bunch of unique stats that open the door for a much different buildpath for lots of characters. Things like cooldown reduction (which DotA has forms of now), penetration, general resists and flat HP/mana values instead of having to quickmath makes League's stat system in some ways a lot more intuitive to some players. Readability is big, and I think it's handled extremely well in League.\n\nAgain, there are my **personal opinions!** I can go on for days, but these are what popped in my head initially!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Asyde","date":"2016-02-09T22:17:26.442+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":5,"body":"> DRAGON'S DOMINANCE (4TH STACK) +15% damage to monsters and minions â You take 20% less damage from turrets\n\nI can't even begin to tell you how terrible of an idea this is.

Is this an accurate feeling? I may be overreacting here, but it just seems like towers go down 2-3x faster than they used to.\n\n I'm also unsure as to why Crest of Cinders (Red buff) works on towers when the latest dragon buff changes make it to where that would be essentially redundant.\n\nin season 3-5 taking 2 or more tower shots for a dive, after 13-15 minutes was still a very serious gambit. Now with the itemization changes and damage changes in regard to how durable turrets are in particular, they seem more like static non-threatening objectives necessary to victory than a REAL threat or credible point to form a defense around. I often see matches where certain tanks would routinely take 4-5 shots and even without half their build done, it still hardly phases them, often not even taking 33-50% of their health. \n\nThis wouldn't be as much of an issue for me, but when a tower can be taken down right after laning phase is over by 1-3 champions with a single minion wave, they just kind of seem like a joke.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rabid R6","date":"2016-02-10T17:35:29.645+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to know what kind of backwards thinking snake got this xin update through the cracks honestly.   we just got murdered by him 4 people on him. he had devourer and guinsoos. and we couldn't kill him. honestly riot. what are you doing to this game? sincerely someone recognizing its getting worse as the days go on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Northerner","date":"2016-02-10T03:51:23.756+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"shhhh ... dont tell everyone about nautilus .... let him stay at the bottom of the sea where only I can play him ...","replies":[]},{"poster":"dude68killermax","date":"2016-02-09T22:00:05.013+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:75}} top is actually so strong if you play him right you can dominate lane. even if you get killed early on just get stacks and come back top. with that being sad i don't know what items exactly to build past frozen heart so if any one can tell me that would be great thx","replies":[{"poster":"Skarnye West","date":"2016-02-09T22:03:09.829+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Spirit Visage synergizes stupidly well with his passive, and Sheen is stronger on him than ever thanks to the CDR it gives this season!\n\nAt that point, Dead Man's Plate makes it harder to kite you and you can go full defensive items from there!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2016-02-09T21:17:19.051+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"I feel like Zilean mid is pretty sleeper OP.
