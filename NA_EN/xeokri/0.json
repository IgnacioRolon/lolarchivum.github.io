How corrupt is riot?","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":3,"down_votes":23,"body":"Everyone knows what nightblue3 did right? I'm pretty curious about this \"What if\". What if Nightblue didn't stream or record him doing that?  What if nightblue3 didn't say anything and just did what he did? The person would have got banned and nightblue3 would not be banned. Read the reason why nightblue got banned and it was stated riot did it because he \"ABUSED HIS INFLUENCE\" Why does a streamer have the control to push a ban through for a person regardless?  Is the only reason something even happened is because it blue up and put riot on heat?\nSwear to god i am getting all this hate for what? what do you people want from me? i have done nothing wrong why r u ppl bullying me?~","replies":[]}
