It would need to be like Game of Thrones, where multiple factions, multiple characters get screen time and showing altercations between them. I see League lore exactly like Game of Thrones lore but with more fantasy/mythological creatures involved.\n\nPlot wise, i think each season would be an action/drama showing tension rising between factions, ultimately resulting in a season finale Summoners Rift match to settle the scores. Each new season would pick up where the last left off, showing how the world has changed since the last match and new characters would be introduced.","replies":[{"poster":"RP Sugar Daddy","date":"2016-03-25T21:32:00.248+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see it now.\n\nHaving the Northerners as Tryn+Ashes faction, with Lissandra being as \"the white ones\", Noxus being as the Lanasters, Demacians being as (i cant spell their names right so go with me on this) as the Dragon Lady, rising up in power to fight vs Noxus.

Zilean creates a band of heroes which he calls the** \"league of legends\"** to set out and unite all of Runeterra and stop Noxus in one deciding battle. Zilean's band includes: Ekko, Gragas, Ziggs, Heimerdinger, Tristana , Ashe , Braum and Lulu. (some of them met along the way) \n\nSome really awsome moments could be to show some of the characters of the movie like : \nA small town is haunted by malevolent creatures , and the towns Sherriff gives a high reward to the person who catches or kills the 3 unknown but evil figures. Vayne the nighthunter tells him she will get the job done and sets out to hunt in the night! ( spooky !) She is suddenly attacked ( jumpscares) by a flock of crows and fiddlesticks behind them ! No problem for vayne she tumbles aroound the crows and then impales fiddle into a tree ( RIp fiddle) . The Sky then turns dark RED and a deep voice yells DAAARKNESSSS, and a shadowy figure ( Nocturne) dashes towardes her only to get one shotted by Vayne's silver bolts! Vayne then is expecting the 3rd figure and starts looking around. She pauses for a moment and then turns around and kills the Demon Jester that was right behind her. She remains dead serious even though she is happy she got the job done . But all of the sudden in the quiet another smiling demon Jester appears out of nowhere behind her and backstabs while laughing : WHY SO SERIOUS? \n\nThere could be some really cool moments like this .\n\nIve also thought of a sequel which would be called :\n**League of LEgends : The Emperor of shurima**\nwhhere the heroes  realise that they need Shurima on their side to win the war vs Noxus , and they travel there to rescue Azir from Renektons Grasp. \nBut only one person can defeat Renekton. His brother Nasus who is missing for many years. So they set out to find the curator of the sands! But many adventures wait along the way.  ( including getting through Ionia where a war has broken out and Zeds rengade ninjas have taken rule while Shen and akali and their brethren are trying to formulate some resistance. ( Master Yi and Wukong join them along the way to stop Zed, but only the legendary warrior of the wind technique Yasuo can stop Zed and his Shadows. They must find him !) another stop could be bilge water where the story between twisted Fate Graves gp and mf unfolds.( they could throw some shadow isles champions here too) \n\nThe final chapter then is the conclusion to the rise of Noxus\n**League of Legends: The Return of The ascendant** ( lord of the rings rippoff the return of the king hehe )\nThey finally reach Shurima with Nasus who in an epic Duel with his furious brother Renekton manages to kill him and finally set him free of his madness but at the cost of his own life too :( . They then set out to open the chamber to free Azir. But by doing so they free Xerath too. Xerath breaks free and wreaks havoc at once threatenign to destroy everything in his path. But Azir filled with the spirit of vengeance manages to defeath Xerath in an epic duel!\nAzir then proceeds to defeat the Noxias anrmy  with his sand soldiers. noxus suffers a terrible defeat etc etc THE END. \nI guess we could have Ashe and braum kiss at the end .","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuzja1","date":"2016-03-26T08:25:24.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:119}} Grab some popcorn, folks cause we're about to watch the League of Draven only on the Prime Time with Draaaaaaven","replies":[]},{"poster":"Strawberrycocoa","date":"2016-03-26T06:31:29.149+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think there's enough overall plot for a movie or a TV series.
