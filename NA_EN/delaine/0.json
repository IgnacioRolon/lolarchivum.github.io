If you just report on the post game screen it'll be nothing more than a computer determining whether they broke the rules or not... I reported a player for saying \"kys\" in post game screen. He was still playing well after I reported it and based off his game history he did not receive any ban. The most he would have gotten is a chat restriction. Even though Riot themselves stated that if a player were to say \"kys\" it's grounds for a minimum of a 2 week suspension. \n\nThe issue isn't whether I opened a ticket or not. It's the fact Riot doesn't take things like this seriously. They don't disclose the outcomes of the \"punishments\" because they don't punish everyone. The only time they actually punish someone is if they do it constantly. \"It takes 20 games of being afk in a row to receive a permanent ban. I know because that's how many games it took for my account to get banned.\" - This is what a buddy of mine personally experienced. \n\nIf them not revealing the \"punishment\" is not for that reason. Tell me what personal information does that give out.

Of course I would especially if they did something wrong. If someone runs it down in a game or tells another to kill themselves you don't think the person who reported it should be informed that their report actually did something? \n\nI've reported many different people and I've even opened a lot of tickets about people and many of them are, at the very least a 2 week suspension worth offenses. Out of all of those reports only a handful of them actually received a real punishment. When I open a ticket about someone I believe it requires an actual punishment. Thus I will check their game history every few days and after my ticket is \"resolved\" I see if they actually did anything. This is how I know they don't actually ban the people who ignore the rules.\n\nI've opened tickets ranging from people saying \"kys\", threatening to dox others, running it down, and threatening to find someone in real life to assault them. Out of all of these reports only 2 people that said \"kys\" and a few of those who ran it down were banned. The rest did not receive a ban. \n\nSo, basically me not knowing what happened to them is better? You know what that does? It discourages people from reporting. Go into any league game and ask the players \"do you think riot will ban me if i run it down\" I guarantee the majority of the players will say no.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Delaine","date":"2020-02-15T15:54:33.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Imperial Pandaa,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=wFWzTdFJ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2020-02-15T15:33:28.238+0000)\n>\n> Only reason it would be deleted would be due to the Rant like nature.

Instead of reporting him to Riot you should report him to discord's support and have them deal with it since this is happening on discord's grounds and not Riot's anymore.\nFor the part of him telling you to die (in game), I would actually reopen the ticket, apologize, and have a new agent take a look at it and see if they do anything for you. But please be nice and don't insult them because they're trying to work with you. Think of it as customer service. They will most likely to help you if you were either friendly or at least polite. Don't degrade them.\nHappened to me a month ago with an old Ekko on my team. My goodness he was absolutely crazy and made violent threats in game. I reported it, nothing happened. He did it to someone else in another game of his, and I'm thinking he got 14'd or perma'd. Actually happened to me today too, had a Pyke telling us none of us deserve to live and wished our Shyvana drowned in her own pool of blood! ...And so far nothing happened yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scarefish","date":"2020-02-15T15:31:32.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm pretty sure if people can get banned for being slightly condescending in a few thousand ranked matches, then anything you mentioned there is equally punishable, and likely in even fewer matches.","replies":[{"poster":"Delaine","date":"2020-02-15T16:04:13.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scarefish,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=wFWzTdFJ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2020-02-15T15:31:32.226+0000)\n>\n> I'm pretty sure if people can get banned for being slightly condescending in a few thousand ranked matches, then anything you mentioned there is equally punishable, and likely in even fewer matches.\n\nIt shouldn't be \"fewer matches.\" If someone tells another to \"kys\" or threatens to dox someone. It should be a ban that game. How is that even a question. Yet Riot doesn't want to do that.","replies":[]}]}]}
