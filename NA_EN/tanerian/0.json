I just had it happen twice in a row. Sitting in Champion select with a team. Suddenly it tells me I have left the queue. I didn't click on anything though? Sitting with a 30 minute penalty now. Has happened a few times before, but never twice in a row like this.\nIs this a known bug? Or am I doing something wrong somehow?","replies":[{"poster":"Tanerian","date":"2017-10-04T01:25:43.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah. It actually just happened again. \n\n3 times now I've noticed I was typing while it happened. Are there any hotkeys that boot yourself from a queue? Maybe I'm hitting it somehow?\nI believe this very last time I was holding Shift+ something to type in capital letter.\n\nMy connection seems to be ok, can't find any issues there.\nWill post in report a bug.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-03T01:30:59.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've spotted this same issue a couple times lately, and if I'm understanding right, this is a preeeetty weird problem to have. So if I'm understanding correctly, you were *IN* a lobby choosing your champion when a \"queue dodged\" message popped up? This would mean that when you accepted the queue it just....never took you out of the queue for some reason, which then found you a second match. \n\nCheckup on your network settings as some basic troubleshooting using our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), but I'd also like you to go ahead and post this over in Report A Bug as this might be something for the devs to look into as well.","replies":[]}]}
