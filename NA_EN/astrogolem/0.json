You can thank Ezreal for helping me realize this.\n\nBut I am sure you mean my rework and VU. My rework is ready and everyone will be more than excited to see my new abilities, but what is holding up my release is my VU as I refuse to be released until it is perfect. Riot was kind enough to give me an all expenses paid trip to the spa and it takes quite a lot of time to get myself to look as flawless as possible. I still have to get both my manis and pedis done. I have this hair stylist who I have been going to for years who does marvelous work but she has been booked for the last few months what with Holiday season and all and I won't let anyone else perm my hair but her. My tiara will be getting replaced with a far more luxurious version of my current tiara as over the years some of the gems have fallen out. I will be donating my old tiara to the make-a-wish foundation for any young boy whose wish is to be a beautiful princess. My new tiara  as I mentioned earlier will be more luxurious, brilliant and sparkly than the previous one because it will be a diamond band encrusted with diamonds and enchanted with diamond dust. Can't go wrong with diamonds, on diamonds on diamonds, right? My hammer simply doesn't have enough gems on it so I will be getting more gems to better accentuate my uncontested dominance of the rift. Lastly is my cod piece. My codpiece needs to be refitted to reduce chafing. This way my outfit will not only be fashionable and stylish but also a great deal more comfortable as well.\n\nOnce these things get taken care of I will appear on the rift and you all will be bedazzled by my brilliance.\n.#Gems\n.#ShineBrightLikeADiamond\n.#DiamondsAreForever\n.#IfYouLikeItThenYouShouldHavePutAGemOnIt\n@EzrealTheGay","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2015-10-13T23:37:18.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And what about those Katarina changes ???\n\nI still have hope!
