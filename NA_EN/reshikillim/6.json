Shaco's clone ALWAYS has 75% of the real Shaco's AD/AP. So the Shaco with more AD/AP is the real one. And the clone is squishier than the real one, because it takes more damage. Also, any summoners/debuffs with timers/dots applied to it will only apply to the real Shaco.\n\nThe problem is that Garen's ult passive is more deadly to Shaco than having enemy 5 pink wards down on the map.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ima firin","date":"2015-09-02T21:51:17.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"they still have lower AD\n\nthey still dont have blue/red/baron buffs around them\n\nthey still dont have dragon stacks","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-09-02T21:54:41.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ima firin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ncwh1phc,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-09-02T21:51:17.194+0000)\n>\n> they still have lower AD\n> \n> they still dont have blue/red/baron buffs around them\n> \n> they still dont have dragon stacks\n\nlower ad requires you to actually compare both of them. often, leblanc and shaco let their clones run into different directions, so you can only follow one of them or have one in sight.\n\nas far as buffs go, drake buff is a good point, but they might not have been able to take it. and i just mentioned red and blue buff. we have no control over that.\n\ni dont see a reason not to just give the clones a debuff icon, so you can identify them when you klick on them.\n\ni didnt even object to the change the op suggested, but there should be other means of identifying the clone that we actually have control over. even looking at his buffs/debuffs when selecting the clone can take valuable seconds and make on the spot decisions difficult.\n\nespecially leblanc where 1 second can mean she activates or reactivates w or ult.\n\nim not as much concerned about shaco, since he actually has to burn ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-09-04T16:48:08.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ncwh1phc,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-09-02T21:54:41.708+0000)\n>\n> lower ad requires you to actually compare both of them. often, leblanc and shaco let their clones run into different directions, so you can only follow one of them or have one in sight.\n> \n> as far as buffs go, drake buff is a good point, but they might not have been able to take it. and i just mentioned red and blue buff. we have no control over that.\n> \n> i dont see a reason not to just give the clones a debuff icon, so you can identify them when you klick on them.\n> \n> i didnt even object to the change the op suggested, but there should be other means of identifying the clone that we actually have control over. even looking at his buffs/debuffs when selecting the clone can take valuable seconds and make on the spot decisions difficult.\n> \n> especially leblanc where 1 second can mean she activates or reactivates w or ult.\n> \n> im not as much concerned about shaco, since he actually has to burn ult.\n\nI feel like that's kind of the point. Have you seen bad shacos? They (I) leave their (my) clone standing there while they control shaco. Good shacos can micro their clone to attack the enemy from behind, or play mind games and run their clone around while they attack from behind. The whole *point* of these clone champs is that they create mind games where you have to guess which is which by behavior. If you can just click on one and instantly know if it's the clone, that's too much counterplay, IMO.

Sounds like you're just salty about the champion and blaming the entire player base because you don't like how Shaco functions. \nIt's very possible to have the villain mark for a majority of the 40 minutes if Garen doesn't kill the villain and the rest of the game continues aside from top lane.

If you're not sure your teammate can take it, it's better to take it yourself. Because letting people escape because you made sure to not \"Steal\" doesn't help anyone.\n\nStealing a kill would be if someone killed a 200 HP manaless Leblanc with no flash who is sitting right next to their full hp ADC.\n\nIf the jungler is not sure whether or not the teammates can secure the kill in a gank, it's better to just take the kill.

(distracing the enemy until w is up). and shes one of those champions who doesnt have to take a lot of risks to get into the position where she could get garen ulted in the first place.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
