Teemo Shrooms.\n\nI can see it now. Teemo placing all of his shrooms in one fairy circle of satanism somewhere near bot lane. Then Ryze and Nunu Come to the circle and invite Teemo down to bot lane. The bot lane prepares for their team to initiate the goon fiesta, whilst you, the other unsuspecting bot lane, mindlessly farms to your hearts content confident in your lane.\n\n Then all of a sudden, All chat appears. The red text of teemo saying \"Size doesn't mean everything\" as the bright blue circle of fuck you appears behind your adc. You know whats happening, your adc knows whats happening, you both know there's no escape. \"An Ally has been Slain appears\" is heard, as the enemy team converges on you. You pray for a swift demise. As your team mates see you were mindlessly slaughtered /all chat appears. \"GG noob bot lane.\"","replies":[{"poster":"TequilaZombie","date":"2016-06-30T18:43:20.186+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was beatiful.
