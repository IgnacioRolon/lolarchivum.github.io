Malphite, Hecarim, and Jarvan all have more impactful initiation ults that make them CC immune while performing them. Yet Shyvana&#039;s is much less reliable compared to any of them.\r\n\r\nDragon&#039;s descent has very spotty CC that sometimes completely ignores enemies who are standing in the way, and it&#039;s also easily interrupted. A change that would greatly improve the quality of life without changing damage numbers would be to make her CC immune for the duration of the leap.","replies":[{"poster":"Bladerunner7777","date":"2016-08-22T05:57:12.582+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":4,"body":"based on the downvotes to realistic replies, shyvana mains seem almost as bad as sona mains\n\nIf Riot made Shyvana's ult uninterruptible and also make the \"knockback\" CC reliable, she would be completely OP, end of story.\n\nI don't understand why people think Shyvana is an \"engage tank\", she's not, not even close. Her ult isn't a reliable engage because that's not what she is balanced around currently. Shyvana is in the same ball park as Xin Zhao or Tryndamere, except she is more easily kited, tankier, has no CC at all, BUT she does a shitton of % health damage AND she can do it in an AoE.\n\nIf ANYTHING they need to make her ult have a faster travel time, but tacking on reliable CC to it can't work unless they completely rework her. \n\nHonestly if riot buffed BoRK which is kind of weak atm I think Shyvana would do a lot better, but I'm not certain.","replies":[{"poster":"Keti","date":"2016-08-22T22:18:56.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Trynd and xin Zhao are also absolute garbage, so it's not a bad comparison. Her cc attached to her ult is very small, and the ult is mostly used to reposition anyways. It's absolutely vital to her success that she gets where she needs to get with it, because she has little contingency. Her hitbox swells to such a size and she travels so slowly, it's very hard to actually complete an ult in a teamfight. I could understand this needing to be the case back when sated devourer was a thing, but its removal severely gimped her damage so shes now just all risk and no reward. And it's frankly kind of ludicrous she doesn't get any real love while hecarim is running around doing more damage with more mobility with better utility, clearing nearly as fast for only being slightly squishier.","replies":[{"poster":"doombotMECHA","date":"2016-08-23T03:31:09.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"like, you have no other way to get in. that gets interuppted and you can say goodbye to even hurting yas/kali/zed, 3mobile5you","replies":[{"poster":"Bladerunner7777","date":"2016-08-24T04:21:49.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're trying to dive into the enemy Kalista as Shyvana/Udyr/Skarner/Volibear then you shouldn't expect to live or deal any damage because that's just a stupid idea as long as the enemy is competent and you aren't ultra fed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Leonerdo","date":"2016-08-22T16:20:30.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, I think the counter-play to her current ult is just more healthy and more fun. And since she isn't an engage tank or an assassin, she should have decent options even if her dive is interrupted; i.e. she can still duke it out on the front line.\n\nHonestly, Hecarim's ult should maybe be interrupt-able too since he plays more like Shyvana than a tank nowadays. And his options for engaging/flanking/diving/ganking are probably too reliable right now, given how much damage he can also do. Then again, maybe that's just his niche.\n\nBy the way, that means Shyvana's niche is similar, but with a lot more damage and less mobility, hence the lack of CC immunity on her ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Bladerunner7777","date":"2016-08-24T04:30:18.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Hecarim's ult should maybe be interrupt-able too since he plays more like Shyvana than a tank nowadays\n\nI disagree completely\n\nShyvana is a power-farming, counterjungling, % health shredding frontline damage dealer\n\nHecarim is great at ganking because he actually has CC meanwhile Shyvana has (basically) none. He is meant to dive into teamfights and burst squshies; he doesn't even tickle tanks unless they're super far behind and Hec is super far ahead.\n\nThey aren't similar at all really, other than \"running fast\"\n\nAnd Hecarim's ult is hardly \"uninterruptible\". I believe he only gets 100% tenacity while _charging_ but at the end of it he still gets CC'd if he tries to go through a Veigar stun or something.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mhihnj","date":"2016-08-23T15:06:29.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it will make her pretty strong due to her dueling power and immune to cc is not a good idea.
