I really appreciate you looking into her bugs at least, and i really hope that some of these fixes (the ult timing ones in particular) will be released in 6.13. What about the E bugs tho?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blossom Crown","date":"2016-06-15T11:15:33.571+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very happy that you're looking into Syndra and her bugs. Long time coming. \n\nAny info on whether Syndra's walking animation is being looked at? She literally desyncs from the world and stutters and, for the lack of a better phrase, creepblocks herself at times. This happens all the time so not the stutter bug after Syndra ults. It's frustrating to see happen.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2016-06-15T02:37:43.869+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're finally giving her love!

At least I hope you notice it here so it actually might get noticed by the rioters responsible for fixing that kinda stuff. It´s not a gamebreaking bug, but since you are fixing her abilities already, this might be a good opportunity to get that wrapped up as well.\n\nCheers\nSyndratastic\n\n{{champion:134}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shavidar","date":"2016-06-16T00:24:42.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Close range e interaction, pretty please.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nociception","date":"2016-06-15T23:22:58.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really glad that you guys are planning to fix her stuttering bug after she ult, although I love syndra, but sometimes this bug gives me motion sickness and I end up not using her much","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2016-06-15T19:51:34.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She also has a bug trying to recall.
