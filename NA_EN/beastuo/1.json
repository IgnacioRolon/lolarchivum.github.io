I tried to attempt to reset my password via the client link which did not work. At the time I didn't know that we could go online to reset the password so I emailed explaining I got the message and attempted to reset my password which did not work via client and asked for help. I got a message saying my account would be frozen until the issues was resolved. I emailed them back explaining I had managed to get the password reset and I felt this was sufficient, and so the ticket was closed and put under *solved*, Except my account status has not been returned and the new ticket I made over 24 hours ago has no response. I was wondering if there is another avenue I can go to get my status returned on the account. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"BeastUO","date":"2016-09-15T12:12:32.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still waiting on an email or something about my account","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-15T18:16:17.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've had a lot of tickets submitted recently, so we'll get back to you as soon as we can.
