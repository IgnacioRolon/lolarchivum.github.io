I made this account a while ago and I think that it may be racist. I don't want to spend money to change it as I am fairly poor. So I would like to know if a  riot employee could help me out and change it for me.\n\nAlso, the reason I'm doing this is because I'm afraid that the account may be suspended or banned from reports. I feel like some may report me for this name and I will have a punishment. \n\nThanks for reading and considering.\n\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-05T22:55:21.595+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaaa I feel like this name is pretty borderline, if not over the line already. Next time you login you'll be prompted to change it.","replies":[{"poster":"Blue People","date":"2017-11-05T23:54:43.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks so much!!!\n\n\n\n\nI'm also sorry for wasting your time and being toxic to the community, I'm not sure why I created this account with this vile name but thanks again.","replies":[]}]}]}
