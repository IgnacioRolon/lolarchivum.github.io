About 30% of the time i am unable to get back in resulting in me losing games. I lost my 1-1 promo game and now im in the leaverbuster because of something that isnt my fault. Ever since i downloaded this new client theres all kinds of issues. I would love to just play a few games without wanting to throw my laptop across the room because i have to deal with lag, bugs, or other issues. I could care less about the trolls, intentional feeders, or w/e else, because they exist on both sides of the playing field. Whats incredibly frustrating is losing games because my team remakes because im not able to reconnect in time or at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-09T16:40:42.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like your network is falling into a dormant state after champion select, and can't transition over to the game server.

I can create custom games and get into the game without any issues. The only way to test to see if any guide will help is by trying out normal or ranked matches, and im afraid of being punished further by leaverbuster and/or getting my account suspended/banned and having to go through a lengthy process of getting my  account out of trouble....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xeeb","date":"2016-12-09T21:42:18.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have also been getting connection failures since the update and have not been able to join a game without disconnecting and it counting as a loss. Its causing me to lose promo matches and is not limited to one device, it has happened on two different laptops to two different accounts. I tried reinstalling and the error persists and the Promo Series Losses keep racking up.\n\nEDIT: went and dug around a bit deeper and found that my client was corrupted due to the update and restored some contents of the \"Riot Games\" folder (meaning some parts were running on patch 6.23 and some on 6.24)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Coffeevin","date":"2016-12-09T17:22:01.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been getting a connection failure the whole morning everytime I get to loading screen I have to close the game and reconnect.
