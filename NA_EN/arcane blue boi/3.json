Fizz's e is technically skillshot if you count ground targets and the first cast is a directional dash.

When your ability is AoE and covers such a wide area that it is next to impossible to miss you might as well categorize it as point and click with the potential to hit multiple targets. I believe it´s more helpful to look at AoE, travel time, range and delays than if it´s possible to miss or not.
