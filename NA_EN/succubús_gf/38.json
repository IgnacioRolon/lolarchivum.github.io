We win game everything is fine until I see &quot;For afk behaviors you will receive leaverbuster&quot; There is no amount of gameplay that could happen in three minutes (this was within the first 10 minutes of the game btw) that could seriously ruin the game for them. I warded for my adc, then i said brb and came RIGHT back. It isn&#039;t fair to be given 20 minute leaverbuster for something so minimal. It wasn&#039;t reported. There was no way it was because the notification popped up right when the game ended.","replies":[{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-07-14T05:36:40.633+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"3 minutes is too long.

I'm saying perhaps you had small moments of afk/dc in recent games.  I think the system checks for leaving over multiple games generally.\n\nAt what point of the game did you afk?  If it's towards the end, it seems to be more likely to mark a person as a leaver than if it was just a short period early on.","replies":[{"poster":"Succubús GF","date":"2016-07-14T06:02:09.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was seriously within the first 10 minutes.
