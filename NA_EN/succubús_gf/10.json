Very low. Meaning most people who played Heim were actually just Heim mains.\n\nBut as the playrates start to rise, you end up getting more and more games where players are using the champion and that gives you a much larger sample group.  This sample group ends up not only having the champion's mains in it but also players who really are just playing the \"flavor of the month\", effectively muddying the winrates of the champion and bringing it closer to 50%.  So what looks like an effectively balanced champion is in fact the exact opposite - it's dominating the player base for one and its mains are seeing significantly higher winrates than what you see for overall because, again, the total average is muddied by people who don't always get the champion.\n\nThis is why correlating playrates and winrates like this can be a good sign of a champion being unhealthy. This goes in the opposite direction as well, where a champion being played almost none of the time with below 50% winrates would mean even the champions' mains have issues trying to stay above 50%.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brain Errör 404","date":"2017-07-09T07:28:41.398+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh can get that refunded cooldown on landing hooks removed... that'd balance him a bit.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AtlasMinor","date":"2017-07-09T17:33:48.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akrid415,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kduanqT5,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-07-09T03:48:11.016+0000)\n>\n> Congrats, you know how to use the internet.

If that happens, then you actually need to pay attention to it.  Hes drowning out other picks, and it's easy to see why.  He has received a bunch of indirect buffs lately.   He loves new Relic quest, support item reworks a few patches ago are exclusively buffs to him, the fact that the meta is ADC centric means he is in the most impactful lane, armor penetration nerfs to BC and the LW line help him a ton as ALL of his armor is bonus armor, as his passive armor is counted as bonus and it takes the place of his armor per level he would normally get, and the support meta itself is one that favors him, as the mages that gave him trouble in bot lane are all gone, and enchanters are in.  He dominates most enchanters.  Seriously, Thresh has had some indirect buff or another practically every patch for the last few months.\n\nAnd when a high skill floor generalist is the highest win rate and play rate in a role, it is heavily implying a major balance problem for that champion.  Thresh is a champion who is supposed to be hard enough that he should probably average a 48-49% win rate on average, with his mains easily being able to bring him to 55%+.\n\n\nHe has also been holding this #1 winrate+Play rate for about 3 patches now, and was starting to show as a dominate pick before (Being #2-3 on both play and pick rates).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Granduss","date":"2017-07-09T15:36:46.261+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh doesn't need nerfs. Riot needs to look at the support role. Right now the meta is the issue. Tanks are flat out trash. People build tanky on more carry champs. Even in the LCS the only \"tanks\" they use are Galio, Gragas and Gnar, all of which are more carry than tank. This leads to champions like Thresh being so much better. No matter who you engage on, it's good. When tanks exsisted, Thresh wasn't good because a tank could block Thresh out. \n\nTl:dr Thresh is only good because tanks are bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fallen Artemis","date":"2017-07-09T14:55:52.906+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dont play Thresh that often anymore, but when i do im either really ahead or really behind. To be honest, i dont think Riot even did anything to Thresh lately, its just the support items being so strong right now. You rush a redemption on him, an item that i never would of even thought would go on a support like Thresh. \n\nThe circlejerk is going to Thresh for no reason, when in reality its the support items doing this to him. Please dont blame the champion before you look at his changes, especially when you know there have been a couple threads on the front page of this Board saying support items are overpowered or busted at the moment. \n\nIts not Thresh that needs the nerfs, its the support items. The only change they did to Thresh lately was in 7.9 and it was a very minor buff(Increased his Magic Resist growth to 0.5 from 0.)","replies":[{"poster":"Danjeng","date":"2017-07-09T15:07:52.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's true Thresh is powerful due to items, but other tank supports, such as Alistar or Braum aren't doing as well.\n\nLet me give you another scenario that you might feel less biased about. When Lucian was meta because of Black Cleaver and BotRK, he deserved those nerfs no? It wasn't just the items, since few other champions did as well as he did using those items. SImilarly, Thresh uses those items too well.\n\nI see Thresh pretty often and I don't have a soft spot for supps. Most people just ignore you guys and gals, but I see what you can do. A good Thresh hook can decide a fight. Every ability in his kit is impactful actually. And I know that Thresh is picked a whole lot and does more than some other supports can do (he does practically everything). Thresh is arguably the best support in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Fallen Artemis","date":"2017-07-09T15:26:14.470+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A good Thresh hook has always been able to decide a fight, ever since his release. Its the same thing with Blitzcrank. I dont understand why people are complaining about his hook and utility now, just because there is a circlejerk on him at the moment.\n\nAnd if Thresh uses those items too well, what about the top three supports right now, Janna, Sona, and Soraka? If Thresh needs to be nerfed with that logic, then those three need to be nerfed as well. But you can just avoid the nerfing of four popular supports just by nerfing the support items.\n\nCheck out the thread i just made on Gameplay about this.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
