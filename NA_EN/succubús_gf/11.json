If they have a high gold lead and kill lead (like 45 to 10) type of thing, yet its like this unanimous NEVER SURRENDER!1!!!!!!1 like why? And where di that come from? Because that type of idiocy needs to go","replies":[{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2016-12-22T04:25:23.337+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"See, heres the thing. There is only 2 ways to have a 100% chance of defeat. The first is the enemy killing your nexus. The second is the team surrendering.\n\nIve won games that the enemy had 20+ kill lead because of backdoors. Ive won games when it got to late game when the team gold advantage doesnt mean anything, because once the teams get to the point where everyone is level 18 with full build, it is just a matter of who gets lucky or who can end it. Ive had a game where my team had 3 people that tried to surrender and i chose no. The 5th person didnt vote yet. I was the last one alive vs enemy team. I was playing Old Mordekaiser. The enemy Yi got cocky and came at me, died, got ghosted, then i proceeded to take out the rest of the enemy team. My team respawned and the last person on my team voted no. They proceeded to kill the enemy team and win the game with me just sitting and defending the base since the inhibitor was up, but there was no nexus turrets left.\n\nYou want to try saying its idiocy? The only idiocy is making sure its a 100% loss. Even with you feeding because you didnt surrender at 20 minutes..... Boo hoo. That makes it so YOU are the only one to blame for the loss. You give up, then you can not blame the team.\n\nFlaming happens when the people who give up and want to assure a 100% loss blames the team for the loss. It happens when people only care about themself and be self centered saying that their time is more valuable than any of the other 9 people in the game. \n\nFlaming happens when people stop thinking. Period.\n\nAlso check out the song from Instalock called \"i wont give up\" on youtube.","replies":[{"poster":"Hiolol","date":"2017-02-20T12:19:34.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's people like you that make me want to smash my head into a wall.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-02-20T12:25:28.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And it's people who necro threads for pointless comments that make regular forum users want to smash their heads into walls.\n\nIf you're going to necro a 2 month old thread, at least bring something worthwhile to the conversation.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mhihnj","date":"2016-12-22T06:22:01.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Also check out the song from Instalock called \"i wont give up\" on youtube.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekAF1PBPMYY","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JavelinJoe","date":"2016-12-22T03:42:25.348+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was not the French","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2016-12-22T05:03:02.427+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"sir Winston Churchill  June 4th 1940","replies":[]},{"poster":"RookPusher","date":"2016-12-22T04:14:48.293+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't surrender because 50% of the time the guy asking to surrender is the reason we're considering it.
