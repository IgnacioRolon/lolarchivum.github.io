Perma-invis is not something that can be balanced. You cant pink ward the whole map and good evelynns know where to go to not be seen.\n\nMy friend who mains shaco never ever ganks from river. You know why? Because you cant pink ward a side bush..He ganks from the lane which honestly guarentees him summoners every single time.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=jojo9800,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QKoOTyMG,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-08-28T22:04:20.412+0000)\n>\n> if you know how to play just slap one in lane\n\n if you do manage to pink ward the side that means you have to be pushed up to actually defend it. If thats the case then the pink ward does absolutely nothing... since you're pushed past it....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-08-28T22:12:18.284+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What lore?

Say it with me, assassin, her kit is designed to creep up on you and delete you from existence without saying a word.\nHer lore is minimal yes, but it covers who she is, an expensive assassin, the reason it is shrouded in mystery is simply because she is good at covering her tracks, which is what assassins do therefore leaving only speculation on where she resides. But as an indicator, twisted fate is her rival, therefore they probably live in the same region.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-08-29T00:10:39.783+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"ok you put a thread about {{champion:32}} needing to be gutted and nerfed that is too strong and now you start a thread about how you hope they dont touch {{champion:28}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2016-08-28T22:12:02.920+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"My hope is that they'll just gut Eve.\n\nStealth was a mistake and has no place in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-08-29T01:11:20.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stealth currently might not be healthy but to most champs its balanced enough.
