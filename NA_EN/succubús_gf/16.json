I don't know if I can or will get better playing vs them when it is usually not that great. \n\nYea some games are random, recent had former Plat jg then all bronze/silver vs 2 gold and some high silvers. Yea I wish the plat jg could carry, but he couldn't and we got wrecked.

MMR and ELO rank are different things. With boosting (AKA premaking) it's perfectly possible to be plat and still plat at a silver or even bronze level.

This is just a core misunderstanding of the matchmaking system.\nThey try to have an even average mmr on both sides.\nIf you have higher mmr than everyone on the other team, then your teammates will have lower mmr than the players on the other team so it remains somewhat even. If you're maintaining approximately a 50% winrate, that's just an indication that the matchmaking system is actually working well. If every game were easy and you stomped the enemy team, it would be terrible matchmaking for the other team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Purple Death","date":"2017-03-01T03:43:02.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dynikus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Q10226A7,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-01T03:39:03.969+0000)\n>\n> Have you considered that maybe mid silver is where your skill currently is?\n> Rather than find something else to blame for why you aren&#x27;t climbing, maybe just focus on your own gameplay and any mistakes you make and try to improve.\n> Even if you play well, that doesn&#x27;t mean you couldn&#x27;t play better.\n\nThis may be a tall order my good sir.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Touch My Box","date":"2017-03-01T05:55:05.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"git good and carry.","replies":[]}]}
