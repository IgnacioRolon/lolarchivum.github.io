Assuming you werent trolling or something. \nI don't care if ekko slid away with a sliver of life, I want to know what you did while he ran like a bitch.

Why should  I play some one that deal LESS damage than a utility tank?\n\nWho the fuck even said this? Phreak played irelia what the hell are you talking about? Nobody said shit about any burst mage.\n\nKayle has aoe DPS with a short windup. Call it what you want but she doesnt need to constantly be utilizing her damage like ekko does. Ekko doesnt get shit done unless he's constantly doing this especially against a sustain champ.\n\n> Ekko damage and survivability is similiar to mundo before his nerfs. Mundo, the guy with single target skillshot slow and a move speed attached  to his ult. Mundo the juggernaut. \n\nMundo was shit for the longest time and got toned down as they made alot of other changes.\nMundo does good sometimes but for the most part he really isnt that big an issue, he never has been and niether is ekko\nMundo has ranged, manaless, max hp damage on a low cooldown\nMundo doesn't have to go base when you get him down to 10hp\n\nI don't care if he has mundo's damage, mundo didn't have great damage, and frankly mundo is better at it than ekko is.\nI don't care if he has mundo's survivability. You can send him running with his tail between his legs just like mundo \n\n\n> I have no problem with any juggernaut having that damage. But a tank with utility? With 3 slows, gap closer, execute and a potential aoe stun?\n\nwho cares? He does nothing unless you fell that far behind anyways. Of course you went glass as hell so I can see why you might struggle but the stats say you were doing just fine, ekko wasn't even getting kills till 18 minutes into the match. Strong early with a climax and burn out. He acts similarly to a really shitty juggernaut regardless of his mobility. While he was frustrating the hell out of you your team reached a 6.9k advantage. \n\nI'm sure it looked very intimidating... but you were absolutely shitting on him. Just all over him. Just smearing it in his face. But then somehow your team threw after you lost baron.\n \n> It like having tank malphite dealing the same damage as AP malphite.\n\nMore like AD malphite. Tank ekko's damage isnt that good. One match I'd splitpush and just teleport out while he hit me to outrun him because his damage was so terrible. You just can't stop him from dealing it, similar to garen but he has no really significant execute. But he's like AD malphite because he doesnt deal much damage but then you just cant make him stop and really even then he doesnt have the CC. His stun is nothing compared to that CC ignoring knockup. \n\n> Sure there were some throws, even professional game has throws.\n\nYou lost from a 6.9k lead. That's not just throws that massive throws. That's catastrophic throws.\n\nThe point is that tank ekko isnt why you lost and likely had very little to do with why you lost. Killing ekko makes you feel good but it isnt the objective. You didnt lose because of ekko you lost because of some huge throws. \n\nMonstrous throws\nMore throws than a baseball game\nYou threw thoroughly\nYou choked \nYou keeled over \nYou dropped the ball\n\n> But hey hey hey, mister expert knows more than riot. Tank ekko is getting nerfed for nothing in pbe again.\n\nI know alot, and so does riot.\n\nI know more than you apparently, you don't have to be OP to get nerfs from riot, they've mentioned this several times. He's also getting buffs by the way but the crying children on the gameplay forums probably wont mention that part because it doesnt fit into their little realty.\n\nBtw epic throws.\n\nso little to do with ekko.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-06-01T00:46:47.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you are entirely correct.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2016-05-26T09:00:47.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gee, it's almost like making a champion with a massively overloaded kit full of utility, mobility, damage, defense and a ton of versatility in both role and build path was a BAD idea.
