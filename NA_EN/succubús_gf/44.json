If a team snowballs an opponent team 24/3 while Eve has the three kills, Eve has the worst recovery kit in the game to compensate such a comeback. She loses her jungle, and can't effectively farm in lane (about 4-5 cs per then long cooldown). She has trouble clearing a lane push as well, and results in many games where she's the only one alive, and is forced to just watch as the other team 5 man pushes an entire lane, unless she wants to blow an ult, which might clear 1 wave of minions and save the turret for about 10 seconds until the next wave arrives.\n\nFurthermore, certain team compositions are just crazily effective at shutting Eve down, even after new runes. Annie, Quinn, Cho gath, Malhazar, Zac, Vayne, Leona, Morgana, all soundly shut her down as to many others. Even Sona shuts her down. Twitch Outruns her, and has a superior stealth that doesn't break even if you hit him with skills. Karma outruns and out defends vs her to the point she will likely NEVER kill Karma.\n\nI can go 10/0/5 in the first 13 minutes of Evelynn, and still have little to no effect on the game, if they have those champs, because she has no actual point to enter a fight vs their oppressive low cooldown shutdowns/escape prevention. And because she has no real lane push, she sucks at split pushing, and relies on teammates for objectives (baron literally melts her; drake is risky solo). (She is literally the ONLY jungler I know who almost dies in 3 hits at Baron). \n\nShe's a bit better with new runes and the 1.5 sec Demon shade adjustment, but her weaknesses are still visible.
