P.S Dodge his Q while you're at it to save yourself the time)- Should also memorize how far/close Rakan is and if he can use his Knockup or not (I find Rakan W/ADC practically screwed if he misses his Knockup). You'll have a somewhat hard time Start-Game until you (Support) hits Lvl 2.\n\nIf you're ADC, I find Caitlyn to just shred through Xayah (Given your Support isn't a Shield support) and Draven to murder Rakan (If you get hit by his Knockup, your support shouldn't run away, they should hit him or Xayah with CC). Basically, if you want a higher chance to beat the combo don't end up with a Shield support... Unless you're Janna cuz F*cking tornado\n\nEdit: I'd also like to point out- if you see Rakan miss his Knockup and Xayah is going towards her tower (Not going for the follow up) then that's also a perfect time to take him down a great deal or Xayah aswell if she still tries to do a late follow-up (Happens more times than i'd like to see).

I usually stand at 2 stacks of power chord so whenever Rakan engages on my adc, I use diminuendo + exhaust on their adc. Most of the time, this is enough to shut them down and turn back the fight on them. Of course, you don't stay close to your adc or else it's over.\n\n{{champion:117}} She can polymorph Xayah and basically shield your adc. Also, if Xayah is not exactly near Rakan, Lulu can slow Xayah down with her Q. After polymorph's duration ends, you can throw exhaust at Xayah. \n\n{{champion:25}} Basically one of the biggest counter to Rakan because of her black shield. Timing is very important. If your adc manages to get caught, try to throw a bind on Xayah.\n\n{{champion:40}} She can knockup Rakan before his W lands. Also, she can prevent Rakan from shielding Xayah too. if your adc gets caught, simply peel XAYAH back with your ultimate before running away too.\n\n{{champion:43}} A little bit harder to counter Xayah and Rakan. But if your adc gets caught, you need to use Mantra shield AFTER the knockup so he can benefit from the movespeed bonus. Try binding Xayah with your W. If she is fed, you can throw an exhaust to damper the damage.\n\n{{champion:16}} If you hit someone with starcall, your W will provide rejuvenation on the next healing ally.

You need to be in a position where you fight on your terms, not theirs. Janna, Vayne and Alistar work well in cancelling Rakan's W and knocking him away should he ult. He is your priority until his engage is spent, then you can fully commit on Xayah with little worry.\n\nAlso more aggressive supports like Leona do well in that match up, in that their engage is a helluva lot harder than Rakan if she can reach Xayah.

His W also is on a high cooldown aswell 18-12 sec, so if he missed it, at this time you can go and try to trade with xayah or him, as he cant do anything while his W is down and is pretty much useless, and you have a huge advantage with your supp to go and trade with xayah or zone her off farm during that time.\n\nWhen he hits 6, his R into W almost guaranteess a knockup. At this point you just want to make sure you are never in a bad position or close to him, unless you know you can survive or outplay his engage. If he flashes to get into range, you must do the same.
