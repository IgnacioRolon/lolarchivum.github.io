Like full tank. And yet sit in the back, like they just sit there and expect  someone to go in for them. As someone who plays a LOT of assassins it is my hope that the tank goes in so i can blink in before anybody realizes i was even there. Especially if I play someone like kat who needs a solid engager, STOP BEING AFRAID to take damage. If you want to play scared go main adcs.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2016-09-20T08:49:43.018+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. You are not in as good of a position as you think you're in.\n\n2. Carries on the team have a proven track record of not following up on engages.\n\n3. The enemy team has Janna and I am not playing Malphite.\n\n4. We are so behind that we cannot win the teamfight even with a 3+ person stun, so we need to go for picks during rotations.\n\n5.

Will said tank get the correct follow if they go in?\n2.) is it better to actually engage a fight, or peel for the team carries?\n3.) Is this actually the correct time to even attempt an engage?\n4.)

You will soon learn that supports and junglers are the games scapegoats. As a jungler you will be expected to be in all lanes to help at the same time. Someone on your team will be pinging for assistance before you even reach level 2 because they wanted to fight level 1 and are now about to die and hiding at their turret. And if 1 lane is having trouble and you spend extra time to help them.....as soon as someone else dies in another lane they will flame and blame u. Hell, ive even seen games where the team had a afk and the jungler had to cover the lane and people still have the nerve to complain about getting no ganks. And as support no matter what happens its your fault. No point in arguing it..just accept it, that is the mindset in this game. if the adc dies, YOU LET THEM DIE.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-20T07:09:25.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to that life known as low elo.

Am I a tank that's really built to engage (Sion, Zac, Sejuani) or a tank built to peel (Shen, Braum)?  Either can engage, but vanguards are usually better built to succeed. \n2. Is my engage ability (sometimes it's my ultimate) up?  If it's the ult you can usually tell by the green circle above my character portrait on top of the minimap. \n3. Is anyone going to follow up?  This is the most important because a tank has all he or she needs to survive the crash (more if you're a vanguard) but not much to survive the aftermath. Can't tell you how many times I've died in a teamfight because nobody focused the ADC that was chipping away at me. \n\nIf you want a tank to engage, they need to know that you'll have their back and help keep them alive so they can keep you alive. Tanks draw focus, while the damage dealers use that distraction to kill the enemy damage dealers. \n\nIt doesn't work if one side doesn't do their job.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-09-20T13:10:47.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Land your CC so I can get a clean engage.

Sometimes Im waiting for a chance to go in and im sitting here watching my team spam away their mana not hitting a thing. of course im not going in if you dont even have mana to follow up with.\n\n2. Sometimes you are in a stand off with the other team and there is always that 1 person on your team that thinks they are playing ARAM and stays there with 200 health thinking \"i got this!\". Umm yeah im not initiating then either. Fool go HEAL.\n\n3. Another time you will see me not going in is if im playing {{champion:89}} and the team has already shown me earlier in the game that when I go in, they turn and run away.....yeah ....dont expect me to initiate again. {{champion:89}}  is a all in champ. once she goes in, shes in. Too slow to get away.
