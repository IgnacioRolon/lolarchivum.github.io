There should be absolutely no way for fiora to beat this guy early on (especially with ignite) without any help from the jungler, she'll just be sitting under tower for most of the early and mid game.\n\n2. {{champion:58}}: Another lane bully and another champion who bullies Fiora VERY heavily in the early-mid game. Like pantheon, his stun is instant, he has sustain which pantheon does not and his full combo can easily burst down a fiora. Paired with ignite, he can definitely kill her at level three. Being in melee range of this guy HURTS.\n\n3. {{champion:23}} Laning against this guy is an absolute nightmare. Fiora might as well be a three ability champ because her riposte is completely useless (unless you somehow manage to parry his W). Early game RNG crits with a 5 second unkillable time, he can outduel a fiora any stage of the game and can even match with her in terms of splitpushing.\n\n4. {{champion:24}}: Now Jax to some people is more of a skill match-up but from what I've seen, he can definitely out-trade fiora early to mid game and scales well into late game. His combo (or poke) which consists of various AA cancels are much superior to fiora's early trades. Most people think Fiora counters Jax because she can riposte his E but it's up to > JAX < when to re-activate it, he can easily bait out her parry and when he does, he can definitely kill her.\n\n5. {{champion:150}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:126}}: Ranged and poke champs can easily abuse fiora's squishiness early game, and if she comes into melee range to trade - they will often have escape tools to kite back and poke her even more. \n\n6. {{champion:75}}: Battle for early game, whoever gets the snowball first will always be able to kill the other with ease since both are late game monsters.

There should be absolutely no way for fiora to beat this guy early on (especially with ignite) without any help from the jungler, she&#x27;ll just be sitting under tower for most of the early and mid game.\n\nI never debated this?\n\n> 2. {{champion:58}}: Another lane bully and another champion who bullies Fiora VERY heavily in the early-mid game. Like pantheon, his stun is instant, he has sustain which pantheon does not and his full combo can easily burst down a fiora. Paired with ignite, he can definitely kill her at level three. Being in melee range of this guy HURTS.\n\nAt the same time the W is rather predictable making this a skill matchup in Renekton's favor - but Fiora outscales him. Not even close to Pantheon. Slightly bad yes, but she doesn't get dumpstered.\n\n> 3. {{champion:23}} Laning against this guy is an absolute nightmare. Fiora might as well be a three ability champ because her riposte is completely useless (unless you somehow manage to parry his W). Early game RNG crits with a 5 second unkillable time, he can outduel a fiora any stage of the game and can even match with her in terms of splitpushing.\n\nAS slow... In Tryndamere's favor, but not \"an absolute nightmare\". \n\n> 4. {{champion:24}}: Now Jax to some people is more of a skill match-up but from what I&#x27;ve seen, he can definitely out-trade fiora early to mid game and scales well into late game. His combo (or poke) which consists of various AA cancels are much superior to fiora&#x27;s early trades. Most people think Fiora counters Jax because she can riposte his E but it&#x27;s up to &gt; JAX &lt; when to re-activate it, he can easily bait out her parry and when he does, he can definitely kill her.\n\nDepends on whether you hit parry or not. He kinda has trouble dodging the W skillshort part aswell so very outplayable. Not a counter at all, slightly good matchup for Fiora. He can't really bait out her parry, it all depends on when he reactivates his E - but she should always get the AS slow.\n\n> 5. {{champion:150}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:126}}: Ranged and poke champs can easily abuse fiora&#x27;s squishiness early game, and if she comes into melee range to trade - they will often have escape tools to kite back and poke her even more. \n\nWut?? You said: \n\n> She's only prevalent right now because people are playing carries top (kennen, jayce and the like), she's a duelist and would be able to match them in laning power and scaling.\n\nYou are contradicting yourself..\n\n> 6. {{champion:75}}: Battle for early game, whoever gets the snowball first will always be able to kill the other with ease since both are late game monsters. Nasus personally imo, has the edge with his infinite stacking and his wither drastically slowing fiora&#x27;s attack speed and move speed as well as being instant cast.\n\nAgreed. \n\n> 7. {{champion:54}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:2}} are also favorable against Fiora.\n> Malphite has an attack speed slow, bonus armor, and steals movement speed from Fiora. His ult completely depends on Fiora&#x27;s reaction time.\n\nMalph yes, although he still has to plaz Malphite which means that he is very vulnerable to ganks. \n\n> Poppy has a W which stops Fiora&#x27;s dashes, putting them on a &gt; 16 &lt; second cooldown early game which is insane. Her Q does %MaxHP damage and her E can easily stun an unsuspecting Fiora.\n\nQ+W=stunned Poppy. Fiora counters Poppy. I don't get how her E should \"easily stun an unsuspecting Fiora\". You'd have to change \"unsuspecting\" for \"stupid\". \n\n> Olaf has AS steroids, Q poke, lane sustain and extra armor/AD and can outtrade fiora early-mid game.\n\nProbably has a decent matchup against Fiora, but I don't think that Olaf is useful + he gets outscaled. Also very vulnerable to ganks, toplane Olaf is pretty troll. \n\n> The rest of the match-ups are heavily skill based: {{champion:122}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:164}}\n\nBtw, take a look at http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/de/champions/counters/fiora/diamond the winrates support what I say.","replies":[{"poster":"My Heartshaker","date":"2017-06-07T23:16:31.818+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">{{champion:58}} : At the same time the W is rather predictable making this a skill matchup in Renekton's favor - but Fiora outscales him.

In Tryndamere's favor, but not \"an absolute nightmare\".\n\nI don't know if you've ever faced a Tryndamere as Fiora before but it's very hard to out duel him at pretty much every stage of the game.
