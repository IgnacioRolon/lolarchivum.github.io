Also Riot being more robotic in their response and only taking to happy replies is a sign of weakness.

I am sorry if I am not bring in sunshine and rainbows to this thread, that comes after the storm if you haven't gotten killed by it.\n\nAlso, you must be feeling so threatened by me using the words I do to make an analogy to violence and assuming that I am speaking for others. Nope, just speaking for myself and I am raising awareness of one issue that I see in the fanbase and that is their too much of one extreme, well at least here on the boards when it comes to positive or negative feels towards riot. So do me a favor and don't put words in my mouth. \n\nAnd I am just someone that is pretty iff'ed over the opposite of being a flamer and trash talker of riot can that is being a half-honest fanboy that heaps praise over something that is they don't have as much love for as they claim and over exaggerate what their love. \n\nIf you like my Opinion, cool let's talk about what's good about it, what's bad and how we can improve on it. If you don't like it, criticise me on how is wrong and be respectful about it if I don't go too far but don't fucking assume I am being an asshole for the sake of it or that I am doing this for attention and not highlighting a legitimate concern. So if people listen, well that's a start, if they don't, I'll watch and see if I am right or wrong. If I am will admit it on the spot, of not.

The established methods are much more effective than your method of taking every mistake by Riot personally and attacking Riot as if they killed your dog.\n\nI'm not entirely sure this is a parallel so correct me if I am wrong, and also my understanding is VERY limited, mostly based on my personal experiences, but it sounds a lot like a concept I am quite familiar with that has....unfortunate connotations.\n\nThe concept I am referring to is \"gaman\" a Japanese phrase/saying essentially meaning something along the lines of \"endure, don't stick out, bend with the wind, don't complain, etc.\"\n\nThe reason why it's an issue is that gaman was and is so laced with the culture and the idea that you shouldn't voice your concerns, that the Japanese had been persecuted and they basically did very little to protest it. Additionally, the idea of gaman, from my understanding, is a contributor to the suicide rates in Japan, since there is a desire to not voice dissent. This can be harmful.\n\nI agree that violent dissent is not the way to go. That's something I can definitely agree with. But I think it is also important to highlight that sometimes, standing firm does a lot more than just kind of passively mentioning something in hopes things will change. Voicing change, petitioning for it, and taking a stand is WORLDS different than flinging a bunch of insults around or mindless accusations.\n\nIf something needs to be changed for the better, or that is an opinion, that opinion should be presented with reasonable examples and suggestions. But it also should not be written off as \"players not knowing what they are talking about\" or \"entitled players are whining\". Such things tend to irritate those with actual concerns, and that can have a damaging effect on relations to come to either a change or compromise as well.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-12-09T07:57:22.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gaman has absolutely nothing to do with what I'm talking about.\n\nI'm talking about how to give criticism in a way that will get it heard.

I don't think so because they are both ignorant on one critical point: Loyalty, even if praisers sugarcoat it, they don't have legit loyalty to the game and just treat rioter like an object of their affection and putting them on a pedestal. because of some people need to be submissive to something and be an obstacle for debate, discussions and criticisms by barring any form of negativity , ironically becoming just like trolls in that regard.\n\nWorse of all, people are too damn emotional and that was the **EXACT** reason I had to be an asshole. I must say I got big results, as it was intended to see if people could deflect an assholian attitude with constructive criticism or maintain a friendly attitude in spite of it. instead I see people getting defensive and offended too damn easy. I understand insults are bad and can piss people off (that fact being obvious as fuck) but if people don't have a thick skin or conviction in their positivity then I am sorry, I will not apologize on the principle that people are not willing see past insult, forgive or keep calm in order to have a proper dialogue in the forums.\n\nEven worse I got quite a bit of attention from talking smack here and I got people hook line and sinker and in spite of you and others saying the people wouldn't listen if i am being an ass about making my points and people failed and that is properly why the forums is such a cesspool. Because people value their feeling than objective points and by being an ass, especially on a positive thread and then raise some hell their instead of it being shut down shows that people can't make the hard choice and still be nice before losing their temper or get offended. When you focus on the negative, things will become negative. \n\nAnd personally, I love the game damn much and I criticise Riot because they can do better and I have faith in them as Rioter to really do good and I wouldn't be this harsh if I didn't care because I would have just left and nothing would have happened. Because I have made my point clear and the proof is in the pudding. So take it or leave it My point stands.\n\nAnd for those that did get it allow me to say it in bold: **I FUCKING LOVE LEAUGE AND EVEN IF I GIVE SHIT TO THE DEV'S I STILL RESPECT THEM. SO  RIOT EVEN IF YOU MAKE SOME FUCKED UPS BUT I LOVE THIS GAME AND I AM GLAD TO PLAY IT.**\n\n###### Sorry for the melodrama.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2017-12-12T13:43:09.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">but if people don't have a thick skin or conviction in their positivity then I am sorry\n\nHonestly, you're not the one here who's going to dictate what people can tolerate and just how much of it. Rioters rarely ever respond in a negative manner simply because the company policy is to never go out of line or else your attitude will surely be noticed by people and then some action is going to be taken against you.\n\nSo they either respond in a polite manner, or they don't.\nIt's that simple. As far as your rather poor quality of bait for others goes, it's still shit if you have to resort to these tactics because you can't actually converse with others unless you're already ready to insult someone.\n\n>I love the game damn much and I criticise Riot\n\nCriticism is one thing, insulting someone and then calling it \"criticism\" is another.\nThat excuse won't fly anymore. You can love the game and be fair towards the people that are in charge of changing it. You don't have to be polite. You can be frustrated but the moment you aim your frustrations towards them, that's when you're crossing the line and things get personal. Many people don't seem to be aware the line even exists. And that's the problem with the boards.\n\nDon't poke the bear for the sake of your crappy social experiment.\nYou expect of people to read your presentation and read in between the lines and yet, the whole read you have prepped for them is so unappealing that no one wants to even bother. You are responsible for how you present yourself and how you present your opinions on the boards. If you can't see the fault in that (and that your crappy attitude can most of the times ruin it), don't try to blame others for failing to see reason, since you were the first one who threw it out the window because you weren't getting any results for being reasonable.\n\nNegative attention will always attract more negative attention.\nThere is no logic behind your \"people should only care about the facts, not how i present them\" attitude. You can't expect to get a respectful comment when your comment itself shows no respect towards others. You can't put a diamond a mountain of crap and say it's all worth a million dollars. A diamond is worth a million dollars but you still have to rummage through a mountain of shit to get to it and that's the part no one is looking forward to.\n\n_**Putting that into perspective:**_\nIf i have to read your comments and pick it apart word for word, ignore all the insults only to get to a sentence or two of actual issues you have with the game...why? If these two sentences were the only thing important, why couldn't you have started from that and opened a discussion from there instead?\n\n---\n#EDIT:\n\nI've taken a look at the entire comment stack and it seems that every single person who was involved in responding to you (even me), passed your alleged \"assholish\" test. We've successfully deflected it and told you that your attitude is rather lacking, even if you had valid criticisms towards the game. I don't deny you've had to deal with the more assholish players that frequent these boards. We all did and still do on a daily basis. That's not going to change. But don't encourage the attitude further.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Succubús GF","date":"2017-12-08T02:33:36.061+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":7,"body":"Do they fuck up a lot? Yes.
