It's hard but you got to grind. This game is always going to be unbalanced so you as an Individual need to go ham if you want to climb or improve.

If I go normals *by myself as a Plat player* I usually am up against anything between Silvers and Diamonds. If someone mostly plays ranked their normal \"elo\" will be much lower.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BlueBilberry","date":"2017-07-12T02:54:24.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normal games are normal games.
