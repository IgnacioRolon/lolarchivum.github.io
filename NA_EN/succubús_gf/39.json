They're far from the most dangerous opponents-- Genji is more likely to feed than most of his competition.

Hanzo also has an escape on a fair cooldown without cost.\nIt's not that their powerful or that their escapes enable busted plays. Nobody wants to face them because it's unrewarding and difficult. They're just asinine patterns; by all accounts the kill should be yours, but both characters will escape 9/10 times unless they've initiated or gone really ham on you-- and even then, most times it won't be enough.
