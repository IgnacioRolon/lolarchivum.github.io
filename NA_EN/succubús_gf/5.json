As orianna, i rushed negatron and roa and still she did like 800 damage with q and e. The purpose of mr is too negate that.  Ridiculous that there is hardly any counterplay to her. and oh, you thought you finally got her in an outplay scenario. HAH nope she will just come back.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-01T22:41:17.170+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can.. you know, dodge the huge, telegraphed, slow-moving Q?\n\nCounterplay: She has zero mobility, zero defensive abilities, cant stun at point-blank range, is incredibly squishy, mana-hungry, and is very short-range unless you stand still for free Q.","replies":[{"poster":"Michael Sykes","date":"2016-08-02T09:42:33.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"she is very safe because of her egg. yeah, she has counterplay, but she is on a very strong side atm","replies":[{"poster":"Gibberwatt","date":"2016-08-02T10:28:01.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"wym, strong side atm? Her egg is purely a self tilt device if she doesn't get under a tower, and adc's can usually still kill it then.  She is squishy af early, such that any burst can pretty much nuke her down.  She is immobile, unless she is up against a champ that doesn't have a dash (all four of them).  True, she has massive burst, but she also runs out of mana faster than a lvl 3 chogath.  Also, Magicflyingllama is correct, that the ice ball is slow af.  Anyone can dodge that unless the anivia is god.  \n\nHer strengths are basically that if someone runs in a straight line in a fixed direction, she can murder them.  Also, if they stand still.  But she can only do it once, then she's out of mana.  And if they bait her q out, then jump on her, she is screwed.  But if they jump on her when she does have her q, she might live.  maybe.  And it takes 240 seconds for her egg to come back.","replies":[{"poster":"Michael Sykes","date":"2016-08-02T12:00:20.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am talking about good Anivia players, and about her winrate. Of course the player needs to know how to utilize her passive.\nShe has a great zoning potential, both dps and burst and has a tanky itembuild.\nHer strengths are teamfights, where she just has to combo her ultimate with her e to burst an adc.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Treune81","date":"2016-08-01T22:11:14.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anivia is strong now.I think she needs small nerfs.Utility nerf maybe because she is very rewarding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-08-01T22:15:24.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nothing to talk about.
