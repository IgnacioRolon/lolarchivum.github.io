I've won 4 of my past 20 games. Yes some are definitely my fault because at this point I'm so tilted, but undeniably most of them are because of stupid team mates being stupid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OneMustFall","date":"2018-11-05T08:30:59.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Usually loss streaks are due to a poor mentality. You start blaming your mistakes on the team feeding instead of looking for opportunities to carry the game. And whether you realize it or not, you're making a lot of mistakes. It's super easy to get caught up in the toxic spiral of spreading your poor mindset too when you start a game. If you're on a loss streak the best thing you can do is not talk about it in game to your team. Stay positive and focus on not making at least one of the mistakes you made last game. If you can't stay positive, take a break and come back when you've cleared your mind.","replies":[{"poster":"Succubús GF","date":"2018-11-05T09:09:09.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thats really fucking dumb because the first question i ask myself is what could i have done better. its not about poor mentality its about inters and gameplay","replies":[{"poster":"OneMustFall","date":"2018-11-05T20:51:28.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lilithh,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=K1NX4FAA,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-11-05T09:09:09.928+0000)\n>\n> Thats really fucking dumb because the first question i ask myself is what could i have done better. its not about poor mentality its about inters and gameplay\n\nAnd that's why you lose.

Sometimes it might be you, but it's definitely possible to happen naturally. \n\nYou can't carry every game, even if you're at the top of your game constantly. You basically just have to grind through games and keep hoping you have good ones. Of course take a break in between as grinding for long periods of time sucks.","replies":[]}]}
