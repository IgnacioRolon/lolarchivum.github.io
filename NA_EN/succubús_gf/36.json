It is an item that is suitable for any champion who utilizes Ability Power. \n\nSo getting it on Riven is trolling. \n\nBut if your only criteria is that they purchased it first, and you then report them for trolling, Riot will not do anything to them. \n\nIf you continue to do so, your reports will literally mean nothing because reporting someone for trolling when they are not trolling, is trolling.
