( have not attempted the custom match part yet tho ). When ever I queue up and someone fails to choose a champion or dodge, the client i guess \"half freezes\" theres still an animation but you cant do anything or click anything and it isnt unresponsive. The little hash marks that usually go around a champion someones picking where it displays the splash art turns to almost a cats eye pupil shape and theres a 0 at the top. other than that the rest of the client is blue. You cant click anywhere and you can minimize it and bring it back up but changes nothing. After a good 30 seconds to maybe 2 minutes if a queue pop comes up you see it with the accept button and decline button but no animations, you can try to click it but nothing really happens. One time i did try clicking accept and it worked but was still frozen and i was \"in\" the champ select part. After a little while half way through the banning phase it unfroze and i was the third one banning and had seconds left, luckily got my ban in and it unfroze the rest of the time. It's very weird why this is happening. It might be something to do with not being in low spec mode, even tho I have a CPU and RAM monitor showing 100% of the time and it wasnt capped it was around 60% CPU usage and 40% ram usage. Not sure if any of this helps but :D","replies":[]}]}]}
