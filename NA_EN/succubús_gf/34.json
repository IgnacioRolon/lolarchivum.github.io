A fire drake should do a lot more for you when losing than a earth drake.

With earth drake captures giving a decents % winrate I bet it helps snowball even more than fire.\n\nIncreased damage to minions will be impossible to push against, certainly without baron or a comp with far more waveclear.\n\nIn my earlier post I mentioned that stacking drakes is broken.\n\nMost tanks wont get much of a damage boost from infernal, because its % ap and ad not % damage boost.","replies":[{"poster":"PB4UAME","date":"2017-02-28T00:56:27.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> A fire drake should do a lot more for you when losing than a earth drake.

I'm entirely baffled as it's completely the other way around.  Infernal *only* increases your AD and AP.  It does not affect base damages, and for any fighter, diver, bruiser, or tank, they are getting less than a 2% increase in damage per infernal.  \n\nNo, Infernal is only good when you have AD and AP items.

Infernal drag boosts % AP and % AD. but if you are using a non auto attack based champion, then most of your AP and AD are only relevant in your skills.\n\nlets say your Q has a 60% ratio, your W no scaling, your E a 60% ratio, and your ult a 60%+60% ratio. then that means You will only get 60% of the infernal drags buff on your Q and your E, no effect whatsoever on your W, and 120% of the dragons effect on the ultimate.

The reason this is so frustrating, is that while I understand they SHOULDNT get three, sometimes it is too hard to contest. I feel like infernal should be one of those dragons that is REALLY good at helping a lesser team comp, do better, but rather it is, a roflstomping team comp that is maximizing it so that they just stomp even harder, personally ive never been a fan of these new dragons, but I feel like it shouldn&amp;#039;t really be rng, as in like there shouldn&amp;#039;t be a possibility to get three infernals (+24% ap and ad) like what? That&amp;#039;s just throwing free stats to champions who are already doing well in their lane, I don&amp;#039;t know, I just feel like it shouldn&amp;#039;t be so readily available to snowball even harder\n\nI made a thread saying that you shouldnt get 2 dragons of the same element spawning in a match and got downvoted. But stacking dragons is obviously broken. I would rather have 2 infernals than 1 of the other 3 each for example.\n\nYou say you dont like dragons helping snowball but I think that is the point of them. If dragons are worth taking than they will favour snowballs because the neutral monsters tend to go to the team thats ahead. I dont think individual dragons could do with a nerf. Stop elements stacking and I think they will be in a decent spot.","replies":[{"poster":"SuccubÃºs GF","date":"2017-02-27T20:45:24.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can agree with this","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Myrddin","date":"2017-02-28T15:20:09.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you're letting them take every dragon you deserve to lose....","replies":[{"poster":"the weeaboo","date":"2017-02-28T19:01:27.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty hard to steal if they got a broken ass jungler (cough Lee cough Zac cough) and their support is a Nunu/singed with Smite as well","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2017-02-27T23:30:10.789+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"The issue with dragons is that some are so much better than others.\n\nOh, you get 3 early infernals when you're winning?

There's no need for this extra luck in the game.\n\nIt's like, we've seen pro games in seasons 4/5 where a team goes too heavy on the early game power and then gets outscaled and loses because of it. Now if you go heavy on early game power versus a late game teamfight comp, if the dragons are infernals/mountains you win, if not you lose.

Something that shows a glowing dragon pit that increases over 5-10 seconds so we can see the change coming if we have sight of the pit, otherwise just updates the HUD with the new type.  And like the jungle respawn timers it can show a timer only if you saw it change or leave combat.\n\nThis would allow for the team to pick what drake they want, give some pressure to rush to the right one and give some balance to the drake.  I get that it means easy stacks for the same type, but add something that drake deals 7.5% more damage and receives 7.5% less damage per stack of the same element.  So first drake would have no change, but for your second mountain drake you would take 7.5% more damage and deal 7.5% less for your team, and a third drake would deal 15% more damage and take 15% less for your team, while the other team with no mountain drakes would receive no penalty (also makes it easier for a team without that drake to steal the kill).  Any kill after the 3rd of one type of drake gives gold and exp but no buff.\n\nTo make it more interesting I think it should start with a random drake, then randomly cycle through until all 4 have shown up before restarting the cycle, again randomly.  So using numbers to represent the drakes it could be 1 > 3 > 4 > 2 > 3 > 1 > 2 > 4.  Or if they really want to keep it random then make it a random cycle that will not pick the current or previous drake, but I like my idea more.  This would make it somewhat random and somewhat predictable, knowing that if the first drake is an infernal and it changes then you can't get back to the infernal for a minimum of 9 minutes.  Although it also means that a champion could run up and hit the drake to make it not change, so if you know that infernal is next (mountain, cloud and ocean drakes have already shown) and it would benefit the enemy more than your team you could delay the change to prevent the enemy from getting it.\n\nI think it would add a lot of fun and tactical planning while not really having to make changes to the drake's buffs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rito Staff","date":"2017-02-28T01:46:26.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I notice the other dragons aswell :P like the move speed and ocean one (the latter particularly once you stack 2)\n\nThe mountain is more try-hard oriented and maybe pros can take advantage of it better.\n\nFire drake, bronze\nAir drake, silver to gold\nOcean drake, gold to plat (I srsly think this one is a bit weak with just one of it)\nMountain drake is try hard.
