Like 0/8929891347867487/1 tf kind of bad. Like i get you can be new to a champion but if you just walk up to them and let them kill you. HOW IS THAT FUN seriously this game is starting to piss me off because of how horrible it is, like i honestly used to love this game and now it is just pure annoyance","replies":[{"poster":"Theorchero","date":"2016-09-03T22:58:08.297+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"Look, a lot of this game simply has to do with mentality.\n\nWith a piss poor mentality, you can't learn, and if you cannot learn you will be punished by this game extremely heavily, as every little mistake can potentially lose you the game.\n\nIf you play ranked, don't take it too too seriously. Shift your mentality away from winning and losing, that's irrelevant. Your goal is to *get better.* Improve on something. Do something better this game than you did last game. Only care about your own performance and whether or not you made any critical mistakes. \n\nIf this is still a struggle for you, mute your teammates and play normals. If it's still a truggle then you just need to stop playing, because this game isn't suited for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Meta Phyton","date":"2016-09-04T01:25:08.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey yeah. Or, go for a walk. Really. Being outside in nature in the forest or fields, getting some fresh air, seein the trees and all the nature stuff that we come from .. it is easing on the psyche, and freshens us up very well.\n\nWe just are not made to sit inside of a dark room staring at moving pixels all day long. It can work, but we have to take time to refresh, or else we will always be seeing the mistakes of others and become tilted easily.\n\nIt is like water torture, only we can easily save ourselves .. just by going outside for a walk. See, 5 drops are not bad, 100 drops are getting a bit bad.. but if you sit there, constantly.. and live through every little mistake, and give yourself no break or pause to recover .. you let yourself be water tortured until you are basically losing your sanity.\n\nSo be kind to yourself and go outside. Regain your sanity. Do not be water tortured.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Merzoth","date":"2016-09-04T05:05:42.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Theorchero,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4iEmqIsu,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2016-09-03T22:58:08.297+0000)\n>\n> Look, a lot of this game simply has to do with mentality.\n> \n> With a piss poor mentality, you can&#x27;t learn, and if you cannot learn you will be punished by this game extremely heavily, as every little mistake can potentially lose you the game.\n> \n> If you play ranked, don&#x27;t take it too too seriously.
