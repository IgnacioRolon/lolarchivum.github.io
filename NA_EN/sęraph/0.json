I told them in the very first post what I wanted the name changed to. They didn't tell me until after I bought the card that I couldn't change it to that. Now they refuse to do anything about and I am just another victim of Riot's shady business. \n\nI am putting in a complaint to the BBB. I recommend that no one ever buy anything from this company. I know I won't be spending any money on this game anymore. There is no telling how many people they scam each year. Guess they have to keep their shareholders happy by any means necessary. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/iLm6hya\n_you might need to zoom in on the image_","replies":[]}
