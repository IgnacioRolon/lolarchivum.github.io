You need to hit the vitals as Fiora. All Vayne has to do is auto attack)\r\n- When late game comes around, don't bother trying to kill Vayne. Just presses R and Q's/right clicks over and over. Virtually nothing you can do\r\n- One of the few champions in the game that can actually 1v9 like it's no big deal\r\n\r\nIm curious to hear your guys' thoughts on this. Maybe it's a low elo problem, but I swear this champion is far overtuned, and Ive been saying this for months. I also got word of her getting 50% cooldown refunded on her Q if she uses it while her ult is active or something wack. You will legit NEVER be able to kill Vayne (constant invisibility), she will be unstoppable. Might have to start perma banning her next patch, and you never want to have to ban an ADC as a midlaner...\r\n\r\nJust let me know what you think","replies":[{"poster":"AsTheSunSets","date":"2018-12-13T05:39:38.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"She can be hard to lockdown, but blows up immediately when anything lands.

Locking down Vayne almost guarantees she's dead before she can react. Obviously it depends on the team composition how effective that will be.\n\nIt's similar to Yi in the sense that it's vital to land CC but their kit makes it difficult. It has nothing to do with melee vs ranged. Yi has ultimate and alpha and Vayne has ultimate and tumble. There are tons of ranged CC moves to stop them both so I don't understand your argument about her range.\n\nI'd say Vayne is the least oppressive ADC to face but I main Sona. She's by far the easiest to harass and blow up.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"hoganftw","date":"2018-12-13T00:34:21.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"She's literally always been.

Theres plenty of ways to scale into the later parts of the game, play safe, or survive laning if you don't make stupid mistakes. She has some strong rune choices in Klepto, PTA, Tempo, Fleet Footwork and has two build paths that work incredibly well, On-Hit and Crit. Her range is the same as most Marksman and she spikes with 1-2 items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GaleWonder","date":"2018-12-13T05:32:06.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nerf vayne into a melee champ","replies":[]},{"poster":"The thigh guy","date":"2018-12-13T00:38:02.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She’s a non existent champion early game, her damage is required to be single target, her cc is heavily situational, and easily predicted.

Every time Vayne kills you, it is her fault for being OP with no counterplay rather than your fault in any way.
