I noticed that my laptop fan was making a noise that Ive never heard before. As in, it never happened while I played League but it started doing it as soon as I started playing CS:GO it started to make a &quot;whirring&quot; sound like it was overheating, but it didnt feel any hotter than when I played League. If anyone knows a solution or if this could potentially hard my computer please lmk in the comments. If you need anymore information about my computer or whatnot feel free to ask\n\nThanks!\n\nP.S. Yes I KNOW CS:GO isnt LoL related, but this is the best place I could expect a fast response. If i broke a rule or something please let me know and I will take it down\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the responses! :D","replies":[]}
