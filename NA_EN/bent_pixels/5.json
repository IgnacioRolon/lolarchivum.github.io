Currently at Silver 4, but i dont really care about ranked anymore since theres no way I can get to gold in 5 days. I played around 400 Ekko games this season and ended with a 53% winrate. Not to shabby imo. But Im thinking about switching mains to another midlaner, or possibly switching roles altogether.\r\n\r\n- I love damage and assassins\r\n- I love high skill cap champions\r\n- For some reason, I prefer AP champs over AD, but Im willing to play AD\r\n\r\nIf you have a champion like this, please let me know if theyre worth one-tricking\r\n\r\nThank you for reading ! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Tr4shB4NSYST3M","date":"2018-11-08T15:46:36.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would definitely keep ekko in your Champ pool, best way to climb is to play a small # of champs (2-3 max for each role), and Ekko is a great champ in general solid outplay potential to dodge skillshots w/ E dash/blink, R, and passive MS and good burst and potentially gamechanging CC, Plus he scales into a god tier split pusher once he gets {{item:3100}}.\n\nAs far as mid goes (can also flex top) i think {{champion:126}}  could be a fun one for you to pick up, as a poke ad caster/skirmisher jayce may have a tougher time getting work done in straight 5v5 teamfights (especially against comps with 1-2 tanks), but he more than makes up for that in his laning/skirmishing (1v1-2v2-3v3) potential As well as his ability to melt turrets in a split push/siege scenario.   Also i think he's worth looking into b/c of the upcoming pre-season turret changes (addition of shield bastion to turrets that gives gold when knocked down) considering jayce (especially vs a melee mid/top) can usually get a good bit of turret damage in this is just potential extra gold for him in the early game.","replies":[{"poster":"Bent Pixels","date":"2018-11-08T15:59:51.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasnt planning on completely leaving Ekko in the dust. Ive put far too much time into him to just stop playing him. Yes Ekko is fantastic and i love playing him, just looking for a potentially new midlaner to add to my champion pool. I hadnt even considered Jayce, just because he is rarely played/banned and I always imagine him up top, not necessarily mid.

You probably won't get bored of him either since he requires so much skill you'll always be learning something new.

She has decent cc with her charm, and you just need to play safe if your against someone who counters you until lvl 6... since her ult allows 3 dashes for easy escape or engage when getting a gank.\nLate game, she can catch enemies off guard with her ult and charm, allowing for an easy pick if you are with a teammate. \nMy largest problem with her is that I have a lot of trouble with her against zed.. so I have essentially needed to auto ban him most games I play mid.\nLet me know if you have any questions about her!\n\nJust my thoughts...
