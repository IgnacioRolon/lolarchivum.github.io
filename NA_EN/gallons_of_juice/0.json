Many of these champs that have been out for quite some time and should be a bit cheaper to purchase with IP. This game currently has 137 champs to choose from, 32 of which cost 6300 IP, and a banning system that demands a high minimum requirement for draft pick. It can be very difficult to achieve even for people who aren't playing ranked matches and want that nice drafty feel...ya feel? For those of us starting on a new league account and may not be able to afford RP and are really gunning for lets say.... Nami, being released for use since 2012. Don't you think its about time to drop the price a bit? I can bring up other OG champs that are in that 6300 roster but I will save those fun facts for you to find out. Raise the price of IP when coming out with reworks or new champs because of supply and demand. For the record for some reason you keep the reworks at the same price...? Give these old rusty champs some polish or consider some haggling even if  I could get it for 4800, maybe even raise the price of some of those 450 IP champs like Poppy,  Warwick, and Ashe. This would help with a balance of price and help to purchase champs I'm truly interested in playing. I would love to know your input on this matter.  (I know my punctuation and grammar need a bunch of work but I spend too much time playing this game instead of going to school because of things like over priced champs) Help me be a scholar and lower the IP cost pretty please with a cherry on top!\r\n\r\nSincerely, Steve that guy who gives that college try","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-04T21:45:57.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No harm in asking eh? As it turns out, we do already periodically reduce the IP/RP price of champions on a pretty regular schedule which you can find [**right over here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202083304).
