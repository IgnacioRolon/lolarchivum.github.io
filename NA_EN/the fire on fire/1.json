I will soon level up to lvl 30, so I am looking for people to play with. I have heard of 'elo hell' before, and I know that it means getting matched up with afks/trolls/feeders (and yes i know by now that it does not exist). I play mid, top, adc, supp. Last time I have jungled in pre-season 5, i kept getting executed because of poor leashes ( so that means I don't jungle unless i am with a good team).  I like to play fizz, and my kda (average) with him is 22/6.5/9.5 (check on lolking.net - The Fire On Fire: http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/59982106) Last time I played supp my KDA was 1/5/17, My kda with tanks is 4.5/6/3.5. I'm not sure about adcs. Thank you for reading, I'm out.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nI search worthy prey. - Kha'Zix","replies":[{"poster":"Raja Chachki","date":"2015-01-11T17:04:08.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I JUST turned lvl 30, and I feel like either Ranked is way overexxagerated, or Promos are just the best part.
