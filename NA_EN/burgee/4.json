He kept saying she made  \"Bronze plays\" because she \"hid under tower all game and had no balls to fight him\".   He was 0/4 or so at that point. \n\nI got sick of his talking so at some point I roamed down from top as Cho - a lane that I was stalemated in - and Q W R'd him to pretty much 100-->0 him.  \n\nI then proceeded to \"Thank\" him in all chat and told him Rumble (my top lane opponent) was too hard to kill and that I appreciated his help.  \n\nThis set him off completely, the shit talk flowed and he pretty much stopped playing and talked about how \"He was going to just go lift instead of playing this nerd game with us nerds\".  \n\nWe won swimmingly, but I felt kinda bad.","replies":[]}
