I played Doom and Warcraft on the internet when online gaming was an unknown thing.  I remember The Zone \"zone.com\" (AKA MSN Gaming Zone) - for those of you who don't know it, it was one of the first online gaming matchmaking services, kind of like a Steam that didn't sell games.  \n\nIn those days a troll was rare.  Maybe you'd have a teamkiller on your team, but he'd be quickly voted out and blacklisted in the community.  That was as bad as it got.  Nobody trash talked, nobody wished cancer or death on eachother.   99.9% of players were playing to have fun, to win, and to make friends.  \n\nNow, these days you're lucky to play 2 games of league in a row without encountering someone who is only there to ruin people's fun.  \n\nWhen I was a kid, online gaming was the most wonderful thing ever invented.  It literally seemed like magic that I didn't have to go to a store and buy a hard copy of a GAME DEMO if I wanted to play it.  Yeah that's right - you used to buy Demos at Wal-Mart for $5.00 or $10.00.  Sure, you could maybe find them online, but it would take you two days to download the 25mb file all the while you'd be tying up your house phoneline.  \n\nPeople need to take a step back and appreciate online gaming, and stop being such assholes to the community.  Play for fun, to win, and to make friends.  It's just a game.","replies":[]}
