Why is this?\n\nBecause he is on the \"low end\" of the tier one junglers. He is a jack-of-all-trades but a master of none. He fits into every single team comp.\n\nThe bans in ranked are focused more on the power 3 junglers right now along with a few top/mid laners. I dont believe he is \"OP\" but he can do everything. If his numbers were tweaked where he had a clear weakness and strength then he would be fine IMHO. Make his mobility his strength (keep it the same it is now), and maybe drop the sustain/slow that is built into his kit. That way he can not sustain through the jungle better than most, and needs to pick his ganks a bit better instead of just diving in and being like \"lol oops\" and jump right back out after slowing the enemy so they cant turn the fight around.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Zilean","date":"2015-02-25T04:42:54.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xLegendary Troll,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ayf6hiBd,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-25T04:36:59.567+0000)\n>\n> Yet nobody bans him in ranked. Why is this?\n\nBecause in bronze / silver giving the enemy team Lee sin is usually a free win for your team. They mostly suck and only play him because \"lolOP\" when they have 0 clue what they are doing. Lee sin takes A SMALL amount of skill to use well, Not saying he's super hard or anything, but he takes a bit more effort then some other jungler picks to make work.","replies":[{"poster":"Chijoku","date":"2015-02-25T06:04:32.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to say as a Gold player that this is also true for low-gold range.
