Why? The lore and the balance teams have been doing some amazing work.\n\nThe lore team has been a little slow, that is true, but amazing stories take a lot of time to concept and then create. They could rush it and put out some stuff above the average OR they can take their time and produce amazing stories. They are clearly taking their time and props to them for that. Bilgewater, this Shadow Isles followup. They are AMAZING. Maybe it is just me drooling over them as an aspiring writer, but yeah.\n\nThe balance team? The game is the most balanced than it has ever been imo. Just because the community finds something new to bitch about every 3 months don't mean the balance team isn't working properly. Some time ago it was Vayne, Riot confirmed that she is getting changes with the Marksman update. Now it is Jinx. She'll probably get some change. Then it will be Kog and Tristana. Then Corki. Then Caitlyn again and so on. If anything I'm hoping that the balance team does not in any way take feedback from players, at least the ones here at boards, because players' opinions are so conflicting and biased, if they got their way, they'll drive the game to the ground.\n\nBut anyways, my little rant put aside, yeah. The art team has to be my favorite. The sound team is fantastic as well but the art team is just top notch.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-10-28T05:21:17.836+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"They are rather awesome, no doubt.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-10-28T05:26:10.016+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes, the lore team has been taking their time.

It's amazing. They're putting out some great stories as we discuss.\n\nIt's the decisions they make and the reasoning for these decisions they give. They retconned the main focus of the old lore and gave at least one objectively false argument for it in the [dev blog](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/dev-blog-exploring-runeterra). They bluntly removed one of my favorite champions from the game with [curious reasoning](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3307295&page=65#post36508044) and now they_ finally_ see it as a mistake. \n\nThey don't seem to care about the old lore at all. Seems to me they're making a new world from a blank slate, taking only the things they like from the old lore. \n\nI cannot trust them with my investment. It'll just come back to bite me _again._ It's not exactly fun when you're expecting more stories about one of your favorite champions, but he gets reduced to a mere skin instead. \nI just shouldn't care about these new characters and this new world Riot is creating, and I hate that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2015-10-28T11:31:08.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lore isn't doing a good job until every champ whose lore they burned down has new lore.

Not as much of that this time around but then there is less dialogue. Hopefully the rest of the event continues to be better.

They are awesome, and part of the reason I started playing League. \nAs for the art department, they took a bad turn, trying to fix what wasn't broken. In simple terms, they turned what may have been the best splash art/model of the game into possibly the worst one: Fiora, of course. \nIt seems they were trying to avoid sexism –which is laudable–, but ironically fell into a worse form of it (\"If we can't make her beautiful, we'll make her I-want-to-speak-to-your-supervisor-ugly\"). [This is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OkjjBWrG50) in YouTube of the original Fiora's splash art, a sped-up photoshop painting by the creator. The artist is _a woman_, and a truly amazing painter.\nRiot has sometimes reverted things –and rightly bragged a little about it– when they don't work. Fiora, and the direction their art department in general is taking vis-a-vis some female characters, would be very good candidates for taking a step back.\nOn the other hand, the art in champions like Bard and Kindred is incredibly beautiful, deep and polished.
