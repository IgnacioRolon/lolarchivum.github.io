Why am I not super upset riot now? The new rotating queue. I'm one to tend to disagree with a lot of what Riot has done, but they did this well. The rotating queue will bring back urf twice a year. Before you tell me \"Yeah, 2 days twice, so only 4\", They said they would increase the time up to a weak for gamemodes players enjoy. Additionally, we will get other game modes from it, like maybe ascension. You aren't entitled to urf, get over it. And for those saying riot did this for the $$$, creating and programming rotating queue is much more expensive than adding a single gamemode that literally just changes some numbers.\r\n\r\nI you go to a restaurant every Christmas and eat amazing food for free, but one year they didn't have anything that great, and you getting pissed because your free stuff isn't good is pretty dumb.\r\n\r\nEnd rant","replies":[{"poster":"Applesaucey","date":"2016-04-03T08:13:28.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Know what else made it to pbe and got a bunch of posts saying it was coming?

Remind where is that?\n\nPretty sure they already said that there is almost zero reason for them to waste time and money on a replay system now due to the number of high quality replay programs you can download. \n\n Remember they are a business.  They shouldn't be wasting resources on something that is already available to the players and is probably better quality than something they could release.  They should focus on stuff aspects of the game only they can affect like as mentioned in this post, rotating que or more game modes to add to the new que.  \n\nThis is the same reason why you can't go to riots website and look in-depth at all of your stats like you can on na.op.gg.  Its already available on na.op.gg","replies":[{"poster":"Sakaru","date":"2016-04-03T09:01:11.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I don't even care about an internal replay system.. But calling LoLReplay/LSI/etc quality is kind of a joke. They're as likely to crash your game and get you afk'd as they are to work properly from patch to patch.\n\nLoLReplay has even, on more than one occasion; caused me, my girlfriend and 2 of my closest friends to uninstall LoL replay, uninstall and redownload LoL and reinstall it, because the repair button wasn't enough. LSI has crashed my game more times than I choose to count (Thankfully about 19/20 of these are in customs because I do tests before playing real games).\n\nRiot just didn't want to put the work into making one that would function right from patch to patch, so they scrapped it. I'm not against them doing that, I understand how difficult that actually is to maintain compared to a lot of other things, it really isn't worth it. But aye not the best argument to give.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Applesaucey","date":"2016-04-03T07:32:44.191+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except the problem is they originally said they were gonna start doing a rotating queue of new game modes years ago and that it was coming \"soon\". If I remember correctly this was sometime around the release of urf the first time it came out. Guess what its still not here, and they are pitching it as if it were a new idea and not something they said they were gonna do and then never go around too. And we still don't have any solid information on when it'll be coming out.\n\nNot to mention the fact that they just killed Dominion because \"it took to many resources to support the map\" What makes you believe for a second they will dedicate the resources to maintain the rotating game mode queue if it ever actually gets released.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if once again we never actually get the rotating game mode queue, and that it was just another fake announcement made to placate the playerbase till they forget about it. Just like they just did with saying they will give us solo queue back, which months later we still don't have.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-03T08:27:35.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Not to mention the fact that they just killed Dominion because \"it took to many resources to support the map\" What makes you believe for a second they will dedicate the resources to maintain the rotating game mode queue if it ever actually gets released.\n> \n\nBecause they have a finite amount of resources.  They stopped dominion because barley anyone played it anymore and they could use those same servers and staff to run a rotating game mode que, you know, something that the playerbase actually wants to play and have fun with. \n\n And before anyone says anything about riot having lots of money so just hire more people no.  You can't just throw more people and money at a problem in business, more often than not **less **gets done than with the original team.\n\nSolo que is just a whole different problem for different reasons.  Its not because of server space or resources but rather how the ques are set up now.  Jeremy gaming curious gave an interesting perspective on why solo que shouldn't be released and I agree with him.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pzwnD_HV7g\n\nJust my 2 cents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-04-03T08:04:08.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The mode is currently on the PBE, they made a post saying it was actually coming a month ago, with an update post going out 6 days ago.\n\nSo yeah, it's totally not coming.\n\nThe difference between when they said it then and now is because then they said it would be a nice thing to have and they would see if they can do it, and now they are actually releasing it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lolz977","date":"2016-04-03T06:44:35.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not really mad about that I'm mad that they are not making an official. \"Hey guys calm down its not coming.\" and maybe an estimation to when we will see urf.","replies":[{"poster":"Xx420n0sc0p3sxX","date":"2016-04-03T06:48:07.811+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"They said it wasn't coming and confirmed it.
