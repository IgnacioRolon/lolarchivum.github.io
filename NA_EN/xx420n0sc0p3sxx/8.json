No balance changes or anything:\n\n**Super Simple Things**\n\n* Extra refunds per season\n* Champion mastery page for rank 5 champs (we can only see 3 rank 5's)\n* Access to whole champ pool in ARAM\n* Being able to change the order of runes/mastery pages\n* A tab to look at your skins\n* A way to report players in champ select\n* Ability to earn chromas and/or summoner icons of a champion you master\n* ANYTHING to do with excess ip other then name changes (Chromas, maybe special, super expensive ip skins, etc...)\n* Quick way to test ping without needing to create a custom game or using CMD (Like Dota)\n\n**Less Simple things**\n\n* Map skins/anouncer packs (Like the bilgewater event. This may not be super easy, but I think it's worth mentioning)\n* Ranked Team Builder\n* Sandbox mode\n* Rework/removal of promo series\n\nFeel free to give me suggestions, the bigger the list the better! Remember, nothing too big, for instance, a system to help with afks isn't \"simple\".\n\nEdit: I have decided to make a list for more complex things, since I got a lot of request for things like Ranked teambuilder.","replies":[{"poster":"Ñapoleoni","date":"2015-10-13T04:17:48.542+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":2,"body":"* 3 Refunds a season is way to much. I'd be fine with just one and that's it.

Unless your talking about people who have more than 13 (I think) ranked 5 champions.\n* Sounds cool \n* Why isn't this already in the game.\n* ^^^^^\n","replies":[{"poster":"Zenthon Prime","date":"2015-10-13T05:33:14.015+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, the whole \"THREE REFUNDS PER SEASON\" thing needs to die.  _One_ refund per season is far more realistic.","replies":[{"poster":"Ñapoleoni","date":"2015-10-13T05:51:52.542+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Even one per season is pretty over kill. Riot made around 630 million dollars last year in micro-transactions. 67 million people play the game on a monthly bases. I am willing to bet 99.9% of those 67 million people screwed up on there first three refunds. Lets say \"O fuck I accidentally bought Project Leona but I don't like it, but I used all my refunds and now I want Project Lucian. I'd probably just simply buy Project Lucian.\" However, if I were to get one extra refund, that sets Riot back from earning 6 dollars and 9 cents (1 rp is about .625cents). Multiply that by 67 million which would mean Riot could earn an additional 408 million dollars without giving out one refund per season. Take that number and multiply it by 3 = 1 billion 224 million dollars Riot could potentially earn every year. Riot technically doesn't really loose any money from giving players refunds, but they loose the chance of players giving more money too them. \n\nOf course, this is only if everyone buys at least one 975 rp champion/skin they dislike, and wants another. IP purchases are not taken into account (in that case riot would be technically screwing themselves over).\n\nI'm using the RP numbers from 2 years ago so they're probably off as well.","replies":[{"poster":"IsmokeOregano","date":"2015-10-13T17:05:53.194+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Imo the best way to do refunds is one per season that roll over if unused, kind of like old cell phone minutes with roll over plans","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrryZ","date":"2015-10-13T15:54:10.089+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's also worth considering the other side of the argument; that some people would be MORE likely to buy RP as a result that they feel they have the freedom with it.
