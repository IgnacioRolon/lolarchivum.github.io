So while I can be really impressed by a sweet piece of fan art (such as the one above by Langler), I don't have any useful information to add to the lore threads about him over in Story & Art.  \n\nI can theorize the same as any other player - but that's about it.  Not to mention, Ekko's only on the PBE so far - not even released for realzies yet.  I've not had a chance to play him (late stage, company-wide playtests generally look for good players - and I ain't one!) but I am looking forward to it.  There may still be things that change about him between now and then!\n\nSorry - I know that's not what you wanted to hear.  I'm like the plain step-sister who turned up to the party instead of the pretty sister - people keep asking me where the other one is!  I just wanna dance, same as everyone else, so to speak.","replies":[{"poster":"ULTRAF0RCE","date":"2015-05-17T00:01:19.397+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are too harsh on yourself bio","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-05-17T01:14:56.178+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ULTRAF0RCE,realm=NA,application-id=2XjzURgc,discussion-id=ZPpykmLy,comment-id=0000000200000000,timestamp=2015-05-17T00:01:19.397+0000)\n>\n> You are too harsh on yourself bio\n\nThanks, ULTRAFoRCE.

The artists wants to dig into details as soon as possible. You must resist the temptation to start working on fine details before the composition is complete. The task of the architect is to convey the intent of the piece with as little detail as possible. An entire picture is just a bunch of gesture drawings that work well together in a space. The faster you are to jump into details, the less likely you are to scrap the picture when you see that your composition is unrefined. His words. He was pretty cool.
