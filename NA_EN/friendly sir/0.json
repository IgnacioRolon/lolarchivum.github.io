The classic skin sounds sound louder and this only affects Miss Fortune&#039;s auttoattack sounds. It just removes the satisfaction of having an arcade skin y&#039;know. Thanks in advance","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-20T20:29:37.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This isn't working as intended - we're in the process of figuring out where these sounds went.

This maybe a stretch, but can you enlighten us on perhaps an ETA on the fix? I know these things take time but I would appreciate it if you could clue us in.

It doesn't appear they have an ETA at the moment, as the issue is a bit more complicated than adding the sound back.
