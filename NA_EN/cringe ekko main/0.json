You wouldn't expect it.  I was under the impression that the shop was for 'champions you play', so getting skins for ones you don't own is a little out of the ordinary.","replies":[{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2017-05-22T14:18:01.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fortunately for me, i own all champions so i never had this issue xD but yeah its a new thing. I think they suggest skins based on skin line as well......

I'm sorry this wasn't made super clear; it's a piece of feedback we've received, and something we'll keep in mind for next time. If you purchase the champion separately for IP, the price in the shop will drop to only the price of the skin!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2017-05-22T13:46:55.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah this has happened to a lot of people.
