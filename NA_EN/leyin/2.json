I believe it was implied somewhere once that Anivia was still alive before Gnar was frozen in ice.\nBraum, if I recall, has lived longer than most mortals. His legends stretch back pretty far, so he has the potential to be a sibling, even if they don't really share the animal-ish characteristic part.\nWhen I say Ivern, I less mean Ivern himself, and more the World Tree. Not sure how demigods work, so perhaps the tree was a sibling to Ornn. The more I think about it, the weirder and less likely it sounds though.\nMalphite has yet to have any of his lore explained and since Ornn and him share a theme of \"Earth-oriented mega beings\", I wouldn't write it off for them being related in some way.\nRammus is a legendary creature within Shurima that shares the animal similarity with Ornn (Ornn is clearly a ram-like creature by the way). Not to mention that, while Rammus is much more so of this, Ornn doesn't seem to speak in too complex of sentences.\nSoraka is the most likely in my mind. Soraka is a goat-like creature that descended from her immortal nature to help humans (at least in the old lore she did). Rams and goats are in a similar general family of animals, plus Soraka is one of the few other demigod-like characters in League, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if Soraka is a sibling.\nFinally, we have Tahm Kench. If we are going for the whole \"each demigod/god represents an emotion, element, etc. of the world\" then Tahm Kench fits in perfectly as the demigod/god of gluttony. This seems like a natural fit as a distant relative or sibling to Ornn, although I wouldn't be surprised if Tahm wasn't related at all.\n\nSo, if I were to guess, I would say Soraka is his sibling if a sibling is currently present in the game. \n\nAlso, Ornn's title as a \"demigod\" does make me wonder... are there mortals and gods that live close enough together for a demigod to appear? I mean, I'm not sure how this would happen since I think I read somewhere Ornn was around when Avarosa and her sisters became Iceborn, meaning the only potential gods in the Freljord at least that could have birthed Ornn were Watchers, which seems off to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nixtarma","date":"2017-08-07T15:29:47.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about I go out on a limb, and say Udy'r/ Volibear's spirits.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-08-06T20:11:24.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't even know what he is lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gear5Luffy","date":"2017-08-06T19:54:07.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Avarosa and Ivern","replies":[]},{"poster":"IllÃ¢oi EvÃª SiÃ´n","date":"2017-08-06T19:14:55.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't Jinx have a sister?","replies":[]},{"poster":"IllÃ¢oi EvÃª SiÃ´n","date":"2017-08-06T19:14:01.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Varus Aatrox Rhaast","replies":[]},{"poster":"IllÃ¢oi EvÃª SiÃ´n","date":"2017-08-06T19:13:17.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Willump?","replies":[]},{"poster":"IllÃ¢oi EvÃª SiÃ´n","date":"2017-08-06T19:12:49.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brand Anivia Braum","replies":[]},{"poster":"Craxsian","date":"2017-08-06T19:10:04.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tryndame...
