The other players get the message that I have not accepted the game. Today, I even lost LP and had a time penalty because apparently I dodged a game; in fact it never showed up on my client and it was still showing that I was searching for a game.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help with this?\r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-15T16:37:50.965+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The queue notification operates on the PvP.net platform. If your connection to that platform isn't great, it could prevent you from getting notifications from it or prevent you from matchmaking entirely. Since this operates on a network connection, the most common cause for a poor connection to it are incompatible network settings. I strongly recommend working through the steps in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"KaKu I SUMMONYOU","date":"2016-09-17T04:55:50.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KaKu I SUMMONYOU,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=UJaswAZa,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-09-16T00:49:08.694+0000)\n>\n> I have been through these steps before, when I posted for a (related?) problem I still get where I don&#x27;t see the post-game screen on the PVP.net platform.
