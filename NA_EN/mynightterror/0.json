Is anyone else having ping spike or lag problems that are unusual for you? ping is usually 70-80 will be normal then jump to 200-700+ ping for a few seconds to a few mins. \r\n\r\nIs anyone else having the same problem in game? I have met a few other people online having similar problems as me. My guess would be maybe Riot working on their servers to help ping spike or whatever they said they where going to do or riot gifting out the mystery skins may be lagging it? \r\n\r\nOr if it is on my end any solutions or what it may be / what to check?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Preacher Saiba","date":"2015-01-10T17:44:36.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i am having the same problems i just decided to stop playing until they fix it,and considering this game is so addicting it's been the only game iv'e played for the last couple months........i'm pretty upset.","replies":[{"poster":"MyNightTerror","date":"2015-01-10T18:08:56.901+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cliff Badger,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=l0mbKVLi,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-10T17:44:36.645+0000)\n>\n> i am having the same problems i just decided to stop playing until they fix it,and considering this game is so addicting it's been the only game iv'e played for the last couple months........i'm pretty upset.\n\nYour brave lol I cant stop playing it, I just got back from a break and now it is having the ping spikes.","replies":[{"poster":"Preacher Saiba","date":"2015-01-11T00:11:21.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"remember how i said i wasn't gonna play........i had too i'm hooked, just played........i'm so ASHAMED{{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2015-01-10T21:39:11.169+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Caveat : I don't have any expertise in this area, just speaking as a player who has had similar problems.\n\nThere are some lightweight ping tools you can find online.  You can run them in the background, pinging a neutral location (like Google), to see if your ping spikes to League coincide with spikes to other places on the internet.  \n\nI did this upon the advice of one of my colleagues and found out the issue was on my end/my ISP's.  Got a new cable modem and it has helped significantly.  Doesn't mean you will have the same luck, but it's likely worth looking into.","replies":[{"poster":"What Is Smite","date":"2015-01-10T23:26:47.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sotere, whenever the Technical Team does reply to these kinds of problems the usual response we get is that it is our ISP, but I don't think it's always fair to blame the ISP's of people since they are multi-billion dollar industries who know their networks than most times Dyrus tries to cook/use a microwave. Have you guys ever checked with the ISP for your server to see if there was a problem returning packets to a players computer? I have friends who have talked to their ISP and have done what you guys have instructed down to the technical changes in their modems and sometimes they still get lag so from their issues, my understanding is that maybe somewhere on the return trip from your server the packets are being holed up causing the lag. My college professor did always compare packet transfer between a computer and server to a highway since packets can travel either way to reach their destination, but also that sometimes blockages do occur at intervals among the connection between the server and computer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PrinceArchie","date":"2015-01-12T23:57:53.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These ping spikes in the severity they are in are rather new, getting between 280-3k ping spikes.
