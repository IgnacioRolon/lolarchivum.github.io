Actions that involve the kitty friend (including his recall animation) also have it absent. Kittens spawned by his Sapling Toss are still visible; only the decorative kitty friend is missing.\n\nThis issue happens every game Meowkai is in and occurs with the White chroma variant as well.\n\n[Maokai has taken it in his own hands,](https://imgur.com/EKsx1ok) but he needs all the help he can get.\n\nUPDATE (DAY 3): Maokai has searched his entire homeland, to no avail. He has asked Yorick to aid him in leaving the Shadow Isles tomorrow (whilst politely but firmly refusing Yorick’s offer to play some board games).\n\nUPDATE (Day 4) [Ohmu has reported](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8agad2/comment/dwza48d?st=JFPSJD3P&sh=5cd8e7fe) that Gary has been with Alistar this whole time! They should be reunited at the next patch!\n\n\\#Garyscominghome","replies":[{"poster":"A Nunu","date":"2018-04-05T22:54:40.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tree with a kitty > Tree without a kitty\nThis game needs its kitties back.\n\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/pdulaoa6df4.png","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2018-04-05T22:57:29.874+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your signature is kind of disturbing.","replies":[{"poster":"A Nunu","date":"2018-04-05T23:32:38.279+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arakadia,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=7tA2cRu1,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-04-05T22:57:29.874+0000)\n>\n> Your signature is kind of disturbing.\n\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/alodupa70d2.png\n\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/uoalpda70d3.png\n\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/dploaua70d4.png\n\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/uldpaoa70d5.png\n\nHey, man.
