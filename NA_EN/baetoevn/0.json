Do you think the Poster-Child of Noxus, who left them because she almost died because of Noxus bombing her, would turn around, put on a Bunny Girl outfit, and swing a giant carrot-shaped blade?\n\nLet me tell you a little something about Bunny Girls: Their outfits don't offer much in the way of mobility. In fact, you need training. [Taken from an article interview of a former Bunny Girl:](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/8470245/My-life-as-a-Playboy-Bunny-girl.html) \n> Most of us hadn’t worked as waitresses before – and Playboy seemed to prefer it that way. Bunny Training, presided over by the suave Keith Hefner, was a sort of Bunny boot camp in which we learned signature moves, such as the Bunny Stance, Bunny Dip, High Carry, Bunny Crouch and Bunny Perch. **The Dip was a graceful backward arch with knees together, employed while serving drinks to keep the girl’s over-stuffed, over-extended breasts from popping out of the costume.** The “High Carry” was designed to manoeuvre a tray full of drinks high over the head through a crowded room.\n\nDo you think an outfit that requires training to not pop out your breasts would be worn by someone fighting [with a Sword bigger than she is?](http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Riven_0.jpg) on a battlefield with monsters like Cho'gath running around? Why would she wear something that requires training just to not expose herself, _much less something that doesn't offer any actual protection?_ \n\nAnd then we'll get into her actual personality: She could only be argued to have worn this once in canon, and that was to approach someone in a disguise to kill them with their guard down. The splash art reflects it perfectly, with Riven in a position for a leaping vertical slash down (which would cause quite a lot of damage to anyone. Forget if they are wearing armor, that Sword'd at least break any helmet with that kind of slash if not cut clean through what's under it.) and though she's looking at the screen,  I would point you to the man next to her. [Now who does that look like, I wonder?](http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Swain_3.jpg) Notice how he's positioned: I'd say he was backing away frantically, wouldn't you? He even knocked aside a table (though I question why he was sitting in a spot like that, that he'd back into a table?)\n\nOther than that, she has served in at least the Noxian-Ionian War, and every skin she has aside from her Battle Bunny has some kind of armor incorporated into it (Crimson Talon is like a headdress and Classic is very weird but let's not get into that.) Now, why would she suddenly stop wearing armor? It's a disguise, and that's it (though considering her status as a Champion I'm amazed it even worked the first time.) It's not meant to be something you'd wear into a battle like the Fields of Justice. It's Fan Service, on a Champion that has no reason for it. I admit, I hate Riven, I hate her Lore, I hate her Kit, I hate everything about her, but even as there's no one I want to see removed from the game more, I still absolutely hate that skin more than anything in this entire game because it's Pure Fan Service and a Disservice to the character.","replies":[{"poster":"Legacy of Xion","date":"2015-07-12T15:27:33.109+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not all skins have to be super true to the character...\n\nI mean, half of Lux's skins were military...","replies":[{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-07-13T01:46:21.829+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am honestly not sure if you are joking on that, Lux is very military.
