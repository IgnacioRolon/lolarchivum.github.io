CLG used to be by far my favorite team until half way through season 3, when they replaced their mid and top, and doublelift just completely unraveled.  I never saw a problem with nien, but CLG seems to have felt the need to go to some random cyber cafe in Korea and ask if anyone wanted to play professionally in NA, and Seraph was the only person who raised his hand.   He never won lane phase, which seemed to be either because he just isn't good, or he underestimated the power of NA top laners, and would just fall so far behind trying to duel, that he either couldn't be an impact in team fights due to his build, or because he just wasn't that good of a player.    Then they decided to replace their mid by picking up sloppy seconds from C9's substitute,  who wasn't as bad as Seraph, but he never had an impact on other lanes during early game or when it came to team fighting.    What first drew me into CLG, is that as a bottom lane main,  they -had- my favorite ADC, and still has my favorite support.   And it used to be, no matter what point of the game and how far behind they were,  it came to a matter of if/when they could turn it around and win.  But now, no matter how far ahead CLG is, it comes down to a matter of when, not if, they (mostly doublelift) are going to throw so hard that the other team wins.  Doublelift thinks that he's the only person on CLG worth a damn, and that he has to solo carry his team.  Which in his mind, means separating from his team and farming every minion on the map, no matter how extended he gets without wards, which means he inevitably gets caught trying to get himself gold, and causes the other team to take a dragon/baron/tower/inhib  to give the entire enemy team gold.  And in the end,  DL thinks he needs to stand on the front line while sieging the enemy turrets, thinking he can outplay whatever the enemy throws at him, and poke down or kill an enemy, but instead, every time, the enemy locks him up, and then goes straight down to take all objectives.   So at this point, I will never be fan of CLG again until doublelift gets kicked off, or completely changes his mindset, and realizes that LoL is indeed a team game.\r\n\r\nMy favorite team last season was Dignitas, because I really like and enjoy watching Darshan, shiphtur, and qtpie.  But now 2 of those 3 people left, and I don't really know much about their new roster.\r\n\r\nI will never jump on the TSM bandwagon as long as Bjergsen is on it.  I absolutely hate him and his personality.  He is the cockiest person in all of league of legends, and comes across as such an asshole and douche bag.  \r\n\r\nI've never thought much of Cruse, but they may be  my front runner for favorite team this year.  I love quas, dominate, Xpecial, and the new and exciting addition of the Worlds All Star Piglet.   I am definitely excited to see how their roster plays out, like I was excited for Dignitas's new roster last season, except hopefully they don't disappoint in the end. \r\n\r\nAnother possibility of my favorite team would be Cloud 9, but they just don't have anyone on the team that I especially like, but I don't dislike any of them.   With all the other teams, there are 2 outstanding All Stars on the team who are fun to watch, but then the rest of the team is either just pretty good or good, so they rely so much on those all stars getting a lead, and then pressing it on other lanes.   But with Cloud 9, there isn't a single person who outshines the rest,  they are all good, no more and no less.  But what I do like about them, is their comradery, communication, team work, and strategic decision making.  They have the longest lasting consistent roster, and it really shows with how well they work together and believe in each other.   They are the epitome of how league of legends is a team based game.  \r\n\r\nAnd the other teams aren't really worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nAny input on my thoughts would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"ZeroAnarchy","date":"2014-12-08T00:57:55.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"C9","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joesus Christ","date":"2014-12-07T20:04:10.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive always like Curse, since like early Season 2. I honestly hated C9 for the entirety of S3 because they were a bunch of cocky shits, who finally humbled up after they were immediately kicked from S3 worlds, and Hai went through medical treatment. so Curse is definitely my #1 for S5, with C9 probably right behind them. at least for NA.\n\n UOL put on a damn good performance during the EU challenger series, and so far at IEM so im excited for them :D ive always liked Fnatic but i hate how streaky they are and with Reckless gone, itll be a difficult season for them i think.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rhlax","date":"2014-12-07T18:30:05.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UoL.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tehemai","date":"2014-12-07T02:23:37.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sneakeos duo are pretty awesome.
