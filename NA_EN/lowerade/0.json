It kept on saying \"attempting to reconnect\" at the end of the game when we had 2 inibs down, and cuz of that we lost. Happened before 2-3 crucial fight, so I thought I was getting ddos, but since it happen to you also, it must be the rito server.\n\nAnd no it wasnt my internet, I alt-tab during the \"attempting to reconnect\" and my internet was perfectly fine and working.","replies":[{"poster":"Jet Juanita","date":"2017-05-02T03:51:10.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> it wasnt my internet\n> \n\nIs not.\n\nLike 4 or 5 days ago this issue is happen to me and never happened before, only on this game.

It doesn't look like the issue is on the server-end however.  If the individual game server itself was having issue, then all 10 players in the game would be experiencing the same issue.  Given it sounds like you were uniquely experiencing this issue, the root cause seems to lie somewhere else.  In an effort to eliminate some of the most common root causes, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).\n\nLet me know if you are still experiencing these same issues!","replies":[{"poster":"Lowerade","date":"2016-05-17T11:08:47.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It doesn't happen anymore , could it be because I'm living in montreal and the servers are located in the eastern US?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-17T22:31:44.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The physical location of the servers shouldn't be a root cause to this type of issue.
