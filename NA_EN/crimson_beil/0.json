Wrong. Take a closer look at her forehead. The symbol looks strikingly similar to...\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fLuTcFk.png\n\n...the symbol for Oblivion.\n\nIf you&#039;ve never played an Elder Scrolls Game, Oblivion is more or less equivalent to Hell. And the creatures from Oblivion attempt to escape from their plane of Oblivion to ours, and mess stuff up. I feel the easiest way to prevent another Oblivion Crisis is to simply banish Kalista back to where she came.
