Reports, made by players, will never work in a game where Friends que together and there is almost always an odd man out who will get blamed for any and all mistakes. Then reported at the end By every single one of his teammates because they are friends and GROUPS will ALWAYS pick on the LONERS.  Cant play league solo unless you like this process... join game, be abused, get reported, deal with punishment. Glad I tried to play league w/o any friends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oddysseas","date":"2015-03-13T09:39:48.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wow i would love to see what you say when the punishment system gets a lill tougher, apparently you like flaming alot too judging on this post, maybe when they ban you for a week for a couple matches that you flamed at, you will be back makin boards of how the punishment system is too rough....","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Drewprint","date":"2015-03-13T08:55:37.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Feel free to {{summoner:4}} away from playing this game and Uninstall. \n\nYou'll be ***terribly*** missed. :).","replies":[]}]}
