One of the champions I noticed this on was Twitch. Sometimes, when I cast his W, I have to click twice, causing me to maybe accidentally miss or move to the wrong place. Another champion I had a similar issue with was Anivia. When I tried casting her E, it would sometimes not cast, and I would instead move toward the target. Has anybody been able to fix this problem, as it is really been hindering my gameplay experience? Thank you so much.\n\nEdit: I just checked and it is not a problem with my mouse, and it will happen no matter what mouse I am using.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-18T18:41:13.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't say for sure, but it sounds to me like you might have smart cast with indicator enabled.  What happens if you disable that, and use smart case without indicators?  You can toggle the option off via your in-game options.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"pooppoop3","date":"2016-08-20T04:01:15.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will try this out as soon as I get the chance. Thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}
