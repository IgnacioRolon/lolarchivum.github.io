I do not use quick cast, where clicking the ability casts it over what I am hovering. I would ideally like to continue using NORMAL CAST.\r\n\r\nThe issue I am having causes me to have to click multiple times to cast an ability, like Soraka W, Twitch W, Anivia E, or Dr. Mundo Q. This causes my play to be DRASTICALLY inhibited. This does not happen with self cast abilities like Teemo W or Dr. Mundo R.\r\n\r\nI have tested this problem, and it happens with any of the computer mouses that I use. \r\n\r\nIn a test ARAM game, where Twitch W was the ability that had to be clicked multiple times, it happened 6/10 times, or 60% of the time.\r\n\r\nI have uninstalled and reinstalled League of Legends.\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea about what causes this problem or how I can fix it? Thank you so much.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-25T20:19:43.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that some background applications can sometimes influence your ability to click or interact with League in some ways.
