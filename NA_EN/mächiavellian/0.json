Why would you ever by RP from somewhere else other than the Riot shop? Someone correct me if im wrong but afaik you cant buy RP anywhere else. With the 0 information you gave it is most reasonable to assume you bought into a scam. Maybe you can try the Amazon support otherwise it's a good lesson learned.","replies":[{"poster":"Summer Arosa","date":"2018-01-29T15:10:36.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually buying RP from Amazon is legit, so long as it is supplied by Amazon Digital Services. I've never had a problem doing so. You can also buy Riot Points from Gamestop (Physical card not digital.) \n\nI would get in contact with Riot Support by submitting a ticket and asking them to take a look. Otherwise, if you think you were scammed by some third party seller in Amazon, contact Amazon's support.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mächiavellian","date":"2018-01-29T16:40:22.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely bought through riot on amazon, I've done this 15+ times and already worked, I submitted a ticket, just not sure exactly what information to provide but I'm sure they'll let me know.","replies":[]}]}
