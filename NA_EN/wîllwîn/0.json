For instance, if you got the 10 game chat restrict, you do your 10 games, go unpunished for 3 months, then it's clear and it resets, so if you get punished again, rather than getting the 25 game, you'll get another 10 game.  This is my personal experience ( I mean what?)  and how I've understood everything.\n\nAs for the deadline, it's normally announced around the end of worlds, and since season usually goes a bit longer after worlds ends, plus the missions being until Dec 5, I'm assuming Mid/Late December, don't quote me on that.","replies":[]}]}
