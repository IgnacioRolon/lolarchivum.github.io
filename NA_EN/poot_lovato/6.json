Why do you let completely busted concepts run rampant through your game, completely unopposed? Why do you insist that the banning phase do your job of balance for you? Why is it like pulling actual fucking teeth to get this game to a healthy, fun-to-play state where you don&#039;t have to roll your fucking eyes every time someone enters the game with a currently overtuned champion. Why are the overtuned champions **consistently** the edgy, flashy, cool, hip, fan favorites? Why are there so many feast or famine concepts? Why are there so many champions who succeed without taking real risks? Why have you purposefully ruined your game and built it around making money instead of being the &quot;for the people&quot; corporation you pretended to be when you started?","replies":[]}
