Backdooring is not \"sneaky\", if you expect it. Keep someone at the base to defend. If you're the better teamfight comp, of course they're not going to teamfight because there's no chance in hell of winning unless it becomes a fiesta. If your team plays a teamfight using their brains at all, you'll win. It's literally the only strategy to win against the better teamfight comp is to NOT teamfight and take them on one at a time, but if they don't split up, you have to make them split up. Riot can't possibly keep every champion at such a state that they have a 50/50 chance of winning a teamfight against everyone else, there are too many team comps to plan that against. They have over 150 champions at this point, with 5v5 the team comp possibilities to balance that against are endless, so if a comp has a better teamfight, you can't fight them, whatsoever in a team environment. If you want teamfights with no option of the team ignoring teamfights, play ARAM. It's teamfights all the time and the only way backdooring is possible is with stealth champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2020-02-09T22:41:28.809+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are so wrong.\n\nThe team that allows the backdoor means they only want to teamfight.

All of those are valid critiques and I've had grievances with people only picking whatever is currently overtuned for years. But since Riot won't do anything to prevent/fix it (because the playerbase would... dare I say _RIOT_... if there wasn't something really strong and barely counterable hovering just at the top of the meta) you accept it as \"just the way things are\" and \"just part of the game\". But it doesn't have to be; it never had to be.
