I have 4 other people in my household who also play League and their connection is fine, at first I thought it could have been my gpu not wanting to process, but I found that i'm getting about 150-200 frames, so please if you have any suggestions on how to solve this, i'm all ears. Thanks!!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-20T23:16:13.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sucks, and it sounds like these issues could be caused by packet loss.
