Keep in mind that in the past (and I assume now as well) it is always permanently gone for the season once you ask it removed - they can't add it back if you later decide you want it, and you won't get a border for this season until the normal time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-06T21:39:04.597+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Having no border would just be \"gg bronze trash\" <afks>\n\nTrash is going to cry no matter what you do, just dont play ranked if you wont want to deal with trash.","replies":[{"poster":"Fawksea","date":"2018-04-07T11:04:16.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=N0NgbXq1,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-04-06T21:39:04.597+0000)\n>\n> Having no border would just be &quot;gg bronze trash&quot; &lt;afks&gt;\n> \n> Trash is going to cry no matter what you do, just dont play ranked if you wont want to deal with trash.\n\nno cus people will asume it's a smurf acount with no border. you see plenty of no borders in challenger accounts","replies":[{"poster":"BillionSun","date":"2018-04-08T12:21:47.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy fucks","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2018-04-06T21:41:32.916+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"if your dealing with these people and get your border removed then its just gonna be bronze or unranked instead of silver","replies":[{"poster":"flibitydoo","date":"2018-04-07T04:52:17.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or they'd just passively assume you're a fresh smurf account","replies":[{"poster":"Bob the Toastr","date":"2018-04-07T06:13:56.581+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or they'll just look him up and find out he was silver last season anyway.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Articus43","date":"2018-04-07T18:28:41.516+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's kind of a weird situation the game is in atm.

As far as I'm concerned, elo hardly means anything. The ranked system is a cluster fuck Riot refuses to fix since they created divisions and blown up damage values to which anybody with a small lead can snowball their lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-04-07T04:49:13.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it doesnt matter if you go 0-10 in placements on a fresh account.
