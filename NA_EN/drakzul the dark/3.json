I was referring the decisions a player is making in a fight. Pre-nerf Talon was a good example of what I see as a binary champion. He would cycle through his abilities and actives, get a kill or not get a kill. He either had the damage for the kill or didn't. He really only has one decision to make: Will my combo kill or not. What his opponent did had no bearing on his decision. This also refers to a lot of autoattack heavy fighters. They'll get gap close, hit their abilities in a predetermined fashion and the player with the better stats and scaling wins.","replies":[{"poster":"JevelFaithful","date":"2015-03-08T00:49:17.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OH in that light yeah I agree.  You're the first one I see use binary that way. People usually say she's bad design in the macro sense and because some design choices kind of break the rules of what a champion be like.  \n\nShe is ressourceless for seemingly no reason. Actually the reason is the same as yasuo : they need to spam *constantly*. But yasuo at least has a random passive to use his bar (which is something people complained about), it's out of place but it serves a gameplay purpose. Riven just look like they said \"we don't like mana so we'll make her manaless =)\". It's more complicated but it kind of feels that way.\n\nAdd the first point to the fact she has at least 3 dashes in her kit on a champion that is made to be a fighter more than an assassin... And she plays toplane where mobility and range are not automatic. Keep in mind that this she is a rather old champion and that level of mobility is on par with ultimate abilities or Kalista/Yasuo, which are said to have too much mobility even today.\n\nAnd she's has offense and defense all out of AD. How many other champion can build glass canon and still end up \"tanky\". I think that side of her was hit a lot so tanky is in quote but the choice of making defense out of offense is *unorthodox*. It's the reason she snowballs that much.  \n(If you wonder, most ap can live with building shield/heal out of ap because ap doesn't also boost AA.

How is that different from MF (Or tristana) having an AD ratio on Q and an AS steroid?  Or how is that different from Draven having an ad scaling on Q?  Both of those are skills that \"amplifies her AD on skill use based on -get ready for it- % of their AD\". In the case of AS buff, it's on every AA (like riven) and it's multiplicative (like riven).\n\nHer passive looks like just another part of her skills to me. Might as well add +%AD on all of her skills (the shield too). Because that'S what her passive is. The number might be too high, but I don't see how it's fundamentally broken.\n\nI always attributed her snowballing to the fact she gets survivability and damage from everything in her inventory.

And some Champs follow this design philosophy already! Galio, alistar, maokai are all fairly immobile but have strong, near-immediate CC. Same with pre-5.4 veigar. Also on the other end, we have Katarina master yi, who have tons of mobility and no CC. But then it gets muddy. You've got hypermobile Champs like kalista and yasuo who also have pretty good CC available even without their ults. You also have brands and mordekaisers, who have little or no CC and certainly none that is reliable given their lack of mobility. Those champions dont get any chance of counterplay against a leblanc because they dont have a bat to hit the ball with. That's where the shoring up needs to happen: the immobile Champs without hard cc. It might also mean leblanc loses her chain stuns, or that ahri loses her charm (though I think she's fine though, given that her mobility is tied to her non-low-CD ult). \n\nYou can still have champs that aren't perfect at this by the way. Karthus isn't a problem if he doesn't have Hard CC because of his global presence, for example.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kögâ","date":"2015-03-07T09:34:54.382+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"                     \n                         \n                CC,    Mobility,    Damage\n\nBalanced champs get to pick 2.

You call that problematic? I understand it is a tether (takes about the same time as Karma's W), but that isn't really an excuse to completely excuse it. Besides, you could merely combo it, by using E, then using your R - E combo to stun an opponent for a long period of time, similar to a full combo with Leona. You can't excuse it just because it doesn't pass through minions, and you have to wait around 1.5 seconds for a stun. There are champions that have less burst damage, no mobility and very little or no CC at all.","replies":[{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2015-03-07T17:02:53.352+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"It's not a stun but a snare.

However, i can see the reason why Mord is in this predicament in finding the perfect way to buff him. \n\nFrom what i can envision, if Mord becomes buffed so he can output far more damage than what is live, then people will start having a problem. Mord would build sudo-tank and perform perfectly well. The amount of damage he will be about to soak up due to his defense and shield would be ridiculous, all while out putting a threatening amount of sustained damaged which constantly charges his shield. \n\nLeblanc has outstanding burst, as well as mobility to have some method of survival. To compensate, she is extremely squishy. If she fails to burst someone down with her full combo, she is left wide open with no escapes. I am not saying she is balanced, for it is rather unfun to play against a skilled Leblanc, but i can understand why she is given burst and utility. \n\nMord is such in a weird stage because no one knows how to balance this champion in a way that he does not become an oppressing force to face against. Buff his damage, but that allows him room to go tanky and take on a team. Give him better mobility, but Riot will for sure nerf some of his damage to compensate since in the long term, being able to chase someone down and do sustain damage is equivalent to more damage over a period of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Raid Boss Morde","date":"2015-03-08T21:59:29.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aquodox,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NcJj7UI7,comment-id=000700000000,timestamp=2015-03-08T19:49:41.389+0000)\nIf she fails to burst someone down with her full combo, she is left wide open with no escapes.\n\nThat's actually pretty funny.
