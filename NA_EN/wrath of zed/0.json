You can gift each other skins, but only skins that are currently in the store. In regards to Mystery Gifts, Championship Riven is not one of the skins you could potentially unlock. Since Dragonblade Riven is a legacy skin, there's a chance you could obtain it via Mystery Gifts.","replies":[{"poster":"Wrath of Zed","date":"2015-04-07T18:12:27.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, thanks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2015-04-08T07:22:11.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DB Riven can be bought around Lunar New Year, so probably sometime early next year again.\n\nCS Riven will be rereleased some time from now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klax002saur","date":"2015-04-07T19:52:51.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Snoneper,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=ixBR8fbZ,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-04-07T12:57:26.188+0000)\n>\n> I&#039;ve been playing League for about a year now, and I love it.

I don't think championship skins will ever be released though due to the reason for their creation (to commemorate a championship.) I'm positive Dragonblade Riven will be re-released at some point in time though so just hang in there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hoffmisc","date":"2015-04-07T13:06:11.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't 'give' skins to each other.
