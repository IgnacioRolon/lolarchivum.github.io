I started playing in July of last year, stopped for a little while. Now I really got into it and at the moment I play this game everyday. I explore different champs on my smurf account. I wanna be world ranked someday (not likely though. Not very good yet). The one thing I can't stand has little to do with the game itself. \r\n\r\nIt's the people. \r\n\r\nNot everyone. But it seems like every lobby I get into SOMEBODY is doing something to instigate or make people feel like shit. Why? Why does that have to happen. I understand that there is a mute button. But there shouldn't **_have_** to be a mute button. People should be respectful of others. If you don't want to help the new person, then don't be mean to them either. It's honestly worse than playing with 12 year olds on Call of Duty. If it wasn't for how much fun I have with this game then I might not play anymore, solely on the fact that people are so toxic for no apparent reason. \r\n\r\nYou are not going to win every game.

It was also mentioned in a reddit comment section, which I'm not going to try to find either, and it appears its the same thing on reddit as well.\n\nOne of the mods responded to a comment lyte said about this topic and the mod reaffirmed that it was also true on reddit. The people constantly complaining about the community being toxic are the people the mods have to warn often as they're generally toxic.\n\nI also have my own hypothesis for this as to why this is true. Simply put, the chances of you getting someone really toxic in your games if you say nothing at all is rather low, like 1/10 games. The people who complain about the community either create a toxic chat themselves, or they get 'triggered' by a rather insignificant comment.\n\nFor example:\n\n---\n\n*Rager Died to Jungle*\n\np1: Rager....\n\nRager: stfu I'm reporting you, you toxic piece of shit.\n\n----\n\nNow who's the truly toxic one in that scenario? p1 certainly wasn't in the right but that is never something he'd get reprimanded for, Rager on the other hand was incredibly toxic. They aren't all as simple as this, but this is generally what happens. I believe this what you call them having a chip on their shoulder, they just think there's a much bigger problem than there is. This in turn creates a toxic and negative atmosphere.\n\nAlso something else, if you're just playing the game and having your own good time, chance are you don't really notice the chat. There are games where there are just an apparent amount of toxicity in the chat that I don't see going on for like 5 minutes, and I only ever notice it now and then. Non-toxic people generally just ignore the toxicity and don't think much of it, where as toxic people are much more likely to notice it.\n\nI'm not saying this is true to everyone and in every occurrence, but as someone who's been positive, toxic, and neutral themselves to a very high extent this is what I've found. Yes I've been all of those and you'd be surprised what your mentality affects. If you're being toxic chances are you're in a bad mood and you're doing worse, which just snowballs toxicity and makes you notice your own actions less driving it onto other team mates and vice versa.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Trent","date":"2015-04-15T01:29:46.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rrett,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=EIAqgfzI,comment-id=0012,timestamp=2015-04-15T01:16:02.510+0000)\n>\n> I'm implying something, but the general trend is that anyone who complains about the community is themselves toxic.\n> \n> Lyte did some research into it awhile back and everyone who commented saying the community was shit were the only people actually being toxic.\n> \n> Surprisingly actually toxic people are a very rare occurrence.\n\ntoxic ppl r rare but people who are neutral aren't.

Trust me..it is FAR worse in ranked. Why? Because there are people who actually try to win...who get mad at the people who feed and such. Same amount of feeders as normals (actually probably more), but more people raging at them since ranked means something lol.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kagemyth","date":"2015-04-14T18:10:53.121+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey if you really feel like this toss me an add :D we would probably get along","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ztoka","date":"2015-04-14T16:21:45.493+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to the cancer known as the minority of LoL players.

There is no short-term fix no matter what you may want to try. TRY TEAMBUILDER! I have yet to find someone (intentionally) trolling my game, mostly because teams are reviewed by the owner before going into a game. You also have the option of leaving a lobby to find a new team if someone looks as if they might troll. Once you get the \"new champion adjustments\" inactive, then you really begin to play with strong players who can actually work as a good team(btw the way to make the adjustments inactive is to play a certain champion many times, and it makes the game believe you are now skilled at that champion). I used to play Blind Queue and I absolutely hated it, someone usually dodged, and I almost never got my ideal lane and champion. I always had someone doing really badly or just completely exaggerating every mistake they made, as if it was fatal to them. \n\nPlay Teambuilder, the ONLY downsides are the wait times, which are irrelevant if you pick ADC, Jungle, or Support. You find the team you want, at the skill level(hopefully) you want, and you play against a competent enemy who will (hopefully) be sportsmanlike. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2015-04-15T14:16:37.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People are A-Holes...if you were to actually be forced to interact with as many people in person as you do online...you would notice the same trend.
