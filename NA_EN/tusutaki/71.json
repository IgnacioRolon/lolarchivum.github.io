However with the constant nerfs and the introduction to Courage of the Colossus, there is no incentive to pick anything but Courage. Assuming you have hard CC of course.\n\nThe purpose of Grasp was to help tanks and fighters by giving them extra damage and additional sustainability. While it was initially good dealing and healing 3% of your max hp, the nerf of sustainability to heal only 1.5% made it unappealing when you have Courage sitting right next to it allowing you to obtain a massive extremely valuable shield.\n\nBond of Stone helps your allies by redirecting the damage they take onto you. Neat in concept but it&#039;s numbers are so low that the actual impact is has is negligible. To the point where I have never seen Bond of Stone block 1k damage in total in a 40min game. \n\nSo as it currently stands, if you have any hard CC, there is no reason to not pick Courage. Now is the problem that Courage is too strong or is it that his brothers are too weak? I personally think its the later.\n\nHere are some of my suggestions.\n-------------------------------\n**_Switch the mastery Perseverance with Grasp_**. Where Perseverance will now be tier 6 and Grasp in tier 4.\n\n**_Tier 4 Grasp_**: After being in combat for 4 seconds, your next attack against an enemy champion deals magic damage and heals you for an amount. deals 1.5% of your maximum health and heals for the same amount. \n\n**_Tier 6 Perseverance:_ **Every 5 seconds restores health equal to  2% of your missing health.\n\nYes, this is the same perseverance that was back in season 4. If Resolve is supposed to be about longevity, then it should be so. The numbers for grasp could be lower due to being lower tier but I feel bringing back S4 of Perseverance would be at the same power level as Courage and would at least present players with an actual choice.\n----------------------------------\n\n**_Bond of Stone:_ **Grants 2% reduced damage +2% for every nearby allied champion and 6% of the damage that allied champions would take from enemy champions is dealt to you instead (cannot reduce you below 5% health).\n\nThis grants the possibility to have reduce 10% of damage if all of your allies are nearby. While it may be arguable that Courage is still stronger, the potential to block 10% makes it more consistent as it would be constant vs a 4 second shield in addition of redirecting damage from your own allies. You can say it is a weaker but less selfish version of Courage. This is also assuming that the 6% from Bond is applied to all nearby allied champs and not just to the nearest one.\n--------------------------------\n\nI would like to hear what you think as I personally feel Courage just outshines his counterparts hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2016-12-17T19:14:48.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumping this because I think this is something that needs to be discussed.","replies":[]}]}
