That was back when his attack speed passive was 50% flat and his E did tremendous damage. Ever since then, he was fallen to the wayside greatly. For the most part, I feel that he gets punished for building the items he needs. Rushing Hydra? You&#039;re going to be blown up instantly. Blood Price? Almost never going to be used in fights as 90% of the time you&#039;re going to want it on Blood Thirst just so you can survive but because of that, your damage is almost irrelevant. Another reason to not use Blood Price? Life Steal doesnt apply to it&#039;s bonus damage making it less and less appealing. Honestly if it wasnt for the item Rageblade, he would tremendously be worse off. \r\n\r\nSo what changes needs to be made to bring him back up a notch? Here my two cents.\r\n\r\nMASSACRE.\r\nIn my opinion, I would rather take away his damage from his Ult and make it into more of a buff similar to Xin Zhao. The more enemies that was hit, the bigger your buff would be. But what would the buff be to compensate taking away its damage? At first I thought a generic Armor/MR buff would be good enough when I think about his theme a bit more, how about making it where enemies afflicted by his Ult gets a debuff where Aatrox&#039;s auto&#039;s has more lifesteal or deals X% of max health. Or make his auto&#039;s be like an AOE in a cone due to the size of his blade, similar how Twitch&#039;s ult works.  I would actually would like to see his ult provide utility for his team to suit his title of being the Avatar of War. \r\n\r\nBLOOD THIRST/PRICE\r\nIn the majority of the time, especially in team fights, Blood Thirst is going to be active. It&#039;s healing is extremely valuable especially when below half health that there will be cases where you literally out heal their damage. Its always funny to watch but you might as well take Price away as a whole. Why not allow lifesteal be applied to Blood Price as I highly doubt that the applied lifesteal will be a bigger heal than Thirst when below half health. That or why not have the two abilities combined when your Ult is active? That would give him the damage to be a threat while having enough sustain to live throughout the fights.\r\n\r\nThose are just my ramblings but what do you guys think? I&#039;ve been trying to think of builds and strats to make current Aatrox relevant with little to no success.  I&#039;ve seen talks of making him into more of a support champ which I thought would be interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"Kneelbeforezoth","date":"2017-01-25T11:28:00.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Playing bots makes him relevant again","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2017-01-26T12:14:23.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kneelbeforezoth,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GsWxVUpg,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-01-25T11:28:00.827+0000)\n>\n> Playing bots makes him relevant again\n\nLmao.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2017-01-25T12:41:36.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"By changing him into a support.
