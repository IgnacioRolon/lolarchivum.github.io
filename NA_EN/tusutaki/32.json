But I'll give it a shot.\n\nIf you have a champion with high base value resist or took a lot of resist runes and stuff. D-Shield reduces damage after the resist reduces. Take Kat for example. If you have 20% magic resist, then you have 15% damage reduce, and then you get the 8 damage reduce after all of that. It reduces a lot more damage then you realize. D-Shield doesn't block \"effective\" damage it blocks reduced damage. \n\nThis increases your effective health by a lot compared to Flask. You don't gain \"80hp\" you gain about 150-300(this number varies on a lot of things) effective health.

Which equates to 1.2 health per second. Inorder to get the \"150\" effective health you would have to wait for over 2 minutes. Thats 2 minutes your opponent has control of the lane vs 12 seconds to recover the majority of your health with Flask. Flask which also recovers MP so you can trade back more consistently without the fear of running out of mana. This is not even counting in the fact that you have 3 additional pots left over from buying Flask at the start of the game which would bring up your effective health by 450.

Effective health is the amount of health you have including resist. If you have 2k health and 50% armor/magic resist. You have 3k \"Effective Health\".\n\nKeep in mind the correct terms at hand. Flask does not increase \"Effective Health\" at all. So you gain 0 effective health at the start of the game. Let alone I'm not even talking about going 100% health at each other full force and comparing the win of the trade for having that higher effective health.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-02-04T22:11:10.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know what effective health means, I just thought you were including the regen and passive from the Shield as Shield only gives 80 health and you somehow came up with 150-300.

Lets use Pantheon for example with 15 bonus AD and his Q against Flask and Shield\n\nHis Q deals 86\nHe is able to spam  Q 6 times before running out of mana at ~24 seconds\n\nYou typical top laner has around 32 armor from runes so that equals to 65 damage from Q\n\n65 x 6 = 387 damage \n\n387 damage in 24 seconds.

Now you still have 1 flask left over and 3 health pots. With Doran's Shield you have 1 health pot. Now note that its single targetd.
