It comes with the least value in stats and only allows you to buy 1 hp pot. Anything you wanted Dorans Shield to do, every other choice accomplishes the same task with better results. Ruby + 2 or Cloth + 4 for example. Even 2 Regen Beads + 4  is a better choice due to Shield&#039;s almost nonexistent regen. 1.2hp regen per second and doesnt scale. \r\n\r\nHowever some will ask about the block passive. This is the biggest issue with Shield. It only blocks 8 dmg from autos and targeted spells BEFORE resistances applied rather than AFTER. Meaning the passive loses more value the more resistances you gain. Thats not even mentioning the fact that majority of damage you will receive would be from AOE.\r\n\r\nFor what it was designed to be, it does not fulfill it&#039;s purpose. It has been in a underpowered state for many seasons now and it is literally a noob trap item that misinforms and misleads players for what it actually does.","replies":[{"poster":"WalkingInACircle","date":"2017-03-14T14:35:07.760+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a change to it on surrender@20 a few weeks ago.

Doran's Shield is really strong with the Resolve tree, some champions can reach anywhere from 15-25 health regen per 5 seconds at level 1 with it. Of all the Doran's starting items, the Shield is by far the strongest one. You regen more with it in the long run that someone who starts with a Blade, the regen doesn't fade while in combat, It essentially BLOCKS 100% of the added damage from a Doran's Blade (8 damage from auto attacks -> Doran's Blade only GIVES 8 damage) while giving the same amount of health.\n\nTo say that it's \"the worst\" is ridiculous.

I do know what I'm talking about, perhaps you don't because by your logic of \"flat\" Doran's Blade also gives FLAT AD. It doesn't scale with anything either seeing how there is neither any item nor mastery that gives added % total AD.\n\nAnd then, here's the part where you are wrong: Doran's Shield DOES scale with the Runic Armor Mastery, possibly even Windspeaker's as well, although I've never actually checked Windspeaker's. Per your example, it's true that item will only give a set amount no matter what level you are however there's multiple items in the game that increases healing and regen so giving it a level scaling factor would easily make health regen far too strong. If you think Singed can regen a lot now, just add regen scaling to a Doran's Shield like you suggest and he'll be pick or ban every single game after that.\n\n1 Health Potion = 50 health per 5 seconds\n\nIf you run Recovery, Runic Armor, and Perseverance on Heim with a Doran's Shield, he has 26 health per 5 seconds at level 1. I'll use Heim since he's the highest health regeneration champion due to his passive. Around level 10-11 he regens MORE than a health potion (51 health per 5 seconds). If he uses a potion at level 11, he's practically more than DOUBLE POTION'd.\n\nThink about what happens if you change Doran's Shield to scale with his per level health regen. Suddenly high base health regen champions are ridiculously strong (did I ever mention that Darius is probably 2nd or 3rd highest base health regen?) and just about every champion is going to need their health regen nurfed all across the board because potions are going to heal faster than Soraka (don't forget - healing and regen from Runic applies to potions AND your health regen combined).\n\nWhile you want to compare lifesteal to health regen, you simply can't. Lifesteal scales off damage because it takes time to ramp up and it's not as powerful or safe as straight health regen. When you lifesteal, you have to be attacking creeps which means you are at risk in a sense. The enemy can gank you, poke you, or straight up all-in you. The same is simply not true of health regen. If you get low with health regen you can just go hide behind your tower and if you make items like Doran's Shield scale per level, you'll never see anyone building lifesteal because anytime they get low health they'll hide behind their tower with their insane health regen and just wait to heal back up.","replies":[{"poster":"Ravenous Howls","date":"2017-03-17T12:16:32.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LuLBRNA,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6ktbg68K,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2017-03-17T01:15:53.718+0000)\n>\n> I never said it &quot;scales&quot; when you add all the possible regen sources there&#x27;s A LOT of regen.

You clearly missed my entire point. The more AD someone buys while holding on to the blade gives it better returns on the Life Steal. The Shield is FLAT meaning it does not count towards your base regen making it far weaker when you buy things like Spirit Visage or ZZ'Rot. \n \n> And then, here&#x27;s the part where you are wrong: Doran&#x27;s Shield DOES scale with the Runic Armor Mastery, possibly even Windspeaker&#x27;s as well, although I&#x27;ve never actually checked Windspeaker&#x27;s.

Breaking the mold here! Also Doran's is typically for top laners so no one is going to be running Wind Seekers there. If a support bought a Doran's item over a gold item then they are shooting themselves in the foot. So again Doran's Shield does not scale it is FLAT. I keep emphasizing that b/c you don't seem to get it.  \n\n> 1 Health Potion = 50 health per 5 seconds\n> \n> If you run Recovery, Runic Armor, and Perseverance on Heim with a Doran&#x27;s Shield, he has 26 health per 5 seconds at level 1.

If he uses a potion at level 11, he&#x27;s practically more than DOUBLE POTION&#x27;d.\n> \n\nYou have to calculate the Doran's separately from base Regen. Perseverance only goes up in value the lower health you are. At what point are you calculating the value? 50%? 100%? 200%? Heimerdinger's base regen is 11 per 5 sec with runic and perseverance at 50% gives Heimer 17.82 regen per 5 sec which means he regens 3.5 health a sec. Add the flat doran's to that and it gives him 4.5 health per sec. The buff will make it stronger yes but without resistances Health Regen doesn't do much. The reason ranged, squishy champions have high regen is b/c they can't build resistances without sacrificing power. So Doran's would be a very weak buy on Heimer overall. A better example would be someone like Malphite. A typical resistance stacking champion who will make better use of the shield b/c of resistances.\n\n> Think about what happens if you change Doran&#x27;s Shield to scale with his per level health regen.

Doran's is weak right now and needs to be more tailored to those who are melee and build mostly tank. Are you worried about it effectiveness on Melee or Ranged? I can't tell you keep yo-yo-ing with your examples. Doran's right now is super weak for how expensive it is. You are making such a big stink over the regen now but it's not good on anyone b/c it doesn't scale. \n\n> While you want to compare lifesteal to health regen, you simply can&#x27;t.

You would lose so much CS and gold that you would be irrelevant by 10 minutes in. Life steal is far more useful for lane bullies and ranged champions b/c they are guaranteed to get CS and heal much faster from poke then someone being passive under their tower waiting long minutes or several waves to heal back up. I can compare Life Steal and Health Regen b/c Life Steal will always scale with your levels and items. FLAT regen will not, like on Doran's Shield. So Doran's Blade is a much more gold efficient item. If Doran's was added as  % of health Regen we would not be having this conversation b/c it's value would be of equal contention. If you manage the wave foolishly then you are making a case indicatively to be ganked. The only ones who make great use of passive healing are Garen and Mundo. Other than those two, no one is going to be regenerating the health you are talking about that quickly while passively waiting for their health to regen and the enemy to push the waves to their tower.
