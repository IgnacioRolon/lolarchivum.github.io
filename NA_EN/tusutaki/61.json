Im only comparing Doran&#039;s set because listing out why practically using any other starting sets over Shield are better will make the post way too long. Trying to keep it short and sweet as possible.\n\n**Shield Cost and gold efficient**: \nAs it currently stands, Shield costs 450 gold while only being is 95.41% gold efficient, without its unique passive. To put it in contrast, Blade is 134.63% gold efficient and Ring is is 184.06% gold efficient even without its passive mana restore on kill. While at the same time, Ring is also the cheapest of the three allowing you to buy two health pots instead of one. In a numbers perspective, Shield is 38.92% less efficient than Blade and 88.65% less efficient than Ring. For a clearer perspective..\n\nDoran's Ring = 736 gold value\nDoran's Blade = 605\nDoran's Shield = 429\n\nWith pots included \nRing + 2 = 836\nBlade + 1 = 655\nShield + 1 = 479\n\n**Block Passive**\nNot only Shield provides the worst stats in gold value and but it does not even truly block 8 damage as advertised as it blocks damage before resistances is calculated rather than after. Meaning the actual damage blocked will always be less than 8. It is also the only item in the game that gains less value from it&#039;s block passive the more resistances you gain throughout the game. On top of that, the block passive is not only unique but it is also so restrictive that the majority of the time it won&#039;t see use as area of effect damage is the primary source of damage. \n\n**HP Regen**\n The heath regeneration also discourages from buying shield because of it&#039;s flat 6hp regen per 5 seconds (1.2hp per second) and the worst part of it is that it doesnt scale. I say this because over 95% of the champion roster&#039;s health regen exceeds 6 at level 3 meaning that you will gain more value from just buying two rejuvenation beads in addition to having three health pots. To further my case, 98 out of 134 (73%) champs has or exceeds Shield&#039;s regen passive at level 1. \n\n\n\n_**Suggestions**_\n\n1. Make the block passive block 8 damage AFTER resistances as it should and maybe block 4 from AOE.\n\n2.  Make the 6 per 5 passive be unique and have it be added to the champion&#039;s BASE regeneration rather than having it as a bonus as it currently is.\n\n3.  If 2 may be too strong then make the bonus regen be 10 per 5 as it was in the past.\n\n4. If not 3, then x% of maximum or missing health recovered per 5.\n\nWhat are your opinions? Agree? Disagree? Lets talk about it because I feel that this has been overlooked for way too long.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-12-17T07:39:54.404+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"funny how someone in support of a defensive item can go to such thorough and rigorous detail and information, and still ask for peoples opinions, while nobody whos ever complained about yasuo or zed have ever presented anywhere near as valuable an argument. take notes kids\n\ni completely agree with this, and the suggestions for change are spot on. its a small scale of a change but its one of the most popular items in the game (or was) and i think this legitimate report on dorans shield should really be read and considered by riot. from another suggestion, i think making it 500 gold would be a good start to a supposedly strong buff, but to have such a decent item for the early and mid game, the sustain overall is probably worth it","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2016-12-17T08:47:19.964+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh stop it, you make it sound like this is a rare thing to witness.

But as previously mentioned, Shield doesnt accomplish what it was designed to do and it doesnt help that other defensive starting sets like cloth + 4 being vastly superior in literally every way.\n\nI also have a small problem with Blade as well for being too narrow for the lack of better words.

Yes, going those other items will typically give you more sustain overall. It often won't matter because you'll be losing trades too hard. A Dshield Garen or Mundo can trade with Riven pretty well. Cloth 4? Not so much.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2016-12-17T18:26:47.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it doesnt make you win trades as I said before, it doesnt even block 8 damage. I've done the math in my past threads that I can link and the only conclusion where Shield does shine is when you're going to all in against an auto attacker at before level 3 when you're both at 100% health.\n\nAs for with trades, you will always win the trade with that cloth+4 because as you already mentioned, sustain. So if you happen to have an even trade or even a bad trade, you can just pop a potion and have control of the lane again in 15 seconds than 2 minutes.\n\nAnd the additional armor gives you 15% more effective health. Lets assume the average health for a top laner at lvl 1 is 570 with 30 armor.\n\n570 * 1.30 = 741 effective\n570 + 80 (shield) + 1.30 = 845\n570 * (1.30 + .15(cloth)) = 826\n\nThat is a 19hp difference at level 1 . That 450 gold investment is so worth that 19hp. Cloth outscales the health Shield provides at 600 base hp. So you have 19 less hp when starting cloth if you have 570 base hp, too bad its not like you have 4 additional pots adding 600hp making your opponent waste resources and their hp dwindle away and youre already making an investment to your powerspike.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2016-12-22T14:02:01.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we please get a comment from one of the Riot staff?
