Keep the &quot;Runes Reforged&quot;/Masteries and allow people to personally customize their playstyle again? You can keep the old runes free so new players wont feel gimped but add a price for additional pages like theyre doing currently. \r\n\r\nWhat they have planned with the &quot;stat shards&quot; in pbe I can guarantee it wont end well at all as it doesnt promote diversity but more linearity by having 12 AD or 20 AP from the get go. The other options? \r\n\r\n10 Armor split into two shards, \r\n12 MR split as above, \r\n1-10% CRD at lvls1-18, \r\n8% attack speed, or \r\n15-90hp at 1-18. \r\n\r\nSo what do you think the majority of people would choose? The one that provides more damage as the others except for maybe the attack speed doesnt provide anywhere near the value to offset the dmg shards.","replies":[]}
