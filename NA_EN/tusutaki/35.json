Not including ratios for bonus MR for ease.\r\n\r\nPassive: .4 AP AOE + 100\r\nQ:  (windblast) .6 AP + 200  + (tornado)  .45 AP + 100 + 9% enemy max HP\r\nW: Passive 23% max HP magic shield every 12 seconds not taking dmg\r\nE: .7 AP AOE + 260\r\nR: .7 AP AOE + 350\r\n\r\nSo how much in total damage are you able to do in one full rotation?\r\n\r\nAP Ratio\r\n.4 + .6 + .45 + .7 + .7 = 2.85 AP \r\n\r\nSounds pretty big right? What if I were to tell you that you can easily deal over 1k damage with an easily obtainable 350AP from ratios alone? Now lets look at base damage.\r\n\r\nBase Damage (assuming tornado is hitting someone with 2k hp)\r\n100 + 200 + 180(tornado against 2khp) + 260 + 350 = 1190 base\r\n\r\nThat is over 1k base damage ALONE. Even without the 9% max hp damage it&#039;s still over 1k.\r\n\r\nSo in full rotation of his damaging abilities with only 350 AP which is easily obtainable, you are able to EASILY deal over 2k in damage. Friendly reminder that THIS IS ALL AOE AND FILLED WITH CC. And thats not even including his bonus MR ratios. Just with his Passive and E combo  you have 1.1 APR and 360 base damage. Using the same AP (350), thats a total of 745.\r\n\r\nWhat this Galio is is a combination of Shen&#039;s defensive utilities and Fiddlestick&#039;s damage. Regardless if they go with the Shen nerfs and release Galio untouched, then there will be literally no reason to play Shen over Galio at all. At this point it would be better option to just reverse Shen&#039;s rework as the new items and keystones would benefit the old him greatly.","replies":[{"poster":"Wind Whistler","date":"2017-03-21T03:22:29.596+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you kidding me?

Thats not including if you have Rylais which would slow them to better receive the full duration. It is EASY to deal 1+ APR without using his ult.","replies":[]}]}]}
