{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2019-02-13T20:46:15.671+0000","title":"My Patch Notes","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I got bored and saw some of the PBE patch notes. So I wrote down some of the changes I would like to see from the top of my head. \r\n\r\n**Kindred**\r\n\r\nDance of Arrows: Now applies on-hit effects and lifesteal\r\n\r\n_Context: There are some scenarios where casting her Q (Dance of Arrows) actually hurts her more than it's supposed to provide due to how it functions. Forcing her to stop autoing to deal marginal damage making the little trade off less valuable. This is even more of a case when she goes for more of a on-hit build making this skill look more like a punishment. Dance of Arrows applying on-hit effect and lifesteal will soften the downside of casting her Q for both Crit and On-Hit builds._\r\n--\r\n**Shyvana**\r\n\r\nTwin Bite: AD Ratio changed to 60/70/80/90/100% AD from 20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80% AD\r\n\r\n_Context: Majority of her damage comes from landing her Flame Breath which considering it's CD, cast time, and travel speed, makes her binary. This doesnt help the fact that she's heavily reliant on on-hit damage from items which forces her on a very narrow build path. So instead of buffing her Flame Breath I thought about giving her Q some bit of love for the early to mid game and for her top lane. Allowing her to still do something instead of being an oversized minion._\r\n--\r\n**Pantheon**\r\n\r\nHeartseeker Strike: No longer deals reduced damage to non-champs.\r\n\r\n_Context: In order for Pantheon to effectively clear waves and camps early to mid game, he not only has to be ahead of his opponent but to also max his E first which hurts his poke and execution from Q substantially while at the same time needing mana to be effective._\r\n--\r\n**Zzrot Portal**\r\n\r\nRecipe changed to Raptor Cloak + Catalyst of Aeons + 700 Gold. Total cost is unchanged. \r\n\r\nThe stats and effects are changed accordingly.\r\n+55 Armor\r\n+300 Health\r\n+300 Mana \r\n+125% base health regen\r\nAdded Unique Passive: Eternity\r\n\r\n_Context: There are some mana hungry tanks and the only option to relieve their struggle against physical damage is to build items like Frozen Heart or Iceborn which doesnt provide health nor sustain you normally get from Eternity. So consider this an Armor version of the Catalyst items. This will give more options to strategically manipulate your lanes and help you act more as a wall._\r\n--\r\n**Grasp of the Undying**\r\n\r\nDamage and healing switched: Deal 2% of your max health as magic damage and restores 4% of your max health from 4% and 2% respectively. \r\n\r\n_Context: Makes tanks act more like tanks and less like bruisers._\r\n--\r\n**Aftershock**\r\n\r\nPassive changed: Immobilizing an enemy champion grants 100% bonus _total _armor and bonus _total _magic resistance for 5 seconds and losing half the amount granted after 2.5 seconds. After the 2.5 seconds, you release a shockwave that deals 10 − 120 (based on level) (+ 10% of your bonus armor) (+ 10% of your bonus magic resistance) magic damage to nearby enemy champions and monsters.\r\n\r\n_Context: This change should help tanks more as it's former iteration saw helping nontanks more than actual tanks. While this will still help the nontanks as this increases their total resistances, this will scale much better for champions who builds for it. _\r\n\r\n--\r\n**Dorans Shield**\r\n\r\nOld Unique Passive: After taking damage from an enemy champion, gain health regeneration equal to 0 − 30 (based on current missing health) over 10 seconds.\r\nto\r\nNew Unique Passive: After taking damage from an enemy champion, gain health regeneration equal to 6 (+ 4% of your missing health) over 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n_Context: When against champs with a decent amount of poke, you're practically forced to take Dorans Shield on top of Second Wind. While this is fine for tanks who mostly stalls, for fighters who can actually respond it hurts them more due to Shield's and Resolve Tree's lack of offensive stats. Buffing shield should help alleviate the need to take the Resolve Tree for non-tank champs._\r\n--\r\n**Second Wind**\r\n\r\nNew Passive: +50% base health regeneration, increased to +200% while below 25% health.\r\n\r\n_Context: This is in response to giving Dorans Shield it's old passive while giving people who originally took Second Wind a legitimate option._\r\n--\r\n**Dorans Ring**\r\n\r\nStats changed: Adaptive +5 AD or +15 AP from +15 AP\r\n\r\n_Context: This should help mana hungry AD champions who primarily uses their skills to harass or clear waves. This should help them apply the pressure more consistently and acts as a response to the defensive buffs._","replies":[{"poster":"fire263","date":"2019-02-14T01:47:18.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting changes, +1 for actually creating a constructive post although can't say I read all of it.\n\nPersonally, I like the pantheon changes, although it would have to be changed so it still has damage reduction on monsters as that will make his jungling a bit too strong, considering he is already pretty good as an early game jungler. ZZrot I'm fine with the mana but the health should be replaced with MR, as ZZrot is that niche item that gives both stats. But if you're throwing in some mana and Eternity passive, it's going to need to lose a bit of base stats if the cost won't be changed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AIQ","date":"2019-02-13T20:49:59.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has a Shyvana buff, I like it.
