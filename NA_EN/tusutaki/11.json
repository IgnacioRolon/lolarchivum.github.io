Why even nerf his passive to this extreme when its not even where majority of his damage is coming from? Sylas' kit has one of if not the highest AP ratios in the game that enables him to be such a menace, but instead of addressing that specific area you keep adding more arbitrary dampeners to make him less relevant like Aatrox. Its not even an attempt to balance him but to purposefully put him in the back burner for who knows how long. \r\n\r\nWhat do you want Sylas to be at this point? He has a kit of an AP Bruiser but with Assassin and Magelike numbers. Its not even like his kit is entirely unfair or broken either, its purely his ratios. Now I love playing Sylas because of his mechanics but I can never for the life of me understand why something like his Q has a 1.2AP ratio on a ~3 second CD at max rank. I just dont get what direction you want him to take. He plays as if he revolves around his passive but \"balanced\" in a way that it's a nonfactor. Its really sad because I actually find his kit to be one of the better modern designed champs excluding the numbers.","replies":[{"poster":"KingBBQChicken","date":"2019-09-26T17:02:49.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its the same issue with morde and diana. Everyones been saying Ap bruiser itemization is subpar right now so most Ap bruisers, excluding some special cases would rather just build full Ap. If some better items that fit kits like sylas were added, he might become a proper bruiser. Or... he might get nerfed into oblivion and be forced to go damage every game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karn Bishop","date":"2019-09-27T00:24:49.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They keep on trying to make him into an anti mage pick when that just does not work in league, he always should have been a jungling mage and it even makes sense lore wise as Guerilla warfare, instead they push this anti mage mechanic which makes him trash vs 80% of the roster and whats worse is he doesn't even do anti mage well at all and will often LOSE matchups to mages.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tr4shB4NSYST3M","date":"2019-09-26T17:15:32.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Its not even like his kit is entirely unfair or broken either\"\n\nAre you trolling?  Sylas has been spam nerfed since his release BECAUSE his kit is so overloaded it makes him nearly unbalanceable, he has everything except basic attack range, Aoe waveclear? Check 2 sources, magic damage shield + amumu Q,  Oh and another mini-gapclose w/ a heal when he's low hp, and access to any of the 5 ults on the enemy team.   But no, his kit isn't unfair or grossly overloaded LOL.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sinister Anubis","date":"2019-09-26T15:43:23.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sylas is just over loaded as all hell. I think his biggest issue is his ulti. I also think that the way his abilitys flow is just to good. Hes like riven with her cancle animations but is like diana as a bursty assassin with cc heals and shields. His passive is also very problematic.","replies":[]}]}
