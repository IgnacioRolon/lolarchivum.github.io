He was my first main when I first played this game back in S3. However I dropped him as a main due to finding more and more champions that does his job better whether it be assassins or even tanks. While he does okay early to mid, he falls off extremely hard late game. Especially when armor penetration is nerfed in this season.\r\n\r\nPantheon from my perspective has been sitting in the back for a long long time. He doesnt do well top except against for a select few champs. Jungle he does okay in but he is extremely mana hungry to clear. Mid is decent to say the least but nothing ground breaking.\r\n\r\nHe did get the spotlight in S4 or S5 when they revamped dragons and he could block it&#039;s attacks. From that, that allowed him to secure a very early dragon. However they since changed that making dragon attacks unavoidable aside from hourglass. So what about the position he&#039;s in now? In what areas does he really excel in? Why should I pick him when I can pick Tahm who is not only stupid tanky but also deals a lot of damage. Hell in most cases, Tahm is a better bully than him.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-11-19T10:30:42.237+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"what do you mean armor penetration nerfed?\n\npantheon is one of the few champions who makes real good use of cleaver since his e rapidly applies stacks. it remains a good item for him. so cleaver/last whisper is still an option. and for him the item actually got buffed, since more ad is usually more useful for assassins than health.\n\nthe same goes for ghostblade. he makes much better use of the flat ad increase than crit.\n\nnot doubting, that his powercurve is weird starting out so strong and falling off so hard, but the item changes shouldnt have impacted him negatively.\n\n\ni would be more concerned about the damage reduction on phantom dancers and the 8% from a support just sitting next to the squishy hes trying to kill. those are the real problems.","replies":[{"poster":"YuGiHo","date":"2015-11-19T10:41:47.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While ghostblade is a better item overall it it is more expensive and with the removal of brutalizer you cant just get that and be set with your early game ad cdr and armor pen all in on cheap item. even with cleaver the removal of kindel gem from the recipie replaces 10 cdr and hp for cheap for 10 cdr and ad an a higher price.\n\nDont trick yourself into thinking all the item changes were good, and even if they are his build paths suck. it cost too much gold to get his items and panth being a early game champ does not have the time","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-11-19T10:49:47.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YuGiHo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VhabFXdg,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-11-19T10:41:47.642+0000)\n>\n> While ghostblade is a better item overall it it is more expensive and with the removal of brutalizer you cant just get that and be set with your early game ad cdr and armor pen all in on cheap item. even with cleaver the removal of kindel gem from the recipie replaces 10 cdr and hp for cheap for 10 cdr and ad an a higher price.\n> \n> Dont trick yourself into thinking all the item changes were good, and even if they are his build paths suck. it cost too much gold to get his items and panth being a early game champ does not have the time\n\nok, i agree with the terrible build pathes. though thats still mainly a problem because of his weird powercurve. they could shift some power from his early to his lategame.\n\nthe only problem i see is that due to pantheons ult this is kindof difficult. he could turn into a really snowballing monster with a strong enough lategame, since he can drop in from almost anywhere any time.\n\n\nthe cause of his weak lategame is mainly because so much of his powerbudget is caught up in his ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2015-11-19T13:32:40.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the utility or the damage?
