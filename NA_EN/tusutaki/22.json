Im not expecting nor asking to revert to what is what before but hopefully somewhere in the middle. I think the most simplest and easiest answer is to revert the range nerf but to also greatly nerf the empowered voidspawns. Perhaps rework the Zzrot into a defensive version of Banner where it instead protect an area or radius. At least something otherwise it&#039;s a rather pointless item.","replies":[{"poster":"z63XnLCMwX","date":"2018-06-01T22:01:00.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If zzrot was buffed again? Wouldn't the zzrot + banner combo be even more strong then.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2018-06-01T23:37:38.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it would but then you would have to sacrifice your item space and utility that other items would've brought. If you were to rush the said two items then you would have nothing but armor and MR. No cooldowns or health. It would make map/lane control more important while bringing up different strategies and comps to the table. Of course it could always be more fine tuned.\n\nIn a perfect world I would love to bring back that one pirate event when GP was reworked where you could upgrade your own minions. Never understood why it was taken out and never brought back.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2018-06-01T21:56:13.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's wrong with zzrot? It's an out-of-lane split pushing tool, basically. Drop it in a bush near turret while you go do something else, and the turret gets pushed in for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2018-06-01T23:31:54.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you already said it yourself. You have to set it practically near the turret for it at all be effective while making it very vulnerable at the same time. While with Banner you could just empower a cannon minion at base and go literally anywhere else while it does it's job. A more effective job at that too. \n\nPreviously before Zzrot was nerfed, it had a gigantic range where the voidspawns could reach up to two towers in lane. That is what I would call \"out-of-lane split pushing\". Although im not denying it's overbearing strength however I also believed that just weakening the Empowered Voidspawns and gaining like 5 gold would be fine.","replies":[]}]}]}
