While Aatrox is below 50% maximum health, heal is tripled.\r\n&gt; 「 HEAL: 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 (+ 25% bonus AD) 」\r\n\r\n&gt;XIN ZHAO\r\n&gt; PASSIVE: Every third hit heals Xin Zhao, and every third basic attack is guaranteed to Critical strike icon critically strike for bonus critical damage.\r\n&gt; HEAL: 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50 (+ 20% bonus AD) (+ 40% AP)\r\n&gt; 「 MODIFIED CRITICAL DAMAGE: 125 / 137.5 / 150 / 162.5 / 175% 」\r\n&gt; ACTIVE: Xin Zhao gains bonus attack speed for 5 seconds.\r\n&gt; BONUS ATTACK SPEED: 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60%\r\n\r\n&gt;WARWICK\r\n&gt; INNATE: Warwick&#039;s basic attacks deal 10 - 44 (based on level) bonus magic damage on-hit.\r\n&gt; While below 50% maximum health, Warwick&#039;s basic attacks also heal him for the same amount, with the healing tripled to 30 - 132 (based on level) while below 25% maximum health.\r\n\r\nLets assume both Aatrox and Xin has 100 bonus AD, 200 AD total, with 10% lifesteal against someone with 100 armor (50% dmg reduction)\r\n\r\n&gt; Aatrox heal auto = 10 \r\n&gt; Blood thirst (above 50) = 65\r\n&gt; Blood Thirst (below 50) = 115\r\n&gt; 10 + 65 = 75 healed every 3rd auto (&gt;50)\r\n&gt; 10 + 115 = 125 healed every 3rd auto (&lt;50)\r\n\r\n&gt; Xin heal auto = 10\r\n&gt; crit auto damage = 350\r\n&gt; heal crit auto = 17\r\n&gt; heal strike = 70\r\n&gt; Xin Heals for either 80 or 87 every 3rd auto. However the heal strike can be applied to structures. Now note that the Q active isnt calculated here, which it was, it would be roughly be around 100+ healed.\r\n\r\nNow how about Warwick? With no damage items \r\n\r\n&gt; WW heal **per auto **(&lt;50) = 44\r\n&gt; WW heal **per auto** (&lt;25) = 132\r\n\r\nIf we were to add rageblade into all 3 with it&#039;s passive activated, Xin will out heal Aatrox since his heal also scales with AP. Warwick however will out heal them all. In 2 autos, WW will heal 132 below 50. 44 + 88 = 132. Below 25? 132 + 264 = 396.\r\n\r\nThere is now literally no reason to choose Aatrox at all. The self titled Avatar of War is now the Avatar is Disappointment. I could include more math but that would make the post a lot longer. \r\n\r\nIs there literally any plans to buff Aatrox? Like at all?","replies":[{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2017-01-25T17:04:03.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xin is also a troll pick, because of how easy is to kite him. \nEvery time I see him in the LCS the last 3-4 years, he doesn't do anything.\nHe is only playable in Dominion/Ascension, because of how strong he is in 1 v 1 against other assasins/ tanks/ fighters.
