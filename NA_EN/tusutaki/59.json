Which was extremely useful against an all AD team. However in it&#039;s current state, it reflects 15% +25% your bonus armor. When you add this effect into the current meta, it loses even more of its value as not only the damage is nerfed but there are so much armor shred now that buying an item that adds health and armor is better.\r\n\r\nLets try some math here. 300 ad with crit and IE\r\n\r\nOld Thornmail (30% reflect)\r\n\r\n300ad*2.5= 750\r\n750*.3=  250\r\n\r\nNew Thornmail (15% reflect + 25% bonus armor)\r\n\r\n750*.15 = 112\r\n\r\nNow how much armor do you need inorder to just match the old damage? 200 bonus armor? Nope, that just adds 50 damage. You would need AT LEAST 400 bonus armor to even get relatively close to the old damage and that&#039;ll just only be 212 damage. \r\n\r\nNow lets take out the crit.\r\n\r\n300*.3= 90\r\n\r\n300*.15= 45\r\n\r\nNow in the same case here, you would need 200 bonus armor to match the prenerf damage. Now some might argue that the current version is more useful against minions and champs who deals lower damage. Thornmail already provides half of the needed requirements and even then you&#039;re edging onto 300 armor territory which is almost never achieved unless you&#039;re playing Rammus. \r\n\r\nSo would reverting the nerf be a good option to our current tank melting problem?","replies":[{"poster":"MaeDoSan","date":"2017-02-19T00:30:24.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow that's y it doesn't hurt as much now","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fluffeh","date":"2017-02-19T00:30:02.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason it was changed in the first place was because the amount of reflected damage was too overbearing and forced itemization. I agree thornmail is a terrible item thats not worth buying but they need to do something different with it. They should take inspiration from dota 2's blademail, it provides modest defensive stats normally but comes with an active that reflects 100% of the damage you receive back onto the attackers for 4 or so seconds.\n\nMake it powerful but give it counterplay thats the best way to balance these things.","replies":[]}]}
