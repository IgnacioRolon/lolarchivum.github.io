Why is that? I would say his ult. While being immune to CC and a huge attack damage buff is nice, the duration is painstakingly short. With high mobility becoming more and more favorable, his ult becomes less and less impactful. By the time you activate your ult to get in range to attack the carries it's already gone. By the time you get into range, your ult's duration is over and are vulnerable to CCs again. What I propose is a small to moderate change.\n\n**Current**\nPASSIVE: Olaf gains bonus armor and magic resistance.\nARMOR & MAGIC RESIST: 10 / 20 / 30\nACTIVE: Olaf instantly removes all crowd control effects from himself and becomes immune to them for 6 seconds. During this time, he loses the passive bonus but gains bonus attack damage.\n\n**NEW**\nPASSIVE: Olaf gains bonus armor and magic resistance.\nARMOR & MAGIC RESIST: 10 / 20 / 30\nACTIVE: Olaf instantly removes all crowd control effects from himself and becomes immune to them for *6/8/10 seconds*.

I'm not a fan of him, but if I wanted to change something on him, it would his ulti. I think that he should gain defensive stats while ulting and offensive stats while not ulting.
