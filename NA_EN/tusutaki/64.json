He was objectively OP and extremely overbearing to play against. So the incoming nerfs and where it hit him was justified. Before his most recent nerf to his Ult, I would say he was pretty healthy. He had a below average early to mid with a big boost in late. While he dealt less DPS than a lot of ADCs in the first two parts, his weakness was offset by his ult which I thought was pretty fair since you need to be ahead to be at all relevant. \r\n\r\nHowever since they nerfed his Ult&#039;s slow, he has a much harder chance to even stay even in terms of scaling. His Whisper passive&#039;s AD boost is what was mostly gating him, only seeing 1% increase per level until 11. After level 11 is where he sees his boost the most increasing by 4% per lvl. \r\n\r\nNow in his current form, he&#039;s barely a viable pick. All other ADCs dishes out damage in a much faster pace.\r\n\r\nSo can we revert his Ult nerf? Or buff his Ult where the enemies arent notified he activates his Ult nor his radius? I personally like the later since it gives more of that sniper essence. But what are your thoughts?","replies":[]}
