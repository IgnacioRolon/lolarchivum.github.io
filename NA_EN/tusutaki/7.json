From a scaling tank buster to another generic ADC. She is greatly outclassed by majority of junglers and is overall weaker and more item dependent than previously.","replies":[{"poster":"Naalith","date":"2017-09-24T16:53:27.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I mained Kindred from the time they came out until the time they were \"reworked\" and I have made posts on the forums about this before. They turned her from one of the most unique characters with an amazing personality and crazy kit to fit to just a generic adc who happens to be able to jungle and it really, REALLY sucks. Old Kindred was an attack speed based carry who could jungle, really only comparable to Kog'Maw with %health shred auto attacks but way more fun to play because of mobility and her ult. New Kindred is an adc... who can jungle... and scales worse than other adcs. I still play Kindred from time to time and sometimes I even carry games but it just makes me feel sad because of how gutted and lame she feels now compared to before, and I HATE building Warrior enchant but you don't really have a choice because of her new scalings.\n\n\nTL;DR, whoever reworked Kindred at Riot has never played the champ, doesn't understand what made the champ so fun and unique, and completely ruined the character(s) and I hope they rectify the situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2017-09-24T17:38:01.643+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never really understood why they decided to rework her in the first place. She wasnt strong until super late and easily denied. Like if the purpose was to actually help her then all they literally needed to do was to have her Q apply on-hit effects and thats it. I feel that was the only thing she was missing. The W and E change was decent but it doesnt offset her weakness.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2017-09-24T22:18:21.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ariel the Cruel,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3JIXY0K0,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-09-15T07:40:45.314+0000)\n>\n> The problem with Kindred is that her kit forces an unhealthy power curve to be viable.\n> They either have to accept the &quot;Early game hyper-scaling ADC&quot; dilemma, or throw her into the &quot;not allowed to be viable&quot; bin.

Back then, I could get away with Devourer, Rageblade, BotrK, and Deaths Dance. Taking full advantage of her passive. Now? You have to build damage to deal damage, attack speed for W to be relevant, Crit for her wolf, and lifesteal to even survive. Now you can say that's how all ADCs go but the biggest factor is that she is a jungler. So those ADC items are heavily gated.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ahris","date":"2017-09-24T16:14:08.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They need to rework her ulti.
