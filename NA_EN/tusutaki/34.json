I would rather wait a little longer in order to play a position we play best at to increase our chances at winning. If the Autofill system stays then there must be a 3rd option along with Primary and Secondary roles. That 3rd option should be &quot;Least preferred&quot; and as the name implies, it would serves as a way to avoid playing in your worst role if Autofill is activated. \r\n\r\nThe last thing I want is to lose a ranked game because I or someone else was forced into a role that we&#039;re not good at. Normals is fine and understandable as its a place to practice and experiment but ranked is where you bring your best to the table. You dont force a wide receiver to be your defensive linemen in a football game.","replies":[]}
