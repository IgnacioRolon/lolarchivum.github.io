Now for the past month or so it only displays the damage blocked in ticks. Meaning it will show the damage blocked in that instance, at that very moment and then resets to 0. \r\n\r\nI would like to believe this is a bug and not an intentional thing because I know it showed total blocked damage fine before.","replies":[]}
