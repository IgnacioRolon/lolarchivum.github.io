The only reason one would invest into the Resolve path is for that 15% tenacity mastery. \r\n\r\nBonds of Stone has such an insignificant effect that any other keystone is vastly better. Barely hitting 1.5k in a 30min game.\r\n\r\n Grasp of the Undying&#039;s healing has been nerfed that its just not worth getting especially if it can only be proced once every 4 seconds. \r\n\r\nCourage of the Colossus has also been nerfed hard. &quot;But its a buff if you have 4 enemies nearby!&quot; Yeah in majority of cases thats not going to happen. Also going from 4 second shield to 3 seconds. Even then, it is essentially the only Resolve keystone worth getting if you want that 15% tenacity.\r\n\r\nAnd people wonder why there&#039;s a huge damage creep when a lot of the defensive options keeps getting nerfed to the ground.","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-02-10T05:35:37.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Undying Grasp can be quite toxic when strong, the problem isn't when it is taken on tanks. It is when every top laner under the sun takes it just for trading power. \n\nCotC was also kinda disgusting for a while when it was strong. Keystones in general are just too effective in specific cases. Like old Fervor or Thunderlords period.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2017-02-10T07:19:01.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel that Ferocity and Cunning is in a decent place as they do what they're supposed to do effectively. New Fervor still find it's uses and Thunderlords even though it was also nerfed, Resolve? CotC was the only keystone that had value at the time. Since everything has to scale with level now, why not have Grasp also scale with level? \n\nEvery 4 seconds in combat, deal 3% of your max health as bonus magic damage on your next auto and restore 1-3% of max health based on level.\n\nBecause as of right now, the only reason I use resolve at all is because of that Tenacity. If Tenacity wasnt in that tree then I would never invest points into it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Proxy345","date":"2017-02-10T05:45:47.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Resolve has its uses still though because 15% extra movement speed while running through brush and the river makes a difference between being alive and dead in alot of situations,Runic armor is also hard to pass up because I like to rush a hydra item with a {{item:3065}} on a AD top laner most of the time. I lost count of the amount of times that perseverance kicked in during a teamfight and kept me alive through near death situations as the tank,and I mean literally down to single digit numbers of health left lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"RexSaur","date":"2017-02-10T05:40:14.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"They literally just trashed both offensive trees on pbe, what else do you want?\n\nGod tank mains are ridiculous.","replies":[]}]}
