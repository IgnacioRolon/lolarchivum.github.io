Something that would deter us from complaining about Zed and Lee Sin 24/7 and to possibly show Riot that we like these changes. Might be past, might be present. What changes have you seen that was a positive? I'll give some examples.\r\n\r\n**Buffing Singed ult**\r\nOne of the buffs that Singed really needed to help him catch up (no pun intended) with his top competitors. Especially since the nerf of Tear during season 3.\r\n\r\n**Viktor rework**\r\nAbsolutely needed and it was a vast improvement compared to his older counterpart. Especially his new splash art.\r\n\r\n**Soraka rework**\r\nI love playing as the healer in multiple mmos. Most notably Guild Wars 1. Pre rework Soraka was ok at best until solo soraka was discovered but it didnt feel right as with her Q was out of place with the rest of her kit. The rework made her more of a definitive healer than ever before. Healing 200-300 on 1.2 second cool down? I aint complaining. \r\n\r\n**The Jungle Spirit items** \r\nSeason 4 was the closest thing Riot has ever got to a perfect jungle. Jungle diversity was large with only a few issues with some champions (KhaZix) but the items are what made it great. Each having their own benefits catering to each type of jungler. Each item has good brought good sustain and damage to bat it off. \r\n\r\n**Baron, Dragon, and the inclusion of the Critter**\r\nSeason 5's jungle isnt pretty. Aint going to deny that. But with the changes to Baron and Dragon I think are positive changes. It made the game less snowbally in a way and utilizes more strategy on managing the buffs, damage output from drag and baron, and the critter making rotations a bit easier and more valuable.","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2015-02-02T22:56:53.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The Jungle Spirit items\n> Season 4 was the closest thing Riot has ever got to a perfect jungle.

Like, 70% of the most played junglers last year built Elder Lizard...","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-02-02T23:16:08.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why was it terrible? Especially compared to today's jungle? S4's jungle had hell a lot more diversity. You could jungle with several champs with good success in season 4 than in season 5. \n\nAll season 5 did was solidified Lee Sin and J4 and made a lot of other junglers redundant.","replies":[]}]}]}
