I was extremely ecstatic to say the least. However even though NB is meant to be a shorter game mode, I thought to myself &quot;Why not have an option to add in old items in custom games?&quot; Since the idea doesnt impact the regular normal games or ranked, I thought it could be an easily to implement and even beneficial to the game itself. It hits the nostalgia in the right place while also adding in more variety in the game. And im just talking about the items themselves and not the stats or price. Love to see the &quot;Spirit of the Ancients&quot; jungle sets back just to see how they would play out.\r\n\r\nItem Shop customization is just the tip as you can go much farther than that. Perhaps include some of the older or forgotten rift game modes like Gangplank&#039;s rework event? Or if you want to give players even more control perhaps let us change the Dragon elemental spawns or even allow champs to be simply locked out! \r\n\r\nThis is just an idea/theory that can easily be expanded upon. What do you think? Have any ideas of your own?","replies":[]}
