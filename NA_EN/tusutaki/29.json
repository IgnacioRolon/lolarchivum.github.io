It allowed many different combinations. Each tree served the purpose as well. Offense/Defense/Utility\r\n\r\nSince the overhaul, it was more or less streamlined. While yes, the 3rd tier keystones impacted the game more greatly than before, it also in a way, simplified the process. My use of 10+ pages is now only around 4 or 5.  Going from the diverse Offense/Defense/Utility that favor play styles to Ferocity/Cunning/Resolve that favors classes. \r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts and opinions?","replies":[{"poster":"Xrusa","date":"2015-12-19T23:55:27.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I just have 1 page that I edit before every game and I don't use any other mastery page, because it's so fast to change stuff around on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Yxion the Yordle","date":"2015-12-19T23:56:56.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ This.
