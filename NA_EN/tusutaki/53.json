Why?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"In a lot of my games, I always see tanks taking either Grasp or Courage over Stonebound and I always ask myself why. Especially when they build Stoneplate or play as supports. On champs who applies tons of CC like Naut, you&#039;d think Stounbound would be a must due to the massive and constant healing but more often than not I always see them take Courage. Same applies to tank J4 where Grasp is favored when Grasp is the least impactful keystone in the game imo. So why wouldnt you take Stonebound?","replies":[{"poster":"Gubaguy","date":"2017-08-04T19:01:42.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could have soemthign to do with the fact that if you are a ranged support (the most commonly used support type) its only half as good, literlaly... read it, it only gives you half the bonus.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2017-08-04T19:08:56.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you could read past the title to see that I wasnt even implying Stonebound on  ranged supports.","replies":[{"poster":"Gubaguy","date":"2017-08-04T22:43:03.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ciourage of the collossus gives a flat shield, plus 5% of yoru max health as a shield when you cc someone, as a tank you need to be in the front lines CCing someone, why woudl i ever take 5% more health when i can have 5%+flat bonus that procs agasint all damage while in a teamfight?\n\nAnd why do i want 5% more health when i can have an attack that heals me for a % of my health every 4 seconds?\n\nThe fact is stonebound is in fact one of the weakest, and most useless keystones in the game, 5% more health doesnt stop vayne, or fiora from gutting you for a max health % in true damage, it doesnt stop mundo from keeping me perma slowwed while chunking me, it doesnt help agasint prolonged damage or in lasting fights...

Tanks like Alistar can use it or oddball supports like Bard. But after that, you start losing heal/shield/damage. Lulu and Janna could but they'd lose their shields and health. Annie and Brand could use it but you lose burst.
