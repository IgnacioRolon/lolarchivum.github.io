Being able to splitpush and saving your teammates from an unfavorable outcome and possibly turning it around. He was considered one of the top tier top laners because of this. Keyword was. What changed? Somewhere around season 3 he was nerfed, most notably his Fient (Shield amount reduced to 60/100/140/180/220 from 70/115/160/205/250.) and with the inclusion of the new meta. As time goes on, he is seemingly getting weaker and weaker. Not just because of the nerfs, but the way the game is being played itself. Shen was considered as one of the best tanks, and now there's a lot of changes with other champions that essentially puts Shen in the backseat and unfavorable. While i'am not advocating to reverse the Fient nerfs, I do however strongly believe that he needs some buff for him to catch up with the rest.\r\n\r\n====1=====\r\n**Ki Strike**\r\nMake Ki Strike's cooldown from basic attacks apply against structures. Not only it wont affect the lane phase, it will keep his tanky splitpushing playstyle at a healthy state. \r\n\r\n====2====\r\n**Shadow Dash**\r\nEither make the energy cost 100 (from 120) or increase the width of the hitbox by at least 10%. If you dont agree with the energy cost, at least increase the width as there are some very questionable occurrences where it looks like you hit them with your shadowdash and that the taunt should be applied but its not. The increase of width will better match the player's perspective and judgement based on Shen's character model as it feels that the hitbox is smaller than the model.\r\n\r\n====3====\r\n**Magic Resist **\r\nFor the justification of (according to lolwiki) Shen \"do not gain magic resistance per level because they are not always melee champions due to their variable attack range.\" Which is farse is almost every conceived way possible. By going by that same logic, Pantheon should also not gain magic resist due to his \"variable attack range\" and neither should Diana nor J4. Why make Shen so weak against the current top lane meta? Or any AP top lane for that matter? It looks and seems counter productive when you have Shen as a primary tank but not allowing him to have the basic resistances. Just giving him a simple fix to his magic resist like the rest of his top lane brothers will benefit him greatly, to be at least on par with the rest of the top laners. \r\n\r\nYay? Nay? Comments?

Especially when back then there was a prenerf Sunfire Cape that dominated almost everything. In present day, its entirely another story. As ranged top and AP top laners become more and more apparent, Shen falls behind extremely hard. Especially when the mobility in this game is becoming more and more apparent. Why pick Shen when I can pick Gnar or Sion? While his Ult is desirable, everything else about him is lackluster compared to other top lane meta champs. \n\nAnd I still dont understand why Shen still has no magic resist gains.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Graves III","date":"2015-02-11T01:57:28.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has no magic resist gains because he didnt need them.\n\nShen can keep up with AP top laners better than many due to his shield. His shield is kept weak though, because ult.\n\n>Why pick Shen when I can pick Gnar or Sion? \n\nBecause neither of them can gank bot lane while pushing top lane. Period. For this reason Shen will always be top tier if he is allowed to be strong in the slightest. You mention pre-nerf sunfire cape, but you fail to mention pre-nerf vorpal blade, or pre-nerf Feint, or pre-nerf Shadow Dash, or for that matter pre-nerf Stand United.\n\nShen was nerfed for being too strong, then remade, then nerfed for being too strong.\nMark my words, as long as shen gets to keep his ult he will never be balanced. He will be too weak or too strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-02-11T04:51:49.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">He has no magic resist gains because he didnt need them.\n\nDidnt meaning is past tense right? So what about present tense? Why does Shen and Singed have no MR gains while other tanks like Renekton and Mundo does? \n\n>Shen can keep up with AP top laners better than many due to his shield. His shield is kept weak though, because ult.\n\nThats a contradiction. Its a 60 shield on a 9 second cool down. A shield that is going to stay 60 seconds for the majority if not, all of lane phase. 60 damage it block which equates to one auto. AP top laners deals a lot more than 60 damage per spell. Especially when Shen has no MR gains, its just going to get worse for him as time goes on when get bullied out of lanes.\n\nAnd also, those said majority of nerfs happened in season 1. A lot, I mean a lot of things changed during season one. \n\n>Because neither of them can gank bot lane while pushing top lane.\n\nWhat is teleport? You could say that Shen could take teleport as well to go back top and take tower. Then you would find out that Shen is one of the slowest top lane splitpushers to date. Its going to take Shen an obscenely long time to take it down assuming if its not already at low health. Not to mention his clear wave is minuscule compared to others without Sunfire.\n\nAnd no, he doesnt have to be too strong or too weak. If Riot really believes these suggested changes will make him too strong then I would say to put it on PBE and see what happens. There has been a very obvious power creep going on the last couple years and no one would deny that. During that powercreep, Shen fell behind hard over a lot more favorable champions and there is a reason for that too.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Graves III","date":"2015-02-11T18:27:30.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Shen an obscenely long time to take it down assuming if its not already at low health.

And yet, because of the proven power of shens ult, everything else in the kit was nerfed till its junk (and he was STILL good for a long time).\n\n>Didnt meaning is past tense right? So what about present tense? Why does Shen and Singed have no MR gains while other tanks like Renekton and Mundo does?\n\nBecause Renekton didn't gank bot lane while  you were at tower, then still be back in time to fight you.\n\nShen doesn't get to have nice things. This is because shen has shen ult. His W and Q used to be plenty strong. Same with his passive. All nerfed to keep the damn ult.\n\nAs for the champs he competes against as a top lane pick, you can say he is outclassed by newer champs like Elise Gnar and what not, but its a little unfair to just say he is bad because he is old. \nRyze is older than shen, and Rumble's kit is older than shens current kit.\nShen's problems all stem from his stupid ult being so strong it disallows them from making shen otherwise good. When shen can potentially turn any 1v1 into a 2v1, they had to remove his ability to actually be strong in a 1v1. What are shens weaknesses? He has high downtime when you miss his E, and he sucks. When a champs weakness has to be, \"He sucks\", something needs done to the kit. Mark my words. Shens kit will never ever be fun, and satisfying, and viable, as long as he is allowed to have his ult in its current form.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ExecutorDill","date":"2014-12-17T16:39:55.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly speaking, although I love shen and wish he was God Tier xD Having no Mr per lvl is understandable as every champ needs a weakness, the tricky thing is some weaknesses are brighter to see than others. Yas neither gets Mr per lvl and this is understandable because shen and yasuo do not run on mana like most tanks and fighters do. Plus logically speaking, an average ninja and samurai wouldn't really know how to defend against magic *(don't ask about Yi,  Zed, Alkali or Kennen :P)*\n\nThough Yas is in a better position of defending himself against magic due to his almost infinite mobility with E, a passive shield that regenerates faster because of this mobility and the infamous wind wall that fully negates all projectiles for it's duration.\n\nThe way too maximize your shen is not to build full tank (they actually die more than assaains). Bruiser is better but for Shem is still weak.\n\nYou have to get 3 key components early to mid game. Then build up your defense/offense mid game for a great outcome. These components are max CDR, lots of attack speed and great movement speed.\n\nGo for these items in this order: Frozen Heart, Zephyr, boots of speed, [Spirit Visage] depending on enemy team comp), randuins omen.
