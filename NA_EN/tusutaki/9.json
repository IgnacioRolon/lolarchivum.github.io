They nerfed Sunfire to scale with your level so you can have the same amount of damage at level 15 while slightly stronger at lvl 18. But when you achieve lvl 18 it becomes late game and by late game, it falls off kinda hard as there are other items that are better suited. So these are some small changes I would propose.\n----------------------------------------------\nSunfire Cape\nStats\n+450 health\n+45 armor\nPassive\tUnique passive: Deals~~ ***20 + (1% of max hp)***~~*** 8  + (1.5% of max hp)*** magic damage per second to nearby enemies (400 range).\n\n*Credit goes to junglerboy16 for the new and better formula.*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThis would keep essentially the same early and mid game pressure while buffing the late game potential.

With you design, his Cape would deal between 36 and 38 DPS at first purchase, which is about as much as it was pre nerf (which is not good, since the point is to buff it late game). With my idea for scaling, it would deal between 35 and 37 DPS. This seems like a small difference, but for comparison, the current sunfire deals between 28 and 30 DPS, but maxes out at only 42. Your example, assuming about 4K health (which is a general ballpark for a late game bruiser/tank) would deal 60 DPS, mine would deal 75 DPS, and the live one only deals 42 regardless. To be honest, I think my suggestion would do better at something more like 8 base damage +1.5%, so that it would scale best off of health, but get closer to the damage they want for an early rush item (between 32 and 35 damage if rushed), but scaling up to around 68 DPS at the 4K hp late game average.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-02-11T04:57:41.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see and I actually like your formula as it better and smoothly scales.

It isn't really invisible because it is noticeable. It is a completely deliberate action to buy an item, so the effect thereof is not invisible; it is deliberate and noticeable. \n\n Tiamat / Hydra are supposed to function in the same manner that Sunfire Cape is, I believe, as it is most likely in the greatest interest for those who buy Tiamat / Hydra to auto-attack, so it really is a pushing tool, because it is their job to auto attack. Saying that you can \"gate your total output AoE damage\" while last hitting by not auto-attacking doesn't make as much sense because you will still deal the same amount to the minions around (unless you position yourself in a way to minimize AoE). In that sense, because Tiamat / Hydra is a pushing tool that is very powerful (has +75 AD), why shouldn't Sunfire Cape? The risk should be something to be rewarded, because pushing a wave is a very powerful and risky element, and, as such, shouldn't every tool concerning wave pushing be as well?\n\nSimply my two cents.","replies":[{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2015-02-12T02:28:30.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The difference between Burnout and Sunfire Cape is that you actively see the Burnout dealing damage, but you don't see the same thing with Sunfire Cape. However, this makes sense because Burnout has a duration and Sunfire permanent with Sunfire Cape.\n\nJust because it is a deliberate action to buy an item doesn't mean that the effect is visible. The opponent doesn't really see themselves taking damage from Sunfire because Sunfire is on such a weak DoT, and by that definition it has invisible power, just like a lot of the other auras in the game, like Zilean's passive exp boost or Janna's passive ms boost, which are still weak, but still functions as invisible power.\n\nTiamat/Hydra is, in fact, a pushing tool, but with that item you can control how fast you push. You can't do that with Sunfire Cape without losing CS. And you can position yourself to minimize AoE so you can keep the minion wave from pushing too hard, just as you can auto attack more to push faster. The risk and reward are things you can play around with the Cleave passive, because the greater risk you take, the greater reward you have. With Sunfire Cape, the risk is there, but the reward is not because you cannot push with Sunfire Cape. It just gives some AoE damage that helps you push the lane, but doesn't allow you to push down towers unless you are so tanky that you can effortlessly tank damage from both the enemy turret and the enemy champ and still push the tower.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-02-10T01:59:45.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think having a potential turret aggro and pushing minion wave is a good pay off for having a decent AoE damage.

It's an incredibly effective item on anyone who stacks magic penetration, because the item damage scales with your magic penetration. For an example, my Alistar build reaches 3500 health end game with 38 mpen, 41% mpen, and 20 magic reduction. On a squishy target, it *will* deal full damage. 20 + (1% of one's current health) is easily 55 magic damage. That's a huge buff for anyone building a moderate amount of health.\n\nOn a full tank Sion who reaches 7000 health late game, Sunfire would deal 90 magic damage. For giggles, let's say he's fighting a target with no scaling magic resistance at all. Damage is only reduced by the 30 base magic resist. That's about a 25% damage reduction. That's 68 damage to an adc. Even on a target who has built at least one magic resistance item with scaling magic resistance glyphs and growth (100+ mr), it would still only deal about 40 damage.\n\nBoth of these champions are incredibly difficult to kill in a team fight. Let's say that these two champions are on the same team. They both manage to lock down an entire team with their aoe cc for five seconds total. Sion would deal 450 magic damage (2250 to the team total) and Alistar would have dealt 275 (1375 total) magic damage. That's a lot of damage to give a champion who has built full tank. This is not a low aoe damage threat. Sion would burn down entire teams, and be very difficult to take down.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-02-10T17:00:42.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">On a full tank Sion who reaches 7000 health late game\n\nYeah no unless you are farming for hours and against bots.

I may have been thinking of season 4 tank jungle Sion. To have Sion's passive generate 700 bonus health is not uncommon. I usually reach that point at thirty minutes in a good game. If I factor in the extra health from Juggernaut (5384 + 162 = 5546), 1% of his maximum health would be about 55, making Sunfire deal 75. To the entire team, that's 375 damage per second to the entire team. I gave you a realistic number. Factor it in.\n\nIn a team fight, it's not uncommon to be able to lock down two or three champions and the other champions either attempt to peel or dive the enemy team. That allows for Sunfire to deal damage to the entire enemy team. I have now given you a realistic scenario.\n\nI stand by what I said. That's a lot of damage to give a full tank who does not die easily. By making the damage scale off of current health, it adds a new layer of complexity and depth to team fights for tanks.
