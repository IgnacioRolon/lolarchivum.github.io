An item that needs to be addressed STILL","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":116,"down_votes":8,"body":"&gt; Stats\n&gt; +80 health\n&gt; +6 health regen per 5 seconds\n&gt; Passive\n&gt; Unique: Blocks 8 damage from single target attacks and spells from champions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Doran&#039;s Shield. An early defensive version of the Doran&#039;s items. However, it absolutely fails in the defensive apartment. From other starting items like Flask, Cloth, or Ruby + pots, there is absolutely no reason to buy a Doran&#039;s Shield. Even on manaless champions. Flask gives you 450 health and 150 mana in 36 seconds. Ruby + 2 gives you 450 health with a faster power spike of obtaining Sunfire for example. Cloth + 4 gives you 600 + 15 more armor and also allows you to power spike faster. Doran&#039;s Shield + 1? Measly 230 health with 1.2hp per sec. You might be saying to yourself &quot;But the passive! It blocks 8 damage!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This is one of the biggest issues I want to bring up. The passive, blocking only single target attacks and spells, blocking 8 damage. That doesnt sound so bad right? Well considering the fact that it blocks 8 damage BEFORE resistances apply. Lets put it like this for example.\n&gt; \n&gt; 100 ad vs 100 armor\n&gt; 100 armor = 50% dmg reduction\n&gt; 50 damage is taken\n&gt; \n&gt; VS\n&gt; \n&gt; 100 ad vs 100 armor + Doran&#039;s Shield passive\n&gt; 100 - 8 = 92\n&gt; 50% of 92 is 46\n&gt; 46 Damage is taken\n&gt; \n&gt; Out of all of the Doran&#039;s items, Shield is the only one that loses it&#039;s value the longer the game goes. Or the more you gain armor to put it simply. Whereas Blade&#039;s 3% lifesteal can be stacked with other lifesteal items and can be used in conjunction with other AD items and Ring has a flat Mana Regen and it&#039;s passive, Shield fails in comparison. Also note that Shield also blocks only autos and targeted damage, meaning AOE damage like Pantheon&#039;s E gets a free ticket.\n&gt; \n&gt; So why has this item been ignored for so long? Note that this item didnt even block targeted spell damage for the longest item either. Shield has been a glorified noob trap item for over a year. So what needs to be fixed then? Simple. Have it block 8 damage AFTER resistances and maybe half of that from AOE attacks. Make it actually worth spending 460 gold. Or buff the health regen. Or something! Otherwise there&#039;s absolutely no reason to buy it. Not when there are other, better options around.\n\nI raised this concern last year and with the introduction to S6, its still in the same terrible spot.\n\nFor those that is going to complain about why im using 100 dmg/armor as an example, because some has in previous threads for some reason, i'll even go further using starting average armor for top laners. Assuming 25 armor is the average. Using 100 damage because majority of single target abilities deals 100 damage or as close as possible.\n\nDorans Shield start (-8 damage from autos and targeted abilities)\n100-8 = 92\n92/(100+25) = 73 damage\n\nCloth Start (+15 armor)\n100 damage\n100/(100+40) = 71 damage\n\n\"But muh autos!\"\nAssuming 70 dmg is the average for autos thats including AD runes\n\nDorans Shield Start\n70-8\n62/(100+25) = 49 damage\n\nCloth Start\n70/(100+40) = 50 damage\n\nSo in mathematical conclusion, Dorans Shield is terrible in every way. With literally a one damage difference for autos where Shield is better. So the only literal way for Shield to outperform cloth start is if they deal less than 70 damage in both autos and abilities which almost never happens and if it does, Shield drops off within the first couple levels. Using 50 damage the difference becomes 2. How clear do I have to make it that Shield needs to be addressed?","replies":[{"poster":"MrWasjig","date":"2015-11-19T13:10:21.452+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"Whenever I'm against someone where Doran's Shield would SEEM like a good idea, I take Cloth in it's place. \nShield is just really MEH right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-11-19T13:24:11.731+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrWasjig,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fnZLEkEF,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-11-19T13:10:21.452+0000)\n>\n> Whenever I'm against someone where Doran's Shield would SEEM like a good idea, I take Cloth in it's place. \n> Shield is just really MEH right now.\n\nbecause you sacrifice the sustain.\n\ndorans blade has lifesteal\ndorans ring costs 400 gold, leaving enough gold for 2 pots\n\nthe defense off dorans shield + the sustain off 1 pot cant compare to the equivalent of what youre getting from cloth + 5 pots. even against ap champs.\n\n\nmaybe another route would be to add a mini malphite shield to the item that regenerates after 10 seconds out of combat. something small like 50 hp. and increasing the base hp to 100 from 80 instead of the 8 blocked damage.\n\nthis would make the item equally useful against ap champions and ranged poke in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-11-19T22:11:39.978+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like that passive from the old Defense mastery tree?","replies":[{"poster":"LordKentravyon","date":"2015-11-20T00:16:25.789+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya it sounds like that, except not trash","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"venomous frost","date":"2015-11-19T16:58:59.550+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"its fine if you are melee vs oppressive ranged, also, why would you calculate the damage reduction 100 armor vs 100 ad, when you have like 30armor and 60ad level 1, the shield is supposed to defend you the first couple of levels. your calculation makes no sense.\n\nalso, how can you say 3% LS is better, you take shield when you are planning on getting dominated early levels, LS wont help when all you can do is lasthit under tower.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2015-11-19T21:25:38.084+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dorans shield\n\n4000 gold\n800 health\n600% hp regen\nBlocks 80 damage from any source after resistances","replies":[{"poster":"OneSmoothDude","date":"2015-11-20T15:45:20.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doran was a badass motherfucker.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-11-19T18:21:18.293+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Doran's shield does have 1 thing going for it over Cloth 4.

All those extra potions that come with the Cloth 4 don't mean shit if you die while they're healing you or have to disengage and take a bunch of free damage every trade. This is especially relevant now that ignite top lane is becoming popular again.

Meaning in reality, the more resistances you have, the less value you get from shield. That 8 blocked damage becomes 5 or less and becomes less the longer the game goes.","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-11-19T19:37:14.013+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"It's not about the healing, it's about taking less damage in trades. Let's say you're laning against a Yasuo, as my lane opponents often are. All of Yasuo's damage is single target, meaning 8 less damage every single time I hit you, whether it's with an auto, Q, or an E. During an extended trade, shield can block upwards of 40-50 damage, which, if you're trading back, is an extremely significant amount of health. Taking less damage is preferable to sustain in every possible situation, which is why Nasus builds more defense instead of a {{item:3072}} even though the item is theoretically amazing on him since his Q stacks apply to lifesteal. Given how much damage minions do early game, being able to stand your ground in early trades without fear of being all inned and dying is an enormous advantage and completely changes how you can play the lane. Yes, cloth 4 does tend to give you more sustain overall compared to shield. But shield gives you far more control over the lane since you can actually afford to stand and fight. Cloth 4 doesn't do shit if I can just force you off your minion wave with the threat of an all in every time you try to CS.\n\nNot coincidentally, the fact that taking less damage in trades is so powerful early game is largely why longsword 3 pot is such a bad item start in most situations. It gives you no sustain whenever you aren't chugging a potion, gives you no defense against your laner or minion aggro, gives you no extra health for an early all in, and all for only a measly 2 AD over Doran's shield. Every team I see a Renekton or Garen start longsword against someone who isn't a pushover, I know they're gonna get rekt. Literally the only time longsword 3 pot is a good start is if the enemy laner can't possibly beat you early and you just want a tiny bit of extra damage.
