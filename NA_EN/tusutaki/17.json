I&#039;ll seperate these into sections.\r\n\r\nBond of Stone \r\nHas such a marginal impact that you dont even know if its doing anything at all. Where in an average of a 30min game, you&#039;ll be lucky if it redirects even 500 damage total. That is an average of 16 damage blocked per minute. And the initial of 4% damage reduction for yourself is also non existent where it can be taken out of the game without anyone noticing the changes. \r\n\r\nGrasp of Undying\r\nIt had it&#039;s  limelight when it both dealt and healed for 3% of your maximum health. Yes it was strong for it&#039;s time but with the introduction of Courage, it marginalizes it&#039;s purpose. Grasp was supposed to help tanks sustain throughout the lane phase and help those who lacked in damage. However nerfing that sustain away makes Courage all the more valuable.\r\n\r\n In what circumstance would I ever want to choose Grasp or Bond over Courage? Is the issue that Courage is too strong or that the formers are too weak? Because I will be honest, I almost never used Grasp or Bond even before Courage came into play.

Riot tuned over several patches, and it became strong on LITERALLY EVERY CHAMP.

The other tank masteries feel much more satisfying and there isn't really any champion that couldn't run one of the others. In my opinion we need some tank jgl mastery, as it is right now tank junglers take some mastery they don't really use most of the time in the early game, which isn't exactly satisfying either. Maybe a damage reflection mastery that works on monsters?

If you change Grasp to purely sustain then you might as well just give CoC to everyone because then their roles overlap a lot.  They both just help to reduce the damage you take in different ways.\n\nI prefer Grasp as a damage mastery for the type of champions who simply want more damage and not yet another way to be tanky.  Otherwise if Grasp is going to heal you for 400 or CoC is going to shield you for 500+ (especially when multiple people are around and you get off your CC) then why ever take Grasp unless you absolutely cannot take CoC?  \n\nThen that brings us back around to the exact same problem we already having.  So, you have to differentiate them somehow, and the only thing that separates Grasp is the damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Z Statistic","date":"2016-12-22T04:43:25.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"K\n\nStrength of the Titan\nCourage of the Colossus\nHeroism of the Valkyries\n\nStrength of the Titan - Your spells that damage an enemy emit a shockwave from your champion, dealing 10% of your max health as physical damage and slows them for 25% for 2 seconds. 30 second cooldown\n\nCoC - same\n\nHeroism of the Valkyries - Afflicting an enemy champion with hard crowd control causes you and your nearby allies to gain 15% movement speed when moving towards your opponent for 3 seconds. 60 second cooldown.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rivuo","date":"2016-12-21T18:45:11.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They nerfed Grasp because ranged champs were abusing it which i found funny as fuck considering that mastery is supposed to be for melee champs to sustain against ranged champs.","replies":[{"poster":"PermabannedGaren","date":"2016-12-21T19:50:41.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ApexCH,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cOR58TTZ,comment-id=0010,timestamp=2016-12-21T18:45:11.091+0000)\n>\n> They nerfed Grasp because ranged champs were abusing it\n\nLol?

Where in an average of a 30min game, you'll be lucky if it redirects even 500 damage total. That is an average of 16 damage blocked per minute. And the initial of 4% damage reduction for yourself is also non existent where it can be taken out of the game without anyone noticing the changes.\n\nThe issue is that it's also very hard to appreciate. It's hard to notice 6%. Honestly, both of them feel weird. Wasn't {{item:3105}} stripped of its aura because auras were hard to appreciate? Knight's Vow and Bond of Stone both do something similar to an aura: an always-on effect (on a target) that's difficult to gauge what the range is and difficult to appreciate just how much mitigation it's doing for you.\n\nColossus is big and appreciable, you immediately see how much it does for you. Grasp is/was OK and when solo laning you could really notice it, but Bond of Stone could really stand to be an \"alternate\" keystone for (tank-oriented) Supports who can't use Windspeaker's Blessing and aren't a damage-oriented Support.\n\nTaric for example. What does he pick? Colossus because he has a (slightly unreliable) stun? Windspeaker for his W shield and Q heal? Bond of Stone? None of them are really amazing for Taric. He just picks \"the best from what's available\", but not \"something that really augments my playstyle.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2016-12-21T21:10:19.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"When deciding between Grasp of the Undying or Courage of the Colossus the only thing you need to ask yourself is if your champion has hard CC lmao","replies":[]}]}
