An item that needs to be addressed STILL!!","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"&gt; Stats\r\n&gt; +80 health\r\n&gt; +6 health regen per 5 seconds\r\n&gt; Passive\r\n&gt; Unique: Blocks 8 damage from single target attacks and spells from champions.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Doran&#039;s Shield. An early defensive version of the Doran&#039;s items. However, it absolutely fails in the defensive apartment. From other starting items like Flask, Cloth, or Ruby + pots, there is absolutely no reason to buy a Doran&#039;s Shield. Even on manaless champions. Flask gives you 450 health and 150 mana in 36 seconds with added true damage. Ruby + 2 gives you 450 health with a faster power spike of obtaining Sunfire for example. Cloth + 4 gives you 600 + 15 more armor and also allows you to power spike faster. Doran&#039;s Shield + 1? Measly 230 health with 1.2hp per sec. You might be saying to yourself &quot;But the passive! It blocks 8 damage!&quot;\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; This is one of the biggest issues I want to bring up. The passive, blocking only single target attacks and spells, blocking 8 damage. That doesnt sound so bad right? Well considering the fact that it blocks 8 damage BEFORE resistances apply. Lets put it like this for example.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; 100 dmg vs 100 armor\r\n&gt; 100 armor = 50% dmg reduction\r\n&gt; 50 damage is taken\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; VS\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; 100 dmg vs 100 armor + Doran&#039;s Shield passive\r\n&gt; 100 - 8 = 92\r\n&gt; 50% of 92 is 46\r\n&gt; 46 Damage is taken\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Out of all of the Doran&#039;s items, Shield is the only one that loses it&#039;s value the longer the game goes. Or the more you gain armor to put it simply. Whereas Blade&#039;s 3% lifesteal can be stacked with other lifesteal items and can be used in conjunction with other AD items and Ring has a flat Mana Regen with it&#039;s passive, Shield fails in comparison. Also note that Shield also blocks only autos and targeted damage, meaning AOE damage like Pantheon&#039;s E gets a free ticket.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; So why has this item been ignored for so long? Note that this item didnt even block targeted spell damage for the longest item either. Shield has been a glorified noob trap item for over a year. So what needs to be fixed then? Simple. Have it block 8 damage AFTER resistances and maybe half of that from AOE attacks. Make it actually worth spending 450 gold. Or buff the health regen. Or something! Otherwise there&#039;s absolutely no reason to buy it. Not when there are other, better options around.\r\n\r\nI raised this concern last year and in the at the start of S6, its still in the same terrible spot.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those that is going to complain about why im using 100 dmg/armor as an example, because some has in previous threads for some reason, i&#039;ll even go further using starting average armor for top laners. Assuming 25 armor is the average. Using 100 damage because majority of single target abilities deals 100 damage or as close as possible.\r\n\r\nDorans Shield start (-8 damage from autos and targeted abilities)\r\n100-8 = 92\r\n92/(100+25) = 73 damage\r\n\r\nCloth Start (+15 armor)\r\n100 damage\r\n100/(100+40) = 71 damage\r\n\r\n&quot;But muh autos!&quot;\r\nAssuming 70 dmg is the average for autos thats including AD runes\r\n\r\nDorans Shield Start\r\n70-8\r\n62/(100+25) = 49 damage\r\n\r\nCloth Start\r\n70/(100+40) = 50 damage\r\n\r\nSo in mathematical conclusion, Dorans Shield is terrible in every way. With literally a one damage difference for autos where Shield is better. So the only literal way for Shield to outperform cloth start is if they deal less than 70 damage in both autos and abilities which almost never happens and if it does, Shield drops off within the first couple levels.  Using 50 damage the difference becomes 2. How clear do I have to make it that Shield needs to be addressed?","replies":[]}
