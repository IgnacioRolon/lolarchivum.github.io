They deserve the amount of threads for making this completely idiotic statement \n\n    >We&rsquo;ve heard a number of player requests for a Sandbox Mode, with two main reasons: the first is trying out new content &ndash; which is something we value too. We want players to know what they&rsquo;re getting and to be happy with the things they&rsquo;re unlocking (we may investigate other ways to do this). The second is that players want to practice very specific skills without the constraints of a regular game. For this point, our stance is that sandbox mode is not the way to go. We want to make sure we&rsquo;re clear: playing games of League of Legends should be the unequivocal best way for a player to improve. While there are very real skills one can develop in a hyperbolic time chamber, we never want that to be an expectation added onto an already high barrier to entry. On an individual level, we know this isn&rsquo;t always true &ndash; some just want a space to practice flashing over walls without having to wait at least 3.6 minutes in between &ndash; but when that benefit is weighed against the risk of Sandbox mode &lsquo;grinding&rsquo; becoming an expectation, we just can&rsquo;t accept the tradeoff. We never want to see a day when a player wants to improve at League and their first obligation is to hop into a Sandbox. We do want to support your ability to grow in mastery, and there may be other avenues to do so, but not this.\n\n\n\n    >We never want to see a day when a player wants to improve at League and their first obligation is to hop into a Sandbox.\n\n    >We never want to see a day when a player wants to improve at League and hop into a Sandbox.\n\n    >We never want to see a day when a player wants to improve and hop into a Sandbox.\n\n    >We never want to see a player improve and hop into a Sandbox.\n\n    >We do want to support your ability to grow in mastery, but not this.\n\n\n\nLet alone the fact that they literally have the capability and the fact that THEY USE IT WHEN SHOWCASING CHAMPIONS VIA CHAMPION SPOTLIGHT.\n\nTheir statement alone deserves the blacklash they&#039;re receiving.  But hey, if you dont want people to feel obligated to play a mode, then why do you force players to be level 30 to play ranked? :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-08-06T09:55:25.805+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"theyre saying they dont want to create pressure on new players from the community to \"go back to the sandbox\" and practise, but rahter practise in a real game environment.\n\ni think there are 2 problems with this argument. there already exists massive pressure to perform for new players mostly through toxic smurphs who will belittle even absolute newcomers on low levels for making any mistake.\n\n- a sandbox mode might actually give players who bring friends into the game a more relaxed environment to teach them some basic mechanics.\n\n- it would also be incredibly useful for experienced players to use the mode to test out the impact of certain changes to champions and game mechanics. especially since the champion documentation for experienced players is usually done extremely poorly by riot. the in client descriptiosn to abilities are all but useless past the most basic information. and even the champion pages on the homepage are missing crucial information.\n\n- it would cut down the time it would test out a new item or item build on the same champion. ive had situations, where i wanted to test an items mechanic and had to afk farm for like 10 minutes just to get said item.\n\n- a sandbox mode might actually be a platform to spawn new gamemodes as people would have more freedom to customize individual games.","replies":[]}]}
