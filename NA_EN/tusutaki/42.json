The only support items for melee tanks like Leona have is Knights Vow. While the item of itself is decent, its practically the only one they have. Especially compared to all of the support items there is for &quot;Enchanters&quot; like Ardent Censer, Athenes, Mikaels, and Zekes. \r\n\r\nAnd this got me thinking as to why ranged supports is so big right now, because they have so many options combined with the amount of synergy they have. \r\n\r\nOne might argue that Stonebound helps melee supports but thats a Keystone, I want to talk about items here.\r\n\r\nI personally would like to see more items that pairs with other champions and for the love of god please rework Banner of Command and Zeke Harbinger. Like have Zeke work the opposite of Knight&#039;s Vow where 12% of your physical damage or basics attacks to champions heals your paired ally. For Banner of Command, if you want to keep it minion focused, change the active where you can mark enemy champs and all of your non super minions within range will attack said target. \r\n\r\nThose are just my thoughts though. What are yours?","replies":[{"poster":"BALDG1VEN BOOMER","date":"2017-03-30T21:45:57.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to mentioned how bad Relic Shield is, 15 health for walk up and executing a minion the more poke you take by doing that just makes the trade bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2017-03-31T20:41:09.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesnt help that it the heal nerfed a bunch of times.\n\n> V6.18\n> Spoils of War heal reduced to 15 from 20.\n> V6.13\n> Minion execute increased to 200 - 285 (based on level) health from 200 health.\n> V6.9\n> Charge cooldown reduced to 40 seconds from 60 seconds\n> Healing per charge reduced to 20 health from 40 health\n\nIt would be neat to see the Targon series' heal be scaled from your health. Like heal your ally for 2.5/3.0/3.5% of your max health. And for Face of the Mountain they should give an aura that gives allied champs Spoils of War, allowing them to execute minions themselves and consumes a charge on you. Hope im making sense. I suggest this because late game or even after lane phase, you wont be procing Spoils of War much so your gold production drastically slows down compared to Talisman.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"khorney","date":"2017-03-30T19:56:34.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"banner is trash and i never build it ever becuase there is something better to build and it is not a supp item as you have stated, all you really have is knights vow","replies":[]}]}
