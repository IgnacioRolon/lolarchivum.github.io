There was no reason to nerf Warwick himself as in the jungle, he is heavily reliant on the blue buff and heavily vulnerable to counter jungle and counter ganks. \n\nIf the reason was because of jungle in its present state and how Warwick and self sustain junglers can comfortably jungle compared to the others, then thats a jungle problem that didnt allow much diversity compared to the old version.","replies":[{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2014-12-11T10:01:21.798+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Almost all of this is wrong.  Warwick became a monster because of a lot of things, not just Devourer.  Skirisher is scary on him by itself, as his ult automatically procs it 5 times.  It also procs devourer five times, so that item alone pretty much tripled the damage of his ult.  The ult that is ranged, targeted and comes with a fairly long suppress as well.  It was fine when it was JUST a lockdown, but the new items made it HURT.  A LOT.\n\nThat however, is not the only reason WW took one on the chin.  Old jungle warwick had strengths and flaws.  He had a lot of sustain, and stayed at full health in the jungle because of it.  He also scaled REALLY well, and was very, VERY simple to play.  He's point and click easy.  His weaknesses where his sub-par ganks pre-6, his vulnerability to being kited, and the fact that he takes a while to farm up into a late-game powerhouse.\n\nBut the new jungle diminished a lot of those flaws by hitting his rival junglers HARD.  Non-sustained junglers often get forced to B early... after three or four camps sometimes.  Warwick's sustain keeps him from having to do this.  That lack of lost time lets him get well ahead of the enemy jungler in level and gold.  This makes him VERY risky to invade, as he is probably higher leveled than you AND has very high health while clearing.  It also means he probably hits his \"sweet spot\" of level 6 before the enemy jungler.  Few junglers have the health to gank early now anyways, so warwick's lack of aid for his lanes before he's level 6 matters less.  The enemy junglers can rarely pressure his lanes hard while he's still busy farming.  Now realize that failed ganks are FAR more punishing to junglers.  Did Lee Sin wander top at level 3 and get seen by a ward?  Well that wasted time hurts junglers more now than it did before.  Sure, if you're good you can land an early lane kill still, but it's a risk.  Warwick isn't a risk.  Farm and you're scary.  By one item and you do crazy damage with your ult.  You can't miss your ult.  He's idiot proof.\n\nSo yeah, WW needed a nerf.  It's not just that he has insane synergy with one item, it's the fact that the new jungle invalidates a lot of his former flaws and it's biggest demands are the things he's strongest at.  He lost a lot of his weak spots, leaving only a big, tanky monster that is insanely simple to play.  Even with the nerf, he'll still be permaban for me.  He's too safe, too simple and too scary if he's not put in his place... which is really hard to do now with how punishing the new jungle is.  He could take another nerf and stay strong to be honest.  You should pick WW because he's very safe in the clearing and scary is left to farm.   He shouldn't do assassin-level damage on a targeted ability just because he bought a single item.

Warwick's level 6 ganks are much easier and more effective than many other champions, and there isn't anything that makes him any easier to avoid.\n\n>just because he is easy to play doesn't mean he needs a nerf\n\nWhile this is technically true, it doesn't tell the whole story. Warwick has a massive amount of value tied up in a mechanic that you can't really avoid. If he gets in range of me (and he doesn't have a miserably hard time doing so), there isn't much I can do to stop his ultimate from screwing me. I can't cancel it without a teammate, I can't stop the damage at all no matter what, I can't do anything to outplay him. His ult has all his value, and his ult has very, very little counterplay. That's something that does necessitate that he not be the strongest champion in the game.\n\nWarwick was reasonably powerful before the jungle changes, and then every change in the jungle favored him, even the changes that hurt his opponents. Itemization alone wasn't making Warwick ridiculous. The new jungle is helping out a lot there.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2014-12-11T23:17:25.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's true they did buff many of the mana regen items, so maybe he isn't as blue reliant as he used to be. \n\nthe jungle creeps spawn at 1:55 + a full jungle roation of gromp, blue, wolves, wraiths, lizzard, golems will easily take you 4 min + 45 sec recall to buy and get back to a lane + 20 seconds to gank + 20 sec walking time back to his blue = 7:20. i suppose he cleared it second after gromp so it will respawn shortly but compare that to other junglers who don't have to power farm to get to level 6 to gank reasonably (which warwick still isn't at this point as long as he didn't leach too much xp off of the lane he ganked) then he's only got in one gank to other junglers 2 or 3. the other junglers don't need as much farm to gank successfully, meaning that warwicks lack of early pressure does still cost him. \n\n> This applies to any jungler and any gank\n\nwell, that was my point. you claimed (correct me if i'm wrong) that compared to other junglers warwick's ganking was risk free, but i think that a failed gank carries more risk for him as it does for other junglers because he is so reliant on farm to get to lv6 quickly.\n\nas far as avoiding warwick, he's immobile so he is prone to kiting, qss and tenacity work against his ult, if he has nothing to life steal off of then he isn't super tanky, he is prone to hard cc, etc... he is not the strongest champion in the game and does have counterplay. \n\nthe new jungle may have helped warwick out in certain ways, but i think the nerf to his w was overkill. they almost halved it's duration which extremely slows his jungle clear speed and hurts his lifesteal ability and almost ruins his team fight potential.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2014-12-11T23:43:08.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">that's true they did buff many of the mana regen items, so maybe he isn't as blue reliant as he used to be. \n\nMachette regen is perfectly fine for keeping him 100% mana sustained. You'll need blue if you want to teamfight early, but you can farm endlessly at almost full mana.

However, I don't quite agree with you on him having more risk. There are two things I disagree with you on. The first thing is that Warwick doesn't have to gank pre-6. The increased risk for junglers in general means that gank pressure in general is lowered nowadays, giving him more room to farm freely to 6. Secondly, and more importantly, the low-risk factor was almost certainly referring to level 6, when his ganks are extremely low risk. He walks up, presses R to gapclose, and usually kills the person, and there is no dodging his ult except by seeing it coming, which can work against anyone. As far as ganks go, his level 6 ganks are about as low-risk as it gets.\n\n>he's immobile so he is prone to kiting, qss and tenacity work against his ult\n\nImmobility is only something that happens after he jumps onto you, and his ultimate still does quite a bit of damage. As for QSS and tenacity, there are two things you should know. First, tenacity does not work on his ult. It does nothing against him. His ultimate is a suppression, and the key aspect of a suppression is that it can not be reduced in any way, shape or form except by disrupting the channel. QSS can disrupt the channel, but it can not actually stop the damage. Warwick's ultimate will always do full damage, which not only gives a substantial amount of burst, but usually lowers an enemy enough for his E to trigger.\n\nSo, while Warwick does have some counterplay, the element of his kit which contains by far the majority of his power has very little counterplay.\n\n>the new jungle may have helped warwick out in certain ways, but i think the nerf to his w was overkill. they almost halved it's duration which extremely slows his jungle clear speed and hurts his lifesteal ability and almost ruins his team fight potential.\n\nI don't think it was overkill. Warwick was helped by almost all of the elements of the new jungle while most other junglers were harmed in some way. Even without devourer and skirmisher, he was significantly stronger than he was in season 4. Something had to give, and the speed of his clearing was a good place to hit. I don't think that this was an overnerf. I think we'll find that he will go down to the top 10-20 winrate bracket.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2014-12-12T00:34:22.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I wasn't the one who wrote the first couple things you responded to, so I didn't claim anything.\n\nmy mistake :) \n\nhis post-6 ganks are certainly lower risk, i agree with you. but his pre-6 ganks are greater risk, and i think those can be the most important in the game. \n\ni just checked the lol wicki and it says \"Tenacity grants the user 35% crowd control reduction.\" but now that i think about it there are forms of cc that it doesn't effect, ww ult might be one of them. \n\nQSS still works though and while it doesn't stop the damage, it does remove the cc effect for you but it does not remove the cc effect on ww. that means that when he ults you as long as the damage doesn't kill you you have a few seconds to get away before he can follow up. \n\nww does have a little counter play, and i think it would have been prudent for them to shift his power from his ult to his other abilities, but they also strongly nerfed his w which i think was unnecessary. so i guess agree to disagree but my guess is that he will fall substantially lower than the top 10-20 winrate bracket.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2014-12-12T01:30:20.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">but now that i think about it there are forms of cc that it doesn't effect, ww ult might be one of them. \n\nIt absolutely is unaffected. The unaffected forms of crowd control are knockups and suppression. Suppression are Skarner ult, Warwick ult, Malz ult, and Urgot ult. You also can't use any summoner spells while you are suppressed, so no barrier, heal, or even smite (useful when contesting baron/dragon).\n\n>ww does have a little counter play,\n\nEverything has a little.

This effect will end upon hitting enemy champion or minions.* So he can keep it up for another 4 seconds while jungling but not while laning or ganking.  \n\nThe ult nerf i felt was fair, the main point of his Ult is to hold an enemy in place not really to instaburst them.   \n\nI agree with nerfing him AND the Devourer and Skirmisher items because they were really only overpowered on WW, not so much on other junglers so nerfing only them would still leave WW at the top of the jungle food chain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2014-12-11T18:31:23.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a knee jerk reaction.  -15 starting Devourer stacks and no other changes would still make Warwick obviously the best jungler.\n\nThe design shift from \"you have to be good at ganking at 3\" to \"sustain matters, gank less, farm more\" is a huge boon for Warwick, who was already average to good in the old jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sarthero","date":"2014-12-11T18:28:37.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should have nerfed how his ult interacted with skirmishers smite.
