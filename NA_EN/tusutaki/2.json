We get that it&#039;s supposed to be for really quick in and out trades for three autos but then you have Lethal Tempo that was designed almost under the same fashion. There is no practical reason for Hail of Blades to exist when its objectively a worse version of Tempo. \r\n\r\nSure, Tempo has a 1.5 start up but it can be proced by any forms of damage and even then, it doesnt have the limitation to just 3 autos. Nor does it have the restriction of needing to be 5 seconds out of combat inorder to be refreshed like Hails does. Not out of combat with champions, out of combat in general. That is a pretty big restriction compared to Tempo&#039;s generic 6 second cooldown.\r\n\r\nEven with the buffs to Hails in the PBE there is no reason for any champion to take it over Tempo. If anything, the only champion that I can remotely think of that would consider using this would be Jhin depending how it interacts with his passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Zeppelins circus","date":"2018-06-11T03:12:20.019+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh top with stormrazors.

I've tested it with Diana and it's quite good if the enemy literally stands still, but if they kite back then you simply do not have enough time after your first attack to really do anything with the rune. It doesn't really help that on champions with low base AS that this rune sees even less returns and actually is clunky in the game.\n\nDoes it really need extreme buffs? I don't really think so. Needs higher duration because it's literally 3 auto's and nothing more, making it burst-centric for on-hits in the early game. The out of combat side of it makes it extremely hard to justify the short window of time you really get to use it with, since I usually have to skip out on CS to use it in lane compared to junglers who do not.\n\nI'd also like to say that if some champions find this to be a comfortable rune, AA animation speed for the initial hit should be improved so as to not cancel auto's. It damages the rune's effectiveness by denying an ability to get any bonus AA's to begin with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lolipopevelynn","date":"2018-06-11T09:10:41.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its designed for 3 hit proc champs to get their 3 hit procs off. So your ekko's your jax, your gnars, diana, etc. Lethal tempo is bad for these champs because any ability procs it. Hail of blades only AA procs it.
