An item that needs to be addressed.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":58,"down_votes":2,"body":"&gt; Stats \t\r\n&gt; +80 health\r\n&gt; +6 health regen per 5 seconds\r\n&gt; **Passive** \t\r\n&gt; Unique: Blocks 8 damage from single target attacks and spells from champions.\r\n\r\nDoran&#039;s Shield. An early defensive version of the Doran&#039;s items. However, it absolutely fails in the defensive apartment. From other starting items like Flask, Cloth, or Ruby + pots, there is absolutely no reason to buy a Doran&#039;s Shield. Even on manaless champions. Flask + 3 pots gives you 810 effective in-lane health and 180 mana. Ruby + 2 gives you 450 health with a faster power spike of obtaining Sunfire for example. Cloth + 5 gives you 750 + 15 more armor and also allows you to power spike faster. Doran&#039;s Shield + 1? Measly 230 health with 1.2hp per sec. You might be saying to yourself &quot;But the passive! It blocks 8 damage!&quot; \r\n\r\nThis is one of the biggest issues I want to bring up. The passive, blocking only single target attacks and spells, blocking 8 damage. That doesnt sound so bad right? Well considering the fact that it blocks 8 damage BEFORE resistances apply. Lets put it like this for example.\r\n\r\n100 ad vs 100 armor\r\n100 armor = 50% dmg reduction\r\n50 damage is taken\r\n\r\nVS\r\n\r\n100 ad vs 100 armor + Doran&#039;s Shield passive\r\n100 - 8 = 92\r\n50% of 92 is 46\r\n46 Damage is taken\r\n\r\nOut of all of the Doran&#039;s items, Shield is the only one that loses it&#039;s value the longer the game goes. Or the more you gain armor to put it simply. Whereas Blade&#039;s 3% lifesteal can be stacked with other lifesteal items and can be used in conjunction with other AD items and Ring has a flat Mana Regen and it&#039;s passive, Shield fails in comparison. Also note that Shield also blocks only autos and targeted damage, meaning AOE damage like Pantheon&#039;s E gets a free ticket. \r\n\r\nSo why has this item been ignored for so long? Note that this item didnt even block targeted spell damage for the longest item either. Shield has been a glorified noob trap item for over a year. So what needs to be fixed then? Simple. Have it block 8 damage AFTER resistances and maybe half of that from AOE attacks. Make it actually worth spending 440 gold. Otherwise, there&#039;s absolutely no reason to buy it. Not when there are other, better options around.","replies":[{"poster":"Laraso","date":"2015-07-01T03:40:40.006+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"My problem with Doran's Shield is that it's too expensive - you only get one health pot.

If you can't read then try your luck elsewhere. The point is, right now, no one buys dshield. Not even tanks or ap bruisers. Buffing it so they can have a better starting item _won't fix that_. It will just make everyone start with that item, and the stronger AD lane bullies will _still make better use of it than they ever will_.\n\nI did read your post, but you failed to do it for my post.\n\n\"Not even tanks or ap bruisers. \"\nThat's why we have to make Doran's shield exclusively useful for them, but not for ADs. ADs already have Doran's Blade as an excellent choice.\n\nYour point was buffing doran's shield would benefit ADC/AD Bruisers. My point was tanks and AP bruisers aren't negatively affected by the buff of Doran's shield, while ADs are. ADs mostly deal damage by AA. Introducing a stronger Doran's shield that mitigates AA damage would be an additional option to reduce their early game domination. It only benefits ADs if they are facing another ADs opponent, but this will give tanks and AP bruisers an alternative starting item.\n\nPlease don't get offended because you didn't fully understand my point. I didn't really think I would have to explain in details for your laziness to think.","replies":[{"poster":"BakugoBestBoy","date":"2015-07-01T19:32:09.129+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ok.
