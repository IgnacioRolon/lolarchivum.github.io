They don't want every champion who builds crit as a steroid to have a stack counting minigame. They've put that mechanic on certain champions like Caitlyn, and they aren't looking to make it something that absolutely everyone has.\n\nIf I want a stack counting minigame, I'll play Caitlyn.

However, one good thing about it is its explosive power: it gives an otherwise heavily DPS-dependent class access to bursts of power which allows them to feel stronger. A lot of proposed crit reworks advocated turning crit into a permanent percent autoattack damage multiplier (i.e. 1% crit means your basic attacks deal 1% more damage), but I'm not too big a fan of that either, since it removes the mechanic's explosive power and still doesn't add any gameplay.\n\nA system I'd like to try out for crits, though, would be to turn it into a kind of three-strike mechanic akin to the one on Gypsylord's champions (e.g. {{champion:245}}'s innate, {{champion:150}}'s Hyper effect in mini-form, {{champion:254}}'s W) as well as {{champion:67}}'s Silver Bolts, where attacking an enemy three times in a row would \"crit\", though without dealing any bonus damage initially, and you could then modify those crits with innate effects (like the aforementioned mechanics) or bonus damage from items. The benefit to this is that it would keep crit as a DPS-focused mechanic, but would also keep its explosive power. It would also add a lot more gameplay and predictability to the mechanic on both ends (the player and their opponent), and could also have tons of potential for expansion: you could include all champions' crit animations for critical strikes, you could turn the aforementioned effects into crit modifiers (e.g. Vayne would deal true max health-based damage on every critical strike), and you could even get into crazy itemization expansions that could add crit modifiers of their own, and even apply to non-AD champions (you could have stuff like AP crit, tank crit or even support crit, none of which would make sense in the current framework). It would also allow a proper overhaul of current crit itemization, which is mostly pretty dry and uninteresting ({{item:3031}} doesn't really enhance gameplay in any way besides contributing a chunk of extra damage, and yet is still _the_ core marksman item).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meeks011","date":"2015-07-12T15:10:09.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Crit is also ridiculously gold efficient.
