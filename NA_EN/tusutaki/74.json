As far as what the similarities are? I honestly have no idea besides to say a gut feeling. It&#039;s nothing negative just so you know because im loving it.\r\n\r\nHowever from how she plays, it honestly feels like a worse Warwick and I think the issue stems from her overall range. While I love the concept of her Allure and see a lot of potential with it, it doesnt actually see much use due to being gated by her lack of range to proc it. She is supposed to be an Assassin but doesnt have the tools to actually get the chance to assassinate outside of her stealth. Even with the stealth she has she doesnt have utilities to be of much use. \r\n\r\nI think a way to fix the issue imo is to add more interaction with her Allure by making her Q and E gaining additional range and maybe gaining spellvamp onto the Charmed target.","replies":[{"poster":"ThisIsMyStick","date":"2017-10-19T08:39:03.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tusutaki,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rdaopMxX,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-10-18T18:00:52.337+0000)\n>\n> While I love the concept of her Allure and see a lot of potential with it, \n\nIt's called 'Lust Dust', not Allure. If you watched the reveal video, the guy says the words 'Lust Dust' at least 6 times. This means that several executives, over the course of several meetings, sat at a table, while someone stood at a whiteboard. And when that person wrote 'Lust Dust' on the whiteboard, the executives nodded and said \"Yes, 'Lust Dust' is something we want to put in our game.\"\n\nThey also did some other stuff to her too, but I forget what it was. But I do remember, and always will, that her ability is called 'Lust Dust', not Allure.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2017-10-19T09:02:52.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo, but, like...it's Allure.","replies":[{"poster":"ThisIsMyStick","date":"2017-10-19T13:54:29.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://youtu.be/ep_U4U6YW4E?t=1m34s\nhttps://youtu.be/ep_U4U6YW4E?t=1m48s\nhttps://youtu.be/ep_U4U6YW4E?t=1m56s\nhttps://youtu.be/ep_U4U6YW4E?t=2m5s\n\nLooks like we were both wrong.

I don't want her to go back to just running into people and bursting them down instantly like old eve did, she shouldn't always need her ult to get a kill","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-10-19T00:31:21.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think her ult definitely feels a bit severe right now, yeah. When she has it, she really can lay down a lot of burst very quickly, but when it's on cooldown, she loses both a ton of damage and an escape. Effectively, she can't really fight consistently right now when her ult's not up, because she is both more likely to fail her kill, due to her missing an important nuke, but also more likely to die, due to her missing her untargetability/blink.\n\nIt's this kind of problem that is making me question the whole escape/damage combo design that has been applied to so many assassins: when a champion has most of their kill potential in their basic abilities, they can at least feel like they can win fights in-between, even if they're putting themselves at risk, and if they have their escape potential instead, they can go in with less fighting power, knowing at least that they have a possible out if things go wrong. When a champion lacks both, they lose a lot of agency in the process, which often requires such overcompensation on their ult that it feels like they give their opponent no real choice either when it's up. Ultimately, the answer to this would be to either reduce the ult's cooldown and strength somewhat (so that Eve would spend less time unable to participate), or simply remove one of its components and move it to her basic ability set (for example, by making it a pure blink, or at least a blink with much less damage attached, and give her basic abilities a greater damage output). The same I think could apply to other assassins, namely Ekko and Zed, whose damage + escape combo either makes them oppressive or otherwise feels wasteful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2017-10-21T00:16:09.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that her passive and charm are working against each other.  Riot doesn't want good CC on a stealthed champ but for some bizarre reason put good CC on a champ with stealth.  In return both are sabotaging one another.  The W can't be that easy to proc and it has to have a good indicator because evelynn's stealth exists.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tik115","date":"2017-10-21T00:09:59.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem is the W indicator, its pinpoint accurate on where she is, especially on higher elos a player can just instantly throw CC in that direction it needs to be more like Fioras vital point indicator saying \"She's somewhere around.....here?\"","replies":[]}]}
