I loved her playstyle with heavy engages and while being highly defensive. She is nothing but a tank who just stuns people. Thats fine and dandy, but as time goes on I find less and less reasons to play her as new supports comes in and Leona&#039;s nerfs.\n\nLets look at some of the other supports and see what they have to offer.\n\nAlistar {{champion:12}}  - Knock ups, stuns, displacement, tanky, and heals\n\nThresh  {{champion:412}} - Pulls, Lanterns, slows, knockups, shield, and damage if you collect enough souls\n\nJanna {{champion:40}}  - Knock ups, Shields, Heals, Movement speed buff, Slows, AD buff, and Displacement\n\nBraum {{champion:201}} - Shield wall, stun, knockup, resistance steroid to himself and target, and slows\n\nLets even look at Jarvan IV {{champion:59}}  - Knock up, Armor Pen, Attack Speed, %health dmg, slows, shield, dashes, poke, and a terrain trap.\n\nAnd now compare that with Leona.\n\nLeona {{champion:89}} - Stuns, self resistance steroid, slows, and mediocre damage. \n\nAnd this is where my topic comes into play, Is there any reason to play as Leona anymore? Especially compared to the above champs? It feels like she fell off the face of the planet of relevancy. Why choose her as an hard engage champ when I can choose J4 for example?","replies":[{"poster":"Lovely Pants","date":"2016-04-06T01:56:35.347+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Leona still provides the most reliable CC-chaining out of any of these champions as well as providing the largest threat range of any of these engage champions except perhaps Jarvan, who seems a much swingier support pick from the few times I've ever faced that. \n\nI think she is locked out of her full potential a bit easier than most of these other champions if she has a rough early game, but then again there's few other supports that are as punishing as she is when ahead. At least out of personal experience. She wombo combos better than most if she can spread her ability procs to multiple champions. Her early damage is also better than nearly any support when she can commit to her combo. Her dive defense is good and her dive enabling is good. Lots of risk and reward about her, but she's not completely helpless either when playing on the back foot.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2016-04-06T03:56:39.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her CC chain while decent is not worth sacrificing the majority of the utilities that others have. Her ult does have a decent range however it can be easily avoidable due to her stun radius being rather smallish. Not something I want to bank with unless we're far ahead. \n\nI dont know why everybody says her early game damage is good enough for her to stand out either especially in a case where she cant poke. In order to do any amount of damage she would have to fully commit. While at the same time fully committing doesnt guarantee good trades hence by what you said by \"risk and reward\". As it currently stands, she's far too risky to obtain any awards compared to other hard engage supports as they are much much safer and has about the same reward potential.  \n\nIm not bashing Leona because I hate her, but because I want to have more of a reason to pick her over other champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Lovely Pants","date":"2016-04-06T05:53:58.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noting Leona's early game damage potential is relevant because, even if you can't commit to trades, the threat of Leona's tankiness and damage means the enemy also can't play super aggressively against you in most cases. \nLeona's laning phase is about on par with other tank supports, I would say. If she has a jungler who wants to ambush a lot she shines because she can setup a lane far more reliably than most. She's tanky enough to soft trade and keep control of her zone except against your stronger utility.poke supports that can sustain constant trades. If she can't even do that, Leona doesn't have to play aggressively and can just sit back and counter-engage, even if that's kind of boring. \n\nMaybe in high-level coordinated team play Leona is outclassed by engage supports that function more safely with the lower amounts of gold/exp supports will more commonly get there, but I don't think that risk/reward balance is skewed against her for your average player with reasonable strategic focus. Personally I pick her for decisive late game team fight power that works as a blind pick against all but the very worst poke lanes. If you don't think the chain cc, teamfight burst supplement, and potent picks are worthwhile gains for her risks, then I guess she doesn't have anything for you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-04-06T02:56:42.879+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leona does mediocre damage?

Not only that but allies can proc the debuff she places on enemies from damaging them with skills. Leona with max CDR can keep someone CC'd very hard. Her ult has a decent range and is amazing for starting a teamfight as it can stun and/or slow multiple people and put them in a bad starting situation, she can then W to the back line and even ignores minions for where to pull her, meaning that enemy laners trying to hide behind minions for safety won't really get that safe feeling and her Q is an auto reset. Sure other supports have different utilities but leona is a very in-your-face-tank-and-cc support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorasama","date":"2016-04-06T09:50:49.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She may not has CC variety but, you forgot the fact that she has **3 stuns**.

If he misses a single pull, her sustain is going to push them out of lane. Leona not so much. Blitzcrank is still an effective pick, but I'd argue it's not as effective as Leona.\n\nAs Soraka, you're so vulnerable early on, and Leona applies relentless pressure that you almost need to farm under your turret. Your ADC is forced to play on the defense because of all the potential stuns, and naturally Soraka is useless when her ADC cannot carve out space for them in lane. Bot lane is so isolated in season 6 as well. Not many junglers are coming down for multiple ganks anymore like they were in previous seasons, which makes the lane a little more deady for her ADC.\n\nLeona is a very effective counter pick, and while that's not an ideal place for her to be right now, the insane spike in popularity of Soraka recently makes her viable enough, which is more than you can say for many other supports.","replies":[{"poster":"Jakubrus","date":"2016-04-06T09:29:17.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chaton,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NtLEf3Ee,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2016-04-06T06:03:45.026+0000)\n>\nBot lane is so isolated in season 6 as well.

I play mostly bot lane, and we get junglers, mid laners, heck, even top laners coming down for the good ol' 4-man towerdive before 15 min in nearly every game I'm in. On the bright side, never has bot lane been more action-packed, and I've really been able to brush up on my anti-towerdive skills.\n\nAs for OP, Leona is still a top-tier support if your lane partner is willing to play aggressively (Jhin/Graves/Draven + Leona is scary). Her single target lockdown is among the best, and a well-placed ulti can stop an entire team. She's also currently my highest winrate champ (75% over the last 12 games).","replies":[{"poster":"Baby Ghoul","date":"2016-04-06T09:46:26.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jakubrus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NtLEf3Ee,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2016-04-06T09:29:17.240+0000)\n>\n> Bot lane is so isolated in season 6 as well.

I frequently get matched with people in Silver 5 to Gold 4. Last year I got matched people from Silver 2 to Gold 1. We're both low ELO.\n\nThe truth is that there are many more champions in the meta right now that gank top more often. This can create a one sided situation. I'm not saying there are no ganks bot. In fact what tends to happen is one jungler neglects bot, and the nearly all of the enemy team comes bot to take a tower and dragon. Then the game snowballs out of control. 4 enemies bot lane happens so often because of a jungler that does not give adequate counter pressure to bot lane. \n\nLast season there were so many even battles bot lane, but now we're facing one sided situations at best. It was not as one sided as it is now.  Every other game I have there's one jungler on one side that doesn't pay attention to bot lane as much as they should because of how crucial ADCs are.\n\nTower diving is common in all lanes, even very early game now. Frankly though, if 4 people were pushing an outer turret and my teammates weren't close by, I'd abandon it unless we were truly pinned down.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"woobat","date":"2016-04-06T06:31:38.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how dare you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frick Mako","date":"2016-04-06T02:34:46.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I too enjoyed playing Leona in S4 and S5, but I don't play her that much anymore.
