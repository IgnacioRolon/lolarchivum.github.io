She's the type of adc that dishes out damage and can bully out most bot laners. Has a good ult that can make an impact in teamfights. Especially if she is left alone. When they change her kit, I thought was fantastic. They significantly reduced the mana to her Q and added a new passive \"Impure Shots\" which greatly helps her dueling potential. However the change to her Ult greatly lowers her team fight presence. On paper, her new ult looks like it deals hell of a lot of damage but in practice its hardly noticeable since you wont get the full potential damage majority of the time.  Plus you would have to ult when they're at full stacks to receive the maximum damage. So this is just going to be a simple suggestion. Why not just revert the ult?\r\n\r\n----------------------------------Current---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPASSIVE: The stack limit for Impure Shots is increased.\r\n\r\nNEW STACK LIMIT: 6 / 7 / 8\r\nMAX MAGIC DAMAGE: 36 / 42 / 48% AD\r\nACTIVE: Miss Fortune channels for 2 seconds, spraying up to 8 waves of bullets (6 bullets per wave) in a cone in front of her. A wave is fired every 0.25 seconds, dealing physical damage and applying Impure Shots' passive magic damage and stack to all enemies within the area.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL DAMAGE PER WAVE: 50 / 75 / 125 (+ 20% AP)\r\nMAX PHYSICAL DAMAGE: 400 / 600 / 1000 (+ 160% AP)\r\nMINIMUM MAGIC DAMAGE (NO STACKS): 198 / 210 / 216% AD\r\nMAX MAGIC DAMAGE (MAX STACKS): 288 / 336 / 384% AD\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------Suggested----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNEW PASSIVE: Increases the stack limit of Impure Shots to 6 / 7 / 8, for a new maximum potential damage of 36 / 42 / 48 % AD.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL DAMAGE PER WAVE: 65 / 95 / 125 (+20% AP)(+35% bonus AD).\r\nMAX PHYSICAL DAMAGE: 400 / 760 / 1000 (+ 260% bonus AD)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYay?

IMO the only thing they need to do is swap the scaling on her w and ult. Having a magic spell that scales with ad and a physical spell that scales with ap is counter-intuitive. \n\nI'm aware the ult procs her w, but it takes too long to build up that it just doesn't feel that effective.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-02-02T01:06:06.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've always considered Miss Fortune more team fight oriented than 1v1 dueler.  Before the changes, all I wanted was for them to decrease her mana cost to what it is now and that would be perfect.

It would also stop Miss Fortune players trying to harass or waveclear with her E. God everytime I see MF try to harass with E instead with her Q makes me depressed. \n\nBut instead of procing every quarter of a second it'll proc her passive every .5 seconds otherwise her dueling potential would be too powerful.","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-02-02T00:58:27.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, forgot it applies that often. \n\nCan easily make it apply on the first and ever second after that.
