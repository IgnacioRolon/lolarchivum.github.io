Or is he a bruiser?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing a lot of Sion lately ever since his rework and I find him one of the best, and safest top laners to date along side with Gnar. He essentially has no weakness, and here's why.\r\n\r\nHis E deals a lot of magic damage to champions that are behind minions. 70 magic damage at level 1 that can deal 105 magic damage if unit is strucked by an E'd minion. All for a low cost  of 35 mana while having insane Nidalee like range and slowing them\r\n\r\nHis W shielding him for around 10% of his max health and dealing 10% of their max health as magic damage.\r\n\r\nHis Q, which is really one of his only faults, has a good AD scaling while bringing knock up and a stun if channeled for long enough.\r\n\r\nHis R that can also equate to a \"get out of jail free\" card. Being completely immune to CC which equates to him having one of the best escapes for split pushing.\r\n\r\nHe also has one of the highest Health regen in the game (10hp per 5 seconds).\r\n\r\nHe is able to build pure tank while dealing moderate to decent amounts of damage. With his W passive, he is able to build pure armor or magic resist items without sacrificing the added HP the other items would give. Allowing him to increase his effective health exponentially. Especially with his W being able to shield him for 10% of his max. \r\n\r\nSo what was Riot's intention when building him? He is an extremely effective tank while being an effective bruiser. He is able to fit both roles perfectly without suffering from anything. If I were to wanting to choose a tank, why would I choose Mundo or Shen over Sion? If I were wanting to choose a bruiser, why would I pick Darius or Wukong over Sion? What exactly are Sion's weakness? Because I cant really find any.","replies":[{"poster":"Anonagon","date":"2015-02-10T01:17:59.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is a tank, and he's perhaps the tank most faithful to tank characters from old RPGs - hard to kill and having situationally high damage, but being relatively slow and easy to evade.","replies":[]},{"poster":"COWmanLord","date":"2015-02-10T01:17:14.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sion's biggest weakness are it can be hard to actually land your abilities. Yes they have great damage but the damage is not always going to hit.\n\nHis Q is the most obvious one as it takes a long time to charge (at least one second if you really want it to do something useful) even if it does have good damage and some strong cc. It can  also be interrupted.\n\nHis w shield can be popped negating the damage it does, which isn't that huge until later on in the game. It is by no means a bad ability, but it doesn't have nearly as much utility as an ability as most other shields in the game. It's main benefit is the passive which gets you health for killing things. That is helpful, but only if you can c well and don't fall to far behind.\n\nHis E does have great range, damage, a slow, and the armor shred, but it is significantly weaker if you don't have a minion to chuck with it.\n\nHis R is a great initiation tool, but it can be tricky to land a good one if the enemy team is mobile enough. Anyone with a dash or simply enough of a warning can dodge it quite easily. Also if you do miss and hit a wall you end up stunning yourself. This can also be blocked by having the enemy tank block it with his face. Because of the way it works you can only use your ult in certain areas around the map if you want to land it well as to get its full stun and damage you need to actually spend a few seconds running. It is very good for running away, but only if no one can block by standing in front of you. Also if you do use it to run away you  don't have it for teamfights.\n\nNow I'm not saying sion is a weak champion. He is certainly very strong and one of my favorites, but he does have some easily exploitable weaknesses if you know how to handle him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2015-02-10T01:13:52.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I consider Sion a tank and build him as such. With firecape or Omens along with Spirit being core items. Then following it up with some Offensive items, like hydra or BoTRK to give him some decent damage out put late game.\n\nBut he is definitely a tank and not a bruiser. He lacks the Damage out put to be a bruiser. In-less he can land his full combo on some one R-Q-E-W then people blow up, but this is very hard to do as his ult and Q are easily dodged unless used correctly.\n\n\nI recently found out that if u can time ending R you will land it 80% of the time, as it gains a much larger AoE if u end it, than the hit box of it is while u charge. Thus allowing u to hit those pesky champs that jump/flash/dash to the side.\n\nI also play him as a jungler rather than a top laner. I just feel his ult is used as nothing but a \"Get back to Lane\" or \"Get out of Jail\" card in the top lane. Making it pretty lack luster compared to the damage it can do if u are a jungler and charge into lane with a fully charged R.\n\nHis only real weakness is are:\nKitability: if he doesn't land his Q or R then most champs can kite him pretty well.\nDodgeability: Q and R are very hard to land on skilled players. (easy as pie on newbies tho)\n\nOther than that he is the tank of all tanks, highest base HP5, 2nd best self shield, Infinite Max HP, doesn't waste any stat, good peeler if need be, and good engage/disengage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-02-10T01:12:24.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends if you know how to land most of his slow ability-combos, especially his ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-02-10T01:09:26.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he's a tank imo\nnot very scary guy\nIf i see sion top, i pick nasus and just free farm","replies":[]},{"poster":"bzhen0915","date":"2015-02-10T01:05:43.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me I feel that Sion is very slow in his abilities and can get kited really easily. Sion really doesn't do much damage  (at all) to be classified as a bruiser late game but in lane some of even \"tanks\" do a considerable amount of damage in early levels.","replies":[]}]}
