Some of them that was teased way back then we could already tell that either it would be a must pick or never picked like that Armor and Magic Resist rune. Patches later we saw some improvements but sorta minor in a grand scope outside of Conqueror. Hopefully season 9 rune system we will see major changes. Here are some of my ideas/hopes for whats to come. I&#039;m planning on doing the other trees as well but feel free to voice your thoughts.\r\n\r\n_**RESOLVE**_\r\n\r\n**Grasp of the Undying**\r\nBonus Magic Damage: 2% Max HP from 4%\r\nRestores 4% of maximum health from 2%\r\nGrants permanent 5 bonus hp\r\n\r\n_Context: Makes Tanks more like Tanks and less like Bruisers._\r\n\r\n**Font of Life**\r\nNow applies it&#039;s mark to enemy units and monsters as well. Healing 5hp over 2 seconds.\r\nNew Description: Slowing or immobilizing a unit marks them for 4 seconds. Allied champions (excluding you) who basic attack marked enemies heal for 5 over 2 seconds. Heal for and additional 1% of your max health if against enemy champions.\r\n\r\n_Context: I was a huge fan of stoneborn pact and I always thought it was a grossly underrated rune. Font of Life tries to copy Stone Born but it was just way too weak that it may as well not exist. I thought to make Font of Life more interactive by adding a sort of risk and reward system in terms of minion management/control. For example, you could use Karma&#039;s Q to hit some minions so your ADC can heal a bit, however you would also be sacrificing potential freezes and lane control. _\r\n\r\n**Chrysalis and Bone Plating **\r\nPositions are switched.\r\n\r\n_Context: The rune categories of Strength and Resistances, you would think that these two were misplaced. It can also be considered a nerf since you cant do the Bone Plate + Second Wind combo which heavily discourages doing trades.\r\n_\r\n\r\n**Conditioning**\r\nNew Effect: Increases your BONUS armor and magic resist by 10%\r\n\r\n_Context: Never understood the 10min restriction as it seems arbitrary. Assuming that it was to prevent champs from being too tanky at the start, I thought it would be a better idea if it actually helps champs who bought resistances early and scales better into later in the game if you continue to buy resistant items._\r\n\r\n**Overgrowth**\r\nNew Effect: Every small monsters or enemy minions that die near you gain 1 stack. At every 8 stacks, permanently increase your base and bonus health by 0.2%. Gain 3 stacks instead if it was a large minion or monster. Gain 8 stacks if it was an enemy champion.\r\n\r\n_Context: Overgrowth&#039;s payoff is very binary. Either you get that increase you expect or you dont and turns into a wasted slot. Hopefully this will smooth it out._\r\n\r\n**Unflinching**\r\nNew Effect: Gain 15% Tenacity and Slow Resist\r\n\r\n_Context: Originally, it was way too situational to see any practical use. _","replies":[{"poster":"Subject 5","date":"2018-10-17T00:19:24.569+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not remove the tree system altogether? More than half of the roster don't synergize with MOST of the provided tools. Without creating a substantially large margin of additional runes and masteries, champions will be left out regardless of adding a few additional keystones.\n\nPrior to the keystones and implementing of this system, there was a greater variety and champions didn't feel ass-raped into performing in a very specific role in a very specific lane. Add massively increased choices, or ditch the system entirely. And stop tacking on damage in EVERY single choice that we make. Be a little more creative? Why the hell is Aftershock, a tank keystone, doing damage instead of providing additional utility? Furthermore, why does the other option for tanks, grasp, do additional damage injunction with getting to be a little bit more tanky (useless after mid game btw) and sustain?\n\nAnd why does offense outclass defense so severely? Listen,\n\nIf I have Aftershock with {{champion:33}} with {{item:3075}} {{item:3068}} I shouldn't be just immediately shredded because it's lategame. Offensive keystones are superior in the early, mid and late game - why not make keystones centered around making sure tanks don't drop off of the face of the planet because of how much time has passed in the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2018-10-17T00:40:02.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> why not make keystones centered around making sure tanks don't drop off of the face of the planet because of how much time has passed in the game?\n\nWe did when we still had the 2016 Mastery system.

Towers are not very good defensively, and when tanks are strong they can stand in them for moments at a time. (I play lots of tanks, and I want to see tank meta because I honestly believe it's the best meta.)\n\nBias aside, the aforementioned keystones in 2016 still did not provide coverage for everybody, and left people out in the dark.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2018-10-17T21:19:38.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Better yet.\nLet's just go back to this:\nhttp://abccbaandy.github.io/league-S4mastery-calc/\nGood times","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2018-10-16T23:42:13.189+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"demolish should grant a defensive bonus, either every time any turret falls on the map, or every time you get a turret takedown/assist. something like 50 health in the second case.\n\nunflinching should grant a stacking tenacity + slow resist bonus for every individual cc youve been hit by (including knockups), to prevent cc chaining from getting out of hand. it doesnt have to be crazy high, but like 5% would be good.\n\n\ni think the real \"problem\" with boneplating in r1 isnt that its overtuned, but that the other two runes in that row simply grant no defensive stats. demolish is also unreliable a lot of the time, even when you get into position to siege an enemy turret with your team. i noticed, that turrets that are sieged by 5 people often fall faster than the proc takes to wind up, which is kindof insane.\n\nso even in a scenario where you should be able to use the rune, its pretty wasted if that 500 damage proc is ready when the turret is already at 100 health, and your team would take it down either way.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2018-10-17T18:52:49.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critmaster Garen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6ZzBpT5M,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-10-16T23:42:13.189+0000)\n>\n> demolish should grant a defensive bonus, either every time any turret falls on the map, or every time you get a turret takedown/assist. something like 50 health in the second case.\n> \n> unflinching should grant a stacking tenacity + slow resist bonus for every individual cc youve been hit by (including knockups), to prevent cc chaining from getting out of hand. it doesnt have to be crazy high, but like 5% would be good.\n> \n> \n> i think the real &quot;problem&quot; with boneplating in r1 isnt that its overtuned, but that the other two runes in that row simply grant no defensive stats. demolish is also unreliable a lot of the time, even when you get into position to siege an enemy turret with your team. i noticed, that turrets that are sieged by 5 people often fall faster than the proc takes to wind up, which is kindof insane.\n> \n> so even in a scenario where you should be able to use the rune, its pretty wasted if that 500 damage proc is ready when the turret is already at 100 health, and your team would take it down either way.\n\nMake Demolish increase your HP by X amount for every tower taken down and increase your resistances by X for everyone of your own towers taken down, granting even more resistances when you are near towers AFTER you lose your first one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BLIGHTBRINGER","date":"2018-10-17T15:45:40.524+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would just like a massive Runes Recorged Update honestly.
