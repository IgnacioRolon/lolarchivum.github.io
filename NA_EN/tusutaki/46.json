She has a built in better version of Fleet Keystone as a passive giving her enough sustain to live through the lane phase. On top of having two potential targets for your marks that are arguably easier to achieve than if you take her to the jungle. \r\n\r\nNow when I say viable, I do not mean it in the same fashion as being meta. There&#039;s a few simple changes that I think that can happen to make her a balanced meta ADC. One of which is to change her Q from firing her arrows at the end of the leap to the start. It would be a QoL change and to make the ability feel less clunky. Another change I have always wondered as to why this was never added to her was to allow her Q apply onhit effects. I never understood why they disallow her Q from doing so since you would think it would make perfect sense.\r\n\r\nWhat do you peeps think?","replies":[]}
