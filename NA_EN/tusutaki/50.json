An early defensive version of the Doran&#039;s items. However, it absolutely fails in the defensive apartment. From other starting items like Flask, Cloth, or Ruby + pots, there is absolutely no reason to buy a Doran&#039;s Shield. Even on manaless champions. Flask + 3 pots gives you 810 effective in-lane health and 180 mana. Ruby + 2 gives you 450 health with a faster power spike of obtaining Sunfire for example. Cloth + 5 gives you 750 + 15 more armor and also allows you to power spike faster. Doran&#039;s Shield + 1? Measly 230 health with 1.2hp per sec. You might be saying to yourself &quot;But the passive! It blocks 8 damage!&quot;\r\n\r\nThis is one of the biggest issues I want to bring up. The passive, blocking only single target attacks and spells, blocking 8 damage. That doesnt sound so bad right? Well considering the fact that it blocks 8 damage BEFORE resistances apply. Lets put it like this for example.\r\n\r\n100 ad vs 100 armor\r\n100 armor = 50% dmg reduction\r\n50 damage is taken\r\n\r\nVS\r\n\r\n100 ad vs 100 armor + Doran&#039;s Shield passive\r\n100 - 8 = 92\r\n50% of 92 is 46\r\n46 Damage is taken\r\n\r\nOut of all of the Doran&#039;s items, Shield is the only one that loses it&#039;s value the longer the game goes. Or the more you gain armor to put it simply. Whereas Blade&#039;s 3% lifesteal can be stacked with other lifesteal items and can be used in conjunction with other AD items and Ring has a flat Mana Regen and it&#039;s passive, Shield fails in comparison. Also note that Shield also blocks only autos and targeted damage, meaning AOE damage like Pantheon&#039;s E gets a free ticket.\r\n\r\nSo why has this item been ignored for so long? Note that this item didnt even block targeted spell damage for the longest item either. Shield has been a glorified noob trap item for over a year. So what needs to be fixed then? Simple. Have it block 8 damage AFTER resistances and maybe half of that from AOE attacks. Make it actually worth spending 440 gold. Or buff the health regen. Or something! Otherwise, there&#039;s absolutely no reason to buy it. Not when there are other, better options around.","replies":[{"poster":"GamersEye","date":"2015-08-16T16:57:37.439+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because the point of the itme is to be defensive and just sit in lane and be generally immune harass. Riot likes to, with good reason, encourage lane interaction with the enemy champion. Doran's Shield runs specifically counter to that idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-08-16T19:21:47.514+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it doesnt.

None of the other doran's items have unique passives.
