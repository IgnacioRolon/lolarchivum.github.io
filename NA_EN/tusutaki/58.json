Everyone has. Dont you hate it when you&#039;re someone like {{champion:80}} who cannot kill anybody in the top lane because you ran out of mana due to their tank and healing abilities? Remember how Essence Reaver was supposed to be an item for those champions? I do. At first, they made it at a decent price initially but weak stats for late game. Now they increased the AD to make it look good but too expensive to build and the build path is too expensive as well. Resulting in having ER to be a snowball type of item that it feels it caters more to ADCs than anybody else.\n\nSo here&#039;s my solution\n\n> Cost: ~~3200~~ -> 2650\n> New Recipe: Pickaxe + Longsword + Vampiric Scepter + 590 gold\n> ~~+80AD~~ -> +50 AD\n> +10% life steal\n> +10% cooldown reduction\n> Unique Passive: Your basic attacks restore mana equal to between 2% and 8% of the physical damage dealt, based on your missing mana.\n> Unique Passive: This item gains +1AD for every minion you kill for a max of +30AD\n\nYay? Nay? Let me know what you think.","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-08-06T11:21:43.499+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This doesn't solve it's main issues though:\n- no mana in the build path\n- Champs like {{champion:80}} who want it, don't actually basic attack much.\n\nit needs to be something like {{item:1053}} + {{item:3114}} + {{item:1037}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nilok","date":"2015-08-06T12:26:22.608+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:1053}} + {{item:3114}} +{{item:1038}}\nThat would be my preferred receptive, though the final combination cost is a bit low.\n\nSomething that may be worth looking into making Essence Reaver into an AD {{item:3152}} that works like {{item:2140}}, have the \"spell vamp\" only work on Champions while basic attacks work normally. The mana-vamp would also apply for abilities.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"atomicwit","date":"2015-08-06T11:27:35.516+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its main issues now are the slot efficiency and a high price to fix issues which the build path doesn't address. \n\nYour route tackles a key problem but encourages a boring pattern. You basically have to just farm passively as quickly as possible to spike hard and reach the 80 AD point. It's a bit like a Rod of Ages for AD champions and may lead to snowball scenarios like BT used to.\n\nI also wonder if now you wouldn't see it too much just for the gold efficiency it provides at full stacks (instead of an actual need for mana regen or CDR). After all, ADCs are mostly about farming early and we already see people hold on to Avarice Blade for a long time.\n\nAnyway, it's interesting and worth exploring. I'd probably make it gain AD on monsters too though.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-08-06T12:19:29.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main difference between the suggested ER and old BT is that BT starts with 70dmg that can go up to 100 while ER would start off with 50 thats goes up to 80. It wouldnt make it snowball as hard as old BT. To put it like this, lets say the average gold you gain from minion is ~19. The price difference between this ER and its current version is 550 gold. Farming 30 minions would net you 570 which would basically made this ER worth as much as its current. My math numbers may be wrong due to tiredness so correct me if iam wrong lol.\n\n> After all, ADCs are mostly about farming early and we already see people hold on to Avarice Blade for a long time.\n\nOf all my games, I dont think i've seen 5% of adc buying first item Avarice Blade. But of course it would work on monsters too. Just didnt think it through all the way lol.","replies":[]}]}]}
