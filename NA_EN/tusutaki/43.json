That if I would to climb, it would be because of my game knowledge and adaptability even though my mechanic skills is average at best. So I thought to create a thread dedicated to off meta choices that makes the enemy and your team question whats going on but at the end of the day, it works. Have you found your off meta picks/builds? \r\n\r\nSome of the successful off meta findings I have had if you&#039;re interested...\r\n\r\nOn Hit Jungle {{champion:104}} \r\n{{item:1416}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3071}} \r\n\r\nWhy? Because of how his auto&#039;s work. Each pellet can inflict onhit effects, meaning you can inflict multiple enemies with bloodrazor and botrk per shot. So even if the enemy isnt hit by your first/main pellet, the full onhit damage will still be applied. However the enemies can only be inflicted by it once but that is where Runnan comes in as since its also works as his pellets as it stops on first contact but bypasses the onhit limit. Meaning that PER SHOT, you can inflict the same enemy champ with onhit effects 3 times for 12%maxHP + 24%currentHP + whatever AD you currently have. \r\n\r\nHip Penetrating Top {{champion:86}} \r\n{{item:3142}} {{item:3071}} {{summoner:6}}  + 30 lethality from Runes and Masteries\r\n\r\nBecome the juggernaut you always wanted Garen to be. 45 flat armor pen + 55% armor reduction from his E and BC will literally melt anybody from just those two items alone. Anybody with less than 120 armor will be taking true damage or additional damage since I dont remember if damaging them as if they were in the negatives works on enemy champs still. At max rank with 10 spins, E deals 300 + 370% AD. BUT WAIT, THERES MORE! It deals 33% more  when damaging a single enemy. Making it a total of 400 + 492% AD. So imagine doing all of that damage as true damage to carries. With Ghostblade, Q, and Ghost, it will be almost impossible to escape. Remember thats just with those two items alone so you can build the rest as tank making you a tanky assassin. \r\n\r\nUltimate Fighter Top {{champion:44}} \r\n{{item:3748}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3174}} {{item:3190}} + Fervor \r\n\r\nTaric top is still alive and well. Although not as simple as he used to be, he can still be a devastating top laner. Able to beat out Riven, Nasus, and even Warwick. The amount of damage you can deal is staggering and unexpecting on top of all of your healing and shields. Why Athenes though? Because Sunfire build&#039;s Athene&#039;s charges and everytime you shield or heal somebody they will receive an additional 200hp. Due to how quickly you&#039;re able to shield and heal, you become a Soraka light with the damage of a Jax. Triforce is if you&#039;re fed and planning on split pushing, or Iceborn for more safety. Fervor is there for trades since you will be autoing a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"1wolfpack","date":"2017-04-07T23:16:04.912+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support:\n{{champion:22}} \nItems: {{item:2302}} {{item:3504}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3085}} \n\nHow it works: their is a keystone Mastery in the defensive tree (cant remember what its called) that allows your allies to heal everytime they attack an opponent you have recently attacked and hit with a slow\n\nAshe auto attacks already apply a slow so its a perfect combo with a ADC\nArdent provides more bonus life steal + Attack speed for your ADC\nBlack cleaver reduces opponents armour\nRunaans allows you to hit multiple enemies at once","replies":[{"poster":"Paquay","date":"2017-04-07T23:46:19.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Umm, {{item:3504}} only applies AD and lifesteal when you heal or shield an ally...

Ick. \n\nAlthough another really fun one is to take Bard and do an on-hit build. You can't do it as support because no income but you can rush statikk shiv, then go berserkers and IE, Guinsos, BORK, and Runaans. Once you get your 3rd item and have enough keeps, you start to get ridiculously powerful. \n\nBy the time you are near full build, you're like 3 shorting squishies. Q them, and about 2 seconds later they're toast. \n\nIt'd work a lot better if I was a decent player but, yeah.
