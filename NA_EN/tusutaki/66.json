That players, newer players to be specific, has no idea when they spawn or anything. Now adding the timers for all the buffs is pretty understandable.\r\n\r\nHowever the true burden of knowledge and perhaps the biggest that for some reason has been glossed over for years, are ratios. In order to know the champion&#039;s scaling ratios, you would have to go to a website such as lolwiki as it is not given during champion preview in the store page or even ingame. There is no way newer players to know about a champ&#039;s ratios without googling it.\r\n\r\nNow I think knowing about ratios is hugely important, more so than anything else imo. As knowing about ratios you can have a a lot better understanding of the champion and knowing what kind of items or runes to run with. \r\n\r\nSo why must players use an outside source to have a better and clearer understanding of a champion?","replies":[{"poster":"hgjkdlsaf jeldvb","date":"2016-03-11T23:39:23.961+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":0,"body":"How long does this skill cc for?

Until I managed to do it with a 50% success rate.\nThat was like 2-15 seconds (depending where I screw up) of practicing a combo, feel the timing, etc. That's about 4 times per minute for 2 hours.\n\nCompare this to LoL for example, most skills have cooldowns. Especially combos that use longer one (such as ultimates). Instead of like practice, and as soon as I mess up, prepare to practice again. Here you got to wait for cooldowns over and over again. Making the \"practice\" much more slow and seemly pointless.\n\nAnd that's why you think \"experience vs the world\" is better than actual training. When in fact, for what is considered \"Basics\". You need to spend A LONG TIME training. Before that \"experience vs the world\" and \"predict the opponent\" comes to play, you must understand the basics of what you are playing. And again, for basics, you need training.\n\nHence why, fighting games require a lot of training. Sure, experience is a good thing. After you learned how to use your combo. Learn at least 2-3 rotations of it so that you won't end up being predictable.
