An early defensive version of the Doran&#039;s items. However, it absolutely fails in the defensive apartment. From other starting items like Flask, Cloth, or Ruby + pots, there is absolutely no reason to buy a Doran&#039;s Shield. Even on manaless champions. Flask + 3 pots gives you 810 effective in-lane health and 180 mana. Ruby + 2 gives you 450 health with a faster power spike of obtaining Sunfire for example. Cloth + 5 gives you 750 + 15 more armor and also allows you to power spike faster. Doran&#039;s Shield + 1? Measly 230 health with 1.2hp per sec. You might be saying to yourself &quot;But the passive! It blocks 8 damage!&quot;\r\n\r\nThis is one of the biggest issues I want to bring up. The passive, blocking only single target attacks and spells, blocking 8 damage. That doesnt sound so bad right? Well considering the fact that it blocks 8 damage BEFORE resistances apply. Lets put it like this for example. \r\n\r\n100 ad vs 100 armor\r\n100 armor = 50% dmg reduction\r\n50 damage is taken\r\n\r\nVS\r\n\r\n100 ad vs 100 armor + Doran&#039;s Shield passive\r\n100 - 8 = 92\r\n50% of 92 is 46\r\n46 Damage is taken\r\n\r\nOut of all of the Doran&#039;s items, Shield is the only one that loses it&#039;s value the longer the game goes. Or the more you gain armor to put it simply. Whereas Blade&#039;s 3% lifesteal can be stacked with other lifesteal items and can be used in conjunction with other AD items and Ring has a flat Mana Regen and it&#039;s passive, Shield fails in comparison. Also note that Shield also blocks only autos and targeted damage, meaning AOE damage like Pantheon&#039;s E gets a free ticket.\r\n\r\nSo why has this item been ignored for so long? Note that this item didnt even block targeted spell damage for the longest item either. Shield has been a glorified noob trap item for over a year. So what needs to be fixed then? Simple. Have it block 8 damage AFTER resistances and maybe half of that from AOE attacks. Make it actually worth spending 440 gold. Or buff the health regen. Or something! Otherwise, there&#039;s absolutely no reason to buy it. Not when there are other, better options around.","replies":[{"poster":"LoL aint life","date":"2015-08-02T01:58:05.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion, the Doran's Ring and Doran's Shield items should all 400g and provide the following stats:\n\nDoran's Shield:\n- 100 health\n- 6 HP per 5 seconds\n- Blocks 8 damage from AAs and single target spells\n- Blocks 4 damage from AoE spells\n\nDoran's Ring:\n- Unchanged\n\nAnd the Doran's Blade should cost 475 gold and provides the following stats:\n\nDoran's Blade:\n- 80 health\n- 10 AD\n- 3% Lifesteal\n- 5 health on-hit\n\nGives more room for option. Pick up Doran's Shield if you want a more defensive lanem by staying very long and to counter poke champions such as Teemo, Pantheon or Gnar.\n\nPick up Doran's Ring if you're an AP mid laner that benefits from the mana regen passives.\n\nPick up Doran's Blade if you are an autoattack reliant champion that benefits greatly from the sustain through attacks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cenobite Azaziel","date":"2015-08-01T04:03:58.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because when it was good it warped the bot lane for coin users. They would go doran shield, go agro  and after the first back, they would get coin. \nThe problem is that coin already is the best late game support build.

Making it what it is in its current state. A noob trap item that provides no value compared to other starting items.\n\nBack then, it was extremely strong. Now its useless in every way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2015-08-01T04:58:14.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they should make the passive no longer unique. Doran's shield is the only dorans item that can't really stack, if behind. \n\nPerhaps that, and reduce the cost so that it's users can buy a few more pots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blacknemesist","date":"2015-08-01T00:00:28.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Irelia,Jax and every AA dependant champion in the top lane, combined with the regen it allows you to stay in-lane and get xp and gold to move on.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-08-01T03:55:18.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesnt mean its better than the other above options. Cloth and Ruby provides much better stats and allows you to power spike sooner. Health regen is almost non existent too. Also, would you rather wait over a minute to recover 100 health  (83 seconds) with the 1.2 health per sec regen or 10 seconds with a health pot which recovers 150 in 15 seconds. In order for the regen for the shield to be of equal value to a health pot, you would have to wait 2 minutes. 2 minutes your opponent has control over the lane, set up ganks, or whatever.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason to buy such a terrible item.
