Well thats because Blood Price&#039;s bonus physical damage doesnt apply life steal. However Nasus&#039;s Siphoning Strike does apply life steal despite having the same function. \r\n\r\nJ4&#039;s passive, Martial Cadence&#039;s bonus damage doesnt apply life steal. Naut&#039;s passive, Staggering Blow does. The list goes on and on. \r\n\r\nThe only way a player would reliably know this kind of information is if they go outside the game itself and look it up online. Similar to what the game Destiny did but the major difference is that Destiny&#039;s case is story whereas League&#039;s case is game mechanics. \r\n\r\nNow the only reason I know about this was because I had to go outside the game rather than the game itself telling me that this skill/passive doesnt apply life steal. If there wasnt outside information explaining what game should&#039;ve explained already, then a bunch of people would have a drastically hard time understanding what does or doesnt work. Imagine new players playing the game and dealing with this. Expecting Kindred&#039;s passive to apply life steal because what makes them think it wouldnt? \r\n\r\nCould Riot please add in a tooltip directly telling players that this does or doesnt apply life steal? \r\n\r\nNow there are a few other hidden information and inconsistencies but the life steal mechanic is my biggest issue personally. Are there any others that you have an issue with?","replies":[{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2017-04-03T23:37:21.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree 100%. \nLook at a game like Magic. The wording is so important because that dictates how it interacts with everything. \nThen look at league. They use words like \"blind\", yet teemos blind is not the same as quinn or Graves.
