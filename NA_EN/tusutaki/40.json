According to the wiki, he gains no magic resistance because he's able to use ranged attacks.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we have Mundo, Pantheon, Lee Sin, and more who also have ranged attacks have MR gains.\r\n\r\nWhy does a tank have no MR gains? Same with Singed. For what purpose? While on the subject of Shen, how big is his dash hitbox? Because it feels like that its smaller than the character model itself. Too many times where my model would touch theirs but the taunt isnt applied.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-02-01T22:52:14.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumping for answers","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xehnon","date":"2015-01-31T00:38:07.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same with Poppy, Kassadin,  Yasuo and Maokai.\n\nAlso, i still believe Elise should get hers back in melee form and to an extent Kayle too.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-01-31T01:16:19.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand Kassadin not having one as his passive also gives magic resist.
