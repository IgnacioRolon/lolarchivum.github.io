If it does display here, then it is a bug with the preview functionality only. This is only a problem when the trailing parenthesis immediately follows the link&#039;s closing parenthesis\n\nEdit: @boards dev, edit/quote my post to see the source text, for this example","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-03T03:37:56.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The HTML character code for a closing parenthesis is 41.\n\n&#40;&#91;&#115;&#105;&#116;&#101;&#93;&#40;&#104;&#116;&#116;&#112;&#115;&#58;&#47;&#47;&#119;&#119;&#119;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#111;&#103;&#108;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;&#41;&#38;&#35;&#52;&#49;&#59; → ([site](https://www.google.com)&#41;","replies":[{"poster":"Modi","date":"2018-12-03T05:15:45.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=icAOUtK5,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-12-03T03:37:56.873+0000)\n>\n> The HTML character code for a closing parenthesis is 41.\n> \n> &amp;#40;&amp;#91;&amp;#115;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#93;&amp;#40;&amp;#104;&amp;#116;&amp;#116;&amp;#112;&amp;#115;&amp;#58;&amp;#47;&amp;#47;&amp;#119;&amp;#119;&amp;#119;&amp;#46;&amp;#103;&amp;#111;&amp;#111;&amp;#103;&amp;#108;&amp;#101;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#41;&amp;#38;&amp;#35;&amp;#52;&amp;#49;&amp;#59; → ([site](https://www.google.com)&amp;#41;\n\nClever workaround.
