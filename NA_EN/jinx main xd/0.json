Crashing during champion select is usually caused by either connection problems, or using third party programs that don't play well with league.  If you have any running like play.tv, overwolf, lolrecorder, etc, remove it for the fix.  If you still have any trouble, let me know with more details like any error messages you might be getting.  I'll be around!","replies":[]}]}
