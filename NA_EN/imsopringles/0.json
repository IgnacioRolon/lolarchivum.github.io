When I opened the chest I got orange essence and what said Project: Yi when i highlighted over the button it had said unlock permanent so I clicked it. I went to the collection tab to see what the skin looks like, but it's saying that it is still locked. Not sure if this is a bug or what exactly I got from the chest then.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-01T01:05:06.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahaaa it looks like you actually received the Project: Yi Summoner Icon as opposed to the skin itself. Check your list of available icons and you should find it waiting for you there!","replies":[]}]}
