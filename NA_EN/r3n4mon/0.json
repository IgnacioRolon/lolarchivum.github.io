She will be having a Dark Armor\r\nwith fine blue/purple lines coming from a blue crystal in the middle of her chestplate (more to that later in the Lore). She uses 2 Swords,\r\none of them being a darkened and one a Silver Blade and has glowing yellow eyes.\r\nNow, the parts that I have so far are the Lore and the Ability Kit. I will keep it updated with Voice Lines and more later on but I wanted to get this done\r\nright now, so... I hope you all enjoy it.\r\n\r\nPassive: Cursed Blades\r\nTersah wields her custom Blades, one of them dealing physical damage, the other one magical damage. It switches between physical and magic every time she autoattacks normally.\r\n\r\nQ: A Stab in the Dark (Range: max. 700)\r\nTersah lunges in a direction she chooses, pulling her swords after her. At the end of the lunge, she stabs the closest enemy target (enemy champions prioritized) rapidly, once with each sword, dealing physical and magic damage. If she kills an enemy minion, half of the Mana is refunded. If she kills an enemy champion, the full mana cost is refunded and she gains a small, decaying speed boost.\r\n- Damage: Basic Attack damage empowered by 25%\r\n- Low Cooldown\r\n- Range can be varied (like Graves dash)\r\n- Bonus Movement Speed: 60 flat MS over 2 seconds.\r\n- Try the Special: When her E is active, she deals twice the physical damage instead of hybrid damage.\r\n\r\nW: Flurry\r\nTersah channels herself for 2 seconds (during that time she can move normally) and gains 70% Attack Speed at the end of the channel. You can imagine it similiar to the Rune \"Lethal Tempo\", so the only warning for your enemy will be a visual and Audio Queue, before her Flurry starts.\r\nfor 2 / 2,5 / 3 / 3,5 / 4 seconds.\r\n- Long Cooldown\r\n\r\nE: Black Blood\r\nTersah throws her Black Sword at selected Champion (point and click). The sword deals low magic damage, but slows the enemy champion by\r\n25 / 33 / 50 / 66 / 75% for 1,25 seconds, inflicting Grievous Wounds.\r\nGrievous Wounds: The impaled enemie's  is reduced from all Sources by 60% until Tersah calls her sword back to her after 3 seconds.\r\n- Medium Cooldown\r\n- Damage: Magic\r\n\r\nR: Feast (Range: 325)\r\nTersah leaps into the air and becomes unstopable. At the end of the Leap she brings down her swords at selected enemy champion,\r\nsurpressing them for 0,75 seconds, dealing high physical damage.\r\nShe ignores any shields of the target (ignores, but not destroys) and heals for 40 / 50 / 60% of the Targets missing health.\r\n- Damage: 322 / 468 / 614 physical damage.\r\n- Cooldown: 100 / 80 / 60 seconds.\r\n- Some Shields for example: Black Shield, Flow, Titan's Wrath\r\n\r\nLore Part\r\n\r\n_The Last Dance_\r\n\r\n\"So this is it, huh? This is how it all ends?\", I asked, as I looked at the waging war outside. The united forces of Valoran were decimating ours faster than we imagined. \"Yes, this was our last battle together... for now.\", said a deep, bassy voice behind me.\r\nI turned around to look at my leader and master. I've been his right hand in more battles than I could count by now.\r\n\"You can't be serious to just... stay here and let them overrun you!\", I complained. He slowly stood up from the throne he was sitting on and grabbed his huge Mace to rest it on his shoulder. An imposing figure and a sight of Terror on the Battlefield.\r\n\"I've made my choice Tersah. You've served me well. I know you will again... after this.\"\r\nThe first few soldiers were now banging on the massive door of the throne room, probably trying to break in with a ram. We took one look at the door, then he looked back at me and gave me a blue gem, the size of my palm. \"You know what you have to do.\", he said.\r\nOh, I did. But I didn't want to. I closed my hand around the blue gem and looked up at him. \"And you are sure you don't require my assistance anymore, my lord?\" - \"Tersah, there is no more time for this!\", he said as the banging grew louder. \"I understand.\", I said, holding one of my swords in front of my chest.\r\n\"Farewell, my lord. Heroes may die...\" - \"...but Legends shall return.\", he finished, holding his free hand in front of his chest.\r\nAs is stowed my sword in their holsters on my back and walked away from him, I heard the door to the throne room crash. I risked one look back and saw the angry forces of Valoran storming the room. Elites, judiging by their armor. Mordekaiser turned around ever so slowly and swung his gigantic Mace at the first few unlucky soldier, sending them flying against a wall, which they met with a wet crunch.\r\nThen I ran towards the secret entrance of the tunnel, which would lead me to the Citadel. I quickly jumped into the hole behind the throne and made sure\r\nto close it by pulling the face tile on top of the hole again. Good thing the tunnel only had one direction, because it was dark as night down here.\r\nA little bit later I ran into a wall.\r\nAfter some cursing, I kicked in the entrance and walked inside the Citadel. I began my search for the magical relic I was supposed to find here. And found it some time later: A stone circle on a podest, cut into 3 pieces, which was kept afloat by magic.\r\nI picked out the blue gem Mordekaiser gave me and put it in the middle of the circle. Immidiatly, it was grabbed by 3 blue and purple magic vines, holding it in the middle. After it was held there for a while, I tried breaking it with my swords, but to no avail.\r\n\"Good.\", I mumbled to myself. \"That will keep them away from it.\"\r\nThen, for the last test, I tried simply grabbing it, but got shocked in return. I knew what I had to do. It was so simple, yet I was... afraid? Get it together, Tersah. There is no time for stalling!, I thought to myself and touched the blue stone. I could feel it pulsating, grabbing onto me, draining me of... something? No, it was my soul and I knew it.\r\nBut it was the only way to see him again. After the Crystal drained me, I just felt... hollow.\r\nWell, now it was only a matter of time before the remaining troops would find the Citadel. I sat down on the floor and sharpened my blades. Let them come. I had nothing more to loose.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nAbout 5 hours later they finally found the old Citadel, as I was meditating with my back to the door. They quickly surrounded me, pointing their swords, spears and other weapons at me. I stayed calm and kept sittting down. Then I heard a familiar voice behind me, approaching with slow and steady steps.\r\n\"Tersah, the Ebony Edge. Right Hand of Mordekaiser. You have been sentenced to death by the Law of Valoran. If you have any last words, say them now.\"\r\nI laughed. \"That's not the way you treat a lady, Admiral Vergo.\", I said and stood up to face him. I took a long look at the man who had chased me for so long, yet never succeeded. Until today. He had short, white hair, a full beard and had a long scar over his left, blind eye, where he got too close to one of my blades last time. I holstered my swords and took slow steps towards him. His men readied their weapons, but he told them to stand down with a sign of his hand. I finally got behind him, put my hands on his shoulders and whispered in his ear: \"You know you can't best me. That's why I'll make you an offer to keep some of your men alive. Half of them may retreat, half of them shall stay, so I don't feel all too bored.\"\r\nI gave him a quick smooch on the cheek and walked back to where I came from. It took him a while, but then his raspy voice spoke again. \"You heard her. Retreat and don't wait for me or anyone else. This will be over quick.\", he said with false confidence.\r\nAbout 50 men slowly lowered their weapons and walked out of the Citadel.\r\n\"Well, I'm waiting. Come and get me love.\", I taunted. That was enough to fully provoke him. \"Get her!\", he yelled at his men.\r\nThey charged me. All at once. Poor fools. They didn't know how I fight, didn't know how I would attack. Why? Because I never left any survivors to tell about my techniques.\r\nTime went slower as I took a deep breath and unsheathed my swords from my holsters. Then I started spinning my blades around me, felt them piercing flesh and cutting bones. I mowed them down like a sharp scythe cuts tall grass. It was satisfying. At the end of my dance, there were only 20 of the once 50 men still standing, too terrified to fight. What a pity. I guess I expected too much.\r\nI quickly dashed from one to another, faster than they could react. Some tried blocking me with their shield, but I just pierced right through those poorly crafted things. Now it was only 10 more, which were running for their lives. I giggled and shut the door with a lever beside me. \"Ah ah ah. Nobody leaves the party.\", I said with a mad grin. I buried my swords in the ground and ingited them. The flames were running across the floor, hungry, searching for things they could burn. They found them seconds later as the smell of burned flesh and the screams of the last 10 echoed through the hall.\r\n\"...and zero. That only leaves...\" - \"...me!\", Vergo said from behind me. \"You are a deadly opponent, but you missed one target. Your legacy ends here.\"\r\nThen his scimitar cut me open fro thighs to shoulders. Strangely, I felt no pain as I dropped to the floor. I half cried, half laughed as I was bleeding out.\r\n\"No... I will return... You are the one who will die here today...\", I shouted at him, as he was walking away.\r\nI picked up my black sword and threw it with all of my remaining strength at his back. My Blade did not disappoint me. It found it's target and pierced through his back, through his heart. I saw him trying to pull the sword out, but he only got his hands up before he fell over. That was all the satisfaction I needed. I let my head rest on the floor and allowed the darkness to consume me, succumbing to my wounds.\r\n\r\n_Resurgence_\r\n\r\n\"I don't think that's a good idea, Bralof. This place has been abandoned for a reason. I think we should loot another place.\", I said as we were approaching one of the old and long forgotten battlefields. Skeletons were laying everywhere. Must have been a real war they fought here.\r\n\"And that is exactly why we are here. All those other Scavengers are too afraid to go here and that just means more untouched loot for us. Maybe we'll even find some real treasure here.\", Bralof said as he picked up and old, rusty halberd. Seeing that it was just standard-issue, he threw it away. Since they were very simple to steal, they wouldn't get you a lot on the black market. We really had no luck this day as it seemed.\r\nAs we continued to move in further, crushing bones as we marched on, all we found were standard Valoran weapons and armor and even stranger ones, which turned into ash when we tried to pick them up.\r\n\"Curses! I thought those \"old battlefields\" were supposed to be full of good stuff!\", Bralof shouted and angrily kicked and armored skeleton out of his way.\r\nAs I surveyed the Battlefield, a small hole in the distance caught my eye. \"Maybe the treasure isn't always in plain sight...\", I suggested and pointed at the hole. It was barely big enough for 1 man. Bralof just looked at me, as if I'd lost my mind. \"Are you insane, Tristan? The only way a hole can lead is either underground, into a cavern or into an underground cavern. And that's no place I want to be in.\" - \"But a Battlefield full of bones is ok? Well, you can stay here and try your luck some more, but I will explain that ominous hole.\", I said and marched towards it.\r\nI heard some curses behind me, then Bralof stomped after me. As we arrived, I looked down for a bit. I swear, I could see a faint light at the end of this tunnel. As I was going in, Bralof told me one last thing: \"Whatever is down there I hope it's expensive. Otherwise I'll be really mad at you!\"\r\nI just chuckled and continued the downward leading path. It got really dark one time to the point where we even had to light a torch, but the light remained ahead. After what felt like an eternity, we finally left the tunnel and were amazed by the view. We landed in some kind of inner court of an old city!\r\nSadly though, most of the buidlings were destroyed by a landslide. Only one was still standing, a Citadel. That was also where the light I saw came from.\r\nIt had somewhat of a glowing protection around it, holding away the stones.\r\n\"Well, that sure is ominous...\", I said. Even Bralof nodded in agreement. \"But if there is one place here that holds anything of worth...\", he said and pointed at the Citadel \"...it's in there. And I'll be damned if I'm scared away by some glowy magic hocus pocus.\"\r\nHe unsheathed his Greatsword and rested it on his shoulder. I got my Morningstar from the holster on my hip, flailed it a bit and nodded at Bralof.\r\nIt took the strength of both of us to open the massive wooden doors. I don't know what I expected, but the first thing we saw were charred skeletons.\r\nWait, charred? How did that happen?\r\nAfter giving the church a blunt lookover, we decided there were no threats in range and holstered our weapons again. \"Oh boy, now would you look at that!\", Bralof called out as he was inspecting one of the skeletons. It had a strange sword sticking in his chest, the hands of it clasping to the blade of the sword. It also had a faded coat of an admiral on his shoulder and a still intact scimitar was laying next to it. Bralof threw away his Greatsword.\r\n\"Oh man, you were right. Stuff like this is what will make us rich!\", he said, equipping the scimitar and stowing the coat.\r\nThat was when I noticed a skeletonin black armor laying on the floor, a few steps away from the admiral. At first I thought that the armor was charred like the skeletons we saw earlier, but as I got closer I saw that it was some kind of black metal. Probably ebony. Hold up! Black armor? I took a look at the Sword that was stuck in the former admiral. No Way! \"Oh my...\", I whispered. \"What is it?\", Bralof asked and looked over my shoulder. As he saw the armor, he looked back at me and said: \"Man, do you have any idea how much gold this will get us, if we sell it to Noxus? We'll never have to go scavenging again!\"\r\nThat was the moment when I noticed a pulsating light from a podest nearby, in the middle of the Citadel. It was some sort of blue gem, stuck in some magical stone circle relic. I slowly got up and walked towards it. Bralof stayed back, still not believing our discovery. As soon as I got close, I tried grabbing it, which I immidiatly regretted when I got a shock in return. \"Hmmm...\", I said and looked at the armor. I saw a small engravement in the middle of the chest piece. So I walked back and took the Chestpiece. \"Hey, what are you doing?!\", Bralof asked. But I didn't respond. As I had it, I walked to the gem and held the engravement towards it. The relic let loose of it's magic, snapping the gem in it's rightful place on the chestpiece, but collapsing in the process.\r\n\"Gotcha!\", I said complacent. Suddenly, Bralof shouted at me from behind: \"You Idiot! Do you have any Idea what you did?!\"\r\nApparently not. Then, the Chestpiece started vibrating and got ripped away from me by an invisible force. It flew towards the middle of the Citadel, the other armor pieces were doing the same. Black Mist started pouring out of it, connecting all of the pieces and some yellow eyes appeared in the Visor of the helmet.\r\n\"That. Was. A. Soulgem. But not just any Soulgem, you just summoned the right Hand of Mordekaiser.\",Bralof kept yelling and shook me.\r\n\"Come again?\", I asked. \"The Ebony Edge...?\", he answered. I gulped. Then we looked at the armor again. It was now fully connected.\r\nOut of nowhere, there was a blinding flash and the both of us sat down hard.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nI took a deep breath. I was back in the world of the living. More or less. As my sight returned, I took a quick glance over my body. My armor looked like new, no sign of the Cut from Vergo anymore. But now it had some fancy purple and blue vines, thin as a hair, going all over my armor, coming from the soulgem.\r\nThen I noticed my Skin Color. Or more like: My mist. Thing is, I didn't have a skin anymore, but was now consisting of pretty much some sort of really dark mist, about the same color of my armor, connecting all the pieces. As I glanced over my new \"body\", I saw my own Skeleton still laying where it fell.\r\n\"Huh, good thing I won't be needing that any longer.\", I said with a hollow, echoing voice. I looked at my chest again and noticed that the blue gem was pulsating like a heart would beat. Then I heard some bones crack and turned to where the sound came from. It came from 2 Scavengers, which were trying to back away from me. One in an respectful set of armor, and long and braided beard like a dwarf and... Vergo's Scimitar. The other one just had brown rags, looked a bit younger than his companion, had blonde hair and a deadly Morningstar hanging on his hip. But nonetheless, these were just scavengers.\r\nNo real fight for me. The older one got nervous. \"Erm, we were just about to leave. Soooo, son't mind us and we'll be right away.\"\r\nI just looked at him, then the lever. It still looked functional, even after God knows how long. I pulled it once again and the doors responded by closing.\r\nNow the younger one got a bit nervous too, having nowhere to run.\r\nI felt like taunting them a bit, so I stretched my muscles, flexed my arms and so on before asking: \"You do know who this Scimitar once belonged to, don't you?\". The dwarf guy looked at his new weapon, then quickly threw it away, as if it was burning him. \"I don't take gently towards those who pick up arms of my enemy, nor towards grave robbers. But I shall grant you 5 seconds to prepare.\", I said and pulled out my swords. He tried holding up a Noxian Greatsword in defense. I just looked at him and chuckled. Then I dashed towards him. He didn't expect, I'd throw a sword at him, but to my surprise, he blocked it. That didn't matter though, because a heartbeat later, I was behind him. He was still focused on my first sword when I pierced through his heart from behind. As I let that lifeless sack of meat drop, I turned towards the younger one. He just stood there, apparently impressed by my technique.\r\n\"Any last words?\", I asked, sounding bored. \"Let's talk. Without me, you wouldn't be here after all. I was the one who connected the gem.\", he answered.\r\nA smart and bold one. I liked that. \"Well then, so be it.\", I said and holstered my weapons. We just sat down where we stood. He told me everything I wanted to know. It has been centuries until he resurrected me and the immortal Bastion was now the Capital of Noxus. He even told me where to find my Master nowadays. \"Last rumors about him were that he returned at the Heart of the Immmortal Bastion, seemingly out of nowhere.\", he said.\r\nYes, that sounded like Mordekaiser. \"Thanks for all the info, Scavenger, You really did help me. I could let you go now...\", I said and his eyes lit up with hope. They quickly turned into shock though, as I slit his throat with one swift strike. \"...but I leave no suriviors.\", I whispered and kissed him on the lips, before he fell over and bled out rapidly. I went to the door lever and pulled it. The doors of the Citadel reopened. \"Well, I have a promise to keep. This new world will soon remember the Name Tersah.\", I mumbled and walked towards the door.\r\n\"Just one last thing I have to do before I can reunite with my master.\" I lifted one hand and placed it on the gem, the Black Mist flowing into it, corrupting it, darkening it. \"Time to see what the Afterlife looks like...\", I said and a strange portal opened in front of me. It was black and white but not seperated more like warped together. I stepped inside without fear, curious what would await me beyond. As soon as I entered the Realm of the Dead, I started to hear whispers in the Back of my Head. He didn't mention THAT before. Let's hope I wasn't going insane. Then I found what he had done all this time here. The sight was pretty impressive, an entire Kingdom forged by his will, shaped after his former, mortal Kingdom. But as impressive as it was, my Goal was elsewhere. Somewhere very familiar. After some time i finally reached the Citadel... again. It was guarded by 2 Spirits, but it seemed like they couldn't see me. So i just walked on in and found immidiatly what I looked for: The Stone Relic. It was back up again and awaiting me. \"I hope you're right Master. Because if this doesn't work, someone is gonna be really mad with someone.\", I said and took a deep breath... or I would if I could. Then I ripped the corrupted Gem out of my Chest and placed it in the Relic, establishing my Link to the Realm of Death. Just seconds after, I was sent back into the mortal Realm, my wraith body still intact.\r\nA strange sensation coursed through me and I knew it worked. I could sense where my master was now. I sighed happily. \"Time for a Reunion. I hope you missed me.\" and continued walking to where my new sense told me to.\r\n\r\n_Epilogue_\r\nThe Lord of Death walked through those Halls he had known so well. He looked around. Most of his Creation was still as it used to be. But he was still at the very Heart of the Bastion. Unlikely that the Noxians changed anything here, even after centuries. \"Finally. It has been... too long.\", he said with deep voice and walked onward. A ghastly spirit walked beside him, visible to only his eye. \"Are you sure this is a good plan my lord? You ARE all alone.\", his general said.\r\n\"Be assured that I have thought about every eventuality. Nothing will stop my...\", Mordekaiser started but came to a sudden halt. \"What is it, my Lord? Everything alright?\", the General asked in concern. \"I sense something. I presence I've not felt since...\", he responded looking down. After a few moments he looked up again, his voice betraying a faint hint of Happiness. \"She did it.\" \"Excuse me my lord, but who did it?\", the General asked once again. Mordekaiser marched on and just repsonded in one sentence: \"Someone I've been awating for a long time...\"","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-09-07T15:57:05.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her Q is still identical to Fiora's.
