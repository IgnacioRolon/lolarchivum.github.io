If you try to put me in a leave buster queue I'm gonna be furious. this is your fault not mine. Fix it","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-07T21:40:24.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was it a bugsplat error?  It sounds like your game files may have corrupt, maybe during patching or updating your client.  If you are using the updated client then a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends)would be your best bet, otherwise you can try the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367).  Getting a leaverbuster isn't fun, so be sure to try it out in a custom match to prevent any further LPQs.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
