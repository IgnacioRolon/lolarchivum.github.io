Riot might already have started to work on this but maybe it could be solved like the mastery system? If I'm just blind and haven't noticed it then please let me know xd \r\n~~w0lftamer {{champion:203}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T21:43:23.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"With Honor being such a new system that's meant to promote teamwork, we didn't want players to feel that the system was \"grindy\". If we had a sort of experience bar for Honor, a lot of people would feel pressured to grind honors and possibly beg others to be honored. It's something we might be able to add in the future, but I don't have any info on that yet.","replies":[{"poster":"StrandedSmurf","date":"2017-08-06T14:39:39.751+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People already beg.","replies":[{"poster":"Finders Keepers","date":"2017-10-12T03:03:29.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=StrandedSmurf,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=V8FTEzcE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-08-06T14:39:39.751+0000)\n>\n> People already beg.\n\nGiving out reward ward skins will make them beg more.. point of xp bar not being there is ?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
