The 4g network is super fast and stable, but I can't afford the 1gb hit to my data cap.\r\n\r\nThis is a temporary issue. Once we get wi-fi in a week, and/or my bank account is created and I can sign up for a better mobile plan with more data, this won't be an issue.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime however, I just want to play league :(\r\n\r\nIs there nothing that can be done!?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nBrodie","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-24T00:23:55.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How are you returning to the legacy client?  It's using the same files as the updated client so nothing needs to update.  You should be able to access the legacy client this way:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know if that solves this issue!","replies":[{"poster":"Raiyan","date":"2016-11-24T08:35:54.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi There!\n\nI've just tried...\n\n* Launching the legacy client, using the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text in the bottom-right corner of the new client.\n\n* Launched using the lol.launcher.exe , as well as using the lol.launcher.admin.exe , in the \"League of Legends\" Folder.\n\nBoth of these result in my needing to download an 850+mb patch [http://puu.sh/ssLIp.jpg]\n\nHowever, Launching the new client lets me straight in; ready to play a game, chat with friends, etc.\n\n\nI recently transferred my league of legends folder from an external HDD, to my laptop's SSD, if this could possibly influence anything requiring specific directories or the like?\n\nIf there's any additional information I can provide, please let me know :)\n\nThank you for your assistance.","replies":[]}]}]}
