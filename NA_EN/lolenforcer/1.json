I know I do bad in two of these games pretty horribly but is that really a reason to ban me for 14 days?  This honestly makes me so sad.  I am a decent player but I have not been playing good lately because I have a slight tremor and it has been worse for the last few weeks.  I even won the Gangplank game and I got many assists and good vision score.  \n\nI do remember in the Ahri game she was extremely mad at me the entire game even though I got her first blood, but I didn't talk to her that much.   I also remember being typed at in chat in the Gangplank and Ash games, but I didn't talk that much in the Ash game and tried to stay positive.  The Gangplank game at the endchat I joked with the enemy team and they all reported me because they were very upset they lost to me.\n\nI am glad it is a temp ban instead of a permanent ban but this has shaken my faith in riots system because basically I am higher then where I should be in my mmr ranking I think.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-07-28T06:24:17.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aye dear...... these games look pretty legit, you just preformed badly, your best luck is to go [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and submit a ticket.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheWizardM","date":"2018-07-28T06:00:37.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I can tell by the graphs it looks like in the gangplank lane you lost because you happened to get hooked by blitz quite early on. The shaco game doesn't even look close to inting - 8 deaths is far less than you'd expect from someone who is actually inting, and your first death is at a time where both teams were even so it was probably a failed gank.
