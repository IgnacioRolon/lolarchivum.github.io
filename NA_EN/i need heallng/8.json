She will have to farm with Q, and that means she doesn't get an auto off to heal, or a Q on you for harass.\n\nIf you let her get a double Q proc on you, you probably deserve it tbh. Akali's success is based off of the mistakes of her enemy. Her entire design is based on punishing bad positioning.\n\nIf she Ws agressively, punish her while it's down. If she uses it defensively, then congrats. She's scared of you. Abuse her. \n\nAkali succeeds mid game if she didnt fall behind in the early game, but late game, or whatever you call that part of the game where the ADC comes online, she's worthless again, so she has to split push.

About the same distance as a Riven's third Q. And it has a cast time almost completely negating the jump distance.\n\nDoes spamming an ability completely negated by Doran's shield at rank one really do anything for you? No. Doesn't matter if it's 1 or 20, you're negating it by simply having Doran's Shield. Pick up Specter's Cowl, and you've negated initial damage at _all ranks_.\n\n> She can literally already use it again the moment the mark times out, basically being able to perma pressure you.\n> And her Q W aa combo already hurts early.\n\nQ>W>AA what? A minion? _She isn't getting close enough to anyone with her W_. You have to literally _walk up to her_ for it to matter.\n\n> Her sustain is maybe not the best early, but it is still there.\n\nYeah. It's pretty much identical to the feast mastery.\n\n> On almost no CD, and tied to no costs.\n\n8s CD. That's longer than a number of cool downs...\n\n> With just some basic AP you can already heal enough to survive until 6, from when it just becomes broken.\n\nUnless they decide to poke her. Or are ranged. Or are Kassadin. Fun fact: She can't beat Kassadin, unless he's completely braindead _and_ afk.\n\n> Her W being a Zhonyas?\n> That was the worst example I ever heard.\n> When your enemy has Zhonyas, you know **when and where** you have to hit.\n\nYou know where as well. In the zone. And you can't hurt anyone in Zhonya's anyways. Treat it just like Zhonya's.\n\nYou can also use a control ward or sweepers to reveal where she is. She's still untargetable, but you know where she is.\n\n> Also, Zhonyas doesn&#x27;t last 8 seconds and has a laughable 18 seconds CD without CDR.\n\n18s CD is longer than most toplaner's abilities...And she can't rush CDR and do well.\n\n> She can just hit you and go invis again while healing up.\n\nPick one. You can't heal _and_ be invisible. Attacking breaks invisibility.\n\n> Also, she can leave and easily disengage from every angle and moment.\n\nUnless she's CC'd.\n\n> At least we once had these things called Pink Wards that would counter that shit, but Riot says nope.\n\nFun fact: You can still hurt her. She can still be seen, revealed, and hit. You just can't AA her or use point and click abilities on her when she's invisible. Try using a sweepers on her next time.\n\n> Her whole burst being delayed isn&#x27;t a problem for her cause she can heal up and be invis every time she basically wants to.\n\nHer heal is crap in early, and outclassed by Gunblade in late. And you can't \"become invisible whenever you want\" if it's on an 18s CD...\n\n> The whole champ is just broken and the definition of unhealthy gameplay.\n\nBroken? No. Unhealthy? Yes. She needs a mini-rework, to make her less shitty before 6, and not instakill as soon as she reaches level 6, and then going back to being useless in late-game.\n\n> Especially her W duration is just BS.\n\nW duration is her least useful thing. It really is. Now, it's actually somewhat useful, since 75g doesn't completely invalidate it, but it's still her least useful thing. I end up only using it to get back cooldowns while my team fights, and as a way to get past my own minions. Sometimes I'll attempt to use it to slow the enemy team down when they're chasing my allies. But the only time the ability's really been _useful_ is when I'm dived.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I NEED HEALlNG","date":"2017-09-25T21:05:04.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DuskDaUmbreon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4cM0RQXE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-09-22T01:33:42.582+0000)\n>\n> &quot;Broken&quot;.\n> \n> Give me a good reason why you seem to think so.\n> \n> Before you pull out bullshit:\n> \n> * No, she can&#x27;t trade before level 6.
