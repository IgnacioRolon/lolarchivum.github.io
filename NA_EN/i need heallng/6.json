While bot laners may give their partners a lot of shit of stuff like.\n\n\"oh this adc/support sucks dick\" in all reality unless that dude is a total fucking moron, having a bot lane partner, makes you so much safer vs being a lone mid laner or top laner. Fun fact, When jhin was first released he had a lot of tools that showed he could of been a capable mid laner, and fact is if you take him to a one v one duel in mid lane, he actually stomps a lot of different match ups. His core issue in why he's not a mid laner is largely because he is so fucking easy to camp. Literally any jungler can just walk up to jhin and kill him in and one v two scenario. if jhin doesn't have flash he's a straight up gonner when it comes to ganks. Same philsophy with brand. Brands only option without flash, in many scenarios, is just to just flash out attempt to kill you.

In the mid lane it's a lot harder to poke the enemy because Brand needs to get close, which draws minion agro if you try to combo the enemy with more than just his pillar. You can hit the odd pillar if you're good with it, but it's much easier to do that bot lane where you can combo off of minions and two champions - while using bushes (which I think help a lot). \n\nI think the core issue with Brand support is that it's so hard to poke with him in the mid lane, and he's very mana gated. In bot lane he doesn't need to CS, so he can use his strong early base damage to zone the enemy off CC while getting to ignore CS completely. Brand was a very good support well before they increased the amount of gold you get from support items. I think the problem is his kit is combo oriented and AE based, which is where it can be utilized better bot lane because there is two champs to play off of. He definitely gets a lot of gold due to his passive, but I really think his kit is just bad for mid lane. I'd love for him to be a mid laner... but I find way more success with him as a support.
