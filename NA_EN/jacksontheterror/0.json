I was at 0 LP in my rank and division. I won two games and was forced to dodge one in the client. I check today and I'm at 27 LP. There is no way I'm getting 15 lp a game. It should be 19-20. Can I get like a full record of my games and LP won and lost somewhere?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-03T20:50:25.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account and it seems you've had a trend of dodges recently. Dodging loses you LP and frequent dodging will result in bigger LP penalties for dodges. These dodges and their LP penalties are what's bringing down your LP total, and I recommend avoiding dodging in the future to avoid LP loss. \n\nFor complete details on this, be sure to check out our [Queue Dodging FAQ. ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
