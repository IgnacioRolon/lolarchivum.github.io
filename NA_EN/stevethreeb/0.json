I made the sad mistake of buying this skin just to find that it has no special ability particle effects, and nothing happens when you feast, besides \"nom.nom.nom\" which if im not mistaken his base model does that. \r\n\r\nCan we get a visual update for this skin? or reduce the price and get refunded the difference? \r\n\r\nHope everyone is having a good day","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-03-19T21:20:21.513+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"You could have.. i dont know, looked at a skin spotlight before buying it?\n\nYou want a _refund_ because you bought something without knowing what it is?
