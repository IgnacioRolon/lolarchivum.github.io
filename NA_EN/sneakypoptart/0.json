I have a couple questions about the end game ranking. I understand the idea that S+ is on the high end and d- on the low end but I have had a couple games where i thought i definitely should have had an S- or better and did not receive that rank and other games where i thought there was no way i could have gotten an S rank and did. Not trying to be toxic or a pain I am just confused and was wondering what i should look for to improve my score and thus improve my playing capabilities.","replies":[]}
