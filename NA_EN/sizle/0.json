If you could coordinate well with 4 other trists, you could still do it in about 5 seconds. Trist #1 bombs, all AA, Trist #2 bombs, all AA, Trist #3 bombs, all AA, etc. I wanna see how fast that turret goes down. But then again, all Naysus trinity force is probably faster, if we're gonna go there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Princess Emma","date":"2015-10-20T06:29:56.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went up against an all Tristana team.\nThe auto attacks from other Tristanas do trigger the damage boost from the E, an I THINK you can stack her E on a turret.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-20T08:00:29.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Princess Emma,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=QQiTRJ3g,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-20T06:29:56.682+0000)\n>\n> I went up against an all Tristana team.\n> The auto attacks from other Tristanas do trigger the damage boost from the E, an I THINK you can stack her E on a turret.\n\nThat begs question #2: So, if you CAN stack e's on turrets, does a single auto from one trist boost the damage of all E's currently on the tower?","replies":[{"poster":"Masked Lunatic","date":"2015-10-20T09:38:29.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because the e cannot stack that isn't a possibility, just to make sure it's clear.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Masked Lunatic","date":"2015-10-20T09:37:07.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This comes from actually playing trist in one for all (against darius btw). \n\nHer e does not stack ontop of each other, instead an additional e will detonate the previous one instantly and continue as usual (its the same for whatever target it's used on e.g. turrets).\n\nAlso any aa from a trist asists in the e stacks of another trists e (I'm referring to the damage stack) .","replies":[]}]}
