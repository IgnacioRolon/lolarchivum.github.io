There is an option in-game via video settings to cap your framerate.  Let me know if that option helps!","replies":[{"poster":"9GAG","date":"2017-12-07T23:31:44.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is what i do. i cap it at 60 fps with the wait for vsync option checked just below the fps cap options.","replies":[]}]}]}
