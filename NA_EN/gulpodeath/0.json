Riot claims they have a new system in place that is better and that they are rolling it out slowly. The truth is, I believe, they are doing no such thing. It is easier for them to pay a few people to post on Reddit that they were punished for something, rather than actually implementing some kind of real system. It is all a farce. Ask them to prove to you that anyone has really been punished in the last year and all they will do is point you to Reddit where anyone can post anything, true or not. The truth, Riot doesn&#039;t give a shit about toxicity. They will say they do, but it is all a dog-and-pony show. Asking them to tell the truth is like asking a televangelist to admit that they are really in it for the money.","replies":[{"poster":"freya od","date":"2015-09-12T07:12:34.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"uhhh, i got two-week banned. for not even hardly being toxic. got a bunch of bullshit chat restrictions for being _sarcastic_, not even toxic, then had one game where i blew up at a troll who intentionally fed & pinged the map 24/7 to piss us off. and this was a \"trigger game\" to ban me for 2 weeks, after just fine behavior and uncalled-for chat restrictions. \n\nbut the reality is their current system is heavily flawed, so that's why they're giving people clean slates and re-releasing \"a whole new, better, and fun for everyone automated system\" because riot is too fucking stupid to make the tribunal faster, they'd rather roll out a goddamn automated system for this bullshit. they're never bringing the real tribunal back.","replies":[]}]}
