Why does taric have to be an ugly gay guy? Why cant he be an attractive gay guy that the ladies cant have? Nice look, nice armour. What lady doesnt like jewels? You know give him some nice armour like Kayle {{champion:10}}  and Garen {{champion:86}}  But make him pretty kinda like EZ {{champion:81}} and Jayce {{champion:126}} . Give em those piercing eyes that every women would fall into with a smirk and tada, Taric is a real something. Also the long Thick flowing hair. Maybe scale Him up to about Garen {{champion:86}}  and Braums {{champion:201}}  Size. Slim him slightly like {{champion:2}} and {{champion:80}} , keep him toned and slim the Hammer a bit.
