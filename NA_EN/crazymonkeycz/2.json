Like running into enemy jungle to counter jungle and then expecting other lanes to save them if it goes wrong but not taking into consideration that those lanes may not be able to do it in that moment. They dont care about anyone but themselves they are the heros of the game in their minds. And I tell you most Jungle players are like this and its aids. It's why I want jungle power reduced, the entire game shouldnt revolve around these players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sea Slug Menace","date":"2019-05-24T09:27:18.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ur smurf account.. was created to run it down? god damn riot get on this man.","replies":[]}]}
