This is why I CONSTANTLY play him. Once you figure out your enemies attack patterns it becomes trivial to Q W them and make the afraid to try it again. Getting ganked? Like Cho cares. Q W walk away. E slowly ticks away at health while farming and it will take 10 minutes for your enemy to realize this is happening. His Ult, aside from the obvious health and true damage, comes with a \"This person will die\" Indicator making its use very easy. Finally No matter how you build him he gets tons of health. Even as a tank Cho's extra health allows for room to buy some damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"masterdragon481","date":"2015-06-28T02:58:38.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cho is so incredibly hard to gank successfully that every lane becomes a farm lane, which favors chogath because of his devastating teamfight capability.
