I had a pretty good game even though we lost, dealing over 100k damage, and ended up getting an S. It gave me a chest since I hadn't gotten one on him, but not a mastery token. I was already at mastery 5 heading into the game, so I don't know why I didn't get one.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-20T22:44:18.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the confusion here, tokens are currently only available on Summoner's Rift.

Also, I feel like riot should extend it to where people can get them from the other maps and modes too. A good score comes with work no matter the mode or map.","replies":[]}]}]}
