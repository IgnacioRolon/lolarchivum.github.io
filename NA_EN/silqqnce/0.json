So many people are screaming at me to stick to 3-4 champs, and not to roam around a gigantic pool of champs and roles. \r\n\r\nI'm looking for champs that I can play that can snowball leads easily, and that are actually challenging but rewarding to play. To sum it up, I want to play champions that can carry solo que, get those early plays and carry your team to victory. I don't want to play champions that are literally overpowered, but completely boring or redundant to play. For example, I don't like champs like {{champion:6}} or {{champion:11}}  or{{champion:157}}  or {{champion:23}} or {{champion:420}} . I want to play champions that are able to carry their games through wide variety of possibilities, and open to chances of outplays that can be easily underestimated. Champs that are too straightforward and only focused on winning like the 5 above are not for me, and I'm looking for champs like {{champion:105}}  or{{champion:266}}or  {{champion:84}} or {{champion:121}}. I've picked up {{champion:38}}  lately, and I'm having a blast in completely squashing enemies after the 30 minute mark, and snowballing hard to roam and win the games with enough fun in skill to be satisfied. I want champions that are not too easy to win, but those that require a medium to high skill cap to have fun in the game, but all the while completely destroying the solo que.\r\n\r\nI'll be looking forward for the suggestions to {{summoner:4}} up the Elo!","replies":[]}
