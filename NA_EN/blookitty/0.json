I was just playing a norm game with my bf and when the game loaded my resolution wasn&#039;t right and it was cutting off the bottom of the screen (I couldn&#039;t see my skill bar, chatbox, or mini map. (We fixed it afterwards, turned out to be a TV setting). I tried to do the best that I could as Riven, but once you fall behind it is hard to catch up. My bf even told everyone in game it was a resolution issue and even died while afk under the turret trying to fix it (he was playing as Lux). I feel like I would have been better off leaving the game once I fell so far behind as I most likely wouldn&#039;t have been banned or would have been banned for a shorter duration. Is that the lesson Riot is trying to teach? I feel pretty bad about this because I never say anything mean in chat I just try to do a good job playing. I used to play ranked (climbed from bronze to silver last season) but the people in game would get so mad when we lost that I started to only play norms as I just like having fun playing with my bf. My best friend just ordered a laptop and the three of us were hoping to all play together when it comes in the mail, and now I got a 14 day ban :(\n\nIf you look at last few minutes of the game Ziggs wasn't even fighting anymore even though the rest of us tried until the end. Why doesn't he get a ban for giving up while I get a ban for trying? Perhaps the auto ban system shouldn't apply to feeding cases since sometimes players report feeding on someone who is having a bad game.","replies":[{"poster":"blookitty","date":"2017-02-07T04:22:37.593+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hooray Riot fixed it!!!! They also reminded me about the remake function. I'll be reading up on it for sure before I start another game in case any other technical issues happen. I did fix the resolution one though. My bf found a \"fit to screen\" option hidden in the settings. I need to work on not feeding when I fall behind next time in a tough lane match up. I had never seen a Tristana top before and had no idea how to deal with her range, damage, and that frustrating escape. \n\nThanks everyone for the morale support.
