I strongly agree with the point that Riot games should change the policy of how they give somebody permaban. You can literally get your account permanently banned for saying useless, bad af, dumb or stupid and other not very offensive words. and you used them because they made you use it. Feed on purpose ruined the game, stood afk, harassed you first just for telling them please play safe or to gank you. Some of the words I used above are still a little offensive but it is not something racistic, something that offends nationality or religion. So why do you have do give a permaban? I got this account banned 6 months ago. Texted support every month to unban me. Told them that I am improved and when I played I was always against any unreasonable harassment. But you know what? They still ban ppl who really care about their game investing a lot of time, money into it, trying to share about it with your friends to make it's auditory even bigger. The main issue why this happens because small kids who are playing this game can't control their behavior and what they are writing. The game doesn't have voice chat so you can not properly communicate and talk to the team and if they had one those small kids won't harass an old guy right? The regular chat is not good for callouts, you just wouldn't have enough time to write some strategy which can win you game, and the only main reason people usually use it is to offend somebody because they are completely ruining your game not because they are bad at the game. It is facts. In conclusion, I think they have to do something with this issue. Why do you give people permaban and completely restrict access to the game if for example, you can just restrict using of chat and you can give callouts through pings? Isn't restricting chat permanently as a final form of the suspect as a penalty not much better than permaban?","replies":[]}
