We want to make sure that this can be dealt with and have the account returned to its original owner on its original server with its original name, and we don't want to give the person responsible enough time to do any more damage to the account.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-04T23:43:40.521+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, we can help!  Your friend submitting a ticket was a great plan, as our account team can help towards recovery.  If he doesn't have access to the account, then he might have problems accessing the ticketing site.  Instead, have him fill out an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) which doesn't require a login, and will instead go to the email he submits in the form.\n\nYour friend should go over our [account protection ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account) guide in the meantime to make sure his info is secure.  Thanks for looking out for him!","replies":[{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2017-03-05T00:00:44.358+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She already submitted the account recovery form, but it did not send a receipt of request to her email address.  That is what we are worried about right now.\n\nRiot Support Twitter guided us to the recovery form and said we should wait till Monday for a response.  She is just very worried about the account as it was transferred to EUNE and the name was changed.\n\nThank you for the response.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2017-03-05T17:47:00.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good Morning, I just wanted to update you on the status.
