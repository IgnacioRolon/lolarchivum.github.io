However, these changes would **incredibly increase** the value of the 5th stack making it even more worth than the baron buff. That&#039;s why I suggest to make it a lot more difficult to contest by **doubling the value of Ancient Grudge only for the 5th stack**. Friendly reminder:\n\nDragon has a UNIQUE Passive called &quot;Ancient Grudge&quot;, which grants it 20% bonus damage to and 7% damage reduction against enemies with Dragon Slayer, per stack.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/R4dFEer.png","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-01-30T19:44:31.072+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dragon and Baron having some of their power in things that aren't relevant in team fights is something we've done very deliberately to keep the amount those buffs snowball in line while still allowing them to be useful tools to end the game. Having extra pushing/sieging power allows you to try and crack the enemy base. The team that's behind on buffs isn't as behind on team fight power as they would be though if all of that power was in raw combat stats. Taking a team fight's often a viable option for them as a result (unless they're extremely behind regardless in which case the game's effectively over).  \n\nThe fourth dragon buff is also deliberately weaker than the previous three, given there's a lot of extra value inherent in then being one dragon kill away from 5 stacks, which puts a lot of pressure on the enemy team to either control dragon or end before you can get the next stack.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-01-31T08:57:53.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The fourth dragon buff is also deliberately weaker than the previous three, given there's a lot of extra value inherent in then being one dragon kill away from 5 stacks, which puts a lot of pressure on the enemy team to either control dragon or end before you can get the next stack.\n\nWhat if the fourth buff was purely defensive. Rather than being take 30% reduced damage from towers have it be your towers take x% reduced damage when a dragon buffed ally is near.\n\nThis way it creates a scenario where taking D4 allows you to easily stall for D5 and it creates more of a 'you have to fight me at dragon' scenario.","replies":[]},{"poster":"exe3","date":"2016-01-30T21:55:03.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any reason why you decided on 30% damage reduction from tower damage? Surely you saw all the threads popping up recently asking for tower buffs because they're quiet frankly useless, this just makes them even more so if a team gets 4 dragons (there's no gameplay in just being able to ignore towers, doubly so since tanks already can ignore towers and force fights in the enemies 'safe zone' without repercussion).\n\nI like the burn change however, it allows everyone, not just ADC's, to be more potent in damaging towers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2016-01-30T21:57:44.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"+3% CDR is pathetic though....","replies":[{"poster":"Sqkerg","date":"2016-01-30T22:10:57.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Until its doubled and you have 51% cdr...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"John Viande","date":"2016-01-31T00:44:38.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok you want to prevent the snowball to be too important.
