He never insulted me again. That was one of the 2 fights in my entire life not just my childhood. Simply because sometimes you have to respond to flame. No one will defend a pussy. You have to show balls to get respect and some peace.\nWhy did I insult him? Cuz I am a bad kid? Or maybe it is because he bullied me every day for almost 2 years. Should have \" flammed\" and beat him up much sooner. The \" report\" system did not work. In fact after the fight I was being called. They let me go once I said that 2 years this bastard had tormented me and they  had done nothing. They felt bad, I imagine.

The fact that you reached the point of getting banned for it shows that you have a pretty bad habit of being generally toxic.\n\n> ...as if the other player said nothing to me throughout the game...\n\nOther people misbehaving does not exempt you from the rules. Other people behaving worse than you does not absolve you of breaking the rules. Other people doing literally _anything_ does not change that you'll get punished for breaking the rules.\n\n> ...but im not such a bitch that i report people over it.\n\nThen you don't get to complain if the other party goes without punishment. Plain and simple.\n\n> You have the logs, you just ban the one who gets reported? Do you look at the whole conversation at all?\n\nWhile Riot and the IFS have access to all the chat logs in a given match, when you're reported, your behavior alone is what gets evaluated when the system determines whether or not to punish you. You alone are responsible for what you say or do; other people's behavior does not matter. It's _your_ behavior, and _your_ punishment, not theirs.\n\n> Everyone gets flamed all the time.\n\nHyperbole helps no-one.\n\n> Some of us just arent such [redacted] that we report people over it.\n\nAnd if you don't report people for their misbehavior, then, as I mentioned above, you have no right to complain if you get punished and they don't.\n\n> Call someone \"trash\" and get banned from something ive sunk money into.\n\nSomething that you've sunk money into, and that you've been warned a good few times before that you need to change your act if you don't want to lose it. That you ignored all your previous warnings is your own fault.\n\nAnd before it gets said; the [Code of Conduct](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse#account-termination) states that your account can be terminated at any time **with no refunds or liability to the account-holder.**\n\n> **2.2. What happens if my account is terminated? (No LoL for you.)**\n>\n> If your account is terminated, you’ll no longer have access to it, including any of the associated data or content (e.g., champions, skins, Riot Points, etc.). You’ll not be entitled to any refunds and we’ll have no liability to you. We also reserve the right to terminate any other accounts you may have created, as well as your access to any other Riot Services (also without any refunds or liability to you).\n> \n> You understand and agree that using the Riot Services comes with the risk that your account may be terminated or suspended and that, whenever you use the Riot Services, you’ll bear this risk in mind and always conduct yourself appropriately.\n\nBeyond that, the amount of money you've invested into the account has no bearing on whether or not you can get punished. It doesn't matter if you've spent a thousand dollars or haven't spent a single cent, if you break the rules, you can ultimately get banned.\n\n> Cant even dispute it just a box that says \"i understand\" lol fuckin bullshit.\n\nYou _could_ technically appeal a punishment, but I'll tell you now, you're not going to get this punishment lifted.
