Everything is fine up until I load into the game. When it starts it goes to the black screen right before the loading screen pops up but there is a portion of my desktop showing the the right of my screen from the top of my computer to the bottom.  It then goes straight to bugsplat and it asks me to send an error report. I cannot go into games at all. I even switched to the legacy client and the same thing happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-12T04:03:24.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you make any recent changes to your computer?

Im not sure what my resolution was before I corrected everything but my resolution looks exactly like i've always had it when I tested out the different ones to find my right setting. \n\nI run my resolution at 1680x1050.","replies":[]}]}]}
