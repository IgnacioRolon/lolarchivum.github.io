When I logged in, I noticed my resolution was enlarged. I was able to find a fix to it but then when I got into game (ranked unfortunately) my FPS sat between 5 and 7 the whole time. I literally could not play. Im trying to look for a solution to this problem at the moment. Has anyone experienced this issue or know a fix to it? Help would be much appreciated! Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-03T18:38:09.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a number of things that could be causing this. Since you specifically mentioned this happened after the Windows 10 update, I'd recommend [disabling the Windows Game Bar feature](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) that was updated in the most recent updates. This has been causing FPS issues and system freezes for some players, so I think it's a pretty good place to start.\n\nLet me know if your FPS issues persist through that change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-10-03T10:43:06.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, are you a Windows 10 user who got a recent W10 Anniversary update?
