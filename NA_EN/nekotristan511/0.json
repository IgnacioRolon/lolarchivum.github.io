I did get my icon for my group picks in worlds. Is there something I'm doing wrong? I've retaken the quiz several times and it says I've already received it. I took the quiz last Friday. Does it normally take this long for me to receive it? Any help would be great as Star Guardian Lux is my favorite skin in the game so the icon is something I would really like to have.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-14T03:17:51.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should be delivered by the end of today.
