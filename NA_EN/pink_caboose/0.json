A while ago, after a Windows update, my frame rate was capped at 60, even though the setting was set to uncapped. I eventually fixed this by going to the Xbox app and turning off the DVR. I figured this would be the issue as I recently installed new Windows updates. However, I made sure all the DVR settings are turned off and it is still happening. I've messed with all the settings (VSync, Anti-aliasing, graphics quality, and the cap on frame rate) but to no avail. Any ideas on how to get my frame rate back?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-22T00:21:29.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good first step going to check for that DVR function again. That thing has caused a few issues, but it seems like we'll have to look elsewhere this time. There are a few different things that could be causing this like missed driver updates or possibly even corrupted game files. You can run a quick repair through the client settings really quickly, but let's also be sure to hit the other steps in the [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) as well.","replies":[]}]}
