I contacted riot games 2 days ago asking for help. The thing is I got a ticket under the \"I need help recovering my account\" section. I got an email saying they will respond soon and they gave me a link so that way I can review my request. I tried to review my request to see if they responded but I need to sign in. How am I going to sign in if my account was hacked? I'm afraid they already responded but I just didn't get an email and the only way to see it is by opening the link and signing in. Or does riot take more than 2 days to respond for these types of requests? I hope someone can give me some information on this. Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-31T17:17:05.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Wolfess* provided some great info here. If you made your request through email, you'll receive the reply to that email when an agent can get back to you. It's true that our account specialists have to manually review information, so it can be a few days before you see a reply. Keep in mind that replying or \"bumping\" your ticket before a specialist gets back to you will result in your ticket being sent to the back of the queue. \n\nLet me know if you have any additional questions.","replies":[{"poster":"DMCRUN","date":"2016-07-31T21:28:19.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got a response, the person helping me now asked me to fill out a list of questions of the account.

You should be able to see the ticket's reply in the email they sent. \nAccount related requests will take a few days because of ticket traffic and the fact that they themselves look at information to determine if an account has potentially been compromised or if someone may be attempting to submit a false or harmful ticket to steal someone's account via having the staff's access to reset a user's password/email settings.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DMCRUN","date":"2016-07-31T03:17:51.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the way, I made this new account so I can post this on the forums.","replies":[]}]}
