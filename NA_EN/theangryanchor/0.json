What we found is that you and a group of friends would queue up for ranked matches and then intentionally surrender them despite actually being clearly in the lead.\n\nWe've seen this before a few times and we generally don't have a problem with a full pre-made doing this as it's their own LP and MMR at stake.  However, the two instances that brought it to our attention were times where you were a pre-made of 4 with a solo player on your team.\n\nThese players were not bought into the novelty of surrendering a guaranteed win and didn't appreciate being forced into the joke against their will at the sacrifice of their own MMR and in one case leading to a player's demotion \n\nPlease keep in mind for the future that as a group of 5 on the same team you're free to troll each other as you see fit  (assuming you're good friends and everyone is fine with it).  But when you play with strangers you'll be held at a higher standard then that of just playing with people you know.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-08-05T21:59:38.688+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"yasssssss !! the Wookie smite!!!\n\nsmite smite smite smite smite smite smite smite!!\n\nPlease do more of these for the board line cases!!
