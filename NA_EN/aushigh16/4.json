This puts them behind on their first item purchase when they're already last in gold. I usually get pinks when laning as well and if the enemy finds these I have to buy another. This means between sightstone and pinks I may have well spent my first 1k on nothing but wards (Sightstone hp >.>). The gold items for supports are nice but I cringe at not getting my sightstone first.\r\n\r\nJust a thought to a possible change being directed at ward trinkets. Maybe adding the option of two trinkets that both store wards over time. One trinket would take longer to get a charge but the wards last 3 minutes. The other trinket would store charges faster but the wards would only last 1 minute (Explorer wards?) useful for split pushers that are applying pressure. Would keep the no more than 3 wards out at a time rule. Sweep would still be an option. Not sure how the upgrading would work though...\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm the only one... I've seen other threads wanting to make sightstone a trinket itself. I'm not concerned with the extra item slot.. I never get full build anyways. It would just be nice to have a build path that didn't start with my first 1k going to wards.","replies":[{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2015-02-02T09:48:54.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">This puts them behind on their first item purchase when they're already last in gold. \n\nSightstone IS your first item purchase, and your MOST IMPORTANT item in the game.\n\n\n>This means between sightstone and pinks I may have well spent my first 1k on nothing but wards (Sightstone hp >.>). \n\nDuring laning phase you don't even need anything else.

When I'm playing support. I'm actually glad that I can rush Sight stone. Nothing is quite more Gold Efficient than this endless fountain of wards. It freaking pays for itself after a couple of wards are placed.\n\nAnd the reason I like Rushing it early is not even Objective control. I can not only ward river, but also the side brush, making sure that the bot lane does not pull off any shenanigans. And considering you have maybe one sweeper in bot lane, the opponent would have to chose which wards they clear out.\n\nThe only time I really don't rush sight stone. is if bot lane is behind, or if for some reason I need to stop supporting. The latter case happens if the ADC a) Royally fks up or b) goes AKF. And in the Former case, if our lane is constantly pushed to our tower. MS would allow me to better juke skill shots and get back to lane quicker. \n\nBut if your Bot lane is Clearly ahead. Sight stone is the best choice because you can press the advantage without worry about being ambushed.\n\nNow their is a fact that Sight stone can be slot inefficient. and limits the Options late game. But as the one with the least gold, this should rarely be an issue. But it's also worth that much more during the late game because everyone else will be full build and have no slots left for wards. And yet their will probably be problems if Sightstone, or its upgrade (or future upgrades) ever become slot efficient enough to be a general build item. \n\nAnother thing to consider about Wards is that Vision has to be balance around the ability to deny it. I don't know what it was like in past seasons. But I do remember Oracle elixir being scraped, with the Trinket wards and sweeping lenses coming into play. Fast forward to the current season. Trinket Upgrades are being severely buffed (except sweeping lens). while the smite bonus on raptors give us more vision denial. (and extra vision with control of the scuttle crab.) \n\nI analyze this and I would say that the vision game is going to get more Trinketised. Particularly in the mid to late game after level 9. While giving a weary hover over vision Denial. But this by no means is making Sight stone any worse.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2015-02-04T03:00:01.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what if sightsone's active replaced the current gp5 items' actives? or possibly a new set of gp items are added where they have a warding active. then you get the choice between damage {{item:3303}} , hp {{item:3302}} , movement{{item:3301}} , or vision [new item(s)]. this could open up a slot for more active items too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-02-02T15:03:43.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:2049}} has always been a first build for all supports, unless if they want to rush gold gains first like {{item:3096}} {{item:3098}} {{item:3097}} .
