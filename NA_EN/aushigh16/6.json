I've been reading into the crafting system but parts of it still aren't making sense to me. \r\n\r\nI own all the champions so can I get blue essence? \r\n\r\nWhat exactly is a champion shard? Are they the same as a mastery token? \r\n\r\nI got a S post game, but didn't receive a token, why?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"EnigmaticLight97","date":"2016-07-30T07:44:26.737+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First question: yes.\n\nSecond question: a mastery token and a champion shard are not the same. Champion shards come from hextech boxes (or bought individually in the store) , and they can be disenchanted into blue essence, be upgraded into champions, or rerolled with two other shards to get a full champion. Mastery token are received from getting an s grade on a champion that you have at least mastery rank 5 on.\n\nThird question: see answer to second question, were you mastery rank 5 with the champion? If you were that sounds like it could be some sort of bug.","replies":[{"poster":"aushigh16","date":"2016-07-30T08:16:41.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome, thank you! Yes I'm working towards level 7 master on Thresh, don't have blue essence, don't have thresh permanents, didn't know where to get thresh shard... but now I see! Its in the shop. \n\nI have 3 Thresh shards, just won a game, got a S but didn't get a token... it could be because I have the max tokens to advance, yes?\n\nThanks again!\n\nEdit: Just bought enough blue essence off the store to get my level 7 mastery! Thanks! :)","replies":[]}]}]}
