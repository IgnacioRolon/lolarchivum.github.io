I thought I&#039;d share my ideas for the possible upcoming Warwick remake! Let me know some feedback!\r\n\r\nHis passive would give Warwick a 3 stack buff, each giving him additional move speed, he gains one stack per auto attack\r\n\r\nHis Q would be an auto attack reset that also applies a slow on his target\r\n\r\nHis W would be a passive that gives him %hp damage on his auto attacks\r\n\r\nHis E would be a leap similar to his ultimate, however it would be based off stacks of his passive\r\n1 stack - He leaps to the target\r\n2 stack - Also gains additional attack speed\r\n3 stack - Also knocks his target down (stun)\r\n\r\nHis ultimate would be similar to his E now, except it would be cast, give vision of one nearby lowest hp enemy champion, granting him full stacks of his passive briefly, and also putting terror into his target reducing their move speed as they attempt to sneak away\r\n\r\n\r\nI would love to see a Warwick design that shows off his speed, allowing him to run on all fours when he senses blood. This kit allows his current play style to be more or less very similar yet inhibit his ability to lock down a target with his point and click ultimate. It also still gives him the ability to provide solid single target CC. I left out self healing in this kit, it could definitely be added back into it however! I would love to hear some of the communities&#039; ideas to make Warwick a healthier champion! Thanks!","replies":[]}
