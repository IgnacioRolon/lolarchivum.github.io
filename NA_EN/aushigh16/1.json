Its odd to me that Galio is always in the air, yet has no mobility in his kit. I think it would great if Galio had an ability skillshot that allowed him to dive similar to Aatrox. In order to preserve his identity as a strong counter mage tank, require his dive to have to charge by taking magic damage over time. A new updated animation could show on his model so enemies and allies know when Galio is fully charged and ready to dive in for a team ult.\n\nJust an interesting thought! Feel free to add your two cents!\n\nEdit: Galio's E does provide mobility as noted below. No harm meant by my post... just thought it would fit his character design nicely and that I would contribute my ideas!","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2016-07-20T09:18:22.076+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=aushigh16,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MpkFPJZw,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-07-20T08:53:19.056+0000)\n>\n> yet has no mobility in his kit.\n\nwhat would you call his E?","replies":[{"poster":"aushigh16","date":"2016-07-20T10:38:04.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean I guess... lol but for a champion that has wings who has the ability to fly... thats pretty weak, no?","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2016-07-20T11:07:07.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kayle has wings and the ability to fly. so does anivia.","replies":[{"poster":"aushigh16","date":"2016-07-20T11:46:46.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why would casters want to dash/dive into the enemy...

I've not been impressed with most of Riot's decisions on updates and reworks.\n\nGalio is a niche pick. If you know his strengths and weaknesses and more importantly have a team with enough brains to know how to utilize him, it will go well. Problem is Galio mains are far and few between and teams don't understand when and how to set up team fights.\n\nAnd as mentioned his E is literally a mobility spell on top of damage.","replies":[{"poster":"aushigh16","date":"2016-07-20T11:50:32.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No harm meant by this!

Simply pointing out his kit is fine as is. You've barely played him and are trying to take part of one champion's identity and shove it into Galio's needlessly.\n\nHe's niche in the same way Rammus is. One builds MR, the other armor. He excels against a dominantly AP enemy. He works in other team comps, but the big issue is getting a team that understands how to utilize him.\n\nTry giving the big guy a fair shot before trying to rearrange his identity. A couple of games is not a fair assessment, especially if you've not played him this year at all.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rito Gums","date":"2016-07-20T11:27:49.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be great if he got ranged auto attacks to make his laning easier","replies":[{"poster":"sheldonbunny","date":"2016-07-20T11:47:06.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rito Gums,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MpkFPJZw,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-07-20T11:27:49.118+0000)\n>\n> It would be great if he got ranged auto attacks to make his laning easier\n\nOnce you get some mana regen going his waveclear is amazing. It comes at a cost which is his melee range. Just takes practice is all.","replies":[]}]}]}
