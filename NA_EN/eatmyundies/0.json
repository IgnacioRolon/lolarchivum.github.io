How do they even get in the game when its a PvP match? Is there anything we can do to prevent them? I&#039;ve been reporting them when I come across them. What category should they be reported under? In the comments I put Bot/AI to get the point across. If bots are reported enough will Riot do something about it?","replies":[{"poster":"freeformline","date":"2015-10-09T00:33:10.661+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that continues to be a major issue.
