I know our game can have its fair share of bullies, but I do hope your son remembered to report them in the post-game lobby. With that report and the chat logs, we'll be able to take action if needed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ion Pope","date":"2017-12-18T16:56:50.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is not much Riot can do about flamers. You can get rid of some of them, but there will be always be others you will encounter, less or more aggresive. Best way to prevent this type of players is the \"mute\" button at the begining of the game. Thats what i do most of time, and it also helps for focusing more on the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-18T16:38:15.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope he reported them at the end of the game! This saves and submits a copy of the logs for them. Even if he didn't, that's something that the system should pick up, as that is absolutely inappropriate behavior. You can rest assured knowing that the vast majority of people who say this end up being banned for it!","replies":[]}]}
