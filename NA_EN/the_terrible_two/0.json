First, just because a work is made publicly available doesn't mean it's been posted under a license that allows redistribution (like GNU GPL) or placed in the public domain. Second, \"they're probably cool with it\" doesn't change the fact that you've posted links to pirated versions of Riot's works on Riot's official forum.\n\nUnlike trademarks, copyright holders don't have to work to maintain the validity of their claim, and Riot probably won't even notice these posts, but... posting links to pirated versions of someone's works on their official forum is just generally not a clever plan, and I wanted to make sure you understood why. 👍","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-10-25T18:48:50.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=LOepumye,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2018-10-21T18:12:27.893+0000)\n>\n>  pirated versions of Riots works \n\nTo be fair, there are no official eBooks created by Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-10-25T21:44:39.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ebonmaw Dragon,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=LOepumye,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-25T18:48:50.883+0000)\n>\n> To be fair, there are no official eBooks created by Riot.\n\nTo be equally fair, that doesn't change the truth value of anything I've said.

Streaming a game adds the streamer's commentary and other unique aspects, which makes it a bit more defensible. Streamers that don't add enough occasionally get dinged for not \"transforming\" the content, and even those that do may be violating copyright if the holder hasn't given them permission to perform the holder's copyrighted works (see Nintendo).\n\nTurning a web page into an ebook like this, however, is not transformative, and the intent is to copy and redistribute the copyrighted work with the only difference from the original being that it's usable on different devices. It's similar to running a paper book through an OCR machine and making the digital text available for download. Do you think that's not copyright infringement?","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-10-26T00:38:50.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=LOepumye,comment-id=0002000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-26T00:31:38.171+0000)\n>\n> They&#x27;re not comparable.
