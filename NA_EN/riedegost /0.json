I took a look into this to see what happened!  I was able to verify that you received 150 Orange essences as well as a Power Up Summoner Icon, very cool!  The icon was automatically unlocked so you can see it in your icon selection screen.  Let me know if that clears things up!.","replies":[{"poster":"Riedegost ","date":"2017-02-24T22:55:18.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't get anything yet.

Can you provide a screenshot of your summoner icon options?  What happens if you try the legacy client?\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nLet me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Riedegost ","date":"2017-02-24T23:20:06.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup,icon showed up after last game.Ty alot. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
