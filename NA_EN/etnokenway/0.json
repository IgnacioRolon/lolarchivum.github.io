If your friends are in the same region as you then it's possible that your ISP could be having issues.  If you're all in the same network or room together, then a connection problem failing to reach the authentication server might be the culprit as well.  In this case, you guys will want to try the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot.  Otherwise, double check your ISP's support page in case anything might be going down.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
