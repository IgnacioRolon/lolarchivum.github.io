The best part about the club in my opinion is seeing everyone smile. Many people come to the club meetings just to chill around and watch others play; and they love it, even though they don't get to play due to lack of many computers. \n2.) The biggest hurdle was setting League up on the computers. First we had to find an internet solution because the school blocked connection to League servers. We must have had over 20 plans on how to get connection to the servers at school. We did many tests and decided to go with a cell-phone WiFi tether to all the computers. After that was done, we, the officers, promised the club members that league would work in a week or two. We were wrong because we ran into another problem. The computer's internal firewall is now blocking league. We had to send requests to the IT's at our school to install league for us (that's the short version of it).  I'd say the efforts the officers and I put into setting this club up is well worth it by far.

A scholarship? That's great, but what if colleges offered gaming scholarships instead of sporting scholarships...would sports then be pointless? The best scholarships are given to football and basketball players because those bring in the most money. If LOL brought in the most money I have no doubt those scholarships would be the best. \n\nYou are pushing your subjective values onto others that physical sports is a \"better\" accomplishment than improving at other things like gaming. Why is being good at basketball a better achievement than being good at League of Legends...or poker...or chess...or any number of non-physical activities. Why is being good at throwing a ball through a hoop better than being good at killing a nexus? Does not League of Legends also require a great deal of practice and training to get to the top levels? Are top level chess players just as pointless as gamers since playing chess doesn't give you a \"strong and fit body.\" Ever see an offensive lineman in football or a DH in baseball?\n\nYou have no convinced me that sporting is more of an accomplishment than gaming with the \"strong and fit body\" argument since I may not care as much about a strong and fit body as somebody else.\n\n**\"On the other hand, if you're a good gamer...then thats all you have.

A scholarship? \n\nYou somehow seem to be actually missing the point. Almost comically. If you've become good at a physical sport, then you've done two things. You've not only become good at the sport, but you've trained up attributes related to that sport. Are you a good hitter in baseball? Then you've probably developed your visual acuity. Can you juke around in basketball? Then you've worked on your reflexes. Point being, you've acquired skills that can mean something down the road. I'll actually accept Chess into my argument because thats still something beyond a single attribute. If you're good at chess, then you've most likely good at skills involving calculation and planning, both wide and long. \nThe question here being \"If you become a good League player, what else have you done?\" Have you trained your body? No. Have you trained your mind? Not really. At best, you can say \"I've trained to work with other people.\"\n\n> If you're a good basketball player and you blow your knee out...then what do you have? What have you achieved? A short lived scholarship IF you even managed to get one? Sure you can say, \"well I would have gone pro if I didn't blow my knee out\" but what does that help you do?\n\nIf you're a good League player, and then you receive serious brain damage....then what do you have? Seriously, the whole point of an argument is to use REASONABLE examples. Or you might as well say \"If the Earth is hit by a meteor tomorrow and everyone dies, what have you achieved?\"\n\n\n\n> You have no convinced me that sporting is more of an accomplishment than gaming with the \"strong and fit body\" argument since I may not care as much about a strong and fit body as somebody else.\n\nI suspect this is what you're trying to focus on, which is honestly not good.
