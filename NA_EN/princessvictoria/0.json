The \"Enable Language Filter\" is always checked and the other option remains unchecked after I save my preferences. All of my other settings can be changed without a problem. I tested this issue on my other account, and I can enable or disable any settings without a problem. Any advice to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-24T02:24:26.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an issue with the Beta Client that we're aware of. It's likely that a fix will be slotted for later down the road, but I can't provide an ETA on when that will be. If this is a dealbreaker for your normal play, you can always launch into the Legacy Client at the login screen to have these options working again.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"PrincessVictoria","date":"2016-11-24T03:01:34.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your helpful answer Targons Blade!","replies":[]}]}]}
