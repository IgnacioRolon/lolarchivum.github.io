Have Dark Star Thresh enter vision from the fog of war. \r\n2. Experience lag. \r\n\r\nThis bug was entirely reproducible on every instance that this happened during the game. This happened whenever Thresh entered TEAM vision. \r\n\r\nLike I said, not sure if this was an isolated instance but it definitely sucked.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-17T18:52:51.819+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Electromech -\n\nThanks for the report!

First, apologies for the problem having in the first place. We have since disabled DS Thresh, and we have a team working on a potential fix. We are testing it over the weekend in hopes of a hotfix very soon.\n\nTo give some behind the scene context- once we get these types of reports- we attempt to get as much information as possible to see how widespread the problem was. We worked with our data analytics team and saw that this issue was pretty wide spread and made the decision to disable DS Thresh. So, when we say we're working on it- it implies we are studying the problem, seeing how wide spread it is, what types of players and machines it's happening on, are there other factors (ie server problems, latency problems, etc.). Once we determined it was for sure DS Thresh and in what type of conditions- we were able to gain enough information to make the call to turn him off.\n\nTotally agree- any feature, skin, champion etc..that causes such widespread disruption should immediately be turned off to protect the overall player experience. \n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts. Genuinely, appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Archadria","date":"2016-06-19T00:47:16.605+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Question: to those of us who bought the skin prior to the problem, how are we going to be reimbursed for the downtime of not enjoying the skin :)","replies":[{"poster":"Pabro","date":"2016-06-19T19:34:51.542+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"We are discussing through options here, hope to have more information in the next few days about this.","replies":[{"poster":"DartExplosion10","date":"2016-06-19T23:23:23.112+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"days???","replies":[{"poster":"Pabro","date":"2016-06-20T00:04:13.376+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yep.
