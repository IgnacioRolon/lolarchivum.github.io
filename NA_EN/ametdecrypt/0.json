I always thought winning and pushing up my mmr (though it&#039;s already higher than my tier since I spar with mid gold in normals and got dropped into bronze 5 as soon as my 10 games were up) would pit me against better people, not better enemies and shittier allies.\r\nside note do allies affect my MMR? I hope to god not because I&#039;ve been getting less lp per win since this loss streak, went from 25 on average to 15.\r\n\r\nnow I&#039;m not saying I wasn&#039;t a factor in losing sometimes nor am I asking for a ticket up to challenjour by way of fedora, I truly feel I&#039;ve been in a string of bad luck despite my best efforts.","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Memes","date":"2016-10-20T04:25:33.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The lp difference is probably just because of your division being higher up on the ladder, but at least you were on a win streak!
