But the skin is not available and I cant even see it on the profile, which doesnt make sense cuz im 100% sure i owned it after i rolled 3 different skin shards. I never screenshot when i purchase something so i dont have an actual proof, but im hoping Riot can somehow check my profile and find out. I was dissapointed when I figured out the skin is not there, since we all know key fragments doesnt drop very often, and it takes time to get 3 skins from chests. I just want my challenger ahri back :/","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-21T18:14:29.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This does sound like a strange situation, so I took a look into this for you to find out what's going on.  It looks like you did receive Challenger Ahri as a shard around the 13th.  About a few minutes after that, you included it as part of a reroll to obtain the Longhorn Alistar Skin along with 100 Orange essences.  unfortunately, it does seem that the shard was used.  I hope that helps clear things up and that you are able to obtain her again!","replies":[]}]}
