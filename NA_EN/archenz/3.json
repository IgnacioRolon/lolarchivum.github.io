Can that be added back in?\r\n\r\nAlso would be nice to have a bit larger range on his R, since it&#039;s not much bigger than auto attack range, considering scorpions usually move there stinger far and strike there target, maybe an 100 range increase?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-11T04:26:04.745+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because the coolest use of his R is to drag people as far as possible, and being able to attack during it would pretty frequently conflict with that. I actually thought about this a bit while working on Skarner, and I thought that maybe it would be cool if he could reactivate R to end the dragging effect but leave the enemy stunned for the remaining duration. Honestly, I'm just not sure it's the right change, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Archenz","date":"2015-08-11T12:22:07.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the reply! \n\nDo whatever you think is best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-08-11T04:32:31.975+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm glad to hear you are thinking of different options to his kit. However, I am still pretty sceptical at this point about his changes. Skar is one of my favorite junglers to play and I just don't see how the crystals are going to help him in teamfights, since any intelligent team just won't fight near an activated crystal. \n\nA great idea I read in the forums was allowing Skarner to carry X number of crystals on him so he can set up a fight before hand. Kind of like Heimer does with his turrets. Would you guys consider something like that?","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2015-08-11T04:41:35.254+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, if you look at where the crystals have been placed, they've been placed in pretty popular choke points, such as the small \"hallway\" between the red buff and raptors. On the blue side, I can't count how many times I have had a team fight in that specific location. The Baron crystal is also in a location that is quite popular. Again, a place where MANY teamfights happen.\n\nYes, it is smart to avoid the crystals when fighting Skarner, but sometimes, you'll be forced inside the crystal's zone of influence. It almost seems like Repertoir specifically placed them in popular teamfight locations. Obviously, you're not going to have one in a lane.........thats just stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-08-11T06:04:44.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem still is that 1) you have to have control over that crystal and 2) the enemy team has to be willing to fight you there. Most of the teamfights in the game will take place out of the influence of a crystal unless Skarners team has dominant map control.","replies":[{"poster":"Shiroi Kitsune","date":"2015-08-11T06:32:14.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The other thing to keep in mind is that this creates areas that the enemy team does not want to fight in.  If they try to avoid it, they necessarily have to fight somewhere else, and that somewhere else might be unfavorable to them as well.  So they get caught in a catch-22 where they either go to the crystal location or are forced into a different disadvantageous area.  It's about zones of control.  Even if the zone can be avoided, that is power in and of itself.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-08-11T05:06:29.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why not have it deal damage at the end of the drag, and deal more damage the further the guy got dragged?

In my opinion the fact he can't deal full dps during his suppression is actually a balancing factor that makes him function more as the utility fighter I like and not an assassin. If he could just solo kill you in his ult his sustained damage _hypothetically_ would end up having to be lower I suspect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2015-08-11T04:29:05.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be broken as fuck, especially if he uses it on his new zone.\n\n\nIf you are worried about Skarner being weak or anything with the rework, rest assured, he is much stronger than initially. I always see him being incredibly useful for his team unless severely behind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Edge of Daybreak","date":"2015-08-11T02:58:00.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IF skarner built some insane cheese build he could just flash ult whoever doesnt have a QSs and you would die","replies":[]}]}
