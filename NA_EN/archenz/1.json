Hes quite awkward, hes not as tanky as a tank, but isnt really an assassin like its listed.\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about letting his Q go through walls and when hes on it he can go through walls? I dont know, anything to make him a bit more viable.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts Repertoir/Scruffy? Do you have any changes already in mind?\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2015-08-12T21:15:14.661+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree that there's a bit of confusion going on with nocturne right now. Ideally in my opinion, call me out if you disagree, he would end up as a tanky diver with both some durability and damage to chase and kill enemy squishies. Something similar to Vi in profile. He doesn't have the burst damage or mobility to support a pure assassin profile so he needs to have some of that tankiness to be effective. \n\nOn the gameplay side of things, nocturne has a bit of the problem (not as bad as some others) of being a bit of a \"stat check\" champion. He has fallen quickly in and out of favor based on his tunings, and it often feels like you don't control your success with him as much as some other champs. It may benefit him if we, without changing his kit, push up some of the rewards he gets when he makes a skillful play.","replies":[{"poster":"Archenz","date":"2015-08-12T21:42:40.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I agree, he definitely has to be tanky to survive dives like that, similar to vi. But he lacks vi's pure damage, cc and mobility. What I think is he should make up for that by being inherently tankier than vi and slightly more powerful. I also think he would need more range on his ultimate at least.\n\nBasically I want there to be a reason I can say \"You know what, I should take Nocturne this game over Vi.\n\nThanks for the response.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-08-12T22:00:31.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right now the only 2 really meaningful aspects of his kit are his spellshield and the subsequent buff that comes with it and the Q trail. The second one is sort of negated by his ultimate because you dive right onto your target, but then again you can't really make it harder to hit or w/e because then his ganks pre-6 would be awful. \n\nTBH attack speed as a buff for his spellshield feels kind of weird. Maybe entirely remove the passive AS he gains and put that power somewhere else on his kit. \n\nEx : Blocking a spell creates a burst of energy around Nocturne that deals damage OR deals damage back to the person who cast this spell.\nMake his E create a small nightmarish orb that tethers to all nearby enemies, creating the same effect the current E has. This would need a lot of tuning, of course, but it would be much cooler and would give some sort of pseudo-tankyness through AoE CC to Nocturne as he dives in. This would also be another thing that sets him apart from Vi, who is also defined by her very long range, potent level 6 ganks. She has more single target damage and lockdown, he's more of an AoE guy.\n\nEDIT: Maybe he could feed of people's fears and gain bonuses like damage reduction depending on how many targets he hit with his E or the affected targets deal less damage to him for a medium period of time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beoridas","date":"2015-08-12T21:41:24.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"most ppl get sated devourer on him. or assassin on him and hes actually, contrary to what ud think, very sticky and mobile enough if he gets his wtv he throws at ppl. spell shield is also good to prevent cc and buff him at the same time.\n\nThink of it as a Yi (who is listed of some sort of assassin) but better equipped for the job.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ult√Æma","date":"2015-08-12T21:28:04.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a thought; Nocturne has a really cool theme associated with him, but only two of his abilities really deliver on the fantasy of being a nightmarish wraith - his E and his ultimate. Nocturne feels at his best when he's an assassin, and at his worst when he's just... tanking. Isn't there a lot of room for Nocturne to be more terrifying? He should be able to haunt the jungle, and more importantly, his prey.
