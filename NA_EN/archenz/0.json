The previous rework skarner had really took away a lot of his fun. \r\n\r\nI just want skar skar to be fun to play, for me and the enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2015-08-01T05:23:38.193+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually the major goal of the upcoming changes.
