You didn't just \"defend\" yourself and broke the rules, or B. The punishment was issued in error. If you post your logs, we can give it peer review and point out what you may be missing, if anything.\n\nBut if you're just going to adamantly insist that you did nothing wrong and not work with us to try and better understand your punishment, we can't help you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2019-03-29T22:02:41.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=hinomoriAmu,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=rWi16Gzb,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-03-29T16:39:40.685+0000)\n>\n> i did not flame back at all. i only defended myself. i said no mean things to anyone. and yet i get chat restricted\n\nShow us the chat logs, because so many people are eagerly waiting for someone to post logs that contain no insults and no excessive arguing in the middle of a match, that resulted in a punishment. I would love to see that just so we can expose how bad it really is. Please post the logs. You could be the hero that exposes their tyranny.
