Just from looking at my match history, you&#039;ll clearly seen I am constantly being matchmade with trolls.\r\n\r\nLast game, Olaf and Udyr. Olaf refusing to do anything, thus AFK. Udyr just running in 3v1, 4v1, 2v1, 5v1 and dying.\r\n\r\nGame before, Rengar who refused to gank and a top bot support trio who all fed.\r\n\r\nGame 3: akali assassin top and rageblade on jax.\r\n\r\nGame 4: nami mid and a jungler who refuses to gank.\r\n\r\nGame 5: triple offensive item illaoi, when behind...\r\n\r\nGame 6: Corki adc, losing as usual.\r\n\r\nGame 7: Darius who AFK&#039;d twice, fiddle support, 5/11 Lee Sin....\r\n\r\nSeriously, I don&#039;t understand. Why is match making so terrible. I normally win games, my scores are generally great because I can carry, rarely do I have a bad score on my own.\r\n\r\nThese people are legitimately deciding to not help, to put themselves behind, for what? The only line of reasoning I could have is either they&#039;re stupid or they&#039;re trolling. It&#039;s unacceptable. And these are normal games, my ranked games are slightly better, but seriously, why am I match made with people like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-08-07T03:59:44.890+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you suppose matchmaking be fixed?

Explain.\n\nAlso, you are playing with low silver (ex-bronze) players, who are the most arrogant trash in any rank i have seen so far. All of them think getting out of bronze makes them godlike, most of them are new or just bad, and also begin raging, trolling or feeding if anything goes wrong (it cant be their fault).\n\nTip for escaping trash-filled ELO: work on your CSing; it is truly horrifying.","replies":[{"poster":"HaloDragonX","date":"2016-08-07T13:38:40.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My ranked MMR is mostly fine, my normals MMR isn't.

Everything you've mentioned suggests problems with players - some who lack the skills to be successful which is totally fine, and some who are liars promising to abide to league's terms of uses then act otherwise - instead of the system.\n\nSomething that points out flaw in matchmaking would be comparing the members of two sides and demonstrating how they're not supposed to be playing against each other. For example, the other day I queue'd normal SR alone on my urf account (that reminds me when is next urf huh); my entire team was a bunch of lvl 20s, and after a crushing defeat I noticed in post game lobby there were four lvl30s on the other side, several of which amounted to 2000+ wins.","replies":[{"poster":"HaloDragonX","date":"2016-08-07T13:37:26.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My matchmaking wasn't this bad.
