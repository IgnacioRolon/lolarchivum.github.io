Im not lying or anyhing thats the truth.\nWe get f blooed and then bot feeds. A lot of these players in silver seem to have a good additude, \nbut dont understand that when they die once they are weaker.. \nThey just keep dying. When I play with my plat/gold friends no one dies for like 10 min.\nThis is sooooooooooo stressfull and i think i will never advance to be honest. My laning, cs\nmap awareness are all fine but i tilt so fucking easy. When i see first blood in red im at the point \nwhere its like i give up right there. Its just so discouraging. I feel like i shouldt have to make a &quot;comeback&quot;\nevery fuckin game because of the first 10 min.\n\n\nOK THIS IS NOT THE ACCOUNT IM ON LOL forgot to mention that.\nBanned from this one for telling a 0/6/0 yi with no smte to do in a fire.

It's about improving.  I've hit diamond every season and what that means is, without trying I can get out of bronze.  Without trying, I can get out of silver.  (Okay, i'm being sarcastic, I'll probably TRY of course, but what I mean is, it's not stressful and I'm not trying to do anything fancy to win).  \n\nBut I'm not trying to brag about me, I'm trying to explain where *YOU* are trying to GO.  So while each game you might lose, if your mechanics are getting better, you're going to get to the point where you win lane every game.\n\nYes, every game.  And if you win lane every game, I guarantee if YOU are doing the right thing, you won't get a 0-6 bot lane every game.  You might get a 0-6 bot lane 30% of the time, 40%, or maybe even 50% of the time.  But the other 50% you will win easily because you are so much better than the other players.  And that is when you will climb without exception.  You will climb.\n\nWe've all been toxic, but it becomes a lot easier not to be toxic when you focus not on what others are doing wrong, but only on what you can do better.\n\nFor example: I played ahri in season 2.  I was pretty bad but I tried to land my skillshots and farm.  I heard about this thing called \"charm-flashing\".  I thought it meant to flash and then press charm.  I tried it.  I did it and it lead to me getting a kill.  But charm flashing is actually the act of pressing charm THEN flashing, leading to a charm that is very hard to react to.  This is the type of mechanic I probably did not understand, and to be honest, my button-pressing mechanics were not that great.  It was hard to understand that I need to press charm while aiming in a certain direction, then flash in a different spot, (potentially somewhere away from my cursor) and line all that up to hit the enemy champion.\n\nEven if my team lost, I could tell I was getting better.  That's how I got good enough to climb.\n\nedit: (side note, one purpose of charm flash is to press charm while you're behind a minion wave but the enemy is out in the open.  More than likely, the enemy will learn to hide behind minions, so if you try to charm they will not be out in the open.  Charm flashing is one way to catch potential targets off-guard.)","replies":[{"poster":"ARESGODOFWARR","date":"2016-10-31T02:50:24.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for this it was helpfull. I just had a game where i did great and felt great to be honest.\nI smoked some weed and took a valium, but i was making fuckin plays.\nI was top maok and me and panth planned a gank early and it worked. I landed a few teleports the resulted in \nmultiple kills, got tanky and peeled like crazy. I actually felt a lot more in control.. my team was fantastic tho.. and they landed\nall the kills so it may have been luck. But i even told them to mute me before the game, and sure enough we win.
