This began happening since I updated the client now every day I have to wait 14 or 30+ mins for the dodge penalty. It's not my connection, and I already tried the autofix and downloading the client again... It's getting so frustrating. Is there any way to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-26T23:53:07.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you are in queue, the server needs to grab you and place you in the same room as your group.
