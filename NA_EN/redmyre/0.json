Roughly 48-49% win rate period, in ranked. Support main, about 80%ish of my games these days, being in the bottom lane.\n\n\nNow to the main stuffs:\n\nI find myself going on tilt. Not necessarily emotionally, but literally losing in a large streak, and then evening out as time goes on. I consider myself a decent player, though I do find many others who can out-lane and outplay me. Not in any way trying to say I'm better or worse, probably belong in exactly the league I am in. However, I do feel that tilt in the literal sense (straight out losing game after game over a period of time) is ruining my attempt to push through silver.\n\nIn short, I'm looking for advice on how to combat it, and I'm wondering if, even though lose streaks are common in ranked, it has something to do with me. I'm not toxic in game, most of the time. I've had my share of bad moments, but I'm excluding those streaks, as I have an idea that I DID have something to do with them. \n\nBut what about when you just start losing? And it seems like there's nothing that can change it?\n\nTDLR; Looking for non-troll advice on battling lose streaks in ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"xLegendary Troll","date":"2015-01-11T06:09:07.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember how difficult it was to get out of silver. My best advice is to STOP PLAYING after you lose 2 ranked matches in a row.\n\nIt took me a while to say no to rank after going on tilt, but after following that strategy I quickly escaped silver. Even if you have 2 really good games in ranked and you lost, stop playing. Go play normals and troll to blow some steam off. Do something wacky. Then go watch a stream to motivate you to play better or a 1v5 pentakill video as Sona or Soraka. Hope that helps\n\nAlso don't watch streamers who don't take the game super seriously. That's just going to develop the \"I don't care/people even troll in diamond\" mentality.","replies":[{"poster":"ChexMex","date":"2015-01-11T11:41:35.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xLegendary Troll,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=PsaITsGJ,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-01-11T06:09:07.988+0000)\n>\n> I remember how difficult it was to get out of silver.

Even if both players are countered if they have good synergy and teamwork then they still have a chance at doing good. Keep in mind that cs matters just as much as kills so if you and your partner cant fight then focus farming and not dying. Even if you lose your tower early, if you and your partner have kept up in cs then the enemies lead will be too small to snowball the rest of the game.\n\nThe most common mistake I see players make is that they still try to get kills when they are behind by a level or more and that they become bloodthirsty and only try to make a comeback via kills rather than farm, which puts them behind even more. Also they neglect enemy minions so even if they do get their kill the team cannot push because enemy minions are at the towers in more than one lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shacos Day Off","date":"2015-01-10T18:17:30.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stab yourself and drink your blood, it's the only way(in patches O houlihan voice).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Demonsolder21","date":"2015-01-10T18:16:41.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLoK6rCBcF0&index=1&list=LLRGJyLdbTXb9gM4dK446udg check out this vid as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Chin","date":"2015-01-10T18:13:22.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check out this vid\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rJJL-5Qs4g","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChexMex","date":"2015-01-12T01:20:30.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"dangit\nDIAMOND IS HEAVEN THERE ARE NO TROLLS :DDD","replies":[]}]}
