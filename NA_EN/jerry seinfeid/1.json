This statement that he hasn't crossed paths with Nautilus makes little sense when Pyke has lines for Ashe.","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2018-05-17T17:01:28.047+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=AJcIJZ0Z,comment-id=000100000004,timestamp=2018-05-17T16:45:32.002+0000)\n>\n> So let me understand this - Pyke has crossed paths with {{champion:22}}, who lives on a completely different continent, who pretty much stays there trying to unify the people on that continent, yet he hasn&#x27;t crossed paths with {{champion:111}} or even {{champion:223}}, who both haunt the back allies and waters of Bilgewater?\n> \n> Even if he HASN&#x27;T met {{champion:111}} or {{champion:223}}, their sheer proximity and the fact that there would be legends and tales about the demon catfish who grants wishes and a fellow drowned seaman who pulls ships under would be enough for Pyke to have at the very least heard of them and have lines for them should he ever encounter them.

Unless she's talked to Pyke, it isn't obviously apparent that she's any kind of authority figure. Him recognizing Ashe as a leader makes even less sense than him recognizing Nautilus and Tahm, because at least they have very distinctive looks that would cause instant recognition if he encountered them based on what he would have heard of them. And given that he's even turned to Kalista for vengeance (considering his voice line to her) why would he not consider the opportunity to employ Kench? \n\nThe main point is, why was Ashe so much more of an inclusion in his VO than 2 vastly more relevant champs he would see in his main lane?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-05-17T16:41:56.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Pyke doesn't hang around Bilgewater much?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2018-05-17T15:26:41.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They will cross paths in game though, are both characters of legends for the same region (Bilgewater), and share a similar fate. \n\nThis is kind of like Irelia not having lines for a bunch of Ionian champions... those are narrative gaps that should never exist in the first place.

It helps develop a sense of how the champ(s) _would_ interact, how they would feel about one another, etc., as well as further fleshing out the attitudes of the champ in question. Pyke with Naut and Swain with Kled are in particular missed opportunities. There's an obvious similarity between Pyke's and Naut's backgrounds, and I feel a lot of people were looking forward to how Pyke at least would feel about their similarities and differences, even if it's an ultimately non-canon game line.\n\nSame thing for Kled and Swain... I at least was looking forward to seeing how the Grand General of Noxus would react to someone who, in theory, is supposed to be the ultimate expression of Noxian values.\n\nHeck, not having come across each other hasn't stopped you guys in the past when coming up with VO. I doubt Urgot has any idea Teemo exists, for example, or Yorick with Amumu, and A Sol probably doesn't give a damn about anyone not of Targon or perhaps the Void. A hefty chunk of Zoe's VO is her commentary on a whole relationship between people who have likely never met, for that matter.\n\nThis isn't to say every champ should have interactions with every other champ, of course. That would be too much. And I'll admit, I could well be talking out of my ass here. But if it helps develop a character's personality in some way, such as revealing some trait of their personality or how they would see such-and-such champ, or if it's even just a fun bit of meta-commentary, I'd say even a Kench-tier VO is nothing to shy away from.
