I was able to browse reddit during the disconnect, and eventually I decided to close the game. I looked at the client and found that there was no option to reconnect. So I restarted the client and still there was no option to reconnect. We were about to win the game and I was a crucial part of our team. I hate to think that because of this my team lost lp.","replies":[{"poster":"√êelofasht","date":"2017-05-15T06:02:32.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just had this issue myself, not sure what happened.  Ghost game, got DC in game with everything running on the internet on my other monitor, eventually decided to close the game and relaunch it.  No record of the game at all, no option to reconnect, no history of it in my profile either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-15T03:36:09.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really sucks when you get disconnected out of nowhere when you can still clearly browse the internet. It doesn't mean your internet went out, but sometimes networks can have a hard time reaching or staying connected to specific servers. Sometimes it's due to some weird ISP routing, other times we just need to check up on a few network settings. \n\nThis almost sounds like it could have been a ghost game as well, which is where a game just kind of....disappears. If you didn't ever have the option to reconnect, it could be that the match was finished before you got back or we might have a ghost game on our hands. If this was, in fact, a ghost game, no worries. The game will not be saved on our end either, and nobody will be punished if that's the case.\n\nBe sure to go through the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) just in case to make sure you cover all your bases!

I don't want the team I was on and me to be penalize for something we can not control. Hopefully everything works out because I will be mad if I get a strike for \"leaving\" the game.","replies":[]}]}
