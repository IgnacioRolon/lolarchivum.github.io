I felt he was finally in a fair and playable spot. He had good strengths, obvious weaknesses, and no rediculous free-lo mechanics to complain about. He was simple, but still had room for skill expression with the use of his passive, and Q was still his main skill.\n\nAs of right now, Skarner has a pathetic passive that feels (to me) like a poor attempt at homage to a removed game mode (RIP dominion). The rest of his Kit is stacked onto his E skill, and his Q is a poorly scaling glorified Sheen proc. E has: Initial damage, slow, stun+damage on proc, passive bonuses for 1 second on proc (attack/move speed + mana regen), self-cooldown reduction on proc.\n\nWhen thinking about how I would rework Skarner, I first thought about how his Q was his bread and butter skill, and in the description it reads, &quot;Skarner charges himself with Crystal Energy...&quot; and I thought, why not a unique resource for this champion? I also saw that they experimented with something similar when making Nasus (thanks Jeremy GamingCurious) so the idea wouldn&#039;t be too hard for Riot to implement. So here is the short version (no numbers) of my idea:\n\nPassive is now Crystal Energy, Skarner&#039;s unique resource. Auto attacking and using Crystal Slash gather crystal energy. The more energy he has, the faster he moves/attacks. (up to a cap, obviously), Energy falls off as Skarner moves around and uses abilities other than Q.\n\nQ: Same, gathers energy per enemy hit, does bonus magic damage while skarner has Crystal Energy available. While empowered, it still gathers energy per enemy hit, but costs 1 point of Energy as well.\n\nW: Costs Crystal Energy, same shield and ramp up speed mechanic, speed breaks with shield. If shield lasts for the duration without breaking, refund a portion of the spent energy.\n\nE: Costs Crystal Energy to fire, no longer slows missile speed as it passes through targets. Targets are marked, procing mark stuns enemy for 1 second and restores extra crystal energy.\n\nR: Same effect: Skarner rapidly gains Crystal Energy over the duration of the suppression. Each rank in R prevents Skarner&#039;s Crystal Energy from dropping below a certain point through sheer movement. (Can still drop below threshold from using abilities.)\n\nThis is a round draft thought, but would love to hear your thoughts on it.\n\nEDIT: I had also thought of adding a poison sting as a passive on his ultimate: Every 5th/4th/3rd strike is an attack with his stinger, which poisons his target, slowing for a short duration and dealing bonus magic damage based on the target's  health (haven't decided if current, missing or max would be most appropriate.)\n\nEDIT 2: Food for thought:\n\n\"Skarner is a melee fighter. Who excels at not only dealing damage, but also controlling the battlefield. Utilizing basic attacks in addition to his abilities, Skarner is a true Hybrid fighter.\" ~Skarner Original Champion Spotlight","replies":[{"poster":"dreadedcape","date":"2017-12-15T19:42:09.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see it bandaging some issues like his passive and giving skarner players something to think about with resource management but i do fear it is a simple bandage over his bigger issues keeping the gameplay the same for skarner mains all 3 of them but in general maby will be a small increase in power am not saying he needs 50 different passives on one ability but some way to better close gap then intimidating running or a cc purge would make a world of difference on the little guy.

As I have stated, Skarner is great for punishing bad positioining, regardless of the target, but that is more of a niche thing that his ult can do, and it is dependent on the enemy slipping up.\n\nTLDR- Yes, Skarner can pull ANY champion who is out of position into his team for a focused kill, but that is not what was being discussed. If Skarner was supposed to ult a carry, mage or marksman, he would have to bypass the frontline, which he can't really do.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PhearBunny","date":"2017-12-15T19:42:06.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I just think he needs a different ult.\n\nR- Crystalline Toxin\nInstantly stings a target champion or Monster.\nAfter 5seconds, the stung champion becomes a crystal statue for 5seconds and takes 15/25/35% of its maximum health as true damage over the 5seconds.\nTarget is immune to all other sources of damage, and cannot be healed or shielded.\nWhen using on Monsters, deals 1500 True damage.\n\nCurrently his role is to grab a squishy and pull them into death.\nNot a reasonable role given his kit.

He excels at dealing sustained damage and chasing/locking down single targets. He's a hunter. He's after the jerks who took his brothers' crystals, and he will kill them all... one at a time... as he finds them...\n\nLike any other Skirmisher, he has some other situational utility to offer, since if he is not even or ahead, he can't really duel efficiently:\n\nFiora- Front line killer- Her %MAX HP True damage can kill a front line tank quickly. The heal from her ultimate makes it where fighting the tank first is less punishing.\n\nYasuo- Zone control with Windwall\n\nSkarner can play like a Warden, peeling off divers and assassins with his single target lockdown.\n\nI don't think they should \"transform\" Skarner again... he should be reverted back to what he was supposed to be.
