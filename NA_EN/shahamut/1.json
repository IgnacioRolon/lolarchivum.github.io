Yasuo&#039;s critical strikes deal 20/15/10% less damage. (Levels 1/6/11).\r\n\r\nWind walker: Yasuo ignores unit collision.\r\n\r\n(Further reduces early game power while keeping his crit reliance. Wind walker is minor compensation since he can dash through people anyway)\r\n\r\nQ: Thrust/Tornado unchanged but with a new effect: targets hit by this skill have their armor reduced by 1/2/3/4/5% for 5 seconds. This effect can stack up to 3 times.\r\n\r\n(This change only makes sense with the ultimate changes. As a carry he will need pen to eventually be able to deal with tanks. % is less useful early game, but scales to late).\r\n\r\nW: Wind Shield- Yasuo generates a shield of wind that blocks a/b/c/d/e damage and lasts up to 4 seconds. Long cooldown that is reduced through movement.\r\n\r\n(Not sure about exact numbers, or what to have the shield amount scale with, but I was playing with a 20-16 cooldown. Constant movement making it 16-12, and optimal uses of dashes getting it down to 14-10.)\r\n\r\nE: Sweeping Blade- same with minor changes:\r\n- Now damages all targets passed through on dash.\r\n- Now marks ALL targets damaged, even of not the initial target.\r\n- New: can be activated to blink to an airborne target, dealing Thrust damage and increasing the knock up duration by .5 seconds.\r\n\r\n(Should make Yasuo have to think a little harder when choosing targets to dash through for trades. Will also make his dashes that much more predictable for lane opponents, giving them more options with positioning in lane)\r\n\r\nR: Windwall- Yasuo generates flow while moving. The rate he generates the flow increases with bonus movement speed. Flow is used to cast Windwall.\r\n\r\nWindwall is now more arc shaped instead of a straight line, fixed size and lasts for 4/5/6 seconds. While active Yasuo may choose his wall as the target of his sweeping blade without marking it.\r\n\r\n(Windwall is now an ultimate. Flow let&#039;s everyone know when it&#039;s up. Yasuo has more mobility with the wall up since it shouldn&#039;t be up as often. Still retains  100/90/80 second cooldown to avoid backing to instantly restore flow.)","replies":[{"poster":"JhomasTefferson","date":"2017-05-29T15:13:09.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or, given the history of nerfs to yasuo, they could put the passive flow generation back into his w.","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2017-05-29T15:19:54.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats... just a buff... that wouldn't help anything... goal of thread is trying to find a not worthless palatable version of Yasuo that people would cry less about.","replies":[{"poster":"JhomasTefferson","date":"2017-05-29T15:26:42.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, that's the idea.

Any straight buffs would only push that further... the Yasuo hate is real. I don't like it, but it is what it is. I want to be able to play Yasuo.

Yas is pretty fine the way he is, far from broken.

My point is community is already planning to basically perma ban the champion... I want to play him. If he has to change for that to be possible, I just have to deal with it. It's not about what \"should\" happen... cry babies will cry and in this case, there are enough that it's very possible I may never be able to play this champ. I'm preemptively looking for ideas for possible changes in case this discussion has to happen. Best case scenario, the community will find someone else to hate more and we get to play the champ we enjoy. Worst case scenario, he's perma banned until riot changes him.","replies":[{"poster":"JhomasTefferson","date":"2017-05-29T17:14:50.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe the solution is to get rid of bans.

Honestly, it makes no sense, especially with someone that has situationally 6 dashes. Way too mobile.\n\nQ change so now he's a tank killer like Fiora? Ew no. Would make him go BC with BOTRK, IE And then PD so then he's too strong. He would deal 50% true damage or something.\n\nW makes no sense at all. You took his flow shield and put it on his W, and put a Fizz passive to replace it? Whattttt. And the shield would last way too short. 4 seconds is 4 seconds, which wouldn't last just walking back to mid lane/ top lane.\n\nE. It seems like you put together random stuff. Why would you let Yasuo damage all enemies passed through? His wave clear would be out of control and he'd be able to do even more AOE. Also, why a blink on E? So even less counterplay? Is that an excuse of removing Yasuo's ult for no reason, putting his R blink on his E? Now he will be even easier to gank so his winrate will drop.\n\nR.. I am not amused. His windwall is very strong for an ability but not strong at all for an ultimate. The cooldown is fucking insane, and why should Yasuo show when this R is up? No other champs do that in such an obvious way. \n\nI don't like it, it's a clown fest and has none of his identity. It's almost as if you don't even know what Yasuo is. He's a skirmisher, not whatever the hell this is.","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2017-05-29T16:35:38.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since he will likely not get as many dashes (since he marks any targets he passes rhrough) and his reduced early game crit damage, I gave the collision ignore so he wouldn't have to deal with creep block as well as fewer dashes.\n\nThe armor shred is incredibly small, especially early since % sucks early.\n\nThe W shield is an active, or did you not read that part? It doesn't auto activate on cooldown. Current shield auto procs on damage and dissipates in 1 second.\n\nE is his mobility skill, so in trying to keep all of his current elements, I made a non-ult blink possible on this skill. It's not random. \n\nR I agree would not be ult level without something extra, which is why I have an increased duration  and extra mobility within the wall. \n\nAll of his current elements are still here. Did you even read?","replies":[{"poster":"Yaśuo Main","date":"2017-05-29T18:32:32.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Note that his Q is maxed mid game and he has one of the biggest fucking power spikes mid game already, again this would pretty much break him. 45% armor pen straight up. This rework balances him around top too, wtf? That's not his intended lane. \n\nW active is still way too fuckin weak for an ability, try again later. It lasts for up to 4 seconds. So now he has less of a window of weakness and a waste of an ability. He now has only 2 offensive abilities as a skirmisher while someone like Fiora has 3. No fucking way is that right. A Nami has more offensive abilities than that.\n\nE is again, incredibly random whether you like it or not and basically a nerf. He has nearly no way to dive and/or trade without being even easier to gank, and he needs no blink on his E. How the hell should an ability have 2 CC's on it with that flexibility. \n\nPeople will call him overloaded with all of this.\n\nIt would've been fine if you left E alone as it is just a noobs annoyance and not anything too strong balance wise. Changing for the sake of change is a huge error you made that I'm actually disgusted by. Infact, Yasuo is literally fine anyway. He needs no kind of rework, and only nerfs dedicated to his top lane and buffs for his midlane. The fucker is sitting below 50% winrate mid and about to hit 51% top.\n\n\nYou can't give him a Fizz Passive, it's called Identity Theft. Yasuo is in no way a trickster like Fizz but you'll give Fizz one of his iconic benefits for shits and giggles?","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2017-05-29T18:50:26.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure how he has less offensive abilities than live, it's literally all still there without the aoe knock up extension, just made single target. He dives just as easily as before. His E is still a dash like normal, just with a situational blink, like old ult.\n\nAn active shield isn't a wasted ability.\n\nFizz is not the only champion to walk through minions. Off the top of my head I know Kassadin does as well, and I think Yorick  (?) When running toward people he hits with his e. I'm sure there are more. Hardly what I would call identity theft. I think weaving between minions effortlessly fits a wind powered samurai pretty well.\n\nWhere are you seeing 45% armor shred? It's 15% after 3 Qs...?\n\nI don't think you understand here... \n\nI don't think Yasuo NEEDS changes. I think he is fine. The community, however, at large doesn't like him and he may very well reach a near permanent ban rate. I am fishing for and offering ideas on how we could make him more palatable should that happen. Best case scenario, this thread will be unneeded, the community will move on to someone else and we can play Yasuo... Worst case? He is near perma banned and something will have to change... get off your rocker dude. Relax and breathe, and at least read.","replies":[{"poster":"Yaśuo Main","date":"2017-05-29T18:56:59.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1st error, don't try to ally with the circle jerk. Already tried that, doesn't work no matter how good the suggestion even is.\n\n2nd, if he DOES keep everything, then he's overloaded anyway.\n\n3rd, he can get 45% armor shred by buying BC. Which will put bruiser Yasuo in meta. Which is BAD.\n\n4th, He doesn't need Fizz Passive if you don't touch E. Don't touch E, it's fine.\n\n5th, active shield will make him more resistant to poke than ever. It would make the circle jerk go crazy.\n\n6th, blinks don't fit him at all other than ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2017-05-29T19:07:31.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) I'm not allying with them. I'm accepting the fact that it's possible they may get their way, aka perma ban yasuo... I don't like it. I'm just discussing possibilities. \n\n2) he's not that overloaded, I think that is circle jerk talk.\n\n3) why doesn't he buy black cleaver now? He has more armor shred on his current ult. He COULD just buy a last whisper as well.\n\n4) Pls stop referring to it as a fizz passive. It's not exclusive to fizz or his identity. I barely made any changes to E. He worst case has 1 to 2 less dashes per minion wave...? \n\n5) it won't make him more resistant to poke, it will be about the same, except now they can just watch the shield drop. They aren't forced to poke your shield, instead it's on Yasuo to have to activate it. It can be baited and lost, as opposed to always used regardless.\n\n6) and in the spirit of keeping that, I made it a conditional blink identical to his ult, except you press E to activate it when not dashing on top of people.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2017-05-29T21:38:07.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://youtu.be/z6Un6dFhh4M\n\nA well reasoned video about Yasuo.
