Here are some suggestion for Evelynn&#039;s rework:\n\n1. Her **Passive - Demon Shade** should give her _15 Movement Speed_ when she enters _Stealth_.\n\n2. Her **W - Allure** should give you _vision_ of the target you marked for the duration.\n\n3. Evelynn needs _AD scalings_ for her **Q - Hate Spike**, **E - Whiplash** (even _Empowered_ **Whiplash**) and **R - Last Caress**.\n\n4. Her **E** ability icons should be _swapped_.\n\n5. The slash of her **R - Last Caress** should _stun_ the target currently marked with **W - Allure**.\n\n6. Bring back the \"**I like it when they scream...**\" quote.","replies":[{"poster":"ThunderSkelett","date":"2017-09-27T16:42:51.995+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow make her op good idea","replies":[]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2017-09-28T03:13:56.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HAHA no","replies":[]},{"poster":"Halodjin Tyr","date":"2017-09-28T03:11:31.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want her to say it's time to feed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-09-27T17:34:27.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't care about 4, but I like 1 and 6.
