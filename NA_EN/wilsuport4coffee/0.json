First game- smooth and quiet, easy. Second game? NOT good, had a trolling garen and a toxic viktor mid. End game we tell eachother to fuck off- i leave lobby and got instantly banned. After getting 3 chat restrictions i never deserved in the place, that i requested four times for proof, was denied my chat logs proof and my requests ignored. No one ever reviewed my account, for anything at all. Never reviewed for toxicity, because if it was i Know I wouldn't be banned right now without a doubt. The timing was as soon as viktor's report went in- i got banned for 14 days.\r\n\r\nI'm done with this game. I never deserved the first 3 chat restrictions i got, sent in multiple support tickets about it, had it ignored, and got banned because people report me because THEY'RE pissy.\r\n\r\nRiot SAID that they review ban cases- so i was never worried i would get banned because if they at least reviewed cases when people were supposed to get banned, then i would be fine, and i could live with false chat restrictions since no one would help me. But apparently, they don't review shit and let their customers rot. I'm never coming back to play this game. I've wasted way too much time supporting a company that doesn't care about me, or anyone else who plays their game. There isn't one company I can think of that would freely ban someone's account without ever reviewing anything. I'm done.\r\n\r\nI'm utterly DISGUSTED at the complete lack of care for their customers. That they have this system in place, and it really pisses me off to be honest, i was already really upset about the false chat restrictions. It disgusts me they still don't have the tribunal up and running, I seriously have a deep, disgusting hatred of riot after all of this, and I seriously won't ever be coming back and will never encourage anyone else to play this poor excuse for a gaming company's game.","replies":[{"poster":"Hell Week","date":"2015-08-02T13:56:47.119+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"did you get baited into harassing a player? because that's what people do. they do bad, troll, harass you, until you do somthing back to them so they can report you. that's how they feed off their behaivor.... best thing you shouldve done, mute them and keep on playing. you getting mad at them or saying something to them, is only going to make them freak out on you and everyone even more.\n\nThat's why i only played 2 games today, people here are way too toxic. this other game i started playing is so much better hehe ( add me and ask me for the name , cause without a doubt it will get removed by someone lol ). im a complete noob and people are giving me stuff without me even asking lol. too friendly of environment. \n\nif you're noob here, you already know what people do.","replies":[{"poster":"wilsuport4coffee","date":"2015-08-02T14:05:21.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"For my first 3 restrictions, i was never toxic.

I've waited as long as 11 days for my tickets to be answered and closed. eleven. fucking. days.\n\nand this post isn't just about the inappropriate punishment, it's about their bullshit system and how ridiculous this company is. Like i said in the post, i didn't even deserve the chat restrictions I ever got. Not one of them. First one i ever got i was MIND BLOWN that i actually got one because- not toxic. I don't post about this because I'm bluffing. \n\nThe system literally adds up numbers of reports, that's the only logical answer i have to my problems. Not about toxicity, it's about talking what so ever. It's about saying anything what so ever that isn't ass-kissing your teammates and riot will punish you for it if the children so wish to report you. That's what this is about. As i also stated, regarding my chat restrictions i asked them to be lifted or to send me my chat logs to prove I deserved a restriction. \n\nRiot's response? They don't have chat logs anymore since the tribunal has been down, and 11 days later they closed my ticket without ever sending me my logs that i asked for 4 times, telling them i know they have chat logs.

The other day I was playing with my lvl 21 boyfriend. (I'm unranked, but when I play with my bronze friends they usually are so easily beaten it's frightening) This kid came in and of course was a lvl 25 and was one of the most toxic trolls I've ever seen. Now when I was a lower elo, I use to trash talk and insult people a lot. But as I matured I decided to help people with their mistakes and look now I almost never get trolls... but playing with my boyfriend oh my lord it's miserable. I just remember at one point someone kept taking the health (aram) and I asked them \"Hey, can we try not automatically running to steal the health please.\" And someone else responded with some \"Stop being a jerk\" shit. Then the next game I got the same two assholes, and I asked if anyone wanted my champ and they went off with their trolling. And my response was \"Omg, you guys again...\" I mentioned something about low elos and how I cannot stand them because they were pushing me and I received a \"Kill yourself\" comment, of course. I told them they had no idea what ELO was and sounded angry and then I muted them. Well someone reported me for negative attitude and riot actually sent me one of those \"Your behavior is not in line with how most LoL players act.\" Like holy shit? You don't say? Idk if you have noticed Riot but most league of legends players are 12 year old sociopaths. This continues to happen to me. Every time I tell someone to mature up or stop fighting riot sends me messages like that. I'd just ultimately disable chat but I get in trouble for that too.
