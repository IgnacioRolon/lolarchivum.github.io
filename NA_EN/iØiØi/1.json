Also, be mindful of how you present your point of view.\r\n\r\nWhile we can appreciate player's frustrations with being punished in League of Legends for their behavior, discussing that behavior should remain civil and geared towards beneficial conversations between users. Replies and comments that are overly negative, dismissive or combative are not appropriate and may be removed.\r\n\r\nYour removed content:\r\n\r\n**yo my bad bud, im sorry i responded to someone saying that they would \"fuck me in lane\" with \"ok boomer.\" i take full responsibility of the first 2 games, i just do not agree that this third game should be a contribution towards my chat restriction. i have a right to annoy and piss someone else off in chat which is something called friendly banter snowflake.**\r\n\r\nWhile we aren't taking any actions against your account at this time, please keep in mind that continued violation of the Boards Universal Rules and sub-board guidelines may result in future punishments.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this moderation action, don't hesitate to reach out to the Boards Moderation Team via:\r\n\r\nThe NA Boards Discord\r\nThe Discuss the Boards sub-board","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-11-30T18:11:31.424+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"As your removal messages explain, insulting others on the boards is not permissible.

It's the way you come across, you take the risk of someone being upset when you want to trash talk and banter. I haven't been chat restricted for 4 years or so now because even though I shit talk hard nearly every other game, it's a friendlier tone of shit talk through the internet. Even if I got restricted for it, I'd say \"ah damn someone didn't see it as banter. My bad\" and not cry about how \"I can't say boomer or snowflake\" as if that's the real issue, when it isn't.\n\nEither:\nA. Work on how you come across, because while it is hard to judge tone through the internet, there are ways you can HELP make people understand your tone. ***Keep in mind it's not a guarantee. When you try to banter, you can upset someone unintentionally.***\nB. Take the chat restrict and board removal as is. It's not a ban or anything, who cares?\nC. Stop typing in league chat. It's not a necessary part of the game. Pings work just fine. \n\nThey can moderate what you type however they damn well please. Doesn't matter if you like it or not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2019-11-30T13:35:16.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't get me wrong, that counts for in-game too.\n","replies":[]}]}
