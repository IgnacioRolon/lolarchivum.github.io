Help?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the longest time my computer has been giving me the worst lag spikes, disconnects and crashes out of any machine i've played on. It changes daily and its usually never the same thing... It started with MASSIVE ping spikes into 500+ where i would literally not be able to understand what's going on. It has been complete crashes of the game, random \"attempting to reconnect\" messages, slow response without ping (or at least showing it...), everything EXCEPT minions moving, crazy vision glitches where i can see part of the map without having any reason to (no champs or minions revealed), and pretty much anything else you can think of. My internet works perfectly, my brother doesn't get lag at all and when he does i know its our internet not the computer. My computer is not lagging FPS wise, only problems with connectivity. I've played league of legends through all this lag and it has prevented me from playing ranked to the best of my ability, and 1/2 the games i play will get some sort of lag throughout the game. \r\n\r\nI would really like to talk to someone to help direct me in how to fix these errors or give me some advise as to what i should be doing to my PC to help these issues, cause I really wanna climb the ranked ladder without having to rage at connection issues... \r\nThanks guys, hope you can help me out.\r\n\r\n{{champion:99}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:86}}","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-09-16T18:55:39.315+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I appreciate you guys coming to Help and Support about your issue!\n\nEverything that you mentioned in your original post, and everything everyone else has mentioned (disconnecting consistently, teleporting around the map, seeing minions move but unable to move your champion, etc, etc) are all specific examples of connection issues.  \n\nThe first step in hopefully resolving these connection issues is to complete all of the steps in this Knowledge Base Article:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/26932010-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nThere are quite a lot of steps in the article, but every one is crucial in resolving connection issues with LoL.  I strongly recommend that you attempt every single step, as it may put an end to your disconnections and lag spikes!  If you are still haunted by the living nightmare of \"Attempting to Reconnect\" errors or ping spikes of 500+, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) to us here in Player Support.  We can work with you in-depth to discover the root cause and provide some additional solutions.

It's only on League and it only started happening around late May/early June.\n\nSometimes, it's Riot's problem, not ours.  And it's frustrating when issues we have are written off as problems with our connection when we never had problems with connection and lag until one of the new patches.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-09-17T01:25:19.333+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely understand where you are coming from.  What further complicates this issue is that over the past several weeks and months, we have had some server instability issues with NA.  Some of these have been the result of DDOS attacks as well, which you can read more about here:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/service-status/REfQ8hps-regarding-recent-instability-on-north-america\n\nIn this sense, you are absolutely right, the problem is definitely on our end sometimes.  However, in the past couple of weeks, we have not seen any serverwide issues of instability regarding connections.  When we do see this server-wide instability, we notify everyone via a ticker message in the client.  \n\nWhen we do not see issues affecting the platform as a whole, we want to make sure we rule out the most common cause of connection problems, players individual connections.  When we review network logs of players, we can identify possible problems causing the lag, as well as rule out other possible root causes.  One way or another, we will find the root cause of the lag issues, even if it is on our end.  Once we find it, we will do everything we can to help resolve it.","replies":[{"poster":"Saint Tyrone ","date":"2014-09-17T01:36:44.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"So when is sion rework coming out?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shacorder","date":"2014-09-16T19:07:52.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't read the support topic, says i dont have access, tried to register and the link it sent me to choose a password doesn't work.","replies":[{"poster":"Shacorder","date":"2014-09-16T19:14:11.315+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nvm, just changed language to English and I can read it now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dead Wife","date":"2014-09-16T13:09:10.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My husband and I have a similar problem its completely random.  Like one game he kept getting disconnected/reconnecting every i swear 15 secs in the game.

I have comcast internet and have a constant 20down/5up, but when I get into a game my internet slows to 1-2down/.5(tops) up. It's like League is completely draining my internet the second I get into a game. After the game ends and I close the client, my internet will go back to normal in a few minutes. I'm tried router resets, I've even gotten the thing replaced by Comcast and not once have they said they've had any problems with service, other than a big storm last week. \n\nI've been having these problems for weeks and nothing is changing. Please, just give us some east coast servers so we can somewhat compare to those on the west coast.
