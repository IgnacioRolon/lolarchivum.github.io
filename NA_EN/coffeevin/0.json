I've just got the 28 min dodge penalty because of a bugg in champion selection. I found a match clicked the accept button and once I got into champ selection I couldn't see the champions nor could I use the chat or see any of the roles couldn't get a screenshot because I was trying to se if it might be a resolution problemwith my monitor but wasn't that. Also the patch update brought a connection failure everytime I get into a game i have to restart the client for my game to start loading.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-09T17:47:39.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on the updated client?  This could be an issue with that or a network problem failing to keep you in sync during champion select.  Return to the legacy client and test it in a custom game to help rule out possibilities:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Coffeevin","date":"2016-12-09T19:15:58.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Went into the legacy client. It seems fixed now thanks. I wanted to let you guys know these problems just started today after the patch update. Might be just a coincidence but I know every information counts :)","replies":[]}]}]}
