I've been playing with a friend and he's got plenty. I red about the chance resetting every month so I'm not sure if mine haven't reset yet or if it is bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-05T03:57:41.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The drop rate for key fragments is a curve rather than a line. This means that every fragment that drops reduces the chances of the next drop *significantly*. The drop rate does, in fact, reset approximately 30 days after the first key fragment, so you should start seeing more keys pretty soon if it's been this way for closer to a month.\n\nI suggest reading through our [Hextech Crafting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) for more info on this system. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Coffeevin","date":"2016-12-05T16:09:41.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, yes I'm aware of the drep reductions and the reset that's why I open the thread. Its been approximately 30 maybe be a few days less just wanted to raise awareness in case something might be wrong. I'll wait for a couple days. I'll let the support team know if  the drops still don't show. Thanks a lot","replies":[]}]}]}
