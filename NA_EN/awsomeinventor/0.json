Urgot's kit is ok. but it needs a desperate damage increase on the q. (possibly increase the cooldown duration on it from 2 to 3 or something to compensate). And Yorick , I know for a fact that his kit is being reworked into a ghoul controller. where he constantly controls 4 ghouls and sends them out to do his work, and all of his abilites either enhance the ghoul damage or increase the amount of ghouls that Yorick can have. ( though i would like him to return to the free rotation, alas poor Yorick). But what do you guys out there think about these champions. or even the ones that are ignored constantly, but are still good.\r\n\r\nKeep Gaming \r\nA.I.\r\n{{champion:6}}","replies":[{"poster":"Deustheproducer","date":"2014-12-09T03:59:04.079+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:3}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:83}} \n\nA legend speaks in hushed tones of the forbidden three.

For a champion that benefits from building mana, you'd think he'd get some scaling in there somewhere, and currently his shield is useless outside of keeping the Q's slow debuff. I can see why giving it AD scaling would be giving him too much tankiness for building damage, but mana scaling has been thrown around for a while now and I think it's a great idea.\n\nAs for his Ult. \nKeep it but make the damage reduction scale MUCH HIGHER the more champions you're nearby + the one you swapped with, but appropriate reduce the current base reduction already on it. In a 1v1 scenario, it gives plenty of defense. But when you ult into 4 champs while throwing their ADC into your team, you're basically trading deaths. Back when Urgot was released, this wasn't the case because there wasn't 2 assassins on both teams so your damage reduction actually meant something. If it was changed to scale upwards dramatically the more champs are nearby I feel it would restore it's original usefulness. Mess with the CD and Range as necessary. ... Though but seriously, Lvl 6 ult range is terrible, actually give that a little bit of love while we're at it. It's less than AA range if memory recalls.","replies":[{"poster":"AwsomeInventor","date":"2014-12-15T23:38:49.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with the mana scaling on the shield, and the damage redux possibly twenty or so percent?","replies":[{"poster":"Mirage Seraph","date":"2014-12-16T02:44:10.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess something like 15% base, add 5%/7.5%/10% per nearby enemy champion?

I use to play, and only play yorick top. Because of his fed late game. 3v1 and walks away with full health and a triple kill under his belt he is a great team fighter focusing and easily separating/eradicating ADC from the fight or any other squishy champs.
