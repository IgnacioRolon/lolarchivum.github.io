Im new to using rp, and i didnt know there was a gifing center, i thought we should buy the item and then we can gift it to another person. I know riot doesnt refund boosts, but i had sent a ticket to them saying the situation and if they can transfer the boost to my actual account.  IM just wondering, how long do they take to reply to tickets, and since ill be waiting for them to respond, what if the boost actually runs out? have i just wasted a lot of money?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-16T20:07:14.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gifting boosts are currently unavailable, sorry for the confusion.  :(  If you haven't used it, we may be able to work something out.
