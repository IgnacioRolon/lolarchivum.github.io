The bots have been running rampant especially on co-op vs AI and ARAM matches, but I have heard rumors of them being in Twisted Treeline too. My concern is that with the bot problem running rampant, someone skilled in the League will meet a full team of poorly skilled bot scripts (the bots cannot really play according to the tubes I have seen). The end result of that meeting is that the skilled player(s) (player creating aram-only account for example) will crush the bots decisively, get incredible stats and set up new record for the champion(s) played and by doing so maybe set up higher rating requirements for the champions involved.\r\n\r\nMy questions are: Will that kind of match result affect how easy/hard it is to gain champion ratings with those champions? Will low end MMR matches affect the rating system of high MMR matches? Has that affected the rating system already? I ask because like most people, I like those chests and especially opening them, and lately I have had a feeling that the ratings are getting harder and harder to get, and those thus those glorious chest opening moments rarer and rarer. Maybe my humble skills are just in decline?\r\n\r\nPS: You might dismiss this thread as ARAM-only matter, but it is only a matter of time until those bots start invading other game modes too and hit your most loved game mode.","replies":[{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2017-06-08T20:55:26.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">PS: You might dismiss this thread as ARAM-only matter, but it is only a matter of time until those bots start invading other game modes too and hit your most loved game mode.\n\nAnd so our brethren on the Howling Abyss now take up the age-old battle. Those of us from the Crystal Scar tried valiantly to hold back the robotic flood for years, but, alas, we eventually fell to the endless onslaught. Hopefully, you'll have better luck stemming the machine menace.\n\nOn a more serious note, I've been curious about the same thing. Pinging Riot via social media or [Ask Riot](https://ask.leagueoflegends.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) could work, but I doubt they'd actually answer. Riot typically hasn't been particularly talkative about neither botting nor the post-match grading algorithms.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-06-08T12:21:00.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would love it if we got some answers on this.

And they play so poorly that their MMR is literally rock bottom, so they're really only a problem for people leveling up accounts or that are still new to the game. They're annoying in coop vs ai games, but not much apart form that. You can't really inflate your stats with bots either, because as soon as you start curbstomping them your MMR will just rise to the point you'll no longer be able too be matched with them again and stabilize there.","replies":[{"poster":"Baka Red","date":"2017-06-08T19:15:25.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heh, it seems that you assumed from the subject that this was about bots invading ARAM. Well, in a way it was, but not quite what you thought. :)\n\nI haven't personally seen any bots in ARAMs. I am just afraid that the bots at lower MMR levels increase the difficulty of getting S ratings at the high MMR end matches. If you want more information about that, please read the opening again. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-06-08T22:04:20.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I said has nothing to do with ARAM though. Performance ratings are given by comparing how well you do with a champion on the same position on the same mmr level. That's why I said they can only affect people who are playing at the bot's MMR , which are presumably only new accounts and new players.\n\nPeople's performance on champions have no effect outside of their own MMR.","replies":[{"poster":"Baka Red","date":"2017-06-09T06:52:27.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah. Do you know it for a fact that ratings are MMR specific? ie: low-end-bot-games don't affect high-end-no-bot-here-ever-games? If that is so, I am pretty happy. Of course I am not happy that we still have bot problem at low-end-MMR, but at least it won't affect everyone. Now the question is; how reliable is your source about that piece of MMR information?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Raven Redeemed","date":"2017-06-08T14:49:38.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt the majority of bots will ever spread to ranked if that's what you are talking about. The point of most bots is to level accounts which is pointless when you unlock ranked at level 30. Not to mention most bots would trash the account's mmr which would also be pointless if someone was looking to sell it.\n\nI really hope they can eliminate most of the bots at some point, primarily for the new players. I don't want to see new player put off by all the bots they are finding in their games. The thing is the more Riot discusses it with us, the more the people making these bot accounts will have to avoid getting banned so we may not hear much on this issue from them.","replies":[{"poster":"Baka Red","date":"2017-06-08T19:13:19.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I agree that the bots won't probably get into ranked, but other Rift and Twisted Treeline games with MMR might be hit by them, and that means less dear chests from those game modes if my assumptions in the OP are correct.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shad√≤w","date":"2017-06-08T14:02:31.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"S on ARAM is almost impossible anyway no matter what you do","replies":[{"poster":"Baka Red","date":"2017-06-08T19:10:59.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I think we rather have it as \"almost impossible\" without the bot games twisting the difficulty into \"totally impossible\". :)","replies":[]}]}]}
