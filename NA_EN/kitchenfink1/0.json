I reported the issue and attempted to log back in. The client told me that i had to repatch. I did so using the Hextech Repair Tool and my secondary account. By the time the patch went through, my game was over. I received a message from Riot explaining how quitting a game is unfair to my teammates. I fully understand this concept. However, I did not quit the match intentionally. **Anyone have any insight on this?**  I dont want to be placed into the low priority queue due to a bug in the software.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-16T19:34:50.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, even though it wasn't intentional the [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system treats all leaves equally because it still causes others a negative experience too.  You won't have to worry about a lower priority queue for just one game, though.  Your best bet would be to run through our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to troubleshoot these bugsplats, and test it in a custom game to make sure it's resolved without consequence.","replies":[]}]}
