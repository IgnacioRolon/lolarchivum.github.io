From the looks of things though your connection in Champ Select was ok to start with; everyone was banning and choosing ok, nothing froze it looks like until suddenly this came up.\n\nIt can still be a connection error but one more due to routing errors or packet loss. To start, I always suggest making sure your Connection is 100% solid by troubleshooting with [**these steps**](http://riot.com/12B7oac). Once you've confirmed it's at peak performance, you should also upload your network logs [**over here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) and check for packet loss that might be interrupting your game's communication. Keep in touch with me about the results if things go poorly and you have no packet loss; I'll look for other solutions. :)","replies":[{"poster":"soul paster","date":"2017-07-02T02:35:07.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"English is not my first language lol but i will do my best thank you for responding","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-02T02:58:38.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's ok! In that case, I'd suggest writing in to Tech Support first; they should be able to provide the same or even better help and in your preferred language too. Go ahead and hit em up in a ticket [**over here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Be sure to set the language to the one you want in the top right corner too. :)","replies":[{"poster":"soul paster","date":"2017-07-02T03:12:15.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you but there is no Arabic language in the list and i am trying the list that you gave me nothing worked for now","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-02T20:14:41.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, try submitting a ticket using the English form, but still write in Arabic if you wish so EU Support can see what language you'd prefer.
