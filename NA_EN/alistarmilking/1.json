They told me that Riot Games does not have a store in Latin America, and I cannot order it from the NA or EU servers because they only ship within their region and not anywhere else. This effectively leaves an entire continent with no way to purchase the game at all. This is even more aggravating since Mechs vs Minions is a limited edition game with only a handful copies being distributed.\r\n\r\nI want to know if they are indeed correct, because I really badly want to buy a copy. I am willing to pay anything as long as I can get it.","replies":[{"poster":"Kades","date":"2016-09-21T16:58:45.708+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, the game isn't 'limited edition'.  As with every physical good ever made, there is a limit to how many we will have in stock at any one point in time, but our intent is to keep making production runs for as long as people want to buy them.\n\nArgentina isn't a part of our initial launch - since this is a brave new world for us, we wanted to focus on NA and EU initially and learn how to do this better.  If the game is popular and we see a demand in Argentina (or any region) we'll look to spin up a version of the game for your region.  But our plan is to keep that experience as player-focused as we can - for instance, if we launch in Korea, we'd localize the game for those players.  Localizing is no small feat on League and with a product with the amount of text that MvM has, it will take some time to make sure we do it right.  One pooly translated rule can really tank the experience, and since you can't hot-fix a board game, we have to be very careful in how we tackle the problem.\n\nThere are also other issues that we're paranoid about - like distribution and whatnot - and confining our initial release to one or two areas allows us to make sure the experience goes smoothly for other regions.  You might not get the initial release.  There's a chance that if the game doesn't sell or is poorly received, we won't bring MvM to your region (why keep selling a bad game?), but assuming those things go as planned and we see a demand in your region AND we can get over logistic hurdles for your region, then I would expect a reprint in your region, eventually.\n\nSorry if this isn't the answer you were hoping for, bud.  But I hope this at least gives you some context into our approach.","replies":[{"poster":"Fang Dong Feng","date":"2016-09-22T10:17:14.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"so unless i live in EU or NA regions i wont be able to buy the game at all? i personally dont mind at all having the game in English instead of my native language (i mean, i surf the web in English and play LoL in English all the time), would i still not be able to buy the game and ship it to my country? \ni live in the Middle East btw.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evelyn Endwise","date":"2016-09-21T17:08:30.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Kades,\n\nWould you happen to know why Luxembourg isn't shipped to? Most of the Western European countries are available to ship to other than the tiny ones (like Andorra) but Luxembourg is quite a bit bigger than any of those.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Santus","date":"2016-09-28T02:55:55.519+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll rather have the english version than the localized one in my case, I hate latin american translations. There should be an option for people outside those regions to get their hands on Mechs Vs Minions, at least if you are focusing on NA focus on all the north american countries and don't exclude Mexico.
