It went straight into auto repairing files which prevented me from re-launching and joining my game in progress. This went on for about 5 mins before it let me back in. I finally connected and played safe trying to catch up.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the game in after game lobby I get a warning notification about leaving games from the Leave Buster. I never afk or leave games. It's unfair for people to get this warning if the client crashed and decided to repair itself for 5 mins.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else had this happening to them lately?\r\n\r\nHopefully, Riot will find a way to get the client to tell the difference between an afk'er and someone who is having technical difficulties.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-31T16:42:52.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ), and it seems to have resulted in the game you went 0/4/5 as Kennen.  If you're getting bugsplats and repairs, then bad game files or even drivers could be failing to render your game.\n\nIf this is still happening, I recommend  going through each step of the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to help troubleshot this towards a more permanent fix.

I never afk or leave games and certainly didn't do so last night purposely. If not, I understand. I just don't want an issue if the game crashes again and I end up being banned.\n\nThanks again for your help and support.
