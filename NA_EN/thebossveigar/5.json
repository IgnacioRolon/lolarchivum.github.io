Running any recording software (OpenBroadcastSoftware in my case) lags me hard, which...never happened before. I guess I can't Stream anymore then, ah well.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-13T23:54:22.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhhhh yep, I'm guessing the main issue was that your pc may have been getting bogged down by trying to run League on top of recording video, as well as uploading the stream in real time to your streaming service. It's quite a lot to do all at once, so I'd try running League without any other programs running in the background to see if that smooths things out!","replies":[{"poster":"TheBossVeigar","date":"2017-05-14T00:33:37.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It DID smooth things out, mostly. I still get some freeze, & some dc though. But it never really caused an issue for me before the past few days & I used to be able to Stream League without it bogging down by pc.
