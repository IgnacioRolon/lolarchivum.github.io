While it's only for a second, it can cause a lot as the delay can cause deaths &amp; lost team fights. My friend says \"That split second is game changing, not being able to press E on Garen is a second of not spinning\" Please look into it. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T01:27:16.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FPS drops shouldn't necessarily impact your ability to use champion skills, so this almost sounds like you might be experiencing some packet loss. Let's run a quick test for that first using our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). Grab your recent network logs from a game that had those FPS spikes, let that reader scan it, and post a screenshot here so I can go over it with you!","replies":[{"poster":"TheBossVeigar","date":"2017-08-11T01:30:37.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well... it can when you're in the middle of a fight, the FPS drops throw you off & you die from it.\n\nI can guarantee it's not packet loss, at least on my end. My friend was the one having issues with his Champion abilites during that split FPS drop. I don't think I can send his logs. :/","replies":[]}]}]}
