Upon finding a vision ward in a bush, I autoattacked it five times, and each time it played the audio as though I was using my empowered basic attack although my passive was not reset.\r\n\r\nI believe that attacking a ward isn&#039;t supposed to use up her empowered auto, but I don&#039;t think the special sound effect is supposed to play either.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-18T23:24:47.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey PlasmaStarfish! \n\nThanks for the report! This one is actually working as intended. You're correct that attacking a ward with your passive active shouldn't consume it, but it's normal that the sound will play each time. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vesarixx","date":"2016-04-17T05:40:48.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That always happens, it plays the animation too but doesn't consume the passive, same way that Jax makes the sound for his ult passive auto while attacking turrets, but less annoying.","replies":[]}]}
