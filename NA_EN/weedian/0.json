I'll be in an aram and someone will be upset i chose what is a \"wrong\" page to them and they'll spam click my keystone but it will show something like\r\n\r\nSummoner Name (Darius) has Predator.\r\n\r\nI can't tell who's doing it and its very passive aggressive and i end up having to mute all of i want to have it stop. I'd still like to report the person doing it for being irritatingly toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-19T01:21:34.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow yea that sounds like it'd get really frustrating really fast. You won't be able to tell who's doing the pinging AFAIK (just tested myself) but you can at the very least mute everyone's pings on the scoreboard. That will stop all pings, but if you go down the list you could figure out who's doing it and report them that way!","replies":[]},{"poster":"WeedIan","date":"2018-01-27T09:07:08.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been trying to. Its very frustrating and happened again in an aram where we did badly. Luckily this time the Jayce flamed me after the game so I was able to report him.\n\nHopefully that's an item that has a hotfix of some sort down the line because people can be very toxic with it.","replies":[]}]}
