It glitches as in I move my mouse but the mouse in  the game doesn't move.  It's been doing it for 3-4 months and I am on the verge of quitting the game.  It never once did it before this time period.  I will be trying to kill someone in a team fight and then suddenly when I moved my mouse, it didn't move.  I have no lag and ping is usually a constant 38.  My mouse doesn't lag on any other game or internet.  I have 60 mbps for internet and a $1300 computer.  There is no reason I can find for me to be getting this problem with my mouse.  I also tried reinstalling the game 3 times....  I also have a problem where when I first get into the game my keyboard will not work, the camera lock the spells, nothing.  I then have to restart the game and sometimes this works, but if it doesn't then I need to close the whole game completely and reopen this and in return it puts me behind and I main jungle and don't get a leash or anything.  This is really frustrating.  I have tried multiple mouses and keyboards....I have also tried doing the whole delete certain files and then try again....If anyone can help to fix this, please don't hesitate to help because i'm sad to say I will be quitting the game and moving on should this not be fixed, and I am a person who usually only plays 1-2 games at a time so I will not be coming back...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-17T19:43:58.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, this sounds like a corrupt config.  When you mention deleting files I'm not sure what that means specifically, so I recommend a config reset:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.","replies":[{"poster":"Prime Instincts","date":"2017-11-17T19:58:39.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the information, I'll try it now!","replies":[{"poster":"Prime Instincts","date":"2017-11-17T20:35:33.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did what you said and then played an ARAM.  Keyboard worked fine, and mouse worked for 18 mins and then kept freezing and/or moving slowly.  Wasn't responding properly to commands.  Had 38 ms and 146 fps.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
