I think having a % missing HP on-hit effect while melee would be excellent, but it would have to have a low base (like 3% missing HP) and have an AP ratio.\n\n* Your idea for W is a little weird, Teemo isn't a hunter, he is a scout/spec ops guerrilla fighter, so maybe something more oriented towards a sort of hit-and-run skirmishing style would be better suited to his kit (also, giving an assassin a hard CC is generally not a good idea, especially when he already has another one)\n\n* I like that E is now an active, but since it is now an active, the poison DoT would have to stack with multiple hits to turn it into more of an assassination tool and less of an \"I auto you once and make you hurt a lot\" kind of spell. Basically, less up front DoT, but multiple stacks hurt a lot more than currently.\n\n* I like the idea of charging mushrooms by moving rather than CD, it connects to his lore where he looks for shrooms in the jungle, and also would make him less of a pain in lane, but buff him as a jungler.","replies":[{"poster":"KarKzz","date":"2015-03-28T18:15:07.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with everything you said.

This refreshes infinitely as long as he stands still (but moving requires a full 2 stationary seconds to refresh the stealth again). On breaking stealth (by attacking or the buff wearing off), Teemo gains 35/50/75% AS for 3 seconds.\n\nThis isn't a true gapcloser, but it would help him gank a lane and adds to the secretive scouting aspect of his identity (he tries to get from one bit of cover to the next as quickly as possible) He could effectively stay stealth infinitely, but would have to gauge how much time he is wasting by standing still for the passive refresh and how much he should just use the MS and stealth to get in for a quick attack.\n\nFor W, maybe it could passively increase the MS buff his passive gives by 5/10/15/20/25% bonus (20/25/30/35/40% total). For an active how about something like: Killer's precision: for 6 seconds, your AAs and abilities cause you target to deal X% (maybe like 8/11/14/17/20%) less damage to you (only applies to the target last hit, and only reduces damage to Teemo) and you heal for a small amount on-hit while granting a small bit of movement speed (ideally with the heal scaling with AP).\n\nI think giving him a true gap closer would kind of break him and remove a lot of cool options he could have, because then there would be no need for him to worry about how to get to melee range, or how to get out of a fight, and that would give us somebody like Nidalee or Fizz, and not a strategist like Teemo ought to be.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2015-03-28T23:21:05.981+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"He can jungle.

To do this, I would suggest any of these things: \n\n* Shroom CD is lowered.\n* Shrooms deal less damage total but have a longer DoT duration.\n* Shrooms apply some sort of debuff that amplifies Teemo's damage to that target, but can only effect one enemy at a time.\n* If an enemy steps on a shroom, Teemo gains MS towards them/gains stealth for a few seconds before triggering his passive's bonus AS.\n* Shrooms have greater vision radius\n* Teemo gains a one time bonus damage proc of a sort when attacking an enemy that stepped on a shroom (once per shroom would ok, but having an internal cooldown would also be a way to manage it).\n\nFor better assassination and ambush power, I suggest any of these changes:\n\n* Passive grants stealth for 4 seconds when standing still for 2 seconds (buff duration refreshes as long as he is immobile). This could allow for some really sick stealth shuffling around the map, and some pretty insane banks if he is patient enough, like stealth>move for 1 second>re-stealth>move>re-stealth etc. Sort of like he is sneaking around behind enemy lines or something of the sort.\n* Passive's AS bonus increases with level (like 40/55/80% Bonus AS on breaking stealth)\n* Like someone below suggested, change his Q to a form swap (between dart gun and knife) dart gun has a blind on the first attack after switching, and knife deals missing health bonus damage.\n* Change E to an active where the poison DoT stacks with consecutive hits, but starts out lower and isn't always active.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2015-03-28T15:37:16.382+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a few master players that are terrifying jungle teemos.
