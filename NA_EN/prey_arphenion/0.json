Always willing to listen to calls, but also to add to them if needed.\n\nHow long have u been playing league?\n\nsince late season 1 \n\nWhat unique skill / trait do you bring to a team?\n\nFlexibility, high league IQ.  I have 95 champions and can easily trade or fill other roles etc. always adapting to the current game state, whether its the meta, or the game im currently in.  As for high league IQ, I rarely make bad decisions on my own, I know when I can win a fight, when to sit back, when I can safely push, cs, dive, when I NEED to roam, when I need to get out. Oh and I'm also very aware of everything my lane opponent brings to the game, cooldowns, skills, and rough damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1EightHunna","date":"2014-12-08T21:32:45.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How old are u? 16\n\nRank in season 4?
