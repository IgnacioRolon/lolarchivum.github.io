It doesn't matter who you are, she can duel you. If it was flat true damage then it would hurt squishies a ton, and it wouldn't hurt health-stacking tanks at all.

But... you have to give the means to some characters to deal with the Mundos and Volibear of this world.\n\nThe best way to deal with a Vayne is to pick lockdown/assassin champions. (Vi, Hecarim, Nocturne (still needs a buff though), Sejuani, Zed, Warwick, Rengar, Nautilus, Nasus (his slow), Kassadin, etc).\n\nFor Fiora... Just wait to see what she's like in game before complainning about her being broken. She's not even out yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AwesomeChad","date":"2015-07-23T08:47:37.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I personally think its fine on vayne but absolutely an abomination on fiora and any future champion.\nHeres my argument\n\nIn defense of Vayne:\n1.

And are you certain that you can land all of these vital spots 100% when they appear? Are you really SURE about that? I  don't think so.\n\nAnd also new Fiora doesn't gain any massive attack speed for a LONGER PERIODS of time. It only applies for her two auto attacks.\n\nVayne's 3rd auto attack is GUARANTEED % true damage. So is Fiora's basic attack when she manages to hit that vital spot. And that's a cool mechanic because you can play around that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BlackInkX2","date":"2015-07-23T05:29:06.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am a Vayne hater . Yes why are we getting punished for building hp and survival items to stop the rest of her team from killing us . I dont have a problem with huge amounts of true damage like darius' and cho gath's  I can build hp and hope for the best but why exactly the more defences I build in order to survive the easier it is for these champions to kill me . \n\nWhy is the whole match turning  into a  race against time  to stop the forbidden character from buying  one or two items  to win the game . Am I still playing league or is this the Catch the VaYNE  game in which one team tries to murder vayne and the other sacrifices its members to let her live  and  carry  them killing everyone while she is running away ?","replies":[{"poster":"Straph","date":"2015-08-11T05:18:02.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget about Ahri whom has a true damage Q that can end game do 600 easy.  In ARAM she is a killer.  I was tanking which I like doing best.  The other team was strictly AP so I stacked MR to win the game (battle of wits), and yet true damage 600 a shot with a stun or two and I was dead.  With my MR I had 76% reduction to magic damage and dead in 5 seconds or less.  True damage isn't something you can defend against, it's not something you can avoid either.  You simply die.  So why is this fun Riot?  That was a rhetorical question, it isn't fun at all.  True damage should be reserved for snowballs, ignites and other summer abilities.  Not something a champion has on a Q.  From a low cool down Q (7 seconds).  So every 7 seconds I could take 600+ damage with no defense for it what so ever.  She kills anyone with low health in a hit.  Tanks just last a few seconds longer.  Instead of dealing with a 4k health tank after two hits you're now dealing with a 2k tank.  Can't tank something that does true damage I can only bleed out damage.  There is no build to deal with these types of attacks.  Think of it this way.  600 true damage is actually 1k or more damage from a regular attack.  If everyone is playing her, or banning her then you have designed the character wrong.  For insult to injury you'll see many Ahri characters in ARAM with ignite and snowball.  600+100+250= 950 true damage... 1700 damage normally, not to mention her other abilities.  It's a uphill battle.\n\nI would suggest taking any true damage a champion has out of their design.  Put in an ability that has standard damage instead of breaking your game for the said characters, as well as all other players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NullDragon","date":"2015-07-22T21:05:19.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"%max health physical damage blows up squishy targets, and is weak vs. tanks\n\n%max health true damage is good vs. squishy targets AND tanks.\n\nVayne will be even worse to play against if she has physical damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordKentravyon","date":"2015-08-11T20:03:11.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In all honesty, between being melee, with limited (but strong) defensive capabilities  coupled with having to AA specific spaces (Which can also be hard to see in a clustered team fight with skills flying everywhere)  I don't mind the mechanic on her.
