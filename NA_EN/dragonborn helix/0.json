I figure if I wasn't invested or wanted to be a troll that I wouldn't have a level 30 account along with more then a year under my belt, so is there anyway to get to the point where you can post any topic under any sub forum without this random level restriction?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-08T01:11:05.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main reason behind those level restrictions is to help avoid certain types of spammers I believe. If someone were able to post anywhere at any level, there would most likely be a higher volume of hackers posting phishing links in an attempt to steal accounts. \n\nIt looks like you're level 30 now, so you *should* be able to post anywhere!","replies":[{"poster":"Dragonborn Helix","date":"2017-08-28T02:45:41.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed I can post anywhere now, if you happen to have fixed something then thank you :D","replies":[]}]}]}
