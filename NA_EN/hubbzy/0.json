Plus the randomness and equal chances of players having no true strength unless they luckily get a main.  My thoughts on this are I feel that that gameplay lacks in the rewards because its shorter so you aren&#039;t given the bonuses as ranked or 5s. I&#039;m just curious if anyone else would agree and like to see this given some sort of character xp, IP, RP. \r\n\r\nThose Fiddle crows put in work :)","replies":[{"poster":"Kyrrion","date":"2016-03-14T02:00:55.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll have to see how Hextech Crafting works.

Or one team having all the pokes and the other being majority melee/short range. \n\nMaybe one team doesn't have more than 2 tanks or something. We don't need to make it strict like SR, but I think some modest changes would make this fun game mode so much more enjoyable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dessim8","date":"2016-02-24T07:25:00.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we balance the mode?\n\nI mean maybe you enjoy random, but I can't call it competitive. An option to have Draft/ban (not as the only option) would make me happy... unless I get teams that hurt my ELO in that mode too.","replies":[]}]}
