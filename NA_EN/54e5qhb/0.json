The people who consistently do the latter are the ones who are consistently hit with Leaverbuster. Either way though there is only so much leniency you can be given with the system before enough is enough, so it is your responsibility to make sure that you have as little reason to leave and/or afk as possible.

Having a frequent amount of leaves/afks though uses up that leniency and results in an LB punishment when it becomes a habit.\n\nThink of it like sick leave. Say you have 3 days of sick leave a month (example) to use when needed. If you use them up for vacation time then when you actually do get sick you no longer have those sick days available to use and now have to go into work as punishment for abusing them.","replies":[{"poster":"mlm olo mlm","date":"2018-09-29T16:40:29.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The quote literally says \"just 1-2 games\".\n\nYou gave more leniency in your made up analogy than Riot games gives its players.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2018-09-29T16:55:03.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mlm olo mlm,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=vohrhKoM,comment-id=0000000000010004000000000001000100000000,timestamp=2018-09-29T16:40:29.620+0000)\n>\n> The quote literally says &quot;just 1-2 games&quot;.\n> \n> You gave more leniency in your made up analogy than Riot games gives its players.\n\nYes it says 1-2 games but it's as an example.
