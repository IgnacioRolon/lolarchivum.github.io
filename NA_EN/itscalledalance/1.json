It turns out three of them played league and since I brought my laptop with me, we decided to play some normals together. I only played two games before I forced myself to stop. It was one of the most traumatic experiences I've ever had.\r\nGame 1: I went syndra mid while the kids went elsewhere. Within 10 minutes I was 3-0 in lane, while they all died a few times. I didn't think much of it since I'm platinum and they were bronze. However, they all started blaming each other and the one random we had on our team. They raged at everything. The lagg, their fps, their ping, everything besides themselves. Two of them ragequit before we could surrender and the game was over before 20 minutes.\r\nGame 2: Same start, except this time two of them couldn't connect due to the \"firewall\" error. I took a look at their computers to see what the problem was. I couldn't believe the amount of malware and incorrectly chosen settings they had. All they did was blame riot and riot's servers when their complete lack of knowledge about anything related to computers was the problem. I'm not a computer science major myself, but I can at least keep league running fine unless riot's servers crash (in which case everyone disconnects).\r\nBefore that day, I thought that people who went afk had legitimate reasons to do so. However, I now realize that most of these afks have severe self control problems and lack basic knowledge about computers and how the internet works. Also, I used to believe that ragers were people who've had a bad day. Now I'm inclined to believe that they're just young, spoiled kids. Before this incident I thought that plat soloQ was bad, but now I feel lucky that I don't have it worse. It must be hell in bronze and silver. I hope that riot will somehow address this problem. Maybe they can force constant afkers to take lessons on computer maintenance, or maybe they will implement a form of age verification similar to Korea. I don't know what is the best solution, but I now understand why several of my college peers stopped playing league entirely.\"","replies":[{"poster":"AquariusGine","date":"2015-02-09T18:10:20.674+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a 26 year old friend who is exactly like this, she's in bronze elo hell and blames just about everybody except herself","replies":[{"poster":"Antonidas1","date":"2015-02-09T21:09:14.240+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":2,"body":"So you're friends with Kaceytron...","replies":[{"poster":"gubigubi","date":"2015-02-10T01:06:33.200+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"IDK how you only got silver 1 last season because that comment was gold.","replies":[{"poster":"Rock Rockburgh","date":"2015-02-10T12:49:10.589+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"...I'm stealing this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Soulforged","date":"2015-02-10T00:22:21.696+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Friends with kaceytron and the player posting here that has a name called kacieytron...\nCoincidence?

Generalizing is always necessary to fix an issue that affects more than one person, but it doesn't mean it should be implemented if there are too many people *being* generalized. I'm under 18, work for all of my money, try to stay as positive as possible in Silver V, and I haven't left a game in over 4 months (pre-4 months ago, I was part of the group that was forced to leave by parents, referring to an earlier thread on here about that). I binge heavily on RP and the like, but it's the only thing currently that I find worth it, even if I am in a lower ELO with little reason to buy it other than for cosmetic pleasure. Sure, just because I'm an exception from the group doesn't mean a system based off of age is a bad idea and that it *shouldn't* be a reality, but if it was, it prevents me and the people like me from playing and enjoying the game as well.\n\nThere's a difference between bad players who are inherently bad and refuse to change to be better, and bad people who are willing and trying to learn. Let's say there's a ratio of 1/4 latter/former. If it's only four people playing, then sure, kick out the one kid. It's one person, and cynical as it may sound, who cares about him. The other three are happier now. But if the ratio is something like 2 million/8 million, then it's far too many people to make unhappy. \n\nDon't misunderstand me, I severely dislike the high RP costs.
