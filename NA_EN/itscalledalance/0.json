The final item is situational but Warmogs is usually your best bet. 12/0/18 masteries with Strength of Ages. AS Marks, HP/lvl Seals, CDR glyphs (any mix is fine so long as you end up with 10%), and AP quints. Early game, you are weak. That means you focus mostly on farming and don't gank unless it's completely free or you can get a safe countergank. Start Talisman+Refillable. Your first clear is any 5 camps. Once you've cleared 5 camps, you back to buy your machete, a hunter's potion, and a pink ward. Start farming again on the same path you started. Once you have your ult, you should look to pull off a gank if possible but otherwise keep farming. You want to get lvl 9 and Cindehulk as quickly as possible because that's when you really take off, and that means you ignore your team to farm for it if you have to. \n\n Your next item is always going to be IBG. The 2 item powerspike of Cinder+IBG on Sejuani is extremely powerful and the sooner you get it, the better. Once you have your 3 main items {{item:1413}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3009}}, you'll find you can pretty much outduel everyone else in the game and can very easily solo their mid or top laner and can often even 1v2 their bot lane. This is the point where you want to start looking to push down towers and force teamfights. Assuming your team isn't significantly behind yet, you should win fights fairly easily because of how strong you are. If your team isn't ready to group yet, just keep farming and looking for chances to push side lanes. You waveclear extremely quickly now with your IBG and those Sheen procs make you take towers fairly quickly as well. \n\nThe most important thing to remember when playing Sejuani is that, while you are a jungle tank, you are a very selfish jungle tank that scales extremely well, has very high carry potential, and is extremely oppressive when ahead. That means you farm hard, tax hard, and don't panic if things don't go well for your team early. You're one of the hardest scaling champions in the entire game and can easily come back from early deficits, especially if the enemy team comp is bad. Oh, and be sure to actually hit your ults.

If that's right in front of your carries controlling the enemy front line, then do that. If your team can handle that without you, then feel free to go onto their carries. In most fights, you'll want to start by holding the frontline and then going in on their squishes once the time is right. Generally speaking, the better your follow up is, the harder you can go for the enemy carries. You have someone like Malphite on your team? You'd better be murdering those carries. Your team's CC and tankiness is weak other than you? Then you're probably better off just being a wall for your team. You're both a tanky CC machine and an anti-carry. How you balance those 2 roles is for you to figure out on a game by game basis. Also, don't forget to get the captain enchant on those boots.

I'm worried that those who are good with him as he is now will play him so well that people will cry for nerfs. \n\nAnd before people ask: I don't see the shield as needing a quicker trigger. It works great with his Q and I tend to max his W first anyway so I can do my job as a tanks.
