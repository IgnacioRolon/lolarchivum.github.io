I have a well built PC, I can't name the specs off the top of my head. But with everything at max, with anti-aliasing off, I run League at about 350-650 fps. With anti-aliasing on I get stuck at 50 fps and my keyboard lags with a whole .75 second delay. This is a serious deal as I use the arrow keys to move my screen since my keys are bound to a special mouse. It seems to be running better than what the fps says, but obviously something is not working right. Also note when anti-aliasing is on my CPU usage jumps from about 18-20% all the way to 30-35%. I run Heroes of The Storm on max everything with anti-aliasing on at about 180-230fps with only 22-24% usage. \r\nI've searched Google for about 2 hours now and I'm left clueless. I have no idea what is happening and just hope someone has the knowledge and kindness to help a fellow summoner in need. Thanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-09T00:23:45.839+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you directly see a change in your CPU usage after turning AA on, I suspect League may not be running off your proper display card. I'd recommend working through our [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) to ensure all your settings are aligned with what we recommend.\n\nPlease let me know if this caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"Milky Roses","date":"2016-12-09T02:33:15.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: I tinkered with the NVidia settings and it helped a little. It raised my fps to 60 instead of 50 and the keyboard doesn't lag AS much, and it definitely does not strain the CPU as well, which was the biggest concern. I see an increase in visuals which is nice, but it still being at 60 fps makes me a little uncomfortable. Also, this led me to discover that Vertical Sync was actually the issue to all this. Weirdly AA doesn't work though unless VS is on. Any idea where to go from here?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-11T23:35:00.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From here, I recommend we escalate this to our tech specialists, as they'll have access to system logs, which will provide much more context to pinpoint this issue.

My game personally freezes up for 2-3 seconds. Someone said they were watching the processes an it turns out there are like 2 new processes that run during game and they can spike and run taking up alot of cpu.","replies":[{"poster":"Milky Roses","date":"2016-12-09T02:08:20.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately that is not my issue, I've had this issue with League since I built my PC. I brought over my station to a friends and sat right next to him. The difference between our graphics were significant just due to one setting, so I figured I'd investigate into this issue.","replies":[]}]}]}
