Lately though, shit what happened to this game?\r\n\r\nIs it just me, or has it taken a serious turn for the worse in the past couple months?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, queues have shot up to like 10+ mins. I&#039;ve never had that happen in any game mode at any level of play. Been playing since 2013. \r\n\r\nBeyond that, idk what specifically it is that is making the games so unfun. It seems like there are absolutely no close matches. They are all blow outs one way or the other. One player on one team gets strong and then its whether or not they can capitalize. \r\n\r\nWho wants to play a game where 9 people are fodder for the 10th person who is fed to play around/beat up on?\r\n\r\nThis used to be a team game where everyone could have an impact simultaneously and lots of games naturally developed that way. Not anymore. \r\n\r\nAlso, the snowballing is ridiculous. I play a lot of adc and bot lane, and if we give up the first kill in the lane its really very close to being over. Esp if its a kill lane. obviously some of that is by design but its soooo much less forgiving than it used to be. \r\n\r\nThe new champions are also a drag. I get that you want to keep innovating with champion design and some of the ideas are cool, but some of them are so overpowered or so sharply unique that they&#039;ve carved out their own roles, and now every game has them in it. \r\n\r\nThe game was more fun when the pool of viable champions was larger. The new champs, recently reworked champs, and then a select group of staple champs are featured in almost every game. MF, Pyke, Lucian, Zed, Rakan,  Ali, Jhin, Lee, Lucian, Camille...blah blah blah blah its the same old shit every game. \r\n\r\nFinally- generally the bot lane is fuckin garbage right now. I dont pay enough attention to know whether this is a prevailing sentiment or if its just me, but the gimmicky bot lane shit non adc champs destroying everything and making typical attack damage carries useless or very handicapped is NOT fun.\r\n\r\nOne last thing too- the people have been nastier. Idk if maybe it is more seasoned players leaving and just leaving newer players that don&#039;t have manners, but the proportion of toxic people/feeders is worse than ever. I had time for maybe 2-3 games per night and getting a game where everyone is fully trying is rare. \r\n\r\nI assumed it was bad luck for a long time, but its really not- it&#039;s actually gotten a lot worse. Eventually one has to ask themselves, why am I playing a game where I have to fish for a good competitive match? There are so many other multiplayer pc games out there that dont suffer from this problem so badly. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure probably two people will read this so it won&#039;t matter, but I felt like I needed to reach out. I&#039;ve had a lot of fun playing league these last 5 years, and it saddens me to see a game I enjoy becoming so shitty. \r\n\r\nI uninstalled the client tonight and won&#039;t be playing until there&#039;s a significant update. I&#039;ll have to keep my eye on the patch notes if I have a hope of returning- most of my friends have also stopped playing so I won&#039;t even have anyone to give me updates. \r\n\r\nGood luck fixin it Riot, it&#039;s no easy task to balance all of these champions but I hope you get it figured out.

They have been steadily working on fixing all the cumulative power creep and snowballing issues.\n\nA lot of the behavioral problems stem from people being annoyed by what a disaster game health is this season, and it will start to return to normal once individual agency and comeback chances exist again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"polite manners","date":"2018-08-10T02:37:33.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Follow up- I meant to say this initially...I actually think a lot of the \"people are nastier\" thing is that the games really aren't as much fun. \n\nIf only one person in most games is going to get all the kills and become the god, and the rest of the team is just there to set them up, help get them into position...it sets the table for a lot of frustration. \n\nAnd I think that is a lot of the problem with the game in all aspects- a lot of players spend a lot of the game feeling like their useless because for whatever reason its too easy for one person to snowball now. \n\nThis fosters frustration even if a person is on a winning team, because they're mostly useless. Also, it puts all the pressure on the person who got fed- if they fuck things up their whole team is going to rage at them out of frustration that they can't do anything. \n\nMaybe the game just needs a big shake up. \n\nThe one thing I will say is I am still feeling good about the new runes system and leveling system for accounts. i think those changes were good and needed. \n\nGL Riot","replies":[]}]}
