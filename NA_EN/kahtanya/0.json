This week is One For All but there is no option to even play that game or even show it. I only know its going on because my second PC was never updated to the new client.  Where is it in the new client??","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-26T22:35:10.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Featured game modes aren't available on the updated client yet.  I don't have any eta for when it will, but in the meantime you can use the legacy client during the weekend:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Father Milky","date":"2016-11-26T07:39:27.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:13}}  I was wondering the same. My friend invited me to the One For All gamemode, but the invite accepter thing said \"_**Mode not currently available**_\". It sounds like they're still in developement with it, just like how in the earlier beta, they didn't have the custom games tab. Maybe they're still trying to put it into the client.","replies":[]}]}
