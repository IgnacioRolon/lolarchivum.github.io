Unfortunately I don't have many details. In one of the games I played last night my team lost every drake to the enemy team. I also know we did not have vision in the area. At some point in time my duo pointed out that specific drake wasn't being relayed in chat when the enemy killed it, it was always just \"The enemy has slain the dragon\". I do not know if we saw the text for the first dragon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colin","date":"2016-06-29T20:46:45.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Howdy Dealth,\nJust tried repro-ing this.
