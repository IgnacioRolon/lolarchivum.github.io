I just want to know the reasoning behind the Tons of Damage that {{champion:223}}   can output by himself. Every game where there is a Tahm, ally or enemy he will just outdamage mostly anyone on the other team.\nIm okay with him being tanky and very annoying to kill, and even more annoying for assasin players, but I just dont get why a Champion who is tankier than other champs can still deal so much damage. He doesnt even need items, just get levels and suddenly your HP bar goes down by absurd ammounts.\n\nMy final point is that many players already thought that Tahm Kench was OP back when he was released, but he just kept getting buffed and buffed. And now its very fustrating going against a Tahm, and when I pick Tahm i just feel cheap, like a cheated, because it is waay to easy to win with Tahm\nMaybe im wrong, What do you think? Rioters and players\n\nEDIT: Im gonna add what triggered me to write this post\nWas playing Zed( pls rito just revert him back to his original state) I was 5/0 against a yasuo so I was really ahead in damage, I decided to roam bot to help out and when I got there, my bot lane had just died, only an enem tahm kench was left, he only had sightstone and a giants belt, he didnt even have kills, or that much gold earned, still he just rekt me and out damaged a fed zed, later I would try poke with Q, it would only do about 5% of his HP and Tahm kenchs Q would do about 20% of mine. At this moment my team just gave up, I wanted to carry as hard as possible but even going after their squishies would end in my death, tahm wouldnt devourer his allies, just me..","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2015-11-16T19:06:09.472+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Most other damage tanks do more dmg than Tahm\nc:","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-11-16T21:08:54.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Penns,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wpbLIEGk,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-16T19:06:09.472+0000)\n>\n> Most other damage tanks do more dmg than Tahm\n> c:\n\nYou are so right, {{champion:59}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:120}} , etc... dish out A LOT of damage while being very tanky too.","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-11-16T21:13:42.385+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Leu07,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wpbLIEGk,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-11-16T21:08:54.744+0000)\n>\n> You are so right, {{champion:59}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:120}} , etc... dish out A LOT of damage while being very tanky too.\n\nThey all build at least one damage item.

All you ever do on the boards is pop up in Tahm threads stating that \"X is way more broken than him\" in everything that is mentioned, but there's never any basis for it.\n\nhttp://champion.gg/statistics/#?roleSort=Jungle&sortBy=general.totalDamageDealtToChampions&order=descend\n\nTahm does the 18th most damage among junglers. Zac does 35th most damage and Sej 38th. The only full tank who does more damage than him in the jungle is Mundo, who does almost nothing except damage and even then is doing way more than he should.\n\nTahm is outdamaged by a single tank and that tank hasn't got a fraction of Tahm's utility. You can stop pretending he's not top of the pack.","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2015-11-16T21:48:40.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Says that Tahm damage isnt \"broken\" in the slightest? \n\nWell I wasnt talking about average damage, I was talking about damage he can actually do. Average damage is impacted by playstyle, utility, CC and whatnot, also devourer Tahm is definetely played more than runeglaive Seju.\n\nBut if you want to bring up average damage, both full tank Nautilus and full tank Bard are doing around the same as Tahm (last patch they did more than him).\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/2yEQeXWN-tahms-burst-at-level-9 You can read this thread if you want, without being biased, and then tell me whats so broken about Tahm again?

He takes WAY too many resources to kill, which let's his team clean up since you wasted all of your cooldowns just trying to get Tahm to back off of you. Ignoring him isn't an option either, because he will destroy your team if you don't focus him. His ult can also make it very difficult to contest for objectives. Then lastly, he can fully deny kills. \n\nRight now there's no real risk to playing Tahm. You get rewarded just for picking him. \nOne could say he has no escapes, but he doesn't need one when he never dies.\n\nIf he did far less damage or was less tanky, his utility would still make him a decent champion.
