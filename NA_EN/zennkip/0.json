I don't think there's any way to transfer from NA to Garena unfortunately - when they first opened that server they manually moved people who wished to move, then went off and did their own thing from there.\n\nI may be incorrect, but this is my understanding of it at least.","replies":[{"poster":"itmedog","date":"2015-01-06T23:51:49.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eambo,realm=EUW,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=kAekcQA9,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-06T20:04:42.824+0000)\n>\n> Garena are the company that host the LoL Chinese servers.

They will maybe sometimes once a year open up a change to transfer there. But only for a short window of time and if you miss it, you miss it q-q","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
