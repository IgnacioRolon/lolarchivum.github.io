If you're under tower, they're much easier to predict as their avenues of attack are narrowed and they're unable to get very close to you without revealing themselves.\n\nI'm not saying these champions are or aren't balanced, but there is optimal positioning against them even when they're stealthed.\n\nEdit: Also I agree that turrets need to be buffed.

This is 100% what has happened to the game since the end of S5.  Damage is out of control and the mastery system overhaul just added damage and power disproportionately to specific champs.  Riot hasn't had a control state to try new things since 5.15, just keep adding more and more stuff and hope it fixes the problems.    \n\nMy entire group of friends (8+ people) used to play league until 5.16 and since then they've slowly been quitting the game (A bunch left during the devourer fiasco and then the rest left after the new mastery systems turned the game on its head, the complaints about the game just kept mounting with every change after being in love with the game for years).  My friend who took a year and a half break came back to try it out again and was confused as fuck why some junglers could 100-0 him with no gank assistance and why the jungler was the same level as him.  \n\nMasteries have completely changed the way the game is played and it was not a change that made the game more interesting or more dynamic, it has homogonized how you trade and how you're forced to play the game.  Mid lane is now a three hit thunderlords minigame which has as much influence over who won the trade than the abilities used.  Courage of the colossus gives free health to champions that shouldn't be getting free health.  Winspeaker's blessing has given hidden power to healing/shielding supports and made them significantly strong for over a year now.  \n\nAll of this combined has made squishies die faster and tanks die more slowly (part of poppy's problem right now is CoC), no wonder ADCs are just a walking bag of gold.  Riot needs to slow down on making changes and balance the game out, at their current pace the game feels like it is in a state of balance for about 3 months out of the year and the rest of the time you're just hoping the bullshit gets banned.\n\n/EndRant","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-01-02T19:39:10.742+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, mages were scary as hell too during the juggernaut meta, i don't recall which ones but as a ADC you got sterak to survive oneshots and deny darius his dunking.... also helped that it was both cheap and strong.","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2017-01-02T19:46:44.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone started building tank, it was just most noticable that ADCs (especially the melee ADCs) were doing it to counter the rise of tanks with reliable damage.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GiantEnemyShaco","date":"2017-01-02T21:13:56.095+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"What's funny is that if you play Heroes of the Storm, Blizzard seems to understand that concept.
