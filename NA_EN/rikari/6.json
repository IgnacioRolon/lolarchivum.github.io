What exactly about Tahm's kit is any more \"offensive\" than Braum other than being over loaded with damage? Q is cc, W is cc or save an ally, E is a 2ndary health bar or sustain and R is just positioning. Tanks, whether immobile or not, shouldn't be dealing a lot of damage, there's a good reason why Juggernauts/some Bruisers with that damage will not have any hard cc and very little utility. It's stupid to allow a champion to have high durability, good damage, a lot off cc and a lot of utility. He also does their level of damage without even building a single half offensive items, at least bruisers have to build BC/SG, Tahm skips all that and builds boots+5 defensive items.\n\nJust because Riot said it's justified doesn't mean it is, especially when it contradicts what they said about champions like Garen, who was seen as \"very sticky\", Tahm can stick to a target with higher reliability while allowing his entire team to catch up to the target where as champions like Garen only allow themselves to stay on the target leaving their team behind.

Besides, i was able to 1v1 a support Tahm as Braum. The moustache never get's cooked. Plus he's the perfect counter to adcs and supports like Morgana and Lux. Braum can eat the Morgana stun for the adc when they don't have a good escape while Tahm just sits there with no defense except devour to rescue the adc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xeynid","date":"2015-12-18T03:12:49.037+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shit like this keeps getting posted and it needs to stop.\n\nBraum isn't tahm Kench.

If you could re-apply stacks immediately, you could chain-stun anyone in 1v1 or 2v2 scenarios.","replies":[{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2015-12-18T23:24:12.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point still remains the same though.\n\nTahm can chain his passive because he is the only one who can proc it (also it doesnt stun automatically on third stack, he needs his Q for that).\n\nWhereas Braum's is any ally, and given that he is teamed up with someone building attack speed, chaining his stun would be ungodly.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2015-12-19T02:43:53.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, but the point of OP is: Tahm chaining his stuns/devour is ungodly too.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Virgin Ray","date":"2015-12-17T21:30:35.713+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"What wraps my head around is why you would still be able to have an acquired taste for something you throw up.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-12-18T11:21:49.135+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taD2YOx47fQ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Transgressor","date":"2015-12-17T22:38:06.432+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's because Tahm's Nomnom soaks a massive amount of his power budget, so he has to have tools to make him feel like his other abilities are actually usefull.\n\nBraum on the other hand has a fuckton of tools to do his thing **IN CONJUNCTION**, the passive being one of them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2015-12-17T19:41:33.477+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tahm isn't Braum","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-12-17T20:43:30.722+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They rhyme, it's close enough.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2015-12-17T20:46:11.844+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't forget Braum is cheerful and positive while the ugly frog just wants to cook and get you in his belly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colgate Minuette","date":"2015-12-19T07:31:49.833+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're all seeming to miss the point:\n\nThe answer to beating a champion in lane should never be \"dodge literally everything ever\" or \"cc him for 20 seconds straight until he dies\" \n\n1) You cannot dodge everything. I'm willing to bet in lane if I'm tahm kench against you after the first 10~ so minutes of play I've learned how you dodge and I'm gonna land at least 50% of my Q's if not 80% it's not a hard skill to land its projectile speed is super fast so you can't just move according to where you see it going sometimes unless you're looking specifically for it.\n\n2) If you do get hit, you WILL DIE. There is no question there if you get hit by tahm's Q in lane and you're not right next to your turret they are going to kill you. Cause now tahm just exhausts you, walks right up to you and starts autoing. Assuming you flash he just flashes with you point blank Q's then devours you tears apart your entire health bar his ADC kills you then he walks away cause Sona can't get through his E shield if she wanted to. And if tahm wanted to now he can turn around and kill her too cause tahm doesn't give a fuck\n\nThe first game I played this cancer champ my ADC didn't die a single time they went 8/0/2 my first time playing it and you can't just say \"really good ADC\" cause the guy had never played jinx before and furthermore hardly ever played ADC he was a jungle main. (my friend was playing with me) This champ is the cancer of bot lane. \n\nI play a lot of bot lane, I play a lot of bot lane champs including {{champion:89}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:161}} \n\nAnd of all my games of support, no matter how much I enjoy playing this role. I won't go bot lane against this champion because I just cannot stand losing lane for no good reason. And even when hes not specifically in my lane he'll just come kill me anyway like what the fuck? You wana talk about azir being a strong lane bully? Watch Tahm kench plow right through his soldiers E proc shield his way through their autos slow stun and devour azir and kill him. It's fucking disgusting. \n\nI permaban this champion.\n\nNONE of his skills should scale off max health in fact no champion in the games abilitys should scale off max health it's just a terrible fucking scaling it makes this games tank meta into pure cancer and ruins everyones fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Lexer","date":"2015-12-18T19:47:22.607+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But while Tahm can stun twice, he can only eat once because the cooldown is really long.

He would rather keep the utility to see this decreased.\n\nHe has told me the main problem with his stickiness is that the stacks do not disappear after you are eaten. Typically, stacks go back to zero after a function like this. Even without a timer. After braums stun, you don't remain at 4 stacks; it's reset to zero. **With Tahm, he can stun them with Q (6 second CD), eat them for 6 seconds (6 second CD), spit them out, stun them with Q, etc.** The stacks never drop. He said it's stupid you can lock down a mobile champion like Ahri with a tank that has obscene CC and damage. He has 3v1 before on a support build and got a triple kill.\n\nI think that if you use an empowered ability, the stacks should reset. So you eat them, spit them out, and then you have to put 3 more stacks on before you can eat again or stun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2015-12-17T22:26:39.613+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"You guys have such a hard-on for 1v1 champs...
