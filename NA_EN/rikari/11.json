It is possible, provided you're on the right champion.  You tend to get camped a bit if you don't have Flash or Ghost, ]though.\n\nTP+Ignite Hecarim is a common one.\nThere is also a high ELO player who never runs Flash.  Always runs Exhaust+TP on Sion, Exhaust+Ignite on Rumble and Exhaust+Ignite on Katarina. \nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=eyemthestron9est","replies":[]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-03-01T03:12:04.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends specifically on champion. Old example is Olaf, used to run JG with ghost/smite, same case with Hecarim, there are very few exceptions and I am sure I don't know them all or even some of them, Off the top of my head Olaf, Shaco, and Hec are the only ones I can think of.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2015-03-01T01:55:16.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mention hecarim but not ghost... Hecarim often takes ghost I'm lieu of flash because they accomplish similar purposes but ghost helps his passive. \n\nSeveral other champions prefer ghost as well;  predominantly top laners who need to stick to their target rather than jump around,  nasus being a prime example.  \n\nI've also seen a variety of Champions with built in jumps forego flash in favor of say teleport+ignite: eg jax.  Or smite+ignite such as lee sin.  \n\nFinally I've seen more mobile supports (eg karma) run exhaust with ignite/heal/teleport.  \n\nNot sure what others go without flash but I'm sure there are other viable strategies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nybx4life","date":"2015-03-01T01:39:21.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ezrael might be good with it, as he has his own flash.\nLee Sin as well.
