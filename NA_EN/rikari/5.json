Yeeaah. Base regen for most is around 6-8ish per second, then 3 from Doran's. When your abilities to poke cost 50-60 and do half the damage of Zed's Q? Well, that means you need to toss it twice to match his damage, but it's also hard to compete with 1450 ranged Q. All you have to do is toss the clone behind the caster minions then toss the Q, do quite a large amount of damage from the one ability and if you manage to also be able to E the person, you get 2 seconds off your W's CD. Most Zed runs 5% CDR runes then another 5% from masteries, rush the Brutalizer for a total of 20%. That 18s CD just turned into a 14.4s CD, 12.4s if you land the E, which against a short ranged mage who's trying to counter-poke against your 1450 ranged W+Q combo, it's not too hard.\n\nI should also note how I'm getting 1450. His shadow goes 550 range in the direction of your choosing. His Q has a 900 range. I should note Ezreal's Q is a 1150 as a comparison of poke power. Comparing him to other champions as well, Ziggs' Q has an 850 range to toss the bomb and can bounce up to 1400, though let's face it, if you're hit by the bouncing Q, you're likely bad at sidestepping or slowed. And for even more 'WTF' is Nidalee's spear is 1500. Only 50 range more than Zed's combo. Yes, the dreaded death spear BARELY out ranges Zed's W+Q combo. \n\nI will also note that the change mentioned won't actually affect Zed in really any way since his R Shadow is never under the turret to begin with since he'll R you from out of the turret range and now be in the turret range. His W only lasts for 4 seconds and most Zeds just W then instantly Q and that shadow is pretty much useless unless your opponent is stupid enough to walk near it for you to press E OR you decide to teleport to it so you can R. Either way, if you halved its time, that's only 2s.

Why would you walk away from some one as Zed? I'm saying his max range is 1450, that means he has more than the entire screen to hit you with a Q, which even if both don't hit, the single one will hurt. The only reason Zed's poke is usually a bit small early on is because he throws it through minions. With a boosted 550 from the shadow and a decent knowledge of how his Q works, you can hit anyone with at least one. \n\nConsidering this range though, as I mentioned, this idea to reduce his shadow duration under the turret is useless. Zed doesn't stuff his shadow under the turret to sit there for the entire duration.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-05-05T21:00:55.890+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I assume the OP is mainly thinking of lanning phase. Which he will only be getting 20 back. IMO Zed is fine late game as is if he is talking about late game. This is why Riot claims he's a healthy assassin. How he assassinates after lanning phase is fine. It's his early game power that makes problems happen. Although with more tank junglers and fewer fighters that synergize with assassins, he has not been as bad. \n\nThat's still 10% of his resource pool. More than Azir will get back from regen in the time it takes for Zed's shadow to come back up. That is a good bit. Not amazing, but it's enough. \n\nAssuming level 6. Rank 3 Q, Rank 1 W and E. Full combo costs 155. Hitting both Q's makes brings it down to 135. He will regen this before his shadow is available again. Azir cannot repeatedly harass like this. He will go OOM. Since he wont likely be casting W on cooldown, he'll probably get an extra Q or two in there as well between shadows without running into energy problems. \n\nAgain,  not saying I support the OP's idea.

God bless you. Most of the time when you use your shadow and your E and your Q it takes all your energy. People always say \"Zed has no counter play\" Yes he does. There's a lot of counter play to zed. If you see him use his Shadow then E and Q you know 2 things: 1. He has no energy. 2. He has no moves to use for a few seconds. That is plenty of time to go up to him and damage him in some way. \n\n   I'm getting sick of so many people saying that Zed needs a nerf and that he is too OP. Yes he is very strong but he's also very hard to learn. I don't care what anyone says. Zed is a hard champion to fully master and yes a person who hasn't mastered the ways of the forbidden ninja don't do great. I can tell if a Zed is bad within the first 3 minutes of the game and I can ruin his game because of his inexperience. \n\nAnd one more little rant about Zed haters. Look at his Kit. His Q is a skillshot that deals less damage depending on how many people it goes through. His W does no damage (it does give him bonus AD but no actual damage is dealt by it) and allows him to move over terrain and also gap close to champions. His E is a short ranged AOE damaging spell. KEY WORD SHORT. It literally only hits people right next to him. Now lets look at someone else. Now I'm not calling Kat OP but her kit seems a bit overwhelming especially in an experienced players hands. She has a POINT AND CLICK RANGED DAMAGING Q (Zeds is a skilshot) Her W is basically the same as Zed's E. Her E is a fucking cancerous blink that she can cast on almost anything and it deals damage. I think it's stupid that she can jump to an ally with a move that does damage and not damage them. She can also jump to wards and to fucking minnions. That is cancer. Not to mention her annoying as passive that allows Kat players to just spam QWER and then do it again and again and again. Plus all of her moves do damage unlike Zed's. So before you go calling him OP look at what his kit really is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-05-06T18:14:06.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Durzaka,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Av3qPyN2,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-05-05T05:02:22.363+0000)\n>\n> How about because Zeds shadow has a 14 second CD and Azir's soldiers have a 8 second CD.

The difference between Energy and Mana makes that pointless. Zed uses most of his Energy, but that can be regenerated within 12 or so seconds. If you use up your mana as Azir, you will have to wait up to 20-40 seconds based on your mana regeneration at the time, and that is to create the soldier.\n\nAzir's sustained damage is, however, the reason they have a reduced time under towers since that would be insane if Azir could just place two soldiers under your tower and ACTUALLY zone you out of the lane. Zed can also only make one shadow with his W, where as Azir can make up to three, I think sometimes for for a split second or so.","replies":[{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2015-05-06T18:18:24.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The difference between Energy and Mana is very important, it isnt pointless.\n\nThe enemy has a very very clear window of opportunity to absolutely crush Zed while he is out of energy.\n\nThey opportunity is much more vague/hard to tell against a mana user, and is often not there except against people with very long CDs on their escapes.

It just means that there's nothing incredibly special about him. Compare this to pre-nerf Sejuani after Cinderhulk came in, or Warwick after the introduction of Devourer. It's not that Zed is bad, and in my opinion, he shouldn't BECOME bad. But he's not particularly amazing, either.

Also, {{champion:238}} 's shuriken does less damage if you're behind minions. Almost half, actually. And please remember that before level 6 and decent items {{champion:238}}  gets destroyed by most ranged mid laners, and almost every single melee laner. Therefore, you can abuse that so hard you'll get arrested for rape.\n\nIf a shuriken on a 6 second cooldown that costs 37.5% of Zed's full energy is difficult to dodge, good luck playing against {{champion:81}} . Just saying. Dodging skillshots is something you should learn to do by level 30.\nAlso, just using Q is underwhelming without AD. A full combo is only devastating if you take two of those shurikens to the face, and then if you do dodge them you can kick {{champion:238}}  in the balls as many times as you want for the next 18 seconds. You can invite the jungler to lunch at mid, too.\n\nYour logic is also extremely flawed. \"Just because they can dodge it doesn't mean it's easy to?\" There are much harder skillshots to dodge than Zed's Q, Dark Binding and Steel Tempest, to name a few. They're also more devastating and are more spammable, and arguably deal more damage. But please, complain about {{champion:238}}'s shurikens.","replies":[{"poster":"kunkudunk","date":"2015-05-07T04:32:12.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dark binding is not harder to dodge than zed's q, it goes so much slower. And steel tempest has like no range other than the tornado, which is also easier to dodge than a zed q since you know when it's coming. And even if he runs out of energy it is full again in 20 seconds since energy recovers so fast. Sure his q isn't the hardest to dodge and I am well aware of it doing reduced damage through minions. However, don't act like he runs out of energy and stays out, it regenerates very quickly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"wop","date":"2015-05-05T16:31:52.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This would make sense, except Zed's Shadows can't hit turrets.........\n\nI'm surprised that wasn't other peoples main argument lol\n\nbut seriously, Azir's soldiers actually pose a threat to turrets, and Zed's Shadows do not. \nand, Zed uses a good bit of his energy pool to cast a shadow, and he would have to blow his ult in order to have more than one","replies":[]}]}
