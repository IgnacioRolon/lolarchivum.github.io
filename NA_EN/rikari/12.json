Now sure not all of those listed have a high skill cap, but without that kind of click you just need to practice. And to all of you who are like \"Ezreal takes skill? Lul, Riven takes skill? lul\" I've played both of them and If i ever intended to actually play them in ranked I would need practice to learn them. Some champions are skill based entirely (Ezreal) and so overall can be more difficult to learn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Salt Miner 49 Er","date":"2015-03-13T01:05:51.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheRikari,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2TBrfo6F,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-03-13T00:53:25.699+0000)\n>\n> A {{champion:19}}  told me this while playing {{champion:1}} .
