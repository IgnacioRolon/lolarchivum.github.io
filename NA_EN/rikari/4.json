Cinderhulk is also far away from being bad, which is another main argument people bring who want Sejuanis nerfs to be reverted. It's actually the best item for every jungler who can take it. Even bruisers like Vi and Jarvan shouldn't take Warrior but Cleaver + Cinderhulk.\nIf Sejuani is shit then Amumu must also be shit, he's practically Sejuani with better early clears but worse damage and post-6 ganks. So yeah.

People flip out and start singing eulogies every time a champ is reworked/nerfed. I haven't seen Sej have any issues with damage, sustain, or presence. It was a bit rough at the beginning of s6, but the slight talisman buff was all that was needed.\n\nIn fact, Sej, with max cdr is probably the best peeler in the game. People say Leo's better? Try to peel EVERYONE on the other team as Leo. Only champ I know that come close to Sej's ability to pull that off is Alistar. Sej with spam cdr can disrupt an entire team for 20 seconds straight, and fill frontline duty solo just fine. Yes, she lacks the innate defenses of true tanks, but she makes up for it with greater interrupt capabilities and mobility.\n\nA hard tank-busting comp focus will end her quickly, sure. But a team takes great risks when they start bearing down on a sej together with her ult still up.\n\nMalphite and 'Mumu ults seem better? See if they can follow there's up by cutting the entire opposing team's move speed down by 2/3ds for 2 seconds, and then follow that up with the same aoe slow a couple seconds after. Add in Randuin's and you can pretty much torment the entire team indefinitely, hence why I say Sej is one of the greatest full-team peelers.\n\nBut if we're gonna sing her death knoll ANYWAY, let's at least check her win rates first:\n\nhttp://champion.gg/statistics/\n\nOh look, 51%. SHE'S FINE. And this is why Riot doesn't give a crap how players' feel. Riot honestly shouldn't. Abandon reason, all ye who enter this community.

Yes, her AoE DOT portion remained the same, but that doesn't always make much of a difference because of how easy it is to get away from her.  So her front-loaded damage was hit hard.\n\nShe isn't AoE CC and lockdown oriented, if you are going off her ult as the basis for that statement that is bullshit.  Without her ult her cc is a single target knockup and a situational slow.  With the slow you have to tag them with a AA or Ability  to get a proc and then pop her e.  While the slow is strong it only lasts 1.5 secs and you can't apply Frost for 3 seconds after PermaFrost ends.  You then need to still be in range of them to apply another frost stack and wait for Permafrost to come off of cooldown to pop it again.\n\nSo i will retract my earlier statement it was far harsher then it needed to be, but after double checking i still stand by the fact that sej is in limbo at the moment.  There are so many champions that do her job so much better than her and most games end before she can even get rolling.","replies":[{"poster":"I Miss Cannon","date":"2016-01-03T07:42:46.685+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Never read so much bullshit in one post.\n1. Saying it's easy to get away from Sejuani is like saying it's easy to get away from Tahm Kench, and the whole boards flamed Riot for saying that not too long ago\n2. Yes she is AoE CC, AoE damage and lockdown oriented. She can easily hit 3+ people with her ult and her Q not having to hit someone to gapclose and her R being ranged is what makes her superior to Amumu btw\n3. Her Q isn't even single target\n3. Must be super hard to stick to a target with a 6 sec cd Gapcloser (with a traditional CDR tank Sejuani build), a 70% slow with 1000 cast range and an ultimate with 1100 cast range that even slows when you miss it. Jesus judging from how you speak, probably only champions like Leblanc are sticky for you huh?\n4. She already gets rolling with 6 and Cinderhulk and most games don't end at minute 10 so what's your point?\n5. Why would you even exclude her ultimate in an argument? There are soooo many champs even of the same kind who are pretty shit without their ultimate: Malphite, Amumu, Warwick, etc. etc. etc.\n6. Cinderhulk isn't even bad fyi and it also doesn't get removed anytime soon. Maybe if it happens to get removed without getting replaced by a similarily good or better item then we can talk about reverting Sejuanis nerfs.\nPlease stop bashing Riot for nerfing Sejuani just to fish for upvotes.

The only champs that sej can stick to easily are the immobile ones or the stupid mobile ones that don't know how to time their dashes, etc.\n\n3. Her Q is single target, unless the champs are practically standing next to each other  For context taken straight from the wiki.\nArctic Assault's charge stops after colliding with an enemy champion, but can affect multiple enemy champions if they are close enough together.\nArctic Assault does not have an area of affect while colliding with an enemy champion; however, if multiple champions are hit by the charge itself, you may deal damage to multiple enemies.\n\n3. what? also learn how to count.\n\n4. No, at 6 she can set up her team for skirmish victories with her ult, cinderhulk while helpful isn't going to do much by itself.  She is a late game teamfight oriented champion, and last i checked level 6 is not late game.\n\n5.  I am not excluding her ult, I was saying that using her ult as the basis of your argument for her being and AoE CC Lockdown champ is pretty stupid when it is her only lockdown.  1 ability that is on a 130/115/100 sec cooldown doesn't not make a champion a AoE CC lockdown champ.  Also it only lasts 1.25/1.5/1.75 secs.  Yes it can affect the whole team at range, but it doesn't constitute her being a lockdown champ see as after it ends thats it for her lockdown.\nAlso Amumu and Maplh are both still strong without their ults, its just their most iconic feature.  Warwick on the other hand is in a bad spot so thats not really a fair comparison since most of the time he only ends up being his ult and nothing more.\n\n6.  Where did i say anything about Cinderhulk being bad?  I actually said that they finally balanced the item itself after they nerfed sej.\n\nI am not bashing Riot and i have never bashed them.  I am not fishing for upvotes, i was just stating my opinion.  You are the one who came in here on you high horse and started attacking me.\n\nI will admit my first posts had some generalizations in them, but i was tired and didn't bother to check my facts.

I and several other people proved him wrong with factual evidence and he just ignored it and attacked us on fabricated statements about us and unimportant things. \n\n1. I am talking from experience, lots of mobile champs can easily escape from sej especially if they are smart with their ability use.  Did i make mistakes, probably, but its still possible.  I even explained how.  Her slow only last 1.5 secs and for 3 seconds after it ends targets affected by permafrost can't have frost applied.  Yeah, it is kinda timing reliant and most people don't think like that, but you would be surprised how often they pull it off.\n\n2. The AoE portion of her q is so small it might as well be nonexistent.  As i said they have to be standing next to each other for it to work and they only take the damage.\n\n3. I was referring to the Leblanc comment, but i guess i should have clarified that.\n\n4. Not what i said, yes she has utility early game, but she is weak and can be punished hard and be useless until she recovers.  Which is not a good thing with shorter games.   I know this from experience, trying to gank for you team or help them, they fuck you over and then you end up behind and can't do shit expect throw out an ult occasionally and follow it up with a slow.\n\n5.  I did not say they were better. You want a lockdown champ, {{champion:111}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:127}}.
