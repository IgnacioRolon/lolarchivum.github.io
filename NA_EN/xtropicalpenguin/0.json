For her q I find it pretty insane that she can kill the whole back line with one Q. Even though I think it makes her more lane dominant to be able to shove, I think the new W changes might make her a little to strong while some champs are shoved under tower? \n\nJust wondering.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Great Ozymandius","date":"2016-07-05T18:17:29.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi Meddler, \n\nI have some thoughts on how you might update Akali and I was wondering if you would take a look (this has nothing to do with your above comment, but I didn't know how else to get your attention): \n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/A5uRzwK7-akali-assassin-update-recommendation\n\nDo you have any thoughts on this?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Defended","date":"2016-07-05T20:20:43.397+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I actually agree.
