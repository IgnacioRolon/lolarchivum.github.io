It's a waste of time trying to talk to my team when 9 times out of 10 they will ignore me, or they will flame. My winrate is indicative of me being a piece of trash player who can't carry, nothing more, nothing less. I had an akali wanting me to gank when she was 25% health against a 100% life zed with 2 kills up and 30 cs up on her, nothing i said would get her to back down, i ganked, she died, she flamed, she afk'd.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-03T20:26:53.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is why you have a 40% winrate.
