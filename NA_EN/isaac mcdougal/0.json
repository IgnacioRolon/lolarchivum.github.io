It was a bargain after all! So you bought and went back to lane. You started autoing the enemy laner, but alas, no result. Bummer. A shitty bargain within a shitty bargain. But it wasn&#039;t even a bargain, it was 2.8 thousand gold. You swear to yourself about how the item sucks, and sell it to buy a second Statikk Shiv.\r\n\r\nAlright, kiddies. Storytime&#039;s over. Now with the Midseason Magic Update, we got all this cool shit, like a revolver item that finally shoots things, Mei&#039;s rocket launcher, the I&#039;m-Annie-and-I-need-a-Blink-but-I&#039;m-not-level-eight-yet, the God of Ages is now the Shod of Ages, and our favorite budget Bilgewater novel stole the Unholy Grail&#039;s passive because the author is a douchebag. Don&#039;t worry though, Mr. Goblet! You got a compensation prize! It&#039;s called a math formula more complicated to understand than Whisper&#039;s!\r\n\r\nMore things were changed, but for TL:DR another focus of the changes was to grant a little more artificial power to Mages by nerfing some MR items but mainly the Mercurial Scimitar through changing it to only remove CC effects. That raises the question: should they buff Wit&#039;s End? One could raise the question of it causing another generic anti-Mage sword to be relevant. However, with Scimitar&#039;s remove-all being limited and being forced to now pick between Sterak&#039;s Gage or the Maw of Malmortius, it could be seen possible as the power-pick between the three. My method of achieving this is through either allowing Wit&#039;s End to Crit or buffing its damage/MR steal.\r\n\r\nNow, the first method mentioned is allowing Wit&#039;s End to Crit like I just said. With Crit, Wit&#039;s End is given the ability to be picked up by Marksmen who need more MR, but keep some damage. This might make it viable, but thing about this is that it shoehorns Wit&#039;s End into only Marksmen, Tryndamere, and Yasuo. However, because of this, it might allow for more Marksmen that are actually centered around their Basic Attacks like Twitch and Varus especially to make a possible return.\r\n\r\nThe second method is buffing damage alltogether. The first way this could be done is granting 10 damage to it. Done and simple. The second, however, could be to add Magic Damage based on how much Magic Resist you&#039;ve stolen. This could raise its potential damage from base 40 to 65. Lower than a Crit, for sure, but it&#039;s a route. This could be an alternative to the method just mentioned as a way to avoid Wit&#039;s End being shoved to the role of Crit users, and open it up to Champions like Irelia and Jayce.\r\n\r\nThe third method I&#039;m devising is raising its Magic Resist steal per hit to seven, eight, nine, or even ten, effectively making it the Black Cleaver for pansy Muggles. Doing this could make it more, relevant but this could most likely be seen as incredibly dangerous. The problem with raising the MR grab against enemies is not how much they&#039;re losing, but how much you&#039;re gaining. The base Magic Resist of Wit&#039;s End is 40. If it is raised above five, the amount of Magic Resist could be as high as 90 with stealing ten from the enemy. Champions like, Olaf, Irelia, the Kindred FUCKING JAX, and Udyr would most likely terrorize League, signing tickets to Super Hell.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading this shitpost.

Perhaps it could be made into a more powerful, more expensive item (which would be the \"scaling\" solution), but even then I don't know if that would really help.\n\nRight now, I think the main issue with Wit's End is that it's not really an interesting item on most champions. There are plenty of on-hit magic damage dealers who'd normally love a MR-shredding item, and who could potentially make good use of its MR too, but there are better, more specialized options for either. If you want proper defense against magic damage, many items out there have better defenses and a better build path, and if you want more magic damage on an on-hit champion, Nashor's Tooth and Guinsoo's Rageblade do a much better job (Sorcerer's Shoes are also a simple and effective option). The magic resist steal is powerful, but poorly visible, and in general the item doesn't really feel like it adds to the user's kit. By contrast, even a shred item like Black Cleaver feels powerful because it's got better optimization and more attractive stats, and it also has the advantage of a shred paradigm that works better, since physical damage is better-suited towards DPS whereas magic resistance shredding tends to be at its strongest at the very beginning of a fight, when every AP champion has their abilities ready, and not later on, when they go on cooldown. If Wit's End really needs to continue existing, it should probably ditch the steal component on its passive and focus on MR shredding, possibly even shred differently (e.g. apply all of its shred instantly and have it decay over time).\n\nAnother potential reason why Wit's End isn't popular is because its build kinda sucks. For the most part, you're stuck with a Null-Magic Mantle in your inventory when you'd rather have a Negatron Cloak, which makes it an even poorer reactive pick against magic damage dealers. Here's the recipe I'd give it:\n\n#Wit's End\n\n* Recipe: Negatron Cloak + Recurve Bow + Kircheis Shard + 1030g (3500g total)\n* Stats:\n * +50 magic resistance\n * +50% attack speed\n * +50 magic damage on-hit\n* New unique passive - Energized Strike: Moving and using basic attacks Energize you. When fully Energized, your next basic attack deals 50 - 150 bonus on-hit magic damage, based on level, and reduces the target's magic resistance by 25 - 50, based on level, for 5 seconds. The magic resistance shred applies before the on-hit magic damage.\n\nSo basically an item that lets on-hit magic damage dealers initiate and give themselves and their team a window to go nuts on them, which they can then recharge by attacking and moving. The numbers are almost certainly off (the shred duration should probably be a lot lower, more like 2.5-3 seconds), and with the above recipe you could very well just remove the Negatron Cloak entirely and make it a purely offensive MR shred + magic on-hit damage item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-05-11T04:01:23.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"on hit builds do no damage compared to crit unless you have a 2.5+ as kayle or kog maw that do spalsh damage. wits end is one of those reasons. why get 40 magic on hit when you can get crit and as items that double your damage output and stack additevely.\n\nto make wits end a good item. increase the on hit to like 60 on hit. and give it a better build path. also give on hit builds. some sort of crit. not crit. but something. i dont like the phantom hit concept but something like that. \n\n\nalso i'd like if it stole MR by percentage. like black cleaver. but more because MR is less on most champions. 8% per hit stacking up to 5 times for 40%.","replies":[{"poster":"KillerKell","date":"2016-05-11T07:11:25.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Percent is horrible, as it helps you not at all vs. a Marksman and many Melee AD.\n\nPeople only build MR if basically forced to... so a % MR Steal would only be good vs. the Tank that did balance out with MR instead of just soaking up the burst with more HP.\n\nThat's why it's Flat.  Which is a good thing, because 25 MR is a nice chunk... and taking that off some one (say, a 25 MR ADC... well, that's not True Damage) really matters.  Watch some times some one with 150 MR, then watch with only 125... it's still a lot, but you'd much rather hit the 125.

I'm also down with a small, say 100 HP Magic Shield further protecting you from said Mages.\n\nSo BAM, hit 5 Stacks and you have your same old +25/-25, but now 100 True Damage and 100 Magic Damage over 5 Seconds (must reset to 0 Stacks to proc again, can't be used on Same Champion in X Seconds kind of thing, so no abusing)... and a small 100 HP Magic Shield to help sustain the Anti-Mage Fight.\n\nI think that isn't to strong, 200 Damage of which 100 can be mitigated by some form of MR (or cleansed on the DOT part) and a very small Shield vs. Magic Damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FourVsFive","date":"2016-05-11T04:18:04.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"if they buffed it to 50magic dmg per hit i would use it.","replies":[{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2016-05-11T06:02:11.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would not be WIT'S END then.","replies":[{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2016-05-11T06:06:16.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"since it is 40, 40 and 40 is it really wit's end now?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hullabaloo907","date":"2016-05-11T09:22:04.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"They should just get rid of the Mr and make it a purely offensive item.
