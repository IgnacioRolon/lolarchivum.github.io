After Placements, you won&#039;t be the same rank  you ended S5 / S6 Preseason as.\n> 2. If you deserve to be a higher rank, then eventually you will get there.\n> \n> For those who don't understand why there are MMR resets and why Placements are how they are take into consideration the following.\n> \n> The game is constantly changing, Players can be a Bronze material player one patch and a Gold Player in another patch. Don't expect to be the same rank every season just because you ended S5 as X rank. The game is always changing that means the player must adapt to these changes. Some players adapt to change better than others, that is why they are ranked higher.  The point of the MMR Reset is to display how a player has adapted to these changes, which means the rank you're placed at isn't so significant. 10 Game is statistically not a large enough sample size to draw any conclusions, so stop worrying about your Rank and continue playing more games. \n> \n> Not even a week into Season 6 so stop complaining.\n> \n> For more information on Placement Rankings\n> http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/E9nkYATc-psa-regarding-ranked-placement-and-seedings-for-all-who-are-confused","replies":[{"poster":"Johnnynogood13","date":"2016-01-24T20:31:48.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just saying i had 0 wins in placement season 5 got placed bronze 2 and i was silv 5 prev this time im silv 2 in season 5 get placed bronze 2 after winning 9/10 placements in a row the way they set this up is fucked i have a friend who was bronze won 2 games got  placed silver 3 tell me how that works and this guys mmr is quite low how does he go up and i go down","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TWGdabeast","date":"2016-01-24T20:29:10.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.
