A skater's worst nightmare.\nR - Replaced with a long wall that she grinds. there are rails also on the wall that she will hop onto after doing a quick trick.\n\nPassive - She hops on a board instead of the rock. When she is idle she will perform manuals.\n\nEdit: Taliyah would probably be a little more rebellious in this skin. I like to think of it like what if she became a professional skateboarder instead of participating in the league. She would probably have special interactions with champions she thinks are lame.\n\nanother edit:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C41qdzR0WYo","replies":[{"poster":"Claymore Saint","date":"2016-09-28T06:26:35.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it.
