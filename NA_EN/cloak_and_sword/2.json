If possible focus on helping to eliminate squishier threats and keep evasive maneuvers ready.. etcetc\" Its easier to just say don't focus the tank but this isn't really good general advice for people who actually want to get better at the adc specifically or anyone who isn't an assassin really. \n\n\"hurrdurr don't focus the tank blitz!\"\n\"but he was riding ashe like a pony!\"","replies":[{"poster":"ThePikol","date":"2016-09-16T12:14:10.831+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give that man a {{item:2054}} for writing all that so noone else had to","replies":[{"poster":"Amasa Delano","date":"2016-09-16T20:13:30.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:2054}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cloak and Sword","date":"2016-09-16T12:09:46.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a bunch.

He has a short range AA, and no escape/gap closer/movement ability. He is a better mid laner. But your job as an ADC isnt to target the squishies....its to target whatever the hell is closest and easiest to hit. If you can get to the squishies without putting yourself in danger, then fine, but its the assassins/fighters job to go for the squishies. Varus lacks the ability to dash in and get that last AA or 2 on the enemy for the kill....which is one of the reasons why hes a lackluster ADC. His job is more of a burst ADC than a sustained dmg ADC. You need to also stay with your tanks/support. Their job is to protect you as best they can, so you can pump out damage. They dont always do this well in lower elo's so you kinda half to do it yourself by staying near them.

That's an assassin's job. Your job is to be the primary damage of your team. As an AD carry Marksman you should ALWAYS be with your team come mid to late game, ready to provide damage when they engage the enemy in a team fight. Do not start fights by yourself and do not engage first.\n\nLet me give you an example of how you're supposed to be thinking. If you're on a team with Gnar, Katerina, Warwick and Thresh and you're Ashe. When the lane phase is over and everybody starts rotating, you should always be looking to stick close to either a beefy team mate or one with some kind of root, stun or a potent slow. This is because an AD carry like Ashe needs peel. So if your team is split up, NEVER over extend without being in the company of either Gnar, Thresh or Warwick. Don't stick close to Kat unless she's super fed or something. She has no CC to peel someone off you if you're ambushed from a bush or something. This simple thing can net you a whole lot of easy kills. \n\nAnother thing, when you're all grouped up. You should position yourself in the back line and poke whenever you can but DO NOT BE THE FIRST TO COMMIT to a team fight. Wait for Gnar to engage when he gets big, or Warwick to ult someone or Thresh to land a hook on someone. When any of these things happen, your team will dive in. And while your team is busy soaking up all their damage and CC, you'll be safely and easily doing a lot of damage from behind because the enemy team just spent their spells and damage fighting off your team's engage. This is how you play the AD carry role as a Marksman correctly.","replies":[{"poster":"Cloak and Sword","date":"2016-09-16T12:23:19.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh sweet.
