A user support member should be trying to help players to the best of their abilities, not lazily copy and pasting the same thing over and over for each reply ticket. I mean, nobody here even took into account the possibility of them being wrong. This user would have been wrongfully punished and had to deal with it if he didn't provide all of this proof... I seriously think you should take this up with someone who can reevaluate how support members work. This isn't the first time users have been wrongfully banned and just fed copied and pasted replies. I have a friend who I know in real life that stopped playing the game because she was banned for using scripts when she didn't. I myself have also had many situations with your support team where they would copy and paste replies to me and their pasted reply not be relevant to what I was saying at all... \n\nThey shouldn't get paid to just copy and paste.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dfenestrator","date":"2015-03-20T21:42:56.618+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WookieeCookie,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=RE7XxFM8,comment-id=008a,timestamp=2015-03-20T19:56:36.902+0000)\n>\n> One of these methods was like the video you linked, where you could spam the \"h\" button and jitter Sion's Ult.

It also problematic because there are (and will always be) questions among the players (especially the new ones) as to what is an \"intended feature or interaction\" and what is not. \n\nFor example, how is a player supposed to know that certain animation cancels are intended while something like this is not? Both of them appear equally intuitive, so we can't just rely on player intuition for the solution. We could try to rely on the information that Reds give, but what if a Red doesn't comment on a particular interaction? Should your players just assume that all interactions are unintended unless you say otherwise?\n\nWhile my suggestion is far from perfect, I feel that it will have the least permanent collateral damage on your players. I also feel that it properly puts the ultimate risk of each game patch on RIOT and not the players. RIOT is the one who issues these patches and changes to the game. RIOT also has the tools to directly deal with the problems that arise from those patches. The players, on the other hand, have very limited options: they can either attempt to avoid those interactions (which, depending on the interaction, may or may not be possible) or not play the game until the interaction is fixed.\n\nI don't necessarily think that this policy is going to ruin League of Legends, but I do feel it will lead to more unfortunate situations like this one, and I, personally, don't ever want to have to deal with it.","replies":[{"poster":"WookieeCookie","date":"2015-03-21T00:52:25.404+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":10,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dfenestrator,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=RE7XxFM8,comment-id=008a000e,timestamp=2015-03-20T21:42:56.618+0000)\n>\n> While I'm glad that the ban was lifted for this particular player, I strongly disagree with your policy. \n> \n> I feel that if a bug or interaction is accidentally added to the game, and a player can reproduce it with **just **the vanilla client, you should not permanently ban any player who uses that interaction.\n> \n> The standard you posted is too subjective and discourages people from experimenting with your game.

You bring up some great points and I did want to say that my goal isn't to stifle creativity or people exploring new mechanics.\n\nBut players should also exercise good judgement when they discover something and think about the impact on the game.  You mention things like animation cancelling which has been a component of the game and not something that falls under this category.\n\nWhen I talk about bugs or unintended side effects in this category I'm specifically talking about specific game breaking issues.  For example, the Zz'Rot's portal which was disconnecting players.  The Mastery issue that gave people insta-Flash or insta gib abilities at level 1,  the Tamat DC issue, or the max stacks on Sword of the Occult/Mejais.  These are specific game breaking issues which give an unfair advantage to players that use them.\n\nIn addition, they required A LOT of extra work and arbitrary steps to pull off.  Players may accidentally run into it as a bug, and that's fine they're safe.  But we're more interested in finding the people who decide to use it to their advantage in games consistently and with intent to harm our community.\n\nIf we do find players in that category of abuse then they will likely be banned.  For those past examples I listed we did permanently ban players that were abusing it.  \n\nBut context is important in each case.  And as I mentioned this particular jitter bug Sion issue is not one of those cases and this ban shouldn't have happened.\n\nThe nature of software development means that things will go wrong even if we do our best to QA and review a product before it is released.  Our promise to all of you is that we will do our best to prevent these bugs in the first place, but if released we will do our best to actively find and fix them as quickly as is possible.\n\nBut the commitment that we expect from you guys, as our players; is that if you encounter these issues you report them to us or at the least do not abuse them to your own advantage and to the detriment of others.","replies":[{"poster":"TornVenom","date":"2015-03-21T02:31:38.314+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"Here's what made me mad as a customer in this situation :\n\"We've already explained the context for your suspension.

There's a bunch of ways to combine or animation-cancel skills that aren't part of 'normal' behavior that are simply considered 'good mechanics'. I'm pretty much unable to play Riven for example because she's balanced around the assumption that people will be doing some weird thing that animation cancels between Q's that I'm not really clear on how to actually do. Instead of calling that trick an 'exploit' and banning players using it, they nerfed Riven on the assumption that all Riven players would use it and forever after she's 'balanced' around that assumption (ie, powerful in the hands of people who can use this 'not-exploit' and worthless in everyone else's hands).\nAlistar's charge-knockup combo on simultaneous keypress was an unintended mechanic, but that didn't make it an exploit. Annie can shield herself -after- she fires her Q to make it an unannounced stun as long as she does it before the Q lands - I don't know if that was intended or not, but it does seem clear Annie is supposed to have a warning sign up when her stun is available and that -does- bypass it. (Not sure the 1/100'th of a second between shielding and Q'ing would matter to the opponent if you fired the skills in opposite order, but still, the way the trick works makes it -no- chance to react to the stun coming up.)\n\nMaybe there's something more here that wasn't mentioned (some actual hack, for example), but it doesn't make sense at all to ban someone for using a mechanics trick without at least a warning that the trick is considered a bug and not a valid mechanic. Nerf Sion and leave the mechanic, or remove the mechanic and leave Sion alone, but why on earth would you go after players who had discovered a mechanic? That can only make people afraid to experiment with the range of the game.\n\nIf there is something more to it, Riot should explain clearly to us why this is an exploit and not a mechanic and how we would know the difference if we found an unusual way to use a champion in the future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Archenz","date":"2015-03-20T13:02:21.576+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":3,"body":"Riot is so full of shit.\n\nLook at the last response from Riot, Templar Iytsuna, acting all high and mighty saying *\"We have already explained the context for your suspension.
