Whatever GUI you have set up for editing my event (where you input \"Event Type,\" \"Organizer,\" \"Basic Info,\" etc.) is not cooperating with me. The first time I opened it for my event I was able to fill out the \"Event Type\" tab, press \"Continue,\" and fill out the \"Organizer\" tab. But then I tried to press \"Continue\" again (with all information filled in) and the page switched to the little loading icon with the curved lines and dots spinning around the Riot fist icon, and it won't switch pages for me. That was a couple of days ago. Today I tried again, and it finally let me access the \"Basic Info\" tab. So I filled out \"Basic Info,\" pressed \"Continue,\" and now I'm having the same loading error. It just spins forever. I tried refreshing the page, filling out \"Basic Info\" again, and pushing \"Continue,\" but it just won't work. I've tried from multiple computers and from multiple wifi routers, so I know it isn't on my end. For some reason, it just won't let me create an event. Any suggestions on what I could try?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nlukenamop","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-17T22:25:42.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was able to test this page and it seems to be working properly.
