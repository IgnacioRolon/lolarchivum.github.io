Let's start with the regions above the great barrier (yes I know some of these might not be in the new lore):\n\nBubbling bog:\nNot much info on this place if it even exists in the new lore. It's a bog so without civilization it would be hard to produce alcohol in the first place. Maybe some animal or fauna does it, which can then be hunted?\n\nDemacia:\nCivilization with strict ruleset and little interest in foreign nations probably means they don't get a lot of ingredients from the outside. They could brew anything but the slightly southern european notions from champions such as firoa suggest wine. I could however easily imagining them banning alcohol altogether due to their strict moral code. (I think i remember garen drinking wine in one of the journals but i can't find it now)\n\nFreljord:\nObvious answer would be mead thinking of vikings which olaf represent. However that would requite bees for honey and since freljord is eternally cold (at least from my memory) it is unlikely unless they import it. Gragas also suggest that they are drinking beer in large quantities (at least him). A bit more unlikely is that they could be drinking vodka to keep the cold away. I say unlikely as it does not fit as well with the fantasies of the champions from freljord.\n\nHowling marsh:\nIf you live amongst undead your alcohol of choice gotta be pretty metal, just saying. Most likely not many people living there permanently although a lot of champions has traveled through the place. Prefered drink is probably the drink popular with the merchants or armies travelling through.\n\nIronspike mountains:\nAnother pass through area but a bit closer to come interesting locations. People living here probably drink a mix of whta they get from freljord, zaun and piltover.\n\nKaladoun:\nNo info... no seriously this place is only on the map... there is no info of anything from it. Depending on how you read the old map feljord could be part of it but I don't think so. Some people think that the wodland skins from ashe and other champions are from there and the name is similar to Caladonia, which is what romans called scotland. If no one on the lore team has anything I now rule that they drink whiskey here.\n\nKalamanda:\nDue to its location they probably drink whatever trade brings them. Since the trade goes from shurima one would imagine either beer and wine as the egyptions or even palm wine as the subsaharan countries are the most common but it could be anything.\n\nMarshes of kaladoun:\nThis is marsh land so I doubt they would drink anything that can be infected. Probably high alcohol drinks such as vodka or absinth. Could also be some low quaility grog where germs are in fact just spice and long lives are a myth.\n\nNoxus:\nA city of intrigue and backstabbing. I would personally say wine fits such a setting best but they could be drinking anything and it would be accepted. Leblanc and swain both suggest a more refined alcohol too. I could so easily imaging seeing katarina drink wine based on animal blood though, just saying.\n\nPiltover:\nWhatever they drink it has to be highly sofisticated. I would be sad if it is not brewed by some king of large hextech machine, too complex to understand unless you spend your lifetime building it. That said I would probably say they drink aged alcohol such as wine or whiskey, with a large preference for the kind that has to age for at least a decade.\n\nMount Targon:\nIt is mentioned in leona's lore that there are farmers around mount targon so ingredient should be in high stock. That said the religous people of mount targon probably follow suit with most real world religions and brew some kind of wine in their monestaries.\n\nZaun:\nThis one is interesting; They would probably mostly be homebrews. Mixing all kinds of things into beer, mead, vodka and so on. There are probably some more complicated alcohols but I would think it is mostly just s simple base alcohol with complicated stuff like different poisons and antidotes mixed into them. Probably highly unique but drink at your own risk. I mean... think of the beer mundo would brew.\n\nEDIT: Like this post if you want more","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-07-18T16:23:56.952+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LongHair Fox,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=xgepYEy9,comment-id=00010003,timestamp=2016-07-18T15:30:31.834+0000)\n>\n> Long post warning so scroll down to your favorite nation.

Rum always seemed too cliche for me, but I bet it's a popular choice.","replies":[{"poster":"LongHair Fox","date":"2016-07-18T19:08:48.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your feedback Bioluminescence. Not sure why I assumed op meant alcoholic drinks but there you have the reason i focused on them. Also giong into non alcoholic drinks really just goes down to flavour and is a lot less interesting (to me at least). I have always liked making a world stick together and have some realism over it rather than just adding more flavour.\nFor example some people would argue that jungle tribes should have high percentage alcohol for flavour, while in reality having the refinery to do anything higher than about vodka would take away from the flavour.\n\nSorry for rambling. The next area will probably be south valoran and then the islands off of valoran.
