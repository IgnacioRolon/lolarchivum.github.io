After which I updated everything and got the league client back on and installed to find that it gives me an error saying that it's unable to login asking me to go to the support portion of league. After I did I used the hextech tool and after installing it then, reinstalling it, the tool would continuously crash at the log gathering portion. I'm able to log on here but not on the support site or on the client. I've gone through the connectivity guide and the login guide, and I've also uninstalled and reinstalled the client. So any ideas on how to fix this? Thank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-17T22:18:38.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After doing that factory reset, I wonder if your network settings might not be set up in the best way for League to make its connections reliably. I know you've already mentioned going through it, but take another look over the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) paying close attention to port forwarding and how to configure your DNS. Let me know if those steps still aren't helping.","replies":[{"poster":"CrusadersFault","date":"2017-08-20T06:01:09.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Broporo, \nSo I went through the guide again top to bottom and am still unable to login to either the client or the support site.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-21T00:42:07.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries, that helps us identify some parts of the equation that aren't the problem areas at the least. It looks like a good number of players are having these login issues currently, so you might be getting affected by this as well. Reach out to our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with a trace route using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and they should be able to provide a little more context.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
