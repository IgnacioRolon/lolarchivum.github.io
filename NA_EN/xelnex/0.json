Leveling up gave me a lot of those so i didnt mind. But now after level 30 i am not getting any essence, even after first win of the day. The only way i can gain blue essence is destroying my champ shards.  I know we wont get essence after every game but i want my first win of the day money. \r\n\r\nAt this rate my IP would forever be at 59 and i wont be able to buy any champions or even play league properly :/","replies":[{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2017-12-03T04:25:06.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gaining IP/BE was changed in the preseason / Season 8. To gain BE, you have to level up and received Champion Capsules. These Champion Capsules provide you with Champion shards which you can disenchant for BE. The amount of BE in the capsules is averaging at around 1000 BE.","replies":[{"poster":"Xelnex","date":"2017-12-03T07:23:20.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SteveTheMiner,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=U3TgfN5k,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-12-03T04:25:06.478+0000)\n>\n> Gaining IP/BE was changed in the preseason / Season 8.

It seems like that was the last match you played on this account, and it doesn't seem like you've logged in with this account since then. If you've been logging in and playing games on this account, there's a liiiiittle bit of a bigger problem going on here tbh xD! \n\nLet me know if you're playing game on this account and not seeing any missions pop up, or if you were talking about a different account altogether!","replies":[{"poster":"Xelnex","date":"2017-12-09T05:17:50.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello thanks for checking, I was referring to a different account and the issue is solved now.
