A recent Windows 10 update auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has been causing freezing and fps issues.

Not that I saw a difference, but I just hate when windows changes my configs.\n\nWhat I did:\n1/ Search for 'xbox' in ur windows-start bar. A xbox app green icon should be shown. Launch it.\n2/ Log in with your windows infos, create an account if you don't have one.\n3/ Once you're in it, open the \"hamburger\" menu on the left. \n4/ Settings\n5/ Clic on the \"DVR Games\" tab \n6/ Turn the recording thing OFF.\n\nIt helped me, hope it will help you too.\n\nPeople on cs, wow, dark souls and all got the problem.","replies":[]}]}
