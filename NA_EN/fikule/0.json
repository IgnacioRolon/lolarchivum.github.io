I get this multiple times per game. So far my best guess is the game is loading in an asset that wasn&#039;t pre-loaded and is having to stop while it does so. My FPS goes down, but that&#039;s just due to the temporary freeze affecting the average, not an actual indication of FPS.\r\n\r\nEither way can anyone help with this? It gets very annoying when it happens during combat.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-04T16:59:27.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen reports of freezing and fps issues after a recent Windows 10 update, which seems to be the OS you're using.  Specifically, the update auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has been causing issues.  Disabling that may fix this up.  Additionally, are you using any programs like play.tv, overlays, or recorder?  These apps can similarly cause freezing.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Fikule","date":"2016-11-04T17:10:38.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, Thanks for the response. I have had this issue for a few years now (While using Windows 7).\n\nI do have Shadowplay enabled, but that is the only thing I'm aware of. On top of that, I only enabled shadowplay specifically to record this issue.\n\nI checked out the Xbox game bar, but loading up the app it tells me I need to sign in, and I don't own an Xbox account. Would it be enabled if I'm not even signed in (and have never opened the app before today)?\n\nOn a technical note, could you explain why these things may cause sudden, brief freezes? I never notice it in other games is all.\n\nJust to highlight the asset theory, my belief when watching this video was that Unraveled Earth from Taliyah was the asset it needed to load.","replies":[]}]}]}
