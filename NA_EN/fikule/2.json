Which is, again, where I say Taric suffers from the aura problem. He has to be balanced around the assumption that it will be used optimally, which causes it to appear weaker than it actually is.

And keep in mind we're comparing an ultimate to a NON ultimate spell... given the variables, the non ultimate spell is still coming out ahead.\n\nTaric's aura has limited range, Janna's shield has to be intact. Janna's shield can be used more often, Taric's ult has a greater potential impact. They both have restrictions.\n\nBy, \"direct AD benefit,\" I assume you are referring to what she gives to a *single* champion (ignoring self casts). In which case, you are correct. Taric isn't using his ult for the benefit of *one* person though. It's an *aura*; it is used by the *team*. You have to really finagle the scenario in Janna's favor for the *total* AD value to be greater (never mind the AP).\n\n>Yes, lower CD.\nAnd greater potential range.\nAnd greater AD benefit.\n\n**CD:** True. Flat out. Can't argue the CD is lower.\n**Range:** Janna cast range 800, and they can walk away. Taric Aura range 1100. So Yes, I would agree Janna's shield has greater *potential* range.\n**AD Benefit:** Already covered this one.

It's amusing.\n\n------------------------\n\nAll of this is ultimately a moot point though (unless Riot keeps it as-is for some strange reason). Janna's shield is more interactive and interesting by simple virtue of being a shield. The [almost] sole purpose of Taric's ult is to be a bag of stats.

Taric is balanced around being in a 5v5 team fight where his ult can have a huge impact, Janna is not.\n\nExcept once again, you are assuming every character benefits from Taric's aura and is within range.

You will lose every time.\n\n> That value is assuming every single character is in range and makes use of both AP/AD.\n> You're right.

That's nonsense.\n\n> Incidentally, we are assuming Janna's shield doesn't get instantly popped and is on someone who uses AD.\n\nThe nice part about that is; The ADC will generally be in the back and not the primary , or often even secondary, focus .... and if the ADC gets targeted, Janna conveniently has (arguably) the best peel in the game.\n\n> Ok. Lets assume a 20 second teamfight (rather generous) and Janna has 45% CDR.\n> That give Janna's Shield a 5.5 second CD. 3 casts=16.5 seconds.\n\nThat assumes Janna will not have a shield cast on someone as the fight begins.... but sure, let's use your skewed numbers.\n\n> 2390.8x3= *7172.4** gold value.\n> Just for fun, let us [again] give her 300 AP.\n> 4001.5x3 = 12004.5\n> 12004.5-11917.5=87\n> So with 300 AP (also generous) Janna's buff wins by *87* gold; meanwhile Taric doesn't have to build a thing (again, consistency isn't always bad).\n\nThe difference being, you are comparing an ULTIMATE vs. a NON ULTIMATE and even giving extremely generous benefits to Radiance, it still loses.\n\n> The raw damage on Taric's ult has also been ignored in all of this.\n\nThe pop radius has atrocious range.... getting that close will also tend to place him away from his ADC, which is a bad thing.\n\n\n>He has to be balanced around the assumption that it will be used optimally\n\nEven under optimal circumstances, the benefit is so flimsy and insignificant so as to not even exist.\n\n> Taric's aura has limited range, Janna's shield has to be intact.

You would rather have less total output that you are certain will be fully utilized. I agree! But that doesn't make the other approach weaker.\n\n>Taric's self buff is meaningless. His damage is a joke and one of the lowest of any support regardless of his ultimate. Even if his ult gave 200 AD/AP, Taric's damage would still be very low per game.\n\nThere's more to a support than damage. Taric invests a lot of budget into his buffs; damage falls off as a consequence. That doesn't mean he won't AA. The self buff gives him respectable damage (for a support) during fights. But he's not going to output damage equal to champions designed for it for most of the game. If you're looking to do damage as support, you really shouldn't be using Taric.\n\n>Except once again, you are assuming every character benefits from Taric's aura and is within range. That is the classic argument of theory vs. practice. You argue the potential, I will argue reality. You will lose every time.\n\nI'm going to say this again.\n\"Radiance is actually pretty strong when used optimally.\"\nAlso, what characters *don't* benefit from his Aura? Off the top of my head, I can't think of any champion that doesn't use AD *or* AP. There's a handful that only use one. Some champions benefit *more* from his aura than other, definitely.\nAlso, his Aura radius is 1100. The longest AA range is is Cait's headshot at 1300, followed by Twitch's ult at 850. The aura puts him at the edge of Xerath's threat range. So.... who is sitting out of range here? Jhin?\n\n>The nice part about that is; The ADC will generally be in the back and not the primary , or often even secondary, focus .... and if the ADC gets targeted, Janna conveniently has (arguably) the best peel in the game.\n\nYou're right. She does. But now we're comparing kits. I'm already making the basic assumption that *both* abilities are utilized optimally. That has been my entire basis from the start.\n\nAlso, who is your team targeting; The tank? Or are we assuming both teams are using siege comps with Illaoi and Taric playing checkers in the middle?\n\n>That assumes Janna will not have a shield cast on someone as the fight begins.... but sure, let's use your skewed numbers.\n\nIt's assuming she casts the shield the moment the fight begins. I'm skewing this in her favor already and you want to nit-pick the scenario even more?\n\n>The difference being, you are comparing an ULTIMATE vs. a NON ULTIMATE and even giving extremely generous benefits to Radiance, it still loses.\n\nUm..... and I'm not giving extremely generous benefits to Eye of the storm?\n3 casts.\n300 AP.\nAnd it comes out ahead by 87 gold.\n\nI'm sorry. How much AP does Janna normally end with?\n\n>The pop radius has atrocious range.... getting that close will also tend to place him away from his ADC, which is a bad thing.\n\nI agree the pop radius is sad. If he's fighting and the ADC isn't his Aura range though, he probably shouldn't be fighting.\n\n>Even under optimal circumstances, the benefit is so flimsy and insignificant so as to not even exist.\n\nThe whole point is to give a smaller individual benefit to a larger group, rather than a smaller total benefit to an individual. You're trading consistent output for peak potential.\nAs a principle, neither approach is weaker. It's just a question of which you would prefer. As stated above, I also prefer consistency; but that doesn't make consistency better.\n\n>Incorrect.\n\n>Janna's shield gives greater benefit to the target that needs it the most therefore Janna's shield comes out ahead in both quick skirmishes and extended teamfights.\n\nTaric gives a bigger benefit to the *team*. Janna gives a bigger benefit to an *individual*. If you're doing quick skirmishes, Janna comes ahead because of the low CD. In a full on team fight, Taric provides more raw stats.\n\n>Except , yet again, Janna is giving the damage benefit (AD) to the person that will make the best use of it (ADC or AD scaling champ like Talon/Zed) whereas Taric is wasting a large chunk of his aura on characters that will not benefit from his aura in any meaningful way.\n\nHmm..... Again. What champion doesn't use AD or AP? If they benefit from the buff in a fight, the buff is meaningful.\nDo you instead mean in an \"overtly significant\" way? Of course, Riven isn't going to use the AP, but the AD is still valuable. Or perhaps you want the power shifted into a single stat. Say, each ally gets 50 AD, but no AP. Of course, that means the aura is wasted on Karthus would would rather have the AP.\nJust because champion A gets more use out of a buff than champion B, that doesn't mean champion B wasn't effectively buffed *unless* they genuinely can't use the buff.\n\n>Except because Eye of the Storm is targeted, it will overwhelmingly be used on the correct target, under optimal scenario.... whereas Radiance is highly dependent and even stacking the numbers heavily, it still flounders against a non ultimate skill.\n\nRadiance is a *team* oriented skill. It excels in the presence of a *team*. It's not floundering, it's restricted. Janna's shield isn't team oriented, it benefits a single person. Eye of the storm will only ever effect 1 person and is balanced as such. Radiance has to be balanced around the potential of affecting 5 people, and therefore can't be balanced assuming only 1 beneficiary.\n\n>Basically, to finish this;\nThere's a reason we're not seeing a swath of Taric players in LCS or Worlds.\nAnd no, it has nothing to do with how he \"Feels\", it has to do with him being putrid scoriae.\nNote however, that Janna has seen high level play over multiple seasons' tournaments.\nDo you understand?\n\n\"Feels\"? (o_O)\n\nAS for high level and organized play. Ultimately, Taric's niche is being a ball of stats for the team. That niche isn't particularly valuable in an organized environment. He can't lock-down, his damage output is overall sub-par, doesn't harass well, and his healing is outclassed by other supports. When you compare raw stats (his biggest asset) to the play-making potential of a Tahm ult, the hard lock-down and burst of a Leona dive, or the versatility of Thresh; Taric simply doesn't stack up. This doesn't make him *bad*, it just makes others more valuable. Though admittedly, that's a very fine line in a competitive environment.\n\nConversely, Janna is the \"queen of peel\" for a reason. She's not picked because of the AD buff on her shield, she's picked because she can peel almost anything not named Olaf.\n\n>I don't need to stack-the-deck against Radiance...\n\nAnd yet you do just that, by assuming he will always buff people that can't use it and that he will never use it himself; meanwhile claiming Janna's shield won't pop and always be used off CD.\n\n[Found the character limit!]\n12345678911","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"43161549_DEL","date":"2016-02-09T17:53:54.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk man that extra damage in an aura it gives is amazing. you just underestimate it XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gusicles","date":"2016-02-09T15:49:22.353+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently, Radiance is an OK ultimate, but not worst by any means.\n\nIt's best used as burst damage for a single target.
