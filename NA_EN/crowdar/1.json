Due to my habbit of not looking LP gains/losses in the postgame-lobby, i was curious how my standing was. But looking up my profile shows me, that i'm in my placement games... My League-Header only shows me the infos about all possible ranks i could place in and that i have to paly ranked for this.\r\n\r\nIf i look up the profile of a friend, i dont see anything. According to this, my B5-Duomate is Silver V, 0 LP without knowing (hooray).\r\n\r\nSo... is ranked-season over now or is it just a bug?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-03T22:25:01.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you referring to your profile inside the client?  This may be a visual issue with the client, if you are seeing incorrect ranks for yourself and friends.
