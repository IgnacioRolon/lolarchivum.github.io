According to Riot's \"!\"-Message the Loot-Tab and it's Functions are working as intended. BUUUUT: I can't use any Event-Items. I cant use my 80 Worlds Tokens nor my Starguardian Tokens. Neither will the Key-Fragment-Combiner pop up. It seems i can only use Skin-/Champion-Shards and Mastery 6/7 Items to upgrade (basically everything that doesnt require a Pop-Up on the right side of the Loot-Tab :)\n\nNow i can't see what Things are hidden in my Wolrds- Token :( Rito, PLS!\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}\n\nEdit: checked on my other Account for testing and it did'nt work as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-11T15:26:46.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is an issue where hextech loot is giving an unintended error.
