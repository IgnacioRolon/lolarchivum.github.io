Seriously, if you're going to go aggressive don't shove the wave into the turret and stop going ham when you're behind.\n\nAs a support I was harassed by a taliyah bot (yes taliyah bot is not a typo), she kept telling me to play aggressively as a nami to get my trinket gold but kept telling her I needed my mana to heal her and she was getting poked a lot.
