But overall love the changes, I have woad Ashe and never played her because she couldn&#039;t do enough and her passive was useless, and now I think I&#039;ll be maining Ashe for ADC.","replies":[{"poster":"Sirsir","date":"2015-04-28T19:09:45.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on how her Crit>Magic passive scales really. The Q changes look neat, changing her slow to no longer require mana is a bold move...

But her overall \"power\" should balance out.\n\nOtherwise, I really like this direction. Replacing her ability to Crit is an interesting and unique idea, I really like it. Her new passive seems absolutely amazing, especially with her new Q, both passive and active. She seems slightly more interactive, and honestly, fun.\n\nOn top of all that, her playstyle seems generally the same. She'll still have a super-low skill floor, and maintain her ease of \"teamfight time? press Q\" routine. (Yes, Ashe is more in-depth than that.) So both Ashe veterans and new players should enjoy this.\n\nRemoving the E passive gold is no surprise to me, since she has added power elsewhere.\n\nAlso, double (triple with charges) globals","replies":[]},{"poster":"IllusoryLumines","date":"2015-04-28T19:27:55.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im more concerned than anything about her passive's new mechanic of \"crits are disabled but you do more damage\"\n\nWill they add this change to every ADC and phase out crit eventually?

Sad to see her passive gold go (I suck at last hitting so it helped a bit), but Ashe now actually has a perma slow, and her new Q looks freaking sweet (although it would be cool if they had added the frozen effect like Sej's ult to ECA, but I guess that's still possible for them to add while she's on the PBE)","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-04-28T19:23:40.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm super excited to try this out.
