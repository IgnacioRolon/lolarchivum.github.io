Therefore, this list will be comprising of this third season and conceptual future ones. Without further ado, let us begin._\nSeason Three:\n Xayah(Legendary)\nRakan(Legendary)\nNeeko(Epic)\nBard(Epic)\n_These choices were made because I think, being the villain, Zoe should've gotten the legendary that we may find out more about her lore through dialogue interactions. With Bard being the villain(and herald for future villains), this wouldn't be a problem since he only makes chime noises._\nSeason 4(April Fools):\nUrgot(Legendary)\nKog'Maw(Epic)\nFiddlesticks(Epic)\nRek'Sai(Epic)\n_These could appear in a dream so they wouldn't need to be canonical, technically speaking, while still giving the playerbase what they ~~want~~ need(With, perhaps, the exception of Kog'Maw, who could possibly function as the Star Guardian team's pet)._\nSeason 5(Finale):\nZoe(Ultimate)\nAurelion Sol(Legendary)\nVi(Epic)\nQuinn(Epic)\nSona(Epic)\n_What with this being the grand finale, I see no problem in having both an Ultimate and a Legendary skin in the lineup. Zoe, of course, would be the ultimate(ha, ha) antagonist, with Aurelion Sol by her side. These skins' arrival would be accompanied by a PVE event, or, if Riot wouldn't even do that for the SG Finale, at least a new gamemode. In conclusion, Riot, if you're watching, please take these ideas into consideration. I do realize that the April Fools one is the only idea you could really fully take, but even that would be simply amazing. Thank you all for coming to my TED talk._\n\n-Gravesoul","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmic Star","date":"2019-09-09T12:41:48.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure how the design would go for Aurelion Sol as a star guardian or Ultimate skin Zoe because normally Ultimate skins have different forms that change through the game.

What I was thinking was she could start out looking like a regular Star Guardian and then gradually change into a darker version as she does in her recall animation, her skin evolving slightly each time she blinks or teleports._","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmic Star","date":"2019-09-10T16:17:21.746+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ohhh a cool new transformation system!

He's not only a being as old as the universe already, but he created all the stars in the cosmos. Who's to say he can't create Star Guardians to protect them?","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-09-07T13:01:27.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely understand the base of your idea for First Star Aurelion Sol.\n\nIt's just....
