We even have a new game mode called **Singularity** that will come with a new backstory about the end of the universe.\n\nI read your earlier comment that your team did contemplate about potentially linking the Cosmics with Dark Stars while developing the Cosmics. I want to hear what you think of an in-universe plot device that we may use to establish a crossover between these universes in the future. For example, possible story hooks could include backdrops that Dark Stars have destroyed their own universe during events such as **Singularity**, and these world-hoppers are constantly in search of other universes to consume in an eternal voyage. Cosmics or Star Guardians in their own worlds would fight to drive them back. \n\nThis may become a pretty strong (and convenient) in-universe argument to establish the relationship between these cosmic groups. Questions such as how they met each other, why they are enemies or even allies, etc. **Singularity** talks about the end of a universe, while **First Star** talks about the birth of a universe and guardians born to defend it. These are (at least at first glance) diametrically opposed themes or ideologies that can mesh together to produce a shared storyline under the same setting. Cosmics, meanwhile, may have more diverse agenda and personalities distinct to each member that could give them other goals. Do you think this idea could have some merit?","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-04-22T01:54:49.215+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the idea has plenty of merit and thanks for taking the time to write it out! We aren't 100% certain how Star Guardian and Super Galaxy are perceived overall, but I think of them as anime-inspired lines in a way that sets them tonally apart from Cosmic/Darkstar/Dreadnova (although I love the crossover fanart). I joked to Thermal Kitten that to me Super Galaxy seems like the anime that Lux and crew watch after school, while paradoxically I feel like SG Rumble would stay up late watching marathons of Star Guardian series in his universe... anything is possible when you get inter-dimensional.

Wubalubadubdub!\n\nThank you for your thoughts and response. Yes, it was also my initial thought that the Cosmics and Dark Stars appear to be most suitable as each others' rivals,  given their tone, background, and scale reminiscent of deities in real life mythology and mythos - a sentient background force of nature, or some great unknown, that are almost beyond human comprehension. Star Guardians and Super Galaxies, on the other hand, have more of a shounen/shoujo anime superhero feel to them, which seem to play on more \"human\" aspects such as a society's search for hero figures, the human relationship between the said heroes, and the power of love/camaraderie that allows a group of people to overcome great hardship together (not to mention they share the same acronyms, haha!).\n\nAnd you are right. The Steel Legion gave off strong vibes of powerful space marines from series such as Starcraft when they came out. : P Discovering, a long time ago, that they were based on then Demcian lore was actually a pleasant surprise. Whatever reimagining you have in store for our favorite space Demacians, I am sure it will not diminish the appeal they already have either.\n\nThank you for leaving comment here again, I appreciate it a lot. I look forward to hearing more from you about the mysteries behind our cosmic heralds in the future.

Piltover joined Demacia to produce the Steel Legions, while Zaun joined Noxus to oppose that Piltovan alliance. That is why Bioforge Darius was given a chemical apparatus for augmentation similar to Singed/Warwick's.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-04-22T01:49:40.127+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do feel fairly space-mariney though.

However, similar to Commando and Crimson Elite, the skins just didn't find a lot of love amongst players and were sort of left in the past as thematics.\n\nDreadnova was cooked up by skins team in a now fairly rare situation where we were given a short list of champs and the opportunity to create any skin we wanted for them. The team dreamed up a 'space opera' setting in which the Harlockian space pirate Gangplank lead a crew of scurvy (he doesn't share his oranges) aliens on the good ship Dreadnova in search of intergalactic plunder and adventure.\n\nEnter Riot DrPh8, a kickass new concept artist joining skins from the world of comic book awesomery. Riot isn't big on telling people what they can and can't do and grant individual contributors a heap of agency, so when he took elements of Steel Legion (which he imagined as being much more space opera futuristic) and combined it with some of Dreadnova Gangplank to make the new Darius skin and began to tell a story of a much bigger galaxy we looked at it and said 'Yeah, this is way cooler' and I think for skins that is always what matters most.","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2017-04-27T13:28:11.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Off Topic question.\nAre you going to address the feedback to Sejuani's skins on this update?\nCurrently they frankly look like ass, and that's not just my opinion either. \n\nThe cosmetic department is seriously looking lazy and effortless right now in regards to this. \n\nHave you just ignored the feedback or are you going to address it? \n\nBecause frankly I've been saying all year that Season 7 skins have lacked any serious inspiration (Save for Festival Anivia) and so far that opinion is holding up pretty well. \n\nDragon Lady? _Real Creative. _\nArmor guy? _REALLY Creative_\nSci-fi Armor guy?
