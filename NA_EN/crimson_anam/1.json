Honestly if you'd have thoughts I don't know the answer. It might sound good because you're matching things together but I feel like there'd be so much overlap with the base thematic it wouldn't feel as impactful and unique. Kind of like doing a fire skin for Brand or an Elderwood skin for Maokai - it's something of a redundancy or just not as dramatic a shift as another skin would be.\n\nHowever we have done it in the past, particularly before we started to change vfx and sfx more often than not - Lunar Revel Diana, Kung Fu Lee Sin, Black Frost Anivia etc. But I wonder how well those skins were received in terms of thematic choice.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-11-05T16:51:00.815+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Syndra main, I wouldn't mind a Dark Star skin for her, even though thematics are quite similar.\n\nFrankly despite playing her since 2012, I don't own any of her skins solely, because their theme is so different from her classic in one way or the other.\nOne throws water balloons that don't feel anyhow powerful like the champion, another throws god-damn bells.\n\nI'm sure a lot of people would love \"power-up\" skins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2016-11-05T16:44:57.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I was talking lorewise rather than skin-wise :P\n\nIf you think about skins it might be like a full armored Aurelion Sol.

I think there is enough space to make that one work just on its own.  Definitely not legendary tier though \n\nA Dark Star Veigar (or Syndra) would be more along the lines of a Overlord Malzahar or even Tyrant Swain.  Pushing their already existing theme harder than base, or even adapting to possible new storylines (T.Swain is basically his canon now after becoming Grand General)\nBasically mostly costume and minor effect work most likely....not much space to REALLY push it like you said.  If they were to be done, should stay cheap\n\nOri though I agree would make an awesome dark star...easily possible legendary\n\n\nAs for the idea of pairing skin lines, I think there is indeed a good opportunity to create that impact through possible shared skin alternate-realities.  See the hype created by the PRODUCT line....those skins are both very well done and thanks to stuff like PROJECT: overdrive people really get hyped for the skins.\nskin lines like Program and Mecha are also very well done, but don't have the same appeal that PROJECT does because they don't have the slight story-line push.\n\nStar Guardians I feel are very similar to PROJECT.  they are good skins that really deliver on their promised theme, but also have a nice little story behind them, nothing elaborate, but something.  I think pairing something like the Dark Star line could really help push both skin lines in ways neither could really do alone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Overlord Forte","date":"2016-11-05T22:16:25.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue kind of comes down to 'are we going to differ a thematic repeat enough for it to not be an upgrade?'. Black Frost Anivia, for instance, is where the corruption of the Freljord radically impacts her. So, it's an ice theme, but it's a different version that's not quite an upgrade over the base. Or, in other words, base 'Good' Anivia and then 'Evil' Anivia. Whether or not the extreme personality difference, and the resulting change, qualifies as a significant difference or not is ... up for subjective debate.\n\nOn the logical other end of the spectrum, another fire skin for Brand would be hard pressed to be very 'different'. You could, at most, have him become his original spirit of fire, but that's just an upgrade. There's no difference between imprisoned Brand or released Brand. Were you to do that route, a Gangplank style story evolution would be more suitable than a skin, per say.\n\nDiana, in the middle of these two, is kind of funny. She's the avatar of the moon, but there are many different ways to represent her. Lunar Revel, Blood Moon, etcetra, all serve to portray the same Diana in different views. It's essentially clothes swapping at that point, where the implementation of style and the 'is this worth having a skin for?' become more paramount. You'd have to go a step further in altering Diana's personality to really avoid the clothes swap problem, but it's an uphill struggle.\n\nSome people like costume swaps, some others want total do overs ... market research will show where the main incentive to develop crops up from, really.
