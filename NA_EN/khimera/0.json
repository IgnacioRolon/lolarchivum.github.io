Simply trying to spread the word of possibly the best idea to repair the Season 5 jungle(if simply interested in the cange click the imgur link). This can be found on the League subreddit by chamility*\r\n\r\n\"Look at support items that we got in patch 3.14.\r\nWe got Spellthief's Edge, Ancient Coin and Relic Shield, all 3 of which can be built in greater items (Spellthief's Edge for AP supports, Talisman of Ascension for utility supports and Face of the Mountain for tanky supports).\r\nWhat Riot did is let supports start with the item that is best suited for them for the laning phase (e.g.: As a Leona you probably want to be tanky from the start and, because you have no sustain or a heal for your ADC, you probably want to pick up that Relic Shield)\r\nAnd after that supports didn't have to buy Rejuvenation Bead, a couple of wards and done.\r\nBut what do we see with junglers? Exactly, everyone is put in the same position, be it Warwick or Nautilus. Everyone has to start with Hunter's Machete. I believe that this is the core problem of jungling, the diversity of first item that you can buy.\r\nI believe that junglers should be allowed to choose from different starting items (which will help weaker jungler, a.k.a. tanks).\r\nI don't know if Riot realizes that, but Quill Coat was the best moment tanks have had in jungle in a long time. It gave you enough sustain in jungle and on top of that you had a neat monster damage.\r\nHere's my take at improving the jungle: http://imgur.com/l4a2zz4\r\nThe only problem with it is that it would need a complete jungle item upgrade overhaul.\r\ntl;dr: Rito, delete Machete.\"","replies":[{"poster":"GtGW","date":"2015-02-27T21:14:37.845+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do believe the lack of itemization tailored towards different styles of play is what is curbing this trend of (Flavor of the Month) picks and bans on a consistent basis.\n\nGiven the limitations of slot efficiency and itemization, especially when you consider how large of a dichotomy there is between ranged and melee carries (the former can be either Marksmen or Mages, but the later is almost explicitly that of the AD Assassin caste in terms of competitive play), LoL could real do with more item choice between the different styles within given roles.\n\nDamage can be dispensed through these patterns:\n\n* Burst\n* Damage Over Time\n* Sustained\n\nDurability can be approached by statistical values of the champion in addition to other specific utilities:\n\n* Sustain\n* Damage Reduction\n* Damage Negation\n* Mobility/Evasiveness\n* Stealth\n\nAnd Champions can potentially gain access to different utilities in the form of:\n\n* Buffs\n* Debuffs\n* Crowd Control Effects\n* Terrain Alterations\n* Projectile Interception\n* Non-personal Healing\n* Non-personal Shielding\n\nHowever, there should be a clearer system in place of how certain utilities and their uses are afforded within a Champion's kit.

While I can't comment on everything you've said since I only started playing last year and it's clear to me you have more knowledge of this game than I do atm I would definitely agree that I've noticed this trend towards high mobility champions with incredibly diverse kits (i.e. {{champion:429}} , {{champion:421}} , {{champion:150}} , Bard upcoming) and while I think it's good that these kits are diverse, I believe it hurts a lot of the older champions in the game that weren't really designed the same way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Amachy","date":"2015-02-28T01:31:50.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good thing the paid professionals are coming up with these ideas.

I also think something that's keeping a lot of champs from being good *inside* of the jungle is this baseline thats been set by the top tier junglers (such as {{champion:254}} , {{champion:59}} , {{champion:421}} ). They all have some form of sustain or passive that helps them *in* the jungle while also having strong ganks that help them gank *outside* of the jungle. In addition to that, all of these champions have high base damage to where they can build their warrior enchantment, one damage item, then straight tank and *still* do a ton of damage while offering game-changing cc. When you have something like that which only a dozen (at most) junglers have, it makes it hard to really bring about jungle diversity.","replies":[]}]}]}
