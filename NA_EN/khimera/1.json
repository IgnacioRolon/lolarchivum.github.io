If we did that, everyone would be a Zed. Big numbers, \"flashy\" plays, kill counts out the wazoo because nobody can stop the other Zeds.\n\nCC is essentially a necessary evil.\n\nThat being said, you **can** leave your lane, you **can** push an advantage, and you **can** kill him. He isn't a god (*remember, they retconned that*).\n\nHis lifesteal is good, but its the only reason he can even lane or jungle whatsoever. His wither is good, but its the only reason he's relevant late game, and its honestly not as powerful as a straight up stun (remember, stuns are 100% movement speed reduction, 100% attack speed reduction, and 100% ability lock-out). If you have any mobility, or your team has any of their own CC (hint hint), you can still peel away from him with ease when withered.\n\nHe's relatively balanced right now.

You lose that amount for **one second.** It doesn't remove you from the fight, only the last 2-3~ seconds are really particularly noteworthy-- roughly the same duration as a stun. It does hurt your DPS, but that is its intention. To reduce the damage of an ADC, which melts him late game anyways.

Almost every played champion in the game has mobility to deal with Nasus's wither. For that matter, many champions now have auto-attack resets, also significantly weakening his wither.\n\nAny who do not have that simply aren't played. And for that matter, they dealt with Nasus just fine before the league of mobility, when Nasus was **was stronger than he was now.**\n\nHe needs wither.

And for that matter, they dealt with Nasus just fine before the league of mobility, when Nasus was was stronger than he was now.\"\n> \n> What fucking part of this sentence do you honestly believe is okay?! If a champion doesn't have the tools to deal with a Nasus's 5 second snare then they shouldn't be played. These champions never dealt with Nasus \"just fine.\" They got just as fucked by him then as now. Except now they're being fucked by literally everybody else.\n> \n> Nasus gets 20% Lifesteal and Infinite AD for existing.\n\nIf a champion doesn't have tools to deal with Nasus, ***THEY ARE ALREADY NOT PLAYED IN THE CURRENT GAME, NASUS OR NOT.***\nReading comprehension please.\n\nI'm not going to bother arguing with you because you seem to be convinced that Nasus is the end-all-be-all of OP monstrosities when he's actually pretty balanced at the moment, and any change whatsoever is going to be for the worse. \nEverything has been explained to you in detail, there has been a link to HateDaddy's thread that does an even better job, and yet you're still frothing at the mouth screaming \"BUHBUHBUH FREESTATS WTF OP.

You can't take things out of a relatively balanced champion's kit and not compensate them pretty significantly.\n He'd be pretty terrible unless they decided to replace what he lost with a hard-CC. Every other tank has hard CC, he has a ramping slow (goes from 35% to 95%) and a similarly ramping (17% to 47.5%) attack speed slow. Honestly if you nerfed wither, he'd be useless as a champion. He'd have no way to mitigate damage, and he'd have no way to catch anyone or CC anyone meaningfully.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-03-26T22:47:45.224+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually Nasus is more of a fighter/bruiser then a tank...\nWhile yes even if Nasus is really farmed... if he gets kited in teamfights he pretty much turns into a bad tank with meh tank steroids and no initiation and mediocre CC (only a single target slow.. most other tank have some powerful AoE CC)\nSince Nasus damage is irrelevant if he doesn't get to use it","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"femmé","date":"2015-03-26T22:10:28.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he's not op because you are able to make a nasus cry in a corner for picking nasus.
