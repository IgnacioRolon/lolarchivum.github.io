{"poster":"Steel Lady","date":"2018-07-26T17:10:07.434+0000","title":"The Value of Lore","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":95,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hi guys, I just wanted to share my opinion on the League of Legends lore and what they mean to me, so I hope I don&#039;t bore you. This is just my personal response to questions such as, &quot;**why do we need lore? It doesn&#039;t affect gameplay**&quot; or &quot;**why do people obsess about lore, it&#039;s so dumb**&quot;. \n\nI think that Riot games has to be one of the most dedicated game developers with regards to world building. It&#039;s something that amazes and continues to amaze me, how much work, effort, and thought goes into making Runeterra feel real, and I just feel like everyone else needs to appreciate that as well :)\n\n_Why is lore important? Why do people care so much?_ Lore is important because it helps bring substance and context to the world of League of Legends. It helps make the game feel more cohesive and organized, to know that the little girl with the teddy bear isn&#039;t just there for show, and that she does indeed have a reason to set people on fire. It bridges gaps filled with questions such as &#039;why this&#039; or &#039;why that&#039;. People don&#039;t realize how dumb League of Legends would be if we had an ice bird and a floating tentacled eye in the game without any context, or why a woman with a pigeon is even fighting in the first place.\n\nBut other than making the game make sense (this is going to be a bit personal) League of Legends lore is important to me because for the past year, Runeterra has stopped being something I read about on the League of Legends wikia page. It&#039;s begun to be a place where I can escape to whenever the real world becomes too boring or too much to handle. You have places, factions like Shurima, Bilgewater and Ionia that are so rich in culture and tradition with stories and information written so engrossingly and so eloquently written that they feel like actual places you can go to just by reading short stories, comics and champion biographies. Runeterra isn&#039;t just reading material anymore, it&#039;s an entire universe of colorful culture and rich history, it&#039;s a place of wonder and mystery. It&#039;s a home to ninjas and wizards, tyrants and monarchs, **it&#039;s a home for legends**. \n\nI&#039;ve been playing League of Legends for about a year and a half now, and I&#039;m speaking on behalf of myself that if League didn&#039;t have such rich lore, I&#039;d have quit the game my first 6 months in. Lore makes this game so goddamn immersive, it&#039;s crazy. I know that a lot of players will disagree, but I know for sure that another lot of you know that feeling that maybe you aren&#039;t playing for the win and that maybe it&#039;s something else driving you to put more effort in winning the game. Personally, I main Syndra, and every time I hit level 2 and use Force of Will on one of my Qs, I don&#039;t know man, I just get into this headspace where I feel like an evil Queen of the Dark Arts looking to murder those who tried to restrain me, and every kill just feels so goddamn satisfying. I just get into this zone where I feel as if I, myself, am Syndra. I relive her story, her biography. I just feel the betrayal and the power, and in a second, every click, every press of a Q just begins to feel so immersive.\n\nReading champion biographies is like getting to know the champion you are playing, and once you know the story behind the champion you&#039;re playing, you get a sense of why you&#039;re fighting, why you need to destroy that nexus. Why do you need to win as an Irelia? To win for the First flippin&#039; Lands. Why need a pentakill as Katarina? To prove to her father and to everyone that she is a worthy soldier of Noxus. Heck, why put a bubble on Draven as Zoe? Because for god sakes, it&#039;s fun!\n\nLore makes League of Legends feel like an entirely different landscape than just a 5v5 MOBA. It makes it feel like there&#039;s more to it than creep scores and vision. Again, a LOT of players will whole heartedly disagree and say that maybe League is just designed well and that maybe players love a certain champion because their kits are fun and enjoyable, and they&#039;re right, but there&#039;s more to League of Legends than just gameplay mechanics, there&#039;s a reason why one of the most active sections of the boards, if not the most active section of the boards, is **Story, Art &amp; Sound**. Riot isn&#039;t just selling a game, it&#039;s selling a story.\n\nPlayers love lore, that&#039;s a fact. Lore makes Summoner&#039;s Rift feel bigger than a just a minimap, bigger than a three-lane arena, bigger than some measly game mode. Lore makes champions feel like actual people, people we can relate to, people we can empathize and/or sympathize with. Add to the fact that there&#039;s never an ultimate good or an ultimate evil in the lore, it makes each champion more relatable, easier to connect with, that here&#039;s more to Aatrox than his rage and that there&#039;s more to Varus than unbridled vengeance.\n\n_To summarize my points in a sentence or two:_\n\n**Maybe I&#039;m not picking Syndra just because she&#039;s an S-tier pick this patch or because her winrate&#039;s are skyrocketing since her last buff, maybe I&#039;m picking her so I can feel like a badass, gives-no-fucks, mistreated Ionian Goddess of the forbidden magical arts for once in a while.**\n\n- Again, to Riot and their Narrative teams, you guys have truly constructed a world, a universe, that players are starting to feel at home in. The efforts you&#039;ve made in making Runeterra feel real are truly starting to pay off, and I just can&#039;t wait for all the lore content you guys can shower us.","replies":[{"poster":"LeaoC","date":"2018-07-26T18:01:38.800+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":2,"body":"My tear is fully stacked.

In other words, it's focused primarily on themes, personality, and \"narrative\" events that tie into those things.  It's about who these characters are and who they are becoming.  Worldbuilding would be more focused on the utilitarian \"how this all works\", including things like culture, daily life, language, and \"historical\" events.\n\nOf course, you're right that the two are connected; they definitely work together!  But narrative is probably the team who is actually writing stories, the actual texts we read, based on the world being developed by the other team.  Every at Riot does well to work together; the teams in charge of Champion Updates and New Champions aren't just in charge of gameplay; they also have to tie that gameplay to the narrative.  For example one (of many) reasons Irelia was updated was because her gameplay doesn't reflect her ability to control a bunch of floating blades; other than her ultimate, which was a basic skillshot, she could've functioned entirely as someone just holding a sword.  So those developing her gameplay worked alongside those developing her character/narrative.\n\nSo would the art/visualization team and the narrative team, I'm assuming.  Pardon my wordiness.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-07-27T00:16:09.163+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"Oof, I should clarify! :-)\n\nSo, when I first joined Riot, Worldbuilding was a team composed of writers, artists and editors working on all the lore that didn't come from League of Legends directly (i.e. the Champions team) But more recently, the writers were instead assigned to longer form storytelling (like Graham McNeill and Anthony Reynolds working on their pieces for the faction updates) or to product teams like Champions. Comics separated from Worldbuilding too, and so did I - that was when I moved to the Lead Editor role, in fact.\n\nThe artists are still doing all their excellent concept and visualisation work! They have produced LITERALLY hundreds of pieces, many of which were released with the map, but also many more we have yet to show you...\n\nSpeaking for myself, I've found the artwork absolutely invaluable as we've moved the lore forward. I've seen writers look at a picture for the first time, and been inspired to create a whole story just from that! Nothing gets people excited about a new idea quite so quick as a great piece of artwork. :-)\n\nWhile we've been delivering lore updates and building the world through stories and champion bios, the Worldbuilding team has been showing us what it looks like. Long may it continue!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[{"poster":"Larriet","date":"2018-07-27T01:01:41.605+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know I was grasping at straws on the actual details, but my general point was accurate. :P  Even as separate teams, they're all building on what others have done, not just making things independently.

I hope Orianna's lore really goes that that sweet way instead of trying to be creepy like her old lore.  Most of her skins are creepy, even after it got updated (her latest was freaking Dark Star, after all, although I think she was a great choice for that skin even if it's not what _I_ like about her).  I think that kind of character has its own appeal, but she's just not the character I fell in love with.  I remember when I started playing, I was debating whether I should play Ahri or Orianna.  The client had their old bios still, so Orianna had that creepy \"killing is fun\" thing going on, and Ahri's quote was super noble (\"Mercy is a human luxury … and responsibility\").  But now that I've read their NEW bios, Ahri is tragic but not quite as noble, and Orianna was turned into such a sweetheart, so now I like Ahri less and Orianna a lot more. :P\nEven though she doesn't \"need\" one, Orianna is top of my wishlist for a voice update, even though I know she technically has one that's about as modern as someone like Nami or Ahri, since her VO just feels out of character.\n\nI know, they are more!

I never thought about that.  Dark Star Orianna is well done but so scary.  I kinda wish that she had a skin reflecting her new lore, now that you’ve explained it.\n\nWow, you must have played for a long time, then.  That lore sounds very old.  I’m surprised Ahri was noble, though.  I thought she’d always been a tragic former succubus.  I’m generally not a fan of the sexy champs, though.

I don’t know where to start with her, other than by saying her chipper positivity is partly an act just to fit into expectations of her behavior.  She’s sitting on years and years of silent agony and anxiety.  But partly, her goodness isn’t an act.  She saves a boy from a demon with insightful, careful, and patient tenderness.  That Demacian society can’t look past her magic to see the wonderful girl beneath is... just tragic and infuriating!","replies":[{"poster":"Larriet","date":"2018-07-27T04:38:21.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't been playing for as long as you think--only a little over a year now.  They just didn't update the bios in the client for a very long time!  They had already gotten everything they have now when I started playing; I just didn't know about the website. :P\n\nAhri was originally a fox who was BECOMING human as she absorbed essence (Vastaya wasn't a thing at the time), but as she did so, she started to develop a sense of morals.  So to become fully human, she would have to kill people, but because she was becoming human, she now knew that was wrong.  That's why she joined the League of Legends in the old lore, so she could kill people and become human without actually killing them for real.  She was basically the same actually, but didn't have the same stakes where she can't help but hurt people.\nOrianna's old lore was very off-putting.  Instead of being the same person, the human Orianna _died_, and her father built the robot in her image.  They outright said that she didn't even have an actual mind.  So although it said she was trying to make friends and be kind in her own way, which was why I checked her out, I couldn't get over her sadistic streak...  Just like how you said you can't play her for the voice, I kind of \"put up\" with the voice because I know she's actually not like that anymore.  But I used to feel the same way, where I didn't want to play her.\n\nIf you ever want to read the old lore, you can find it on the League of Legends Wiki!  Go to a champion and you can find it under the \"History\" page.  Also, the Journal of Justice (an old newspaper-type thing from the old lore) is on the Wiki, too.  It developed a lot of champions, but you won't see those stories on their own pages.  Some champions weren't around for the old lore, though, so there's nothing there (like Taliyah).\n\nI totally understand not liking the sexy champions, although I still do sort of like Ahri and Miss Fortune.  I think Miss Fortune is cool, sexiness and all, haha.  Although I don't play her very often because she's not very \"me\".  When it comes to characters in general, I'm interested in everyone, not just the nice ones.  But when it comes to characters I want to play as, to represent me in-game, I definitely agree that I want to play the goody-two-shoes.\n\nAnd yeah, I've read everything for my three faves!  I really admire their spirit.  I think they're easy to relate to, but I also really agree with their sense of morals, so it gives me something to aspire to.  Don't know if I want to call them \"role models\", but kindred spirits for sure. \nHonestly, the story of Lux showing her light to the wounded soldier is probably my favorite thing in the entire lore.\n\nEdit: these posts are getting super long now, yikes!

One of the BIGGEST reasons I always end up coming back to League is for the lore and for the beautiful art that they integrate into the game. It's beautiful, the stories are compelling, and it makes it SO much more rewarding to play and actually get good at. Being able to tell a good story adds another layer of depth to a game; it's why games like The Witcher 3 and GoW are so popular; it's the immersion as WELL as the game play.\n\nNot saying that games that are just meant for fun aren't worth the effort of playing them, some games are just better being just the game-play alone; but League utilizes its resources to tell a great story with it's characters. Even if I take breaks from this game, I'll always watch for updates and character developments while I play something else.

However, this is a lot better than what happened when the League of Legends was immediately deleted after years of basically no lore or stories and a canned JoJ.  I used to read the Journal every time and was really impressed by the stories they put into the new maps like Kalamanda in S1/S2.  It hooked me into the game and the fact it was a good game is what kept me playing.\n\nLeague has a rich world and 90%+ of the recent short stories have been quality reads.  The comics are all top notch other than a couple weirdly drawn faces on some panels, legitimately looks like something DC or Marvel at their best might produce.  There's a lot of good content here and as long as the narrative teams keep true to the spirit of these champions and take proper care when writing their stories, I'll keep reading.  The art teams are honestly the best part of Riot and the comic/narrative teams are a big part of that.  As long as we avoid retcons as massive as the Varus one or new champion stories ruining old ones (Jayce's first story was a disaster for Viktor if anyone remembers that), I'm sure League will continue to produce great stories and build a rich world.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LightningShado","date":"2018-07-27T00:51:12.163+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"NOW I'M JUST WAITING FOR THE MOVIES BOIIIIIII","replies":[]},{"poster":"IllusionLord333","date":"2018-07-26T22:12:11.625+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the lore and without it I probably wouldn’t have picked up League in the first place.\nI remember when I first got into League, a friend of mine referenced me to it.
