They promise us a great game without any problems or bugs what so ever. But then they throw Clash at our faces. The one thing that people actually look forward to playing in the godforsaken game. But they just can&#039;t seem to keep that going. Literally every single time they&#039;re about to release clash. It crashes. Riot Games keep telling us that they fixed it and that it will be up and runing in no time without any problems. \r\n\r\nBUT NO, They released it 3 times with the same problems. I&#039;m not a genius but goddamn Riot. Fix your shit before you start giving us false hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n{{summoner:3}}","replies":[]}
