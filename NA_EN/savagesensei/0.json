At the time I was still in high school and unaware of the significance behind the words in which I was using at that time. Since the ban I have matured and realized the hurtful effects that my speech had on those around me, and sincerely regret the things that I said. I now wish to return to the game and hopefully become a better member of the League community. In the 4 years that I played prior to my ban I invested over 1,000$ dollars linked to my account, therefore I humbly request that Riot forgive my previous transgressions and lift the permanent ban that is currently on my account.\r\n\r\nRespectfully yours,\r\n\r\nSavageSensei","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-06-09T00:00:02.472+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but unfortunately Riot does not lift punishments unless they were made in error.

It was stated on your reform card that any continued negativity would result in a permanent ban and that's what happened.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-09T03:11:28.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SavageSensei,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=zfGRzw8a,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2019-06-09T03:05:05.843+0000)\n>\n> I didnt ignore anything lmao I was never even given all my chances, it went from 14 day ban straight to perm I never had any chat restrictions.\n\nThose are all the chances you get when you use racial slurs, hate speech, etc.\n\nYou said in your OP that you understand that the things you said had \"hurtful effects,\" but in your comment above you believe that your punishment was \"an error\" - which one is it?

Have you been playing league on a different account since you've been banned?

You may have matured but the community for sure hasn't (there's a reason why league's community is known to be toxic to the point of memery).
