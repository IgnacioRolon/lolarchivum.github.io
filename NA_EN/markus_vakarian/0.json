These are the points you earn after playing a champion consistently that updates the banner you have in your profile or in the Loading Screen.  Currently, the max level you can get is 5!\n\nKeep in mind that shards you receive are completely random.  So it is possible to receive shards for champions you already own.  However, you can use 3 champion shards to re-roll into a new permanent champion (one you do not own, even new champions that get released)","replies":[{"poster":"Markus Vakarian","date":"2016-05-10T13:59:44.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know what champion mastery is but i don't know what 6-7 brings to me. I want something for crafting not just the chance to say \"hey i'm lvl 6 with Malzahar\". \nI don't want Ahri/Fizz/Soraka if i have them already and i don't want to have a chance to get a new champon because:\n1) the chance to find the champion i need are 1 on 140 (what's the total number of champions??? ok that number)\n2) i have all champions and 150000 IP so i don't need to have that small chance to get the new champion since i can buy it\n\nAnd please don't telle me  that this can be useful for those who don't own all champions. You are supposed to find a solution good for everyone\nLet me get orange essence even if i find a champion shard.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
