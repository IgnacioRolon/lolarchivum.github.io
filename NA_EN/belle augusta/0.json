I get dropped before I can enter any lobbies. I feel like it started after I started getting an unusual 90ms ping in the Star Guardian gamemode. I think I was still receiving messages from the server, as I could see what my teammates were doing at normal ping. It didn't look like the server was getting my messages though, because I couldn't move my character or buy items. Every other service besides League is connecting with me just fine, and my cmd ping to the ip came back at my usual 60ms. I flushed my DNS, and my connection is normally good.\n\nReal talk Broporo, is it because I haven't bought any Star Guardian skins yet? {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n\n*Edit: Apparently it showed I was in a lobby with my friend, even though the client wasn't even running! I actually managed to get into a champ select phase... we'll see where it goes from here.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-08T04:29:16.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL I can guarantee you that it's not because you haven't bought the skins. You actually get to use the skins for free in that mode! \n\nThis sounds a lot like packet loss though tbh. Grab the network logs from that game and have the [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan them, then post a screenshot here of what it says so I can look over it.","replies":[{"poster":"uguubean","date":"2017-09-08T05:01:55.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://imgur.com/a/DmXJe\n\nI seem to have stopped having issues. I'm just confused how I could be having problems communicating with League of Legends when I'm not having problems with other services. Could I just have gotten caught in some weird bottleneck? Should I worry about something about my setup causing network problems in the future?\n\nI won't tell any other Rioters if you decide you want to admit it's the Star Guardian Syndra I don't own that's causing all the problems.\n\n{{sticker:poppy-wink}} ","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
