Keep in mind I did not touch League in over two years. However I remembered my account was on EUW. So found out there was a Region Transfer option, costs money sadly, so I looked into it to see if it was worth it. Sumamrized the cost of the things I had and yeah it was basically worth the 2.6k RP. So I had then purchased a 20 Euro package of Riot Points to be able to get the RP to perform the transfer. Once the transaction was complete I then immediately performed the transfer and it happened instantaneously basically. I logged in with my new username because the one I had for EUW I had already made for North America. So logging in with the new one I go into the account... I have abolutely nothing. 0 RP &amp; 1 IP, zero champions, zero skins, no Runes not the 1 loot box I had opened for the tech stuff. My level was back to 1, It was as if it was a fresh account but with the odd 1 IP. Idk if yo ustart with one IP I forget. Anyone have experienced this or anything like that?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-13T16:56:49.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is it with the account you're posting from right now?  It sounds like you might be logging onto the wrong account if it's looking pretty empty.  Just to be sure, I suggest filling out an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) so we can be sure we locate the right account and make sure everything transferred accordingly.","replies":[{"poster":"FlashToroGaming","date":"2017-05-13T17:49:14.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes this is the account. My EUW was FlashToroGaming as both username and summoner name. However When I performed the transfer I had already made a North America account with the Username FlashToroGaming summoner name FlashToroUS. So when the transfer was done I changed the username to FlashToro only to keep it simple. THe summoner name I also changed to FlashToro but when transfered it maintained the FlashToroGaming summoner name which on the page for transfers I saw it wa slisted that that would happen. So I am logging into the now named Flashtoro Username. I have filled a ticket just under the wrong category so I assume I should fill out another?","replies":[]}]}]}
