Usually had 150-250 FPS, currently getting maybe 10-20 FPS on average, sometimes if I am lucky i'll get up to 25-30. I have tried all your so called fixes. I've played on Howling Abyss and Summoners Rift. Your \"fixes\" work on neither map. I'll be posting my PC specs and a link to my DL and UL speeds so you can tell me if there are any known problems with my hardware. Everything is up to date, I even rolled back drivers and tried updating them again. I did a fresh install onto my SSD instead of onto my HDD. Nothing works, so when will you admit you screwed up and will fix it? And if you can't fix it, should you do some type of roll back on your servers and compensate some people?\r\nI've been playing for around 4 or 5 years, and have never seen such a massive FPS problem among so many people because of a patch and the best you can do is link everyone to your \"FPS Problems\" page which hasn't worked for almost anyone. \r\n\r\nSpeedtest:http://beta.speedtest.net/result/6897258766\r\n\r\nPC Specs:\r\n\r\nOS:Windows 8.1 64 bit\r\nProcessor:Intel Core i7-4710MQ @ 2.5 GHz(8CPUs)\r\nRAM: 16GB\r\nGraphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-20T21:56:30.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've noticed a lot of players having problems with fps on the new snowdown map, but there have also been some known fps issues addressed in [**this post**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/lZv6E2Xz-update-on-fps-issues-in-722-and-723).
