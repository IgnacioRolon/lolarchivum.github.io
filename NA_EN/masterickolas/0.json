I think I've had like 30 ~ 40 matches, won just about half of them, and before then I was getting them a LOT more regularly. At least one every 5~6 wins.\r\n\r\nDid you guys change something, or put a limit on key fragments like you did chests? Can somebody explain? I have like 3 chests that I wanna open.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Morgageddon","date":"2016-04-11T20:25:28.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Heyo,\n\nRemember, it's still a chance based system for key drops.

The number of people questioning why they're not getting any at all (rather than simply less) is something of a warning flag...  I know in my experience so far, it feels like the rate is on less of a curve and more of a cliff - I didn't get a single fragment between my 9th and the month reset.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord AzÄ±r","date":"2016-04-11T20:33:49.519+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Morgageddon,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=AvY95T0G,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-04-11T20:25:28.633+0000)\n>\n> Heyo,\n> \n> Remember, it's still a chance based system for key drops.
