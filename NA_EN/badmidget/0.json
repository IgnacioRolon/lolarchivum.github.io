It seems as though I have been losing a lot of packets or latency has been exceptionally high, only on League though. I will be playing and although my ping remains the same, usually somewhere between 26 and 45 but all of a sudden instead of moving I'll be stuck in place for a few seconds, then either rubber band into place or suddenly start moving again.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-22T01:35:49.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm that rubberbanding really makes it sound like you've been having some packet loss issues. Luckily we have a pretty straightforward way of testing for it by using our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). Use that tool to scan the network logs from that game and post a screenshot here for me to look over with you!","replies":[]}]}
