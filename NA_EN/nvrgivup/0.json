Freezes here are often caused by an unstable connection to the servers. When your connection falls off during champ select, the server doesn't get a response from you and is not able to verify you're connected anymore. Most of the time these issues can be resolved by the steps in our [connection guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nLeague points and match history cannot be modified after they've been recorded. The system was designed this way to prevent corruption. Often times losing a series doesn't put you down to 0 LP and sometimes it only takes one or two wins to enter your series again. I encourage you to live by your summoner name and Never Give up! :)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-12T10:31:27.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Repair the game by clicking the question mark icon to the top right of the patcher and hitting \"Repair\".
