Since then ive played league a bunch, though im still not very good, i enjoy. But for the past couple of months my ping is alternating from 100- 1000 and i can barely play. has something changed during the last few updates to cause this and is anyone else having a similar problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-15T17:09:34.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the high ping has been consistent, it's possible the your ISP's routing has changed and taking longer to reach our server.
