The fact that anyone can disconnect at anytime, and the ranked match still counts, despite the unfair advantage it causes, coupled along with trolling by rude or sour teammates who give up all hope of winning (or simply want to make life miserable) has brought this Game Mode to its lowest point in comparison to any other MOBA on the internet. Many players can&#039;t enjoy their matches, and may go as far as quitting League entirely due to the toxic nature of the Ranked community (outside of 5s teams).\r\n\r\nNow we have an answer: Champion Mastery Grades provide a great way for a player, as well as his teammates, to see that he/she is definitely serious about Ranked play. It can prevent players from behaving negatively in terms of gameplay because now they have a vested interest in the champion! This would also deter a part of the community for afking or disconnecting, despite the current score or phase of the match, because their champion grade would be affected. Finally, we all have a reason to always come in shining, deliver our A-Game, and go home proud despite the outcome.\r\n\r\nThis new feature would only affect Ranked Solo/Duo queues and Ranked 5s teams. Normal matches (and any other game modes) won&#039;t be affected, so people can safely play other champions and practice them without criticism.\r\n\r\nChampion Mastery Leveling up, Mastery score and Mastery Rewards would be unaffected by this new change. No matter your score, you would still get points and receive rewards (Crests, Badges, Titles and Emotes) and levels for each champion, despite your Ranked Champion Mastery Grade.\r\n\r\nRanked 5s teammates can now see how well you did, who you are best with, as well as be able to recruit based on a now definite proof of skill and ability. Team captains would know that these Grades are not a definite indicator of prowess with a champion, but it&#039;s a very good start.\r\n\r\n-----------------------Conclusion-----------------------\r\n\r\nRiot has explained that their new Champion Mastery system is performance based - a way to recognize you &quot;for playing the champs you love and give you feedback on how well you play them&quot;. Let&#039;s maximize this benefit by providing its findings to our community. Ranked queue should be a competitive environment where every player is serious about their contribution. Presenting Champion Mastery Grades publicly (for Ranked matches only) will favorably affect this environment greatly, across all Divisions and Tiers. Let&#039;s ask Riot to make this change come true. Let&#039;s improve our Ranked Game Mode by giving players incentive to bring their best champions and playstyles to their Ranked Matches!\r\n\r\n-----------------How Can I Help?---------------------\r\n\r\nIf you agree with what has been stated in this forum post, then you can help make this a reality by replying to this thread.

It will do better in providing incentive for players to do their best than the honor system in place now.  Also it I believe it will play a hand in providing random players to work together to build a better player composition in champ select.  Players may have to admit, \"hey Im a C jg  and he's an S and I really do want the win so..\", and hopefully quell \"called it\" debates. If a player is a C and a player with a higher grade nabs the spot they might be less likely to play angry in game, knowing that it is the best possible make up.\n\nAs for the comments below stating that \"it wasnt my fault we lost and I got a bad grade\".  I believe to understand that RIOT has more metrics in place to grade a player than just a win/loss scenario.  You can still get a halfway decent grade in a loss.  This shows that you aren't contributing to the loss as much as a team mate.  So in my opinion, that position may not be very valid.\n\nJust to reiterate out of excitement over this, I really do think this is a great idea and a much better move in creating better players and better incentive to do well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boxleitner","date":"2015-05-10T03:08:38.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I am so excited to see agreement to this post!
