If you find it happening again, can you send me your leagueclient logs for that login session? You can find the logs in your root league folder > logs > leagueclient logs, and then grab the most recent leagueclient.log. You can send it to me either through google drive or a dropbox link. Let me know if you need any help with this!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boxleitner","date":"2017-11-06T22:38:55.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi ChupaaCabra, thank you for checking in on this.\n\nNo, fortunately this was a one time bug. I tend to use emotes very very often in matches, and I believe i can rest assured? that they can't be counted as harrassment or toxicity?\n\nSo it happened that this one match, whenever i pulled up the wheel, it was just empty. No matter how many times i clicked. For that entire match I thought i had gotten penalized for unsportsmanlike behavior thru emotes!!\n\nBelieve it or not, I tried leaving the match and returning. I also restarted the client and returned to the match and nothing: the wheel was still empty and clicking had no effect.\n\nBut as soon as that match was over, the next match had no issues at all in any manner.\n\nI haven't seen this issue since.","replies":[]}]}
