Ex: Rengar, Kha'Zix, Trundle, Volibear, Shaco, Wukong...etc. The early camps bring you so low to the point of recalling or death and it's bogus to be quite honest because now Nunu and Warwick and other tanky sustain junglers are over played. Please Rito, just nerf the jungle earlier on in the game to make it a wee bit easier on the older junglers.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2014-11-24T02:46:30.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a little more difficult, but it's still easily possible to play non-sustaining junglers still. Shaco, Evelynn and any others I can't think of are in an ok place in my opinion, they could use a little buff to help them, but with them, always start Krug, the stun every 5 AA really helps them out. Early game can be a little rough, but once you get mid game, you usually start clearing faster then most sustaining junglers.\n\nA lot of people have been complaining about Evelynn...honestly she's one of the strongest junglers I've played so far. Her clear times are slow early game, but mid game with jungle item and sheen, they become stupid fast. I usually Krug (Smite)-Wolves-Red Buff (Smite)-Blue Buff-Gromp (Smite) and still have hp to gank, assuming the lanes have been harassing.\n\nThe big thing now is really paying attention to when and where you smite. If you smite something like blue buff, unless you're oom, it's pointless to do so. Or if you use it on wolves when you're not getting counter jungled or Raptors if you're not counter jungling, you're essentially wasting your smite.

You just have to do things differently. For example, did you know that killing the frog gives you level 2? Kill blue then wolves and you are already at Lvl 3. The jungle may hit harder but it gives you more XP allowing you to lvl up faster and get out to help the lanes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cloud273","date":"2014-11-24T02:22:18.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why don't we just give them something similar to what amumu has ('w' passive that makes him take less damage from monsters)?
