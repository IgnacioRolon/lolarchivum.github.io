I do, however, find it telling when a community can't come to a decent idea about which ability of any fotm champion is broken, so over time you see, well, all of them. Lee Sin being the best example, as literally every single part of his kit was requested nerfs by the community when the Lee Hate Train (it had some cars following along labeled \"Vi\" and \"Jarvan IV\", too) was strong on the rails. In response, Riot proceeded to not nerf anything directly to Lee Sin to my knowledge, maybe Warrior enchant aside, and buff tanks.
