I find it hard to believe that just removing spats from the carousel is what did it. The rise of rangers isn't really that much different than the rise and fall of other alliances... but this game just seems hollow now. Even winning feels like \"yup, I got it\" instead of how it was before- where i felt like i was outplaying my opponents... \r\nDoes anyone feel the same way?","replies":[{"poster":"NeonPanda","date":"2020-02-07T19:03:41.775+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% agree with this.  I'm not sure if it's about Spatulas but the past few days I haven't been enjoying the game as much.  I feel like the carousel has been really weird lately, like half the items are missing from each one.","replies":[{"poster":"Proƒyt","date":"2020-02-07T19:16:27.141+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes! thanks lol\nwe are not alone! haha\nAlso i think one of the things that kind of kills it for me is when you are doing really well then suddenly stop being able to do anything.

I had a game wher I was shadow inferno ranger and usually I can at least win  a few bouts, But I mean I had a game we were both running pred we had basically mirror matched, I had level 2 rek he had lvl 1 I had lvl2 kog and skar vs his lvl 1 we both had lvl one mudo and he had a volibear lvl 2 to my WW lvl 2.  Only thing was his rek had gunblade and for what ever reason My team just got deleted.  I don't think I killed one of his units. I get if it came down to like his rek vs mine and it had items but I swear there are games where It just decides My team will loose and thats it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VvVVvV","date":"2020-02-10T08:55:16.751+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is the spatulas.
