No other roles get autofilled.\r\n\r\nI really don&#039;t mind being autofilled as support once in awhile, since I can play it, however it feels like every other game the &#039;support&#039; is saying &quot;can someone swap with me pls i dont play support&quot;.\r\n\r\nMost of the time, if the enemy team has a support main or someone barely competent at the role on their team, then my botlane just gets rolled, and the game is lost.\r\n\r\nAutofill was introduced in attempt to shorten queue time and &quot;increase match quality&quot;, my queue times are pretty much the same, but my matches are utter dogshit.\r\n\r\nIt really doesn&#039;t help that this is the meta where the winning botlane wins the game 70% of the time, so every time you get an autofill support there&#039;s an increased chance in losing.","replies":[{"poster":"Espy Psyche","date":"2017-01-15T23:00:42.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do we even have autofill below Plat anyway?
