I have linked my op.gg account as proof and I have compiled together images explaining and proving that I was given a random loss.

It doesn't look like op.gg is showing you the full match history, since there was a game where you queue dodged as soon as your miniseries started. Keep in mind that [**dodging games in a series**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760#h2q2) will always count as a loss. Also, remember that op.gg isn't hosted by Riot, so their data can be skewed or missing elements.","replies":[]}]}
