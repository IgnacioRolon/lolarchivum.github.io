Tried repairs. read limks about fixing x86 problems. ive been playing since the start of lol. thousands games played. never had this problem this bad before. not seeing anything on this subject. i can use the web fine while its tellimg me error reports being sent. i do not have a connection issue. everything works in real time but the client and if i do make it in game 42-4k ping. i understand wifi, but i get this with ethernet too. client cant be reconizing me for dodging cause my connectivity is excellent for EVERYTHING ELSE. im the only 1 on the network. no phones wifi turned on. I can use any device to do anything online but get past the champ select issue. this a random problem that i dont see any constant variable for.  its so hard to play when u see the movements of champs and the animations but no damge or numbers appear. or i will see the damage but no animations appear. after all has caught up, BAMN the lag finally ends and in less than a sec the 5 secs of ghost screening all comes together. Doesnt matter what video settings i use, very low or very high its the same. i might be fine for a few hours and then bamn here we go for the next 5 games with this then it will stop again.  I think it is something i'm missing due to updates and these apps now on windows. Like they start running in background doing checks or definition updates, but i dont see anything. Maybe i dont know how to see if apps r affecting me in background. i do know this. My lil wheel inside is making a chatter when it happens. Its gotta be something accessing my RAM.

Every year problems. I hope its just those ddos tying up sever space.  Every year at worlds time i see issues. If that all it is i will be happy and deal with that. If not i need to know how to fix my end please.\n\np.s.   custom too.  selecting champs in custom and changing difficulty was fine. In game it took a min but yes it did show problems with ai players.  No other manual players in game. I believe there is a problem in my network and/or adapter. i am the only 1 on the network. I am at home. secured. event logs show me stable ms. I only have a problem at select and in game. No other games or sites show any problem. In fact now they r better after i did the hextech tool. We may be not able to solve it, but if i could just identify it would be nice. Then that will tell me what i need to do next. Hold on, i get again a window saying 1380x7?? is not my optimal resolution. Not in game. This appeared again on desktop. I look at display and im in 1380x720 and its the only 1 i can be in at 1320! Ive got a update still pending i feel somewhere that is trying to finish that is not showing.\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-10T18:41:02.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro, are you using any third party programs?  I've seen issues like this before, and many times the culprit are apps like play tv or lolrecorder not playing well with League.  If you have any running, disable them and let me know if it helps.  You can also test it out in a custom game to be sure.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Runethor","date":"2016-09-10T19:47:15.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no, i havent used those since s2. i do use a map skin at times but even still without 1. just did two poro now, ms 46-51 and ghost screening. fps 60-112. but when they dont change and stay like 47ms ad 75 fps ik im in for a ride.

The guides to help would also not match 98.  In general, though, things like screen delays are usually due to network problems that can't communicate with the server properly.  I would suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide, but can't guarantee anything with your OS.  I do hope it helps, though!","replies":[{"poster":"Runethor","date":"2016-09-12T23:55:06.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ran hextech, first game champ select was fine, very minor hiccup. In game constant intervals of lag though showing different on screen this time. More what i'm used to seeing in previous years. Ping really didn't move again. It did adjust to a higher number after the lag ended. It usually wont move now when lagging and that's never done that. It has always adjust everysecond, be it 42-51 or 42-4k. If i can see my ms move from 40ms too 200+ i can use that for a start to trouble shoot. So u see it doesn't move anymore. It will stay 42 or 46 and fps not move either. It is all wrong the signs i see now. Something is interfering i cant put my finger on. This game i put all settings to very low and turned of all interface gold, damage, xp etc. No map skins, (usually mapskins increase performence) and nothing running in background. Its almost as if their is someone else on me line. I am only running 3mbs thru WoW provider in florida. Before these last 10 days, i have played for months on the same 3mbs and WOW and it was all fine.

Soon as i am in champ select.... unspecified error sending reports. Locked screen, can not get out. drop from select failed to pick champ. Can not log out. i am getting dropped from select only and if i make it to game it has terrible issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Runethor","date":"2016-09-12T22:09:09.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol. No i am not on windows 98. It's just a joke from past shows on computers. I am on windos 10. I think it is related to VPN. Some how my action center tab shows me running thru a VPN now. After reading i dont want to go thru a VPN to the router. Not sure if i turned it off. Action center shows its running thru it rather than the previous icon showing the router name. Windows 10 says there r issues with vpn due to windows 8 upgrades into windows 10. It seems like something is in the way. Just played one now. Client works fine until i enter champ select, at some point it no longer shows whats happening in real time. I can still choose bans and my pick if i anticipate the moves. The timer will end, i may or may not get to see the screen catch up. If i do it will go to load screen. If not i am stuck at double 0, either with unspecified or disconnected from chat. This game it said i wasn't connected to the internet but im picking. Timer went to 00. Then reset itself with 54 secs left to pick and had my champ locked in. i can chat with the team until they go too load screen regardless of how the screen is reacting or the error report windows i get. It's weird.  I can't log out. X wont respond or it will just keep saying are u sure u wanna go and do nothing. i have to shut down desktop and relog client and i will be 2 min late too fountain. This is 3/4 the games last 10 days roughly. Look my account u see thats alot, i addicted to olaf. The rest of the 1/4 games have some small lag but it catches up quick. I did have a forced update happen last week and the other day with microsoft edge and something else that took 1 hour each to download  and install right when i turned the computer on. I have all apps and progams to do no actions even as checking until i say manually. Before this last 10 days all was great as usual. Tx for the quick reply.  ill be in poro all night and keep an eye out for your response. \n\nSincerly,\n\nMushroom juice is fine once u get used to the madness and paranoia\n\n\n\n{{champion:240}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
