Why?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":8,"down_votes":13,"body":"Let's not forget this is in addition to unrelenting hatred of Christianity when they stop to take a breath. \n\nAside from my general dislike of discussing religion on the Internet, it's wildly off topic. Without even touching the contents, for what reason did we want the ability to discuss this on General Discussion? We always had an off topic forum and we held it in disdain because it was off topic and nobody gave a fuck.\n\nIf you ever needed to know why nobody seems to give a shit about our forum, or the moderation for said forum, or the contents about said forum, it's because this is now off-topic by another name.\n\nNote: I'll cop to being wrong on the past relevance of threads to General Discussion. It's possible I just don't remember the irrelevant threads in the face of interviews with Tryndamere, people writing fan fiction between champions, and Factions. I can admit to some bias - at the time, I usually posted when I was pissed off about stuff in the classic bronze fashion. ","replies":[]}
