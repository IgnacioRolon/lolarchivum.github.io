I was banned today for 15 days for being toxic. I was banned for calling out people for mistakes and them flaming for it. If you have gone through anything like this or anything similar and have been banned for it plz upvote this. I was banned for calling out mistakes from other players and defending myself from their flame for doing so. apparently in &quot;riots&quot; society everyone is perfect exepect for the angry people. I&#039;m sorry i&#039;m triggered for having 3 games with teammates that auto pilot and have no idea what is going on throughout the match. myb for callling them out and trying to find a new game in &quot;norms&quot; (ffing early) to actually improve over trying to constantly play from behind in bronze. I see shit from 10 mins ago and call it out. but i&#039;m flamed and reported for it. Thanks riot for treating your $1400+ deep fan so generously! ( looking at the chat log i don&#039;t see where the fuck i was toxic.) sure i called people out on shit but i&#039;m banned for doing that. so pretty much if you play league don&#039;t talk to anyone unless it&#039;s game related? i&#039;m hella triggererd thanks riot.

If you take the time you're trying to teach others, and instead use that time to try and focus on your own gameplay, you may very well find it's easier to win games. You can't control others, and you can't make them better, and you'll probably never see them again.

Champs, bans/picks, summoners , opponents and allies change each game, but you don't. The only way to improve is to improve yourself.
