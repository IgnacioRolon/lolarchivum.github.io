I know people have different tastes, and each band is not for everyone, but can we give a huge amazing props to the the Production team, music team and design team for creative amazing skins and music. It’s actually so diverse, seeing types of genres being explored so actually well. \r\n\r\nTrue Damage for me hit the hip hop genre on the spot. From the rap flows, to rhythm drops and lyrics, the band and singers nailed everything to the style.\r\n\r\nI would not compare K/DA and True Damage or Pentakill because they’re both different styles and would not be fair. \r\n\r\nI’m happy they’re moving to this direction with music. Songs like Awkaen and Phoenix should also give a huge shoutout to them too. I’m excited for what next in the future of music in league, and now other games too.","replies":[{"poster":"SkiptoMyLuo","date":"2019-11-11T20:26:47.082+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you so much for the kind words!

She’s just collabing with them. She isn’t supposed to take the spotlight like K/DA cause she’s the lead rapper there. Here she wants the others to shine. Both Duckwrth and Thutmoose killed their verse for Ekko and Keke and Becky G nailed their parts too.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-11-10T23:26:48.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well I guess that's true about Akali.  \n\nI'm still kind of sad that they had Duckwrth and Thutmoose do the vocals for Ekko.

I mean they sound pretty similar, so it worked out pretty well as they sounded great but why not get someone else and then they could have opened up some vocals for Yasuo?

We the best!\"\n\nHe doesn't usually sing. He just...makes the beat.  Yasuo made the beat. He contributed the most to the song. Yeah, Ekko had two parts, but if Ekko was stripped out, we still have the hook and two people that did verses. And guess what, we still have the beat.  Keep Ekko and get rid of Yasuo, they'll be doing acapella, and rapping without a beat or any background.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zeanix","date":"2019-11-11T06:57:56.425+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sukishoo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=KojoMhFy,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-11-10T23:26:48.066+0000)\n>\n> Well I guess that's true about Akali.  \n> \n> I'm still kind of sad that they had Duckwrth and Thutmoose do the vocals for Ekko.
