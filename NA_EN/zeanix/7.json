With the Darkin lore showing a light on how Ascended, Aspects and Darkin works, we still have yet to see a Baccai. Have these god like beings witnessed a Baccai before? What sort of power do they have if compared to these beings. \nThis is the description of what Baccai are from the loading screen tip \"In Shurima, those who survived a failed Ascension ritual are known as the Baccai, who often are twisted and malformed.\"\n\nAnd for other lore questions, if Azir meets Aatrox, Varus or Rhaast, will he still recognized them? Will they recognize Azir? And will Nasus recognize them as well?\n\nAnd how does Sivir's weapons work now? Does it contain the souls of the Ascended? Can Sivir hear them? And is Diana basically connected to it now, since Ta'anari combined the power of the Moon (with the help of an aspect of twilight) to defeat the other Ascended?\n\nSorry for asking too many questions, but There's so much revealed but so many more questions to be asked\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-05-10T13:47:19.063+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in video games, it's not the case for old forum threads.

And though baccai (if still in the lore), are failed ascensions and would die of very quickly, I kinda wanna see a modern half baccai, no idea how that will work in lore, but it could shake things up a bit.\n\nI agree with the interactions between them, though idk If nasus would just kill them just like that but who knows.\n\nWait did I miss the part?

Already in the lore, Ta'anari is old as fuck, and his age is showing through his gray hair, his aching and age-gnarled body (I know he's got battle wounds, but still), and his general tiredness. So given that he's significantly younger than Nasus and Renekton during the time in that story, and he died LONG ago in the history of everything, why aren't Nasus and Renekton battling each other and Xerath with walkers, canes, stray dentures? They should be older than anything imaginable in the current time period, yet they still have the minds and bodies of men in their prime. Why introduce lore that explains that yes, the Ascended get old and show their age, when the current ancient Ascended in the game do not follow this model at all? It's like come on, I get that you're on the narrative team, but you really need to do research and understand your characters and your game before you start writing about. Every author who's writing in an established world knows that they have to do research before making stuff up, or else you're stepping knee deep into plot holes like this that create major inconsistencies.","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-06-27T01:17:02.368+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=wydMKxeN,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-26T21:30:50.419+0000)\n>\n>... yet they still have the minds and bodies of men in their prime. \n\nI dont think that the mind of Renekton is in his prime.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CytheGuy","date":"2018-06-26T23:26:17.379+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might be tied to them becoming Darkin, and also that they have warped their flesh using forbidden magic.
