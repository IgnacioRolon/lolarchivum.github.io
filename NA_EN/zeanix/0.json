But when I looked up his other voice lines, it showed a new light on Aatrox. Though it isn&#039;t the same as the old Aatrox, he becomes an actual character with depth to it other than shout and kill everyone.\r\n\r\nSome quotes [(from the league wiki)](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Aatrox#PBE) that I found most interesting\r\n\r\n&quot;I touched the stars... And saw the glorious light of a thousand suns... Now, blinded by this elegence, how could my purpose be anything... but dark...&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;I am but an unholy copy of life... A mockery of its freedom... And born in the cruel betrayal of the noble ideals I would&#039;ve served.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;We had another name once...

Does he resemble to you a funny entity? Does he look funny? He is supposed to murderer god-like being, not a clown.\n\nI really don't like how you (speaking for general, I don't have any grudge against you, you are actually one of my favourite rioters) butcher champion personalities for marketing when voice lines are one of the FEW ways to know their exact thoughts. It is the most effective way to make champion feel alive. And you butcher it to satisfy kids and their \"LULZ\".\n\nYeah sure Aatrox knows what MEMO means in the story.\n\nPlease, yeah I get it, you guys wanted to show to unnecessary funny side, but please, don't do that to Mordekaiser and Nocturne, champions that should be terrifying.\n\nIt literally butchers the entire theme for me. I was really excited about the Aatrox voice. I did not wait for special interactions to see only yells and jokes.\n\nIt definitely kills the champion for me. Because I see special interactions like \"what would _the_ champion say if they ever met?\" and not like \"useless, never will happen in lore lines that are unnecessary and seperated from champion personality.\"\n\nIf it not is how champion would speak in lore, please don't use them in special interactions.\n\nJoke lines are here for a reason.","replies":[{"poster":"aw beans","date":"2018-06-14T20:41:58.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I disagree that Aatrox's interactions aren't lore friendly.

Being much more prideful and coming across even as cocky makes these lines feel real to me. I'll admit, some of them are a bit off (any time he says edgy EHHHH) but I like a lot of them. Of course that's just how I feel about it.\n\nI feel the funny side adds to the character, giving him more depth and realism than JUST the one-sided aspect of being this betrayed warmongering god killer.\n\nAlso just a side note, characters like morde already have joke lines (that aren't there jokes)\nie \"You only need to click once fool\"\nThat is obviously something that would NEVER be said (maaaaybeeee in old summoner lore, but still) by Mordekaiser, but its a good interaction and it adds to the enjoyment of the character for a little of people","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2018-06-14T20:50:43.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"But jokes make me take them less serious, and when it happens, It butchers the \"murder machine\" for me.\n\nJokes on some champions of course give the depth and realism, but Aatrox is not one of them IMO.
