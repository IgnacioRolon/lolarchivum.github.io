It seems like it would be a SUPER long stretch between the marksman, which will most likely come out Late September-Early/Mid October, sometime during the Fall, and Fiddle/Voli, who are slated to come out in 2020.  If there aren't any other champs/VGUs coming inbetween, is Fiddle going to come out early, perhaps sometime around December of this year or early January?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LH2RN2P2","date":"2019-07-02T21:42:23.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are Fiddle and Voli the next reworks coming out after Pantheon?

Again, compare that to Tristana who has explosions in the background. It’s an action shot, she just blew something up and she just rocket jump away. You can see the trail. It’s interesting too.\n\nHere it just feels weird.
