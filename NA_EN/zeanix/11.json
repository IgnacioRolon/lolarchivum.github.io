Why is that?","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"After looking at he older skin for the Ezreal update, I gotta say, you guys didn&rsquo;t really put much effort into them. I don&rsquo;t play Ezreal but looking at the old skins, there isn&rsquo;t much love put into them and I kinda feel sorry for Ezreal mains. There&rsquo;s going to be comments saying &ldquo;it&rsquo;s pbe, it&rsquo;s going to change&rdquo; but there is such a high chance that it won&rsquo;t. I just hope this becomes big and riot will actually change them. \n\n\nFrosted Ezreal would&rsquo;ve had such great frosty effects on them, but instead uses Base Effects.\nStriker Ezreal&rsquo;s new W should&rsquo;ve used a soccer ball and should&rsquo;ve had an kicking animation. \nNottingham Ezreal ult should&rsquo;ve had a Brown/Nature-ish green bow instead of blue to represent old school/fantasy genres.\nAnything before Debonair/Ace of Spades (don&rsquo;t know which came first) should&rsquo;ve had at least something unique other than their joke. \n\nIf you look at newer reworks, like say the {{champion:20}} rework. Each skin has a unique Snowball, Grungy Nunu and Willump has a Toy Ball, Demolisher has a metal ball and TPA has their logo.\n\nAll Star {{champion:84}}  shuriken is a soccer ball with kunai’s and Stinger changed her passive to yellow. \n\nIt&rsquo;s these little things that make it fun and awesome to use these skins and I hope these changes come through and I really like the Ezreal update too.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention about Pulsefire Ezreal, which for me I think is a successful rework skin. Looking at the little touches like his recall is what adds some ‘spicyness’ Into this skin. If you put much love and effort into Pulsefire, you have to put much love and effort into his other old skins too.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-09-26T12:39:02.750+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason is likely that Ezreal just has a ton of skins,with freaking 11 skins(including an ultimate one).\nThis means that they had to put much more work into his skins than they had for the previous VGUs.","replies":[{"poster":"Zeanix","date":"2018-09-26T13:09:02.013+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess that would make sense.

That being said, it's going to be released early next year but that's still going to be a lot of skins being reworked. \n\nHalf of Ezreal's skins are real old, and like what they did with {{champion:20}} and {{champion:84}}, their 520 skins have some unique VFX. The other half are more recent and modern which I understand took more time.
