The execution of the skin is vital for it to work imo. This skin design however is just so out of a place, even for a corrupted guardian. I saw her as an actual Star Guardian, I don’t see her “fighting” the Star Guardians. I see her as a messenger for the First Light, like how she’s the pretty much the messenger for  Targon.

Instead we got Zoe, a champion that we don’t see as a villain of this skin line.\n\nLike if it was Dark Star Zoe, I wouldn’t mind it one bit. \nBack when Zoe was released, I remember riot said that they were planning on Star Guardian as here release skin too. People did want a Star Guardian skin for her and there was even nice fan art for it as well. \nBut her design here and her place in the skin line as a sort of a bad guy isn’t the best option here. \nI know the Star Guardian lore isn’t even out yet (or nor if there will be lore for this year since project didn’t have any) but again, it just felt off.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2019-08-26T22:30:37.223+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zeanix,realm=OCE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=phbFEpU9,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2019-08-26T21:56:35.292+0000)\n>\n> I know there are a lot of champions with Dark Skins that are good guys, like Noxus Poppy and Dark star Karma.

But regarless of that, Zoe is far from being percieved as an \"heroic\" character, i mean, she is a trickster that basically killed a bunch of innocent guards in the lore with no problem, and a lot of users in game see her as an annoying character to deal with it in game.\n\nSure, she looks out of place in comparison with the Star Guardians, but that is because she is something totally different from the rest of them. A good comparison between the \"evil\" star guardians and the \"good\" ones is the Arcade Skin Line, where the \"evil\" Battle Boss skins dont look like the \"good\" Arcade skins.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TStrm LastCaress","date":"2019-08-26T22:57:48.036+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because 1350 rp skins dont change voice lines. so Zoe will now be skipping around cheering about mooncakes while trying to Corrupt all the Star Guardians. its the reason Jinx got the Legendary when it was her turn. you can't have a happy go lucky team witha  murderous sociopath on the team.

From what I've heard (second-hand, so not completely accurate) she herself is also a corrupted Star Guardian that lost her old team and is now obsessed with gaining \"sisters\"...which she unfortunately does by corrupting them. Sure, she is the antagonist, but she's much more chaotic neutral like she is in her original Runeterran form; it just so happens her chaotic, self-serving behavior is directly antagonistic to heroes, in this case. It was an unexpected choice, but I think it works ok.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2019-08-28T00:07:48.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the idea for it was that the antagonists are corrupted star guardians.\nZoe being the aspect of change, is actually really fitting for an antagonist who corrupts others(changing them from light to dark, just like the twilight) and with her insane morality and lack of understanding, she can easily fill the role of a villain, just as well as a hero.\n\nRakan and Xayah are a bit more odd, I haven't heard their voice overs, but they do fit in a way, since they are rebels in their original lore, that try to change the system and thats pretty much what they are doing here too.\nThey rebel against the great star and want to kill the star guardians, so that they can be reborn just like them(I at least know that they have some lines talking about how they \"died\").\nSo essentially they are agents of \"change\" both in their regular lore, as well as the star guardian lore.\nAlso I kinda get team rocket vibes from them, Riot likely wanted a villainous duo, so using the duo-champs for that is kinda fitting.\n\n\nHeck even Neeko kinda fits. In her regular lore she lost her home and is now trying to fit in/create her own tribe for those who don't fit into the society, this actually translates fairly well to the star guardians, where she lost her original team and got tainted by the darkness, thus not fitting with the other star guardians, but also not fitting with the evil guardians. Her touch of corrution can also explain why she is so weird compared to the others.\n\n\nSo while I'm not a big fan of these skins, I do think they were pretty much perfect for what riot was going for.\nAlso keep in mind that just because Zoe is the one corrupting others, doesn't mean that she is the big bad for the entire series, after all there had to be something that corrupted her first.\n\nEDIT:\nAlso I feel like the corrupted guardians should get their own name, like Night guardians, to differentiate them from the regular ones.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2019-08-28T00:08:56.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that they had plenty of more upfront and obvious villain choices.
