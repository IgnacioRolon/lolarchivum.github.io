For instance, I thought it was really neat that Karma's voice actress mentioned ages ago that she was trying to channel Storm from the 90s cartoons and Gaia from Captain Planet when she was doing the voice for Karma. That kinda stuff is really fun to hear.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2018-07-12T14:35:18.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have a feeling certain champions and Regions require a lot more work and inspiration to get their music just right.Freljord is one of them! the themes are just so damn beautiful.","replies":[]}]}
