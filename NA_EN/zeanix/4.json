But this one has got me so excited for it! I&#039;m genuinely interested about Ornn and I don&#039;t even play tank! And don&#039;t get me started on the Star Guardian event because omg I&#039;m dying. They made the star guardians even better and the new game mode looks just as amazing and spectacular. Congratulations Riot! I really can&#039;t wait for 2 weeks for it!","replies":[{"poster":"Epicurus","date":"2017-08-09T07:12:03.231+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad someone is happy about the new Star Guardians.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-08-10T18:31:30.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"h y p e !\n\nWho's your favorite Star Guardian? \n\n*By the way, I know you'd mentioned two weeks, but as a fair warning, the Star Guardian skins won't be out until September 7th!*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2017-08-09T07:37:39.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"they do look good but that {{champion:16}} SG ! such hair such colors! SO GREAT!\n\ni dont know if its because i love Soraka or the fact that being a star guardian just suits the star child, but her outfit just stands out among all other star guardians (to me personally at least) before this i use to think that about Janna's skin but Soraka stole that torch from her!\n\ndont get me wrong MF and syndra,etc, definitely look good as well just not as much!","replies":[]}]}
