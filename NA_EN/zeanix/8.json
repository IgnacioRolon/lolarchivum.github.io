Even if its based on her story/bio is about destroying something, it would still be poor, giving that she’s just doing a fashion pose, where others like Tris or Jinx splash arts feel much more alive, and they’re pretty much explosive characters.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2019-06-07T22:04:03.636+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking at her ability preview and her quotes, the explosion is there because she is arrogant show-off that wants to display how she's better.

MAde her hair look more tribal or maybe even shaved her entire head?\n\nI think you watched Black Panther one too many times.\nShe is a self-titled Empress, as per Reav3's confirmation. And it is proven yet again that you should keep speculation as speculation and wait for more official information and then pass your judgement. What we instead get every time is people treating speculations and first looks as basis for their entire religions on how the current design (with nothing else revealed yet) failed in some way because they didn't hit the right subjective notes in every person's imagination.\n\nWhether you agree on her design or not, is irrelevant.\nYou're hitting that logical fallacy of judging a book by it's cover. You can't know what the book is even about simply by looking at the color of its cover pages or the title, if it's merely a teaser.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2019-06-08T01:00:16.945+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Her design is painfully generic. Even if the \"inside of the book\" is better than its \"cover\", that doesn't solve *this* point. In fact, if she has a super-original and totally unexpected back story, that would even make the generic visual design even more painful in contrast.\n\nThis has nothing to do with Black Panther. It's about not repeating yourself when you have 140+ champs already.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2019-06-08T09:34:14.390+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if it's generic, so what?\nI like it. There's no rule of thumb that says a character's design has to poke your eyes out on the account of how unique it is, so alien and disjointed from this universe that you literally cannot look away.\n\nHere's the thing:\nPeople reacted as expected when Qiyana was shown some form of dashes, invis or stuns based on her elements. They were not pleased that one more champ gets to join \"an overloaded kit\" club, especially when she's an AD assassin -  even if the trailer doesn't showcase her actual CDs, resource management, skill floor and ceiling, itemization, a unique mechanic, etc. What i can gather from all of this is that they just want a traditional, no BS champion like Ashe or Garen. Flat and predictable gameplay. They don't want innovation.\n\nThe same thing happened with Pyke.\nDesign was pretty cool and creepy and yet his gameplay was again criticized because Riot dared to make an Assassin support champion so that there's more variety of gameplay when you get Autofilled. Just as much as Kindred was the first jungle Marksmen. \n\nFrom a character design standpoint, they want the opposite!\nThe gameplay can't distinguish itself from the rest of 140+ champions and can't be unique because \"muh counterplay\" while the character itself can't even be human-like because there's too much of them, we need a floating torso with its limbs flailing around disjointed because \"muh uniqueness\".\n\nI prefer my female champions good looking to some degree.\nThey don't have to me swimsuit models. But that kind of attractiveness married with some form of exploration in terms of design (like Zyra, for example), is good. Jinx is also attractive in her own way + her whole attitude on making things explode. \n\nI like Illao's design as well. She's a favorite champion of mine in terms of gameplay.\nI'm not too fond of bodybuilder women physiques but i don't think her gameplay would've been projected very well on a body similar to Syndra's, for example. Oh, and we do have a \"sexy\" cultist too - LeBlanc.\n\nI'm fine with Riot breaking the mold on occasion.\nBut i don't want it forcefully broken just for the sake of champion uniqueness diversity.\nIf it makes sense, go for it. If not, stick to what works.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ChaosReyn","date":"2019-06-08T01:24:21.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean...it almost fits.\n\nThe hairstyle is a blatantly out of place piece...but it's a mockery of the old English white wigs of the nobles (some of which traveled to the newfound Americas to eventually rebel against their own country and start their own) and the rest of her is clearly inspired by such Native American fashions of Mayans or Aztecs. Considering it all, I'll go with Aztecs - the most powerful of them, and the most arrogant by far. Her arrogance is that of an Aztec ruler - she thinks she's all powerful, and deserves more. I'd damn near argue the headwear she has is *meant* to be a mockery.
