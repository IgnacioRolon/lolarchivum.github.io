The strange thing is game shows that our ping is always around 30ms, but we just couldn't move. Anyone knows why?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-15T17:12:58.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be having a poor connection issue or packet loss that's causing this problem, so you can't communicate what you're doing to the game server.

Now I gets a average of around 50 packets loss per min, which is really bad cos I can't control my champ. Btw my friend just lost a rank game by it, feels bad. The Ping is usually stable in around 25 - 50 ms which is ok.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-16T00:30:25.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update!  So the ping is okay, but you have packet loss.  In this case, either your network is having issues locally holding a connection to the game servers or your ISP has changed in the way it routes there.  As a first step, try the entirety of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to rule out any possibilities with local issues.  Test it in custom games and me know what happens!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
