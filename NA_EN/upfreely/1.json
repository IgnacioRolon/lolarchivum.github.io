Not trying to slam you, just pointing out that if a player is going to buy an item, they are probably going to get it no matter what. The real decision is usually not how much something gives, but how much it gives compared to other items.\n\nbut, everybody loves information, and I don't see a reason not to add it :D","replies":[{"poster":"Sockenfreack","date":"2015-05-04T17:59:28.613+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I see what you are getting at.

There is no world where that information would not be more helpful than simply knowing the % increase.  \n\nRight now, pretty much any % stat increase given in game is worthless information.  All you know is it's making you move more quickly or attack faster.  You don't know by how much so you don't know how close it will bring you to the caps which means you have to go into the game already having done the calculations.  I don't want to have to keep a % move-speed cheat sheet when Riot could VERY EASILY provide that information for us in a tool-tip.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gavran","date":"2015-05-04T21:21:35.593+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They'd better make sure it doesn't factor in Homeguard though. :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-05-05T03:17:59.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All the other listings change dynamically based on changes in your max health or whatever.

That is useful to know because there aren't many abilities that change max health. Only Renekton, Nasus, Gnar and Lulu can change maximum health (I think). Compare that to the number of speed-boosts and slows in the game, the more complicated way in which they stack and the soft cap the stat has and the usefulness of the knowledge drops dramatically.","replies":[{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-05-06T05:02:11.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except, by that argument, there is no point in showing us movement speed in the game AT ALL, but they do.","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-05-06T13:22:47.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting.

The purpose of that information is having the ability to compare yourself to your opponent.  If you clicked on that ulted Yi and realized he moved X speed faster than you, how much is getting this Statikk Shiv from the shop going to help?  Okay, that's an extreme situation where the answer is probably more obvious--not much.  But there are plenty of scenarios in which knowing that information can be helpful in informing your decisions.  It is the same as being able to see AD and AP.  Now, we are expected, as players, to be able to meet the burden of knowledge ourselves by knowing our opponent's champion well enough to interpret that information, but the information itself is, and should be, provided.  What we do with it is a matter of strategy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-05-04T17:58:15.162+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"In addition to this, make it so that the character stat window (default hotkey C) shows your whole % bonus AS, or make a separate stat slot for % bonus AS.
