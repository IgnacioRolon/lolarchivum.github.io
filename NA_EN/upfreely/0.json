Mordekaiser's W is his primary defense mechanism aside from his passive which is conditional, reliant on enemy creeps & positioning to get the best out of it. {{champion:92}} gets a shield with no condition + mobility + CC to deter the squishy factor.

Lifesteal isn't for facetanking unless you're stacking it or other healing sources on a grand level (IE: Aatrox levels), and even then you have to be able to actually hit for it to matter at all. It helps, but it makes you no more of a tank than an AD Carry. Morde is objectively better at taking damage. Plus if both champions get CC'd, Morde WILL tank that damage better, there are no ifs, ands or butts unless Riven is building so tanky that she does negligible damage for her assigned role, there's not even a case to be made for Riven in that discussion.\n\nRiven is annoying, but she isn't the end-all be-all champion everyone wants to claim she is. She's great in pubs. She's a pubstomper - you mostly play in pubs, so you most likely get stomped by her. Most of us do. That's what the champion does. Incidentally, she doesn't seem to see a lot of tournament play... I wonder why? If she's so broken and cancerous as you claim, then surely her strength must transcend only pubs and be able to sustain her broken play outside of a brief window of time where she went mid, right? \n\nOh, she doesn't? She's just a pubstomper that can be easily dealt with at the level where it counts? Like Necrophos who had 60% win rate in pubs for months straight but was NEVER picked in tournaments before his buffs because he was easily dealt with where it mattered? \n\nOh, okay. So cancerous. \n\nPoint being: Riven isn't broken, she's just hilariously strong in uncoordinated playing environments. And if you pick in such a way that something like a Riven counterpick is able to bring your whole team to its knees, then, well, welcome to counter-picking. If you're gonna play MOBAs, then get used to it and quit crying if the same thing you can do is used against you to also staggering effect. And if they first-picked Riven and you had all the opportunity in the world to counter it, and she STILL rolls you, then well, I got some bad news for you and your allies.\n\nUnrelated (but totally related), my list of words I hate seeing used because people have overused them so much that they've become near-meaningless and completely grating words: \"Toxic\", \"cancer,\" \"sheep.\" There's probably more but I haven't visited this cesspool recently enough to have them in my immediate memory.","replies":[{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-06-10T17:46:20.528+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really? Is that why they recently nerfed her movespeed and ult missile speed? Because she's unfit to play in tourneys? Thank god, I thought tourney play was all that mattered for a moment. She doesn't have to be nerfed because she's competitively dominant, being dumb to play against is an entirely valid reason to tweak a champion.\n\nMorde and Riven have very similar stats, in fact Riven has higher base defenses; HP: 558 -> 2020 VS Morde's 555 -> 1915. Morde has 24.9 -> 84.4 armor while she has 24.4 -> 78.8 armor. Overall, Riven is actually more tanky when CC'd so there is that fallacy.\n\nI'm not giving her the perfect scenario, most CC in the game is skillshot/delay based while her kit excels at avoiding those. ADCs don't have splash lifesteal nor natural shields and untapped mobility to lifesteal through creeps ASAP to get back in; completely different scenario. I doubt you've witnessed many ADCs using lifesteal + {{item:3085}}, it's quite ridiculous healing actually; could heal to full in ~5 seconds. Hydra gives comparable healing.\n\nTo suggest counterpicking is only valid when said champion has a lot of counters, Riven does not have a lot of counters actually. Most of them are risky and work halfway such as beat her early lose late {{champion:98}} or beat her late get smashed early {{champion:24}} or deal with her but she'll go wreck your team/split elsewhere {{champion:75}} all while having that your champion is immobile, vulnerable to ganks while she has little to no risk; playing against her is extremely frustrating partly because she has all the tools to be successful in any given matchup while your \"counterpick\" champion has a lot of limitation. That should say a lot about her kit and balance state, even if numerically and in terms of winrate she is balanced; she should have more defined weaknesses for players to exploit as such with the majority of champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2015-06-10T21:10:22.801+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"For Riven to be tankier in the situation you laid out \"Hydra + shield rotations\" means Morde also had time to take action and had items of his own. Morde doesn't build \"squishy at first, then a tanky item or two,\" he builds \"a splash of defense and offense outright then some pure damage\" meaning in that same scenario unless Riven is actively hitting someone that Morde will outright tank more damage. Again, there isn't an argument to be made. Their base stats are a factor, but not the whole story. Morde will never be less tanky than Riven - period. \n\nRiven also has plenty of counters. She also has teamwide strategy counters. And I have seen an ADC with lifesteal + Runaan's, but you know what that only helps with? Enemies that are bunched up. Same for Hydra. Now we've also put an enemy positioning requirement on her survivability in addition to her own items, abilities and self-positioning. To that end, Mordekaiser again takes the tanky cake of the two because he has less of a requirement for their positioning. He didn't hit 3 with his E? Oh well, he still got a large shield from it. His didn't hit 2 with his Q? His enemy took bonus damage and Morde still got a large shield. They're constantly next to him? They're constantly giving him shield - small amounts to be sure, but it's still constantly being added. Then there's his ult for a large injection of shield straight to Mordekaiser. Riven has... her auto-attacks for life-steal, a shield-dash, and... that's mostly it. \n\nAlso, saying she's no-risk is pretty... well, it's pretty damn wrong. Her risk is exactly why she isn't picked in tournament play. In many lanes she loses hard or wins hard. There is no going even, and in a 2v1 scenario, which is easy for an enemy team to put up, she WILL lose that lane. \"But what if the jungler ganks for her?\" They have a jungler, too. \n\nRiven is very risky, the problem is that in pubs very few people put her into a stressful enough position that her risk matters. Again, she's a pub-stomper. Why should I care what a pub-stomper can do? Have you ever picked a Nasus into her? She lost all kill potential then and there. Rumble top? Now she can't even farm safely, AND Rumble can take on a 2v1 in competitive play. Not only that, but Rumble scales hard as well, and can be a teamfight monster. To say she has little-to-no risk means to ignore gameplay elements outright to make your argument sound better. \n\nAnd since it's not impossible to put a Riven behind, you've probably seen a scenario where she makes a comeback later on, right? Y'know, those exact same comebacks pretty much everyone can do, but with even less risk than her because they don't all have to play like as a mediocre-damage melee assassin with telegraphed entry when they're behind. And yes, when she is behind her damage is mediocre. To also bring up those moments where she makes that comeback ignores the many, many other times where she is unable to make that comeback and remains shut-out and shutdown. \n\nRiven has risk, but very few people put her in a situation to abuse it. Riven is not tanky, she is barely scraping by unless she's ahead - but then she's ahead, so what did you expect? Riven is not adverse to risk-taking by nature of her kit, because her kit encourages her to be in risky situations in the first place. She has her counters, you and your allies need to work together against her. Why? Because she's part of their team, and you should all be working together against their whole team. Countering one champion may not be as simple as countering another. Riven simply requires more teamplay.
