It's really just his passive and his bombs that keep him from being a major contender. \n\nThe first thing players need to know is that his bombs are no longer what makes Zilean a good pick. People need to realize his true strength is getting people to and from places with his 99% haste/slow on a 3 second cooldown(with max CDR).\n\nI rarely put more points into his bombs after level 1 because his damage isn't reliable or even very good. Instead I max everything else. Q W Q is dead and doesn't work. Don't even waste the mana trying. E Q W Q works wonders. Perma slow and stuns.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lime Josh","date":"2015-04-12T06:25:02.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"needs some love\" he just got a rework wtf else you want? some champions haven't been touched in years so let them have a taste before others get 2nds","replies":[{"poster":"TheRakkun","date":"2015-04-12T12:51:48.324+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"A rework which has but him at the lowest winrate in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-12T14:59:17.867+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope..
