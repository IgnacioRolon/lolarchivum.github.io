I know a lot of questions are being asked, and it's because our team won't recover an account unless they are absolutely sure it's being returned to the owner.  Even if you didn't make it this time, it's totally fine to try again!  Just fill out another [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) and our account team will be happy to investigate further.  Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Taxi","date":"2017-07-27T20:51:54.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i did man , i legit give him all the information , he dont want to recover my account because i dont have any payment proof while i never purchased RP , thats the problem , can you please help me to recover it , i tried really hard , i mean like i was siting all day long waiting for the answer just to recover my account ,  i will truly appreciate any help","replies":[]}]}]}
