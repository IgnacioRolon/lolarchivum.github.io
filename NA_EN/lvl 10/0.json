I think around ~10-15 minutes into the game. There&#039;s no warning, no freezing, or strange sounds. It just suddenly says &quot;League of Legends has stopped working&quot; then gives the option to Close the Program or Check online for solutions and close the program. And its extremely sudden. It has happened multiple times the past few days and today it happened twice in a row..in ranked games. Both times it cost me my mid tower - the second time it actually got me killed. (I lost those games too :/ ). I can get back in the game fine, and it seems to work okay, but is there a root cause of this? Has anyone else experienced this.\r\n\r\nFYI: Nvidia drivers up to date. Fking new geforce experience is a pain in the ass.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-21T16:50:29.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At first glance I thought there may have been a connection problem, but this sounds more like something is failing to render the game properly and causing it to crash.
