The loading screen is just that, when the load actually starts to load. If it tried to load stuff during the client, you'd run into cases where it loads the wrong things after someone changes champions or the client itself gets slowed down because everyone is loading the game files while trying to choose champions and interact with each other. Alt tabbing *may* also interrupt the loading screen, but it doesn't happen every time. It's a little hiccup that can happen with anything while bridging connections.\n\nUninstalling and reinstalling is a bit different from the client repairs in the sense that the repair is scanning for damaged or missing files, while the repair is doing a clean sweep of everything to make sure it hits any possible oddities.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShadowScorpionX","date":"2017-05-13T02:09:20.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=zNBaaFmy,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2017-05-13T01:40:56.998+0000)\n>\n> On the loading screen, the game is trying to load all the assets and make connections to the game server.
