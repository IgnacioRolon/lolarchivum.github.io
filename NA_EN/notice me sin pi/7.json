But those calls are easier to make because the map is usually open and you have more time. During the early game, you have very little time to make a play because staying in the lane just makes you scale very easily at this point. So before lvl 6, it's mostly everyone for themselves where a jungle gank can happen, but you shouldn't rely on it, unless they announced it already. Midlaner might roam once lvl 6 and botlane may come mid one they killed the turret. Top lane can tp gank bot after 6 if bot warded deep enough. But that's about it. There's no crazy Aurelion sol mid ganking bot at lvl 1 (pretty sure that does happen in bronze, though).\n\nSo what I'm saying is, if you pick MF to have lane pressure, the only thing you're going to do is attract enemy jungler and probably die. Your other laners and/or jungler will most likely not adapt to your playstyle because they never have played with MF support before. That's why meta picks are so convenient. Your team will know how to play with that champ (however, the opponents will also know how to play against them). If you have a premade adc+supp then maybe you can pull this off successfully. It's much like a trundle support really that needs a lot of practise from a premade bottom lane. Never play this as a soloQer, not even in diamond.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"bbquesauce","date":"2016-10-24T15:52:46.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless he is silver in premade groups, I wouldn't necessarily say he's a silver player, either.

Maybe she is just good against all of the midrange mages that go bot like annie, brand, anivia, etc.\n\nFor example, trundle isn't really a traditional support champion but he does really well against all of the melee supports and he does alright against the peel supports if he gets picked into that matchup.\n\nIt could be that MF support is actually good but no one has ever really given it much attention so far. Morgana went largely un-thought of for the longest time and was considered to be a midlane champion until one day people decided she countered botlane meta really well.\n\nThat being said I am not looking forward to the wave of MF supports that have no idea what they are doing :\\","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-10-22T20:39:06.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes all of this is true... and people dont understand why team comps and champ picks work in pro play but they will try the champ and think it is viable cuz X pro did it and fail and not understand why....\n\nalso part of it is they are PROS the .001% best players and most talented people at this game and its more then getting good at mechanics and knowing the complexity of the game. just like i cant run a 4.4 40yrd dash or throw a football 65 yrs downfield on a rope... i understand all the complexities of football i just dont have the talent to be a pro football player.","replies":[]}]}
