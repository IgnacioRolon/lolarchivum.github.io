And why do you assume any kind of correlation between damage done and LP when the changes are 2 points but the damage done in one game is 3 times the amount of a different game? Don't you think that in 6 seasons of this game more support mains wouldn't notice significant differences in LP gains if damage done mattered?","replies":[{"poster":"notice me Sin pi","date":"2016-09-25T22:28:56.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Flaherty","date":"2016-09-25T19:07:35.780+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"LP gains have literally nothing to do with score in a game. How much you earn/lose depends on how often you win or lose and your MMR, that's why if you win a huge amount you start getting more LP per win and if you lose a lot more than you win you gain very little LP per win until you win rate gets closer to 50%","replies":[{"poster":"notice me Sin pi","date":"2016-09-25T19:18:56.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"*edit: score of 5/11/12 with 25k damage to champions, score of 5/2/31 with 8k damage to champions","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2016-09-25T19:06:23.181+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on your MMR and the MMR of the people you're playing against.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-25T19:08:55.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I..
