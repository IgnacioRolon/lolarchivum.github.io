It wont make her capable of viktor level of waveclear, but it would help her waveclear go on par with other mages such as veigar, zoe, cassiopeia, and ziggs on waveclear. ~~Bonus points if her passive induces crit for the crit animation.~~\n\nAnd compensation-nerf for that buff by nerfing E base damage. If lux can have a source of waveclear aside from E, then her E base damage wouldn&#039;t have to be as powerful. With reduced base damage on E, she would be less attractive for support role since her support laning power comes mostly from E poke damage.\n\nEDIT: i thought that even just a while ago most people were opposed to lux being viable at support role. It appears im wrong about that","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-05T21:42:25.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do we want to push Lux out of support?\n\nShe is a pretty mediocre support currently, the goal with making her ult CDR work on assists is to improve that.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaìju","date":"2018-04-06T01:49:34.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It isn't fun to play immobile carries against her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"notice me Sin pi","date":"2018-04-05T21:53:44.159+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"we want to push Lux out of support role cuz\n1. circlejerk?\n2. she might get trashed to botlane like {{champion:143}} , and lux players don't want that\n\nthat's all I can think of but im not really sure myself","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-04-06T01:29:11.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and why the fuck would we want to push her out of support?","replies":[{"poster":"notice me Sin pi","date":"2018-04-06T02:39:15.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cuz she's gonna get zyra'd at some point if made viable in support role? i was certain that was the stigma even just a while ago","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-04-06T02:43:20.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=notice me Sin pi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bvRcmYX1,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-04-06T02:39:15.389+0000)\n>\n> cuz she&#x27;s gonna get zyra&#x27;d at some point if made viable in support role? i was certain that was the stigma even just a while ago\n\nlux is a great support if pick her into the proper matchups\n\ni mean if u peick her into people like {{champion:412}} {{champion:89}}  or {{champion:53}}  you are ganna get fucked. but as long as u see what they pick beforehand. and it is safe to pick her into it.. she does fantastic","replies":[{"poster":"notice me Sin pi","date":"2018-04-06T13:50:43.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally when I play lux supp myself, I dont really have problem with thresh&blitz in my elo.
