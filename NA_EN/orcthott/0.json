They are watching us play, watching chat logs, taking note of our opinions and making changes based  on that.\r\n\r\nMake no mistake, your time and opinions are worth money to these companies and Riot owe us all compensation.\r\n\r\nDo not let this become the norm for video game testing.  We as consumers deserve better.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nAnd any ideas re course of action - boycott, protest, legal action if they don&#039;t remove the feature and get it properly tested by staff under fair contracts etc.  \r\n\r\nI&#039;d be open to helping to organize it.","replies":[]}
