With rank 5 Q and some CDR, your Q has around a 2 second cooldown, and that makes it a lot harder to have pressure against Orianna. Like, if you use your Q and it has a 5 second cooldown, that is a 5 second window that people can take advantage of when fighting you. But it's a lot harder for people to use a 2 second window. Does that make sense?\n\nPoints in W give 45 additional damage, while points in Q only give 30. So maxing W gives better burst damage, but maxing Q gives you significantly stronger sustained damage and flexibility managing your ball.\n\nAt level 2, I almost always have Q + E. At level 3, I like taking a second point in Q. Since ranking up Q doesn't increase the mana cost, it gives the spell very mana-efficient damage. \n\nThough taking W at level 3 is the safer option if you're at risk of getting ganked, or if you've been trading with your lane opponent a lot and an all-in might happen.\n\nI think the only time you should max W or E before Q is if you're playing Orianna as support. Though in some situations, taking a second point in W early in the game isn't a bad idea. For example, if you take Q level 1 + W level 2 and whittle your opponent's health down, you could put a second point in W at level 3 and catch the opponent off guard with its bursty damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Doominator10","date":"2016-03-16T16:55:28.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting.

The mana is better but I can only imagine it doesn't trade as well compared to just poke.

Thanks for taking time out to talk to us! I have like a bunch of questions but I'll just do my top 5.\n(I'm trying to avoid questions that you've already answered but forgive me if I ask again without realizing it.)\n\n1. Have you ever tried support Orianna? If so, did you like it? Why or why not?\n2. What do you believe is the hardest combo to pull off as Orianna (when you're by yourself)? Also, why do you believe this is the hardest combo?\n3. When I played Orianna for the first time, I knew her playstyle revolves around her ball but it was hard for me to position my ball in a good place and keep the enemies on their toes. Besides doing flash combos, what are other ways you can position her ball to your advantage and also keep the enemies on their toes and/or unsuspecting of what you'll do next?\n4. Orianna is notorious for her ult (especially with a Yasuo on her team.) But what do you do if the enemy ends up avoiding your Shockwave? How would you make the best from that situation?\n5. What is a thing about Orianna that not a lot of people know that actually affects her playstyle quite a lot?\n\n*BONUS QUESTION!!!*\nWhat is one thing you'll never get tired of no matter how many times you play Orianna?","replies":[{"poster":"Plasma Lemon","date":"2016-03-15T21:50:49.961+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. I've tried it a few times. It can work, but I think there are better options to pick as support in most situations. Personally I don't like it, because I feel Orianna is pretty weak when under-leveled and without items, which she would usually be as support.\n\n2. Hmm I'm not sure. I think in general it's more difficult to pull off good ults with the ball on yourself (with or without flashing) \n\n3. So if the ball's on you and you target to Q somewhere out of your range, you'll walk forward until you're in range and use Q as soon as you're in range to use it. The ball will then spend a bit of time traveling before reaching where you targeted. But if you stay within the ball's range and Q the same location, the spell hits immediately since the ball doesn't have to travel. Try to take advantage of that. Keep the ball in front of yourself so that, if you try to Q someone in front of you, the ball will be closer to its destination at the start, and will reach its destination faster.\n\n4. If your team needs your ult in order to win teamfights, and you miss it, then it would be best for your team to try to kite back and not let the enemy team engage, and wait for your ult to come back up. However, Orianna can still have a strong impact without her ult. If you don't have your ult up, then try to stick close to your adc and play more defensively. \n\n5. Managing mana, at all points of the game. Playing Orianna with Athenes + Blue buff  or with RoA/tear very different from playing her with just Morello and no buffs. \n\nBonus: Engaging on my lane opponent as they walk up to get a cs and killing them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ScoRcH420","date":"2016-03-16T06:18:40.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have two questions.\n\n1.

You should avoid hitting max CDR with your items, because if you have max CDR, you can't take advantage of the CDR that blue buff gives if you happen to get a blue buff.\n\n2.

I am very proud of my Orianna play and am always looking to improve, and now I finally have a chance to ask one of the best some questions ! \n\n\n1. One of my hardest matchups tends to be Leblanc. Generally speaking, if the Leblanc is not too experienced I can handle it well and usually win lane. However, once I face a Leblanc that plays at a higher level I start to find some difficulties and the lane go often go either way depending on how tricky she is. Do you have any basic or advanced tips for surviving this lane?\n\n2. Building off of that, I tend to ping MIA like a mad man when a laner leaves and opt instead to farm. I know that this is not optimal, but I also know that I can personally have a greater impact in teamfights if I can maintain gold and my teammates follow my pings. Of course in solo queue, this is not always the case. Do you have any guidelines for when it's best to roam as Orianna or when it's best to focus on yourself and farm?\n\n3.  I used to always put 2 points into both Q and W pre-6, but since preseason I've been doing 2 points into Q and E. Is there any significant disadvantage to this in your opinion? If so, are there situations where you would recommend it anyway?\n\n4. When running RoA Orianna, I tend to forego either Morello or Athene's and instead use Boots of Lucidity for CDR. I also sometimes run a build which goes Sorc Shoes - Morello/Athene - Lich/Ludens - Lich/Ludens - Deathcap - Void Staff. I really like the movement speed and kiting ability of this build and don't think that it suffers in damage or utility. Do you think that either of these builds have significant disadvantages versus other Orianna builds?\n\n5. Thunderlord's is my favorite mastery ever. I find it to be incredibly troll in how that thunderbolt can deliver truly unexpected damage. You noted in someone else's question that your favorite thing to do was kill a laner as they move up to take some cs. My favorite thing, in the same vein, is to hit someone with a Q+W+AA combo when they are low but don't think that I have the expected damage. When in lane, sometimes I try to land only two hit combos to whittle the opponent down, then finish them off with the use of Thunderlord's. Is it better to just simply unleash the full combo whenever I am able to get it off without risking myself?\n\nThank you so much for doing this. I hadn't known about your stream until now and I will definitely be visiting.\n\nEDIT: My own bonus question: What do you feel is the difference between a master Orianna player and someone who's just good with her?","replies":[{"poster":"Plasma Lemon","date":"2016-03-15T23:16:02.280+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. A skilled LeBlanc can be a nightmare to play against. I'm the same as you, I can usually handle laning against her, but I still get beat up sometimes by good LB players. I think the most important thing is to not let her get control of the wave and start zoning you. If you have some minions built up and pushing, shove the next wave and back.\n\n2. Other champs are better at roaming than Orianna is, like TF, Ahri, Fizz, Zed, LeBlanc... If your team has good vision control and your lane opponent can't 1v1 you, then it's usually safe to counter-roam. If you're stronger than your lane opponent, only try to pressure them at their tower if you have vision of all the enemies. Otherwise, it's probably better to shove the wave and roam yourself.\n\nIf it's not safe for you to counter your lane opponent's roaming, then all you can really do is ping mia/spam careful pings along river, and hope that your team keeps your lane opponent in mind. And if they don't, and get killed, and blame you, just know that they have no good reason for blaming you. Hindsight bias... If you expect it to be better not to roam, so you decide not to roam, but as it turns out, your roam would have been better... Well you couldn't have known how things would turn out at the time of the decision.\n\n3. Personally I think at level 5, 3 points in Q, 1 in W and 1 in E generally gives you the best power. W/E give a lot of power at rank 1, while Q isn't really a one point wonder at all.  For example, your rank 1 E gives 10 armor/MR, and additional ranks only increase that by 5. The first point is the most useful. You can't really say the same for Q though.\n\n4. Lucidity boots were pretty good earlier this season, but after getting nerfed, their not nearly as cost-efffcient. \n\nI pick up Ludens after Morello sometimes, because as you mentioned, the movement speed is very nice. Orianna only has 370 movespeed at base + sorcerer shoes, which is pretty low. If I get Ludens, I usually pick up Alacrity enchantment on my boots shortly after.  I don't think Lich Bane is worth building on Ori though.\n\n5. Yeah haha thunderlord's is great. In lane, I often proc it by Q'ing past my lane opponent, self casting E so the ball hits them on its way back to me, and autoing once.  This is a less risky way to proc it, as the shield makes it harder for your opponent to trade back damage. Also, you can do this a lot without going oom.\n\nI try to avoid using my W early on in lane, because it costs a ton of mana.\n\nAlso, that's a good idea, autoing your lane opponent twice, then surprising them with the burst damage from QW + thunderlords. But it's not common for your lane opponent to just let you auto them for free.\n\nBonus: A master Orianna takes full advantage of everything her kit offers. Someone who is only good with Orianna doesn't.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"philimix","date":"2016-03-15T20:34:31.220+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"what are your thoughts about orrianna not being so meta and only mostly played is lcs?","replies":[{"poster":"Plasma Lemon","date":"2016-03-15T21:58:53.108+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Being a very versatile champion, Orianna is almost always viable imo.
