To answer your questions:\n\n1. Actually Vi was in the original cast. Zyra came after!\n2. Maokai is just loveably grumpy and well Ivern creeps me out (his animation is too much like Tallbird from Don't Starve). I definitely think Zyra and Maokai bicker like old friends but have a very strong understanding despite their differences. Zyra would probably find Ivern fascinating but obnoxious. \n3. Oh man, well I've always loved Vi and Ziggs (probably why they're already included). Otherwise it'd probably be Miss Fortune or Katarina!
