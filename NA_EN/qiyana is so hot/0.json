I havent been banned and i play a ton of games and get honor frequently and the level wont budge. There are people on my friends list with less games and less honors then me at honor level 5 which is really strange to me. Can someone help me out with this and tell me whats going on?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-19T20:12:38.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I took a look into this for you, and I wasn't able to see any issues.
