However, anyone who has a close group of friends knows that you can act differently with them because you know their feelings wont get hurt. I mess around with my friends all the time and they know I am joking with them, however the automated system, (or whoever was reading my chat logs,) did not seem to be able to put together the fact that:\r\n1. I was in a 5 man group talking in only team chat.\r\n2. My teammates names where ZGM Heritage, ZGM Pyro, [ZGM] Cherufe, and shosho613WINMODE (no name change)\r\n3. All four of them are in my club and we all use the ZGM tag.\r\n4. If the stats are available you can see that I play around 90% of my games with this group. (+ ZGM Jewpacabra, ZGM Penguin, r3lax) All in ZGM Club.\r\n\r\nI hope this misunderstanding can be resolved. I will post the chat log bellow and a link to the game I played.\r\n\r\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=ZGM+Permabanned# 5th game down\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, hopefully I can get some clarification on this misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I would add the chat log however since I was actually (a little) mad at my friends, because you know how friendships are, there is a lot of personal stuff in there that I don&#039;t think would be proper to post on the boards.\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: I was 14 day banned on this account (and deserved it) around half a year ago, that was my latest behavioral penalty.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-04-06T17:59:56.707+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is not the game that triggered the perma ban.

If someone used a litany of foul words like the OP did, the system probably took note of the game and was waiting for ANY reports simply to trigger a review of the chatlogs. Whether the verdict was rendered by a machine or a human, he got banned because they saw excessive foul/aggressive language and abuse of another player. Although he allegedly said nothing to opposing teams and the full premade situation should be taken into consideration, it's still Riot's game and they have final say in how any two players can treat each other.
