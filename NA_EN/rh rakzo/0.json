Running as admin can be a temporary workaround sometimes, but doesn't resolve the issue for good.  Your best bet is to go over our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to restore access and make sure that the game is allowed to not only launch, but also scan game files.  Hopefully, that will get the issue fixed up!","replies":[]}]}
