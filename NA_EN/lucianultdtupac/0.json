You dont need to talk to these people. Heck there really is no point in it because the whole point of them doing this in the first place is to get a reaction out of you. So why give them what they want? You ignore them and they are either going to stop. Or they will give more evidence of what they are doing thus easier for them to get reported and punished. At the end of the day its just a waste of time. If you want to vent why does it NEED to be in the chat, and not screaming at the screen, or punching a pillow/bag?","replies":[{"poster":"LucianUltdTupac","date":"2017-11-07T23:24:49.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ask myself the same question its harder than it looks when ur a saltl0rd like me","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-11-08T20:01:02.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You already mentioned flaming through your tv where no one can see or hear.

Combine that with the fact that it took a very long time for people with hundreds of CRs to work them all off and you have a recipe for disaster. The current system is in place to encourage people to either reform or get lost faster than the old system ever did, and while it's not perfect it gets the job done. If you can come up with a system that can consistently encourage reform or the removal of chronic problem players at a reasonable rate then please feel free to share it.","replies":[{"poster":"LucianUltdTupac","date":"2017-11-09T03:02:29.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why don't they do what CS:GO does and make a separate queue for people who violate the rules and they can play with other people of their kind.
