Unfortunately, it is difficult to nail down due to the fact that it usually occurs very inconsistently.  \n\nIf this seems to be more consistent for you, we may need to take a deep dive into the R3d Logs (the game logs) to see exactly where the problem occurs.  This may allow us to troubleshoot it further.\n\nTo that end, the next time that this occurs to you, [find the R3d Log](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq7) for this spectated game, and [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so our Tech Team can take a look!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chaoscontrol","date":"2015-01-18T15:26:32.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see any games in pvp.net anymore and when I try to Right-click spectate a friend ill be stuck in the screen till it says it cannot connect","replies":[]},{"poster":"RasCaelestis","date":"2015-01-15T00:32:27.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've not been able to actually spectate a game since yesterday.  Tried multiple times last night and again today.  The game just crashes instantly on the part that normally shows the -VS- screen.  I leave the launcher, then get a black screen and the entire thing stops responding.  This causes me to have to close it manually.  I can play games just fine, but this error happens every time I try to spectate any of my friends or the featured games on the launcher.","replies":[]}]}
