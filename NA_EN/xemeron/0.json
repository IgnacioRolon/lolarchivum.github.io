Without it, he's waiting on Q, because his basic attacks are only used to prep 3 lobster stacks.\n\nYou have to think as a whole what Tahm provides on a consistent basis. There's no point in him treating basic attacks as big dps when, even with his bonus health->damage passive, he isn't threatening enough in fisticuffs. \n\nThink of what any other tank/support does CONSISTENTLY in combat. Leona has a bunch of lockdown on moderately short cooldowns. Naut has more lockdowns and even some damage with w, plus his shield doesn't require him to take damage before being effective. Alistar is old, so his q and w still have longish cooldowns, but he gets immense damage reduction on top of bonus AD to make his attacks hit harder--his heal is meh. Despite not being played much, Taric's passive allows him an opportunity to continually stun, heal and shred enemy armor. Sona has short CD spells, so her power goes without saying. Janna has cc and a shield that lasts for a healthy bit of time, effectively meaning her power is noticed throughout a fight. Soraka has heals for days...\n\nI imagine if you increased the cooldown on Tahm's w, it wouldn't feel like he's eating people enough. That's really what he offers, and I see no reason to remove that from his identity. What else would he be doing if he didn't have a reasonable cooldown on devour? Q doesn't go through other enemy units, and he doesn't have the mobility to guarantee he'll reach his targets. Every time I've played with/against him, he is fairly easy to run away from. If you dodge the Q, he may as well give up the chase.\n\nEDIT: if the damage is too high, then shift the power into better AP scaling so that he gets the damage when he really goes dps. Otherwise, I disagree with increasing the CD of devour.","replies":[{"poster":"Xemeron","date":"2015-07-08T23:04:07.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Loveless,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XuqdKHFO,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2015-07-08T22:18:14.710+0000)\n>\n> [Alot of stuff that actually makes alot of sense]\n\nThe point is: Tham makes the lane ungankable. You will NEVER get the ADC. Maybe you get Tham, but even for that you need to be very lucky. \n\nMy ADC was attacking the enemy tower when I saw the enemy Lee Sin coming, the enemy Thresh hooked him, I ate my ADC, used the bonus Movement speed to get him halfway across the lane, then spat him nearly under our tower, after that I just had to stay between Lee and my Miss Fortune. They hit me a bit, but I am tanky, I can deal with it. \n\nAnd 12 seconds later I could do the same again.","replies":[{"poster":"Partholonian","date":"2015-07-08T23:51:01.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if Lee had kicked you back at the right time he'd have kicked BOTH of you back.  You're lucky he didn't think of that, or wasn't positioned for it, or was pre-6/on CD.\n\nOr, of course, Thresh could have saved the hook to hit you while you were full, and then trapped both of you inside the Box.\n\nPeople aren't used to playing against Tahm yet, but they will be.\n\nISTM a big weakness of ally Devour is that it doubles the effectiveness of most CC.  Not blind and silence because you're doing that to your ally yourself, but things like snares and knockback/up.\n\nP.S. If Lee lands his Q on the ADC and then Tahm eats the ADC, does Lee lose the opportunity to follow up?  Or does it just bring him to Tahm instead, and if so, who takes the Q2 damage?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xemeron","date":"2015-07-08T13:36:16.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Other than that the champ is super made and looks perfectly balanced BTW^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shroom Junkie","date":"2015-07-08T13:46:46.165+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I personally haven't played the PBE, but I made a post like this saying that its almost like Skarner's ult and Zhonya's in one on a really low cooldown and I got downvoted into oblivion.\nsrslytho fuck you g&b -.-","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xemeron","date":"2015-10-16T18:39:57.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just pushing this thread again, seems like, once again, I am proven right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-07-09T01:19:32.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leave what's unique about him fun, nerf his R passive.
