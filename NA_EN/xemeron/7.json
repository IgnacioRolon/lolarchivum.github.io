Sona heals for 165+30% if her target was somehow at 1% health left (110+20% for someone at full health). And it's not 2 targets, it's herself and the most hurt person within range (so it'll auto target a tank at 40% rather than the ADC at 45%...). The shield only affects people really close to her, and lasts 1.5 seconds, which is really really short and hardly ever helps anyone.\n\nSo lets pick someone who isn't the worst at healing, like Nami. Hers heals for 185+30%AP. Only 35 more base healing than Bard. And that's only if she targets an ally first. Plus, it costs 130mana, more than most ults...\n\nBard's shrines are fine.

You get 24% of your mana spawning every 50 sec somewhere on the map, you leave some shrines, you come back with nearly full mana with regen + all the chimes.\n\nAnd late game, yes the healing is mediocre. But it's definitly not the priority.
