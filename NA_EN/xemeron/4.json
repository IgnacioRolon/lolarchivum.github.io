Running down mid lane means they're trying right? \nNice job dodging the question and the whole point of my post.","replies":[{"poster":"AbodyHUN666","date":"2015-09-25T00:34:27.220+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"For doing that people get banned eventually. Flaming at them accomplishes nothing, they just get what they want: attention and dragging you down with them. For the part where you get banned for flaming them, think of it this way: your teammates try their best to ignore the troll, but you are making the whole experience a lot worse by ranting about it. Even in real life we can't properly punish all assholes and pricks, with the anonomity of the internet they have a lot easier time.
