I haven't played in about a month but I just received an email saying I have been permanently banned. So I fired up LoL, patched, and tried to log in. Sure enough, banned. Then I log into the forums here and see my summoner icon is changed. someone stole this account and used some \"3rd party program\". \n\nthis is fucked. I'm going to try and contact support. maybe they can look at the IPs that have logged in or something.","replies":[{"poster":"xKAiiRUx","date":"2017-07-14T02:45:32.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just read there's no way to appeal. This is complete bullshit. Can someone please check the logs as to who accessed my account? Or refund me for all the RP I purchased? I legitimately did not use any 3rd party program nor have I played recently. Just check around the time my summoner Icon was changed. Last one I was using when I played was the One For All icon with like 3 ziggs. I've changed my password. Hopefully I get a response. But knowing Riot, even if I do get a response it will be yet more bs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-14T04:25:24.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and looked into your account for you, and yea I can see where it looks like you might have been hacked.
