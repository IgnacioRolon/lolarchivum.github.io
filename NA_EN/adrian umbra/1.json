At the moment, I personally regard Evelynn's ultimate as one of the weakest in the game, with my reasonings below.\n\nCurrently, her ultimate deals **15/20/25 (+0.01AP) % current health damage**, provides a **30/50/70% slow for 2 seconds**, and grants **150/225/300 shield per champion hit for 6 seconds**, up to a **maximum of 750/1125/1500 points**.  The CD is **150/120/90 seconds**.   Since the ability is divided mainly into three parts, I'll be breaking down her ultimate mainly based around those three.\n\n**Damage**:  Let's get this out of the way right now, 15-25% current health damage is weak, especially for an ultimate.  The idea sounds really cool, having this vision of shredding everyone's health away so that you can come in and clean up, but in practice MR cuts this damage incredibly hard.  A lack of minimum damage means that this ability is the only damage ability in the game that cannot kill a target, even at 1 HP (Proof at bottom).  For an ultimate, this is incredibly unsatisfying to use, as you watch your character deal comparable damage to Mundo's cleaver on over thirty times the cooldown with no possibility to score a kill.  An assassin who cannot kill anything is pointless.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1NlN3ZgByCE?t=1m5s\n\n**Crowd Control (The slow)**: The is the main thing Eve gets out of her ultimate when she hits level 6.  At 30% for two seconds, most champions who provide CC will have outclassed her well before she gets her ultimate, but given her potential to sneak past wards, the lack of power here might be forgivable.  This part of the ability also scales quite well, reaching 70% by the end of the game.  A solid teamfight contribution, though one that's losing more and more relevance due to mobility creep.\n\n**The Shield**: Probably the most out of place aspect of Evelynn's ultimate and the main reason why she's built bruiser rather than full on assassin.  The shield is a solid value, adding up to a good defensive bulwark if you manage to tag most of the enemy team with her ultimate.  However, given that Evelynn is now going to be in the center of a teamfight, well within range of the enemy team who are all informed she's coming, the shield isn't going to mean much unless she builds heavily into resistances, which is the idea behind most of her current builds.  As an ability for an assassin, it just feels out of place and prioritizes using the ultimate on the full enemy team and throwing yourself into the brawl over picking off stragglers and finishing weakened opponents.\n\nOverall, Eve's ultimate dumps a lot of its power into CC and defense, which are really strange places to be pointing an assassin toward.    The ultimate generally feels unrewarding to use, especially from an assassination standpoint.  To top this all off, it's gated in early levels by an incredibly high cooldown, on par with Amumu and Twisted Fate.  Agony's Embrace needs a change if Evelynn's going to become a health assassin once again.\n\n**Some possibilities**: \n1. Either remove the damage completely, make it max health, or make it flat.  Current health damage does absolutely nothing for her and was a pretty strange change in the first place.  The range can be reduced for flat/max damage so that you don't have Eve assassinating people out of nowhere (though I thought that was part of her theme?), but as it stands the damage is consuming power budget without doing anything at all.\n2. Remove or rework the shield.  Thematically, a shield makes very little sense on an assassin of the night who relies on stealth and isolation to rip her foes to shreds and it takes up a huge chunk of her ult's power budget.\n3. Flatten the curve.  Strangely enough for an assassin who focuses heavily on the early game, Agony's Embrace has a huge amount of power in the slow and cooldown invested in lategame.  Adjusting the slow to 40/50/60% instead of 30/50/70% and/or the cooldown from 150/120/90 to 130/120/110 would increase her early game power (emphasizing her strengths) while giving her more appreciable weakness lategame.\n\nDo you guys agree?  Disagree?  Let me know what you think.  Let's see if we can get a Rioter such as @Scarizard or @Gypsylord to lend their thoughts.\n\n**TL;DR: Eve's ult is weak, especially in damage and its long cooldown and doesn't fit her thematically.  Needs some changes, suggestions outlined above.**\n\nEdit: I've been getting a lot of replies saying Eve has more problems than just her ult and that a huge amount of her power budget is in her passive.  I'm looking to fix her ult.  Not Eve as a whole, but her ult.  I realize there are other problems that she has.  Riot can sort out those on their own.  \n\nAs for the power budget in her passive, Riot will be adding a kind of ward that will ping the map whenever an enemy champion approaches, regardless of their visibility status, called the Mandrake ward.  This will be a direct nerf to the power of Eve's passive and one that should allow Riot some room to buff her.  In addition, you'll notice that I'm not suggesting flat out buffing her ult, just adjusting what's there.","replies":[{"poster":"GGMystic","date":"2015-03-19T16:44:04.719+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It saddens me to see that the Eve changes in PBE do little to address her problems. Regarding her ult, I completely agree with you. Instead of making its damage only current health, they could even make it a combination of current health + flat, similarly to Xin's ult.\n\nFrom what I can tell, Riot seems to think that Eve's early game is fine, so they're trying to help her better transition into mid-late game. If that wasn't the case, they would had already attempted to change the damage on either her Q or E.","replies":[{"poster":"Adrian Umbra","date":"2015-03-19T21:32:44.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My issue here is that Eve's early game really isn't fine, though the new jungle changes with this patch will help with that.  I would also agree with you as to where they're going with the changes, but the fact that she's getting so little every few patches when champions like Volibear, Xin, Skarner, and Nautilus got noticable buffs, both direct and indirect within a single patch is reminding me a lot of the year and couple months when Eve was the poster child for purposeful overnerfs.\n\nHopefully with the introduction of the Mandrake ward Riot will be a little less cautious, but as they're balancing her like she's seeing regular play  rather than scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Hearing that they're taking it \"slow and steady\" just feels like they're saying \"We know she's not in a good place but we don't want to invest anything in fixing her right now\" and hoping nobody notices that many of her \"buffs\" have come with noticeable drawbacks, from the \"missing mana\" that they forgot to highlight in the patch notes to the sticking power she'll be losing when the W changes hit live.\n\nSo instead of making tiny tweaks, I'm suggesting that we get something that's been broken for years now fixed.  \"Slow and steady\" has been far too slow and inconsistent for me to hold out much hope that Riot will really fix Evelynn.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-03-19T17:21:34.442+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Evelynn needs more work and I think fixing the ult is a good place to start.","replies":[]},{"poster":"catastrophicSkil","date":"2015-03-18T18:33:06.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"evelynn's problem is not with her ult it is with the fact that her damage in the early game is no longer scary espcially when she can't farm jungle then directly gank lanes like most champions that are strong in the jungle can but with the recent jungle nerfs i haven't tested it out because Sej is freelo lol\n\nUnless you run lifesteal quints which hurts her damage\n\n i would love to see evelynn be viable again actually i think the new tank item mightt be OK on her because the AP and AD jungle item make it hard for her to be in melee range for very long if we build evelynn with cinder how when she builds HP she will obtain enough bonus HP where she can sneak in another offensive item for example Warmogs/Cinder/Trinity/GA/BOTRK/Boots would make her fairly tanky in the late game and still give her decent damage\n\nYou could replace Bortk with maybe LW/Black cleaver depending on what would be better","replies":[{"poster":"Adrian Umbra","date":"2015-03-18T18:40:56.752+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eve absolutely has more problems than just her ultimate, especially considering the compounded effects of continual nerfs and the changes to the jungle killing her ability to clear.  However, I just wanted to address her ultimate, an ability that's honestly been next to useless for more than two years now.  Even at Eve's high point as a jungler, her ultimate was used for the shield and CC, not for damage.  It was always her passive, Q, and E that took the spotlight.\n\nI'm not a fan of that.  I want her ultimate to be meaningful, like it was back in S1 and during her time in midlane.  It's been an enormous flaw in her kit since the current health changes and that's really not healthy for the character.\n\nAnd I've never been the biggest fan of the fighter build from the start.  Eve's supposed to be an assassin, so why should I be building bruiser?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LongHair Fox","date":"2015-03-19T17:05:43.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Main problem with eve is that she has extremely low cd on her spells outside of her ultimate so if she can assassinate someone without it then she can just keep doing so.\n\nShe has a lot of problems and I don't think you can fix one of them independently of the others.","replies":[{"poster":"Adrian Umbra","date":"2015-03-19T21:16:23.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her cooldowns (with the obvious exception of her Q) really aren't that short (1.5s, 15s, 9s), I'd suggest looking at them and comparing them to a \"healthy assassin\" such as Zed.  Taking away power from her normal abilities and sinking it into her ultimate to me would actually fix this problem anyway, so I'm not sure what your point is.\n\nAnd remember that I've said before that I'm not looking to fix Eve here.  I'm looking to fix her ultimate specifically and make it more impactful to use, especially from an assassin's point of view.","replies":[{"poster":"LongHair Fox","date":"2015-03-20T02:39:06.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Main part of her damage is still in her q when it comes to her normal spells. I would much rather see her in a position akin to what fizz is right now. Let her ult give enemies a debuff that lets her basic attacks and spells do an ekstra amount of missing health and take away the largest part of its damage to compensate.\n\nThe way I see it having an assassin without a good escape and its main damage spell on a 1.5 cooldown cannot be healthy and in a top tier spot at the same time.","replies":[{"poster":"Adrian Umbra","date":"2015-03-20T16:33:15.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is a low CD main damage spell a balance problem (See Hecarim, Lissandra, Ashe, Mundo, Cassiopeia, Ezrael, Jax, Karthus, Ryze, etc)?  Eve's Q damage is steady but fairly low in comparison to most abilities.  It's ALREADY balanced around having a low cooldown.\n\nYou mention an assassin without a good escape and a spammable damage source being unhealthy when Rengar (primary damage source: auto attacks, Q) and Pantheon (primary damage source: auto attacks, Q) are considered to be in good places, too.  Eve will always be a high risk champion simply because of how close range she is and her lack of a reliable escape.  That's not going to change by taking power out of her regular abilities and shoving it into her ult.\n\nAnd if you do this, Eve's early game is going to be absolutely nuked.  Tying a large portion of a champion's damage to a 150 CD ult (Bear in mind that Fizz's is only 100) gates them in the worst way.  You nuke their pre-6 potential, you nuke their skirmishing potential, and the payoff often isn't worth the compensation (see Fizz's current state).  You're not fixing any of Eve's issues with this change (Especially her ultimate), you're making many of them worse.  Loading more random power into her ultimate isn't really healthy, which is why I've been suggesting focusing what there is.","replies":[{"poster":"LongHair Fox","date":"2015-03-20T21:15:44.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Low CD main damage spell has balance problems for assassins. None of those you listed are assassins but all of them have build their indentity up around those abilities (or at least have now with the cassi change).\n\nI mention assassins without good escapes being unhealthy (and yes full damage rengar is not healthy when he can oneshot carries without any counterplay even though he might be balanced or underpowered). Rengar is healthy since he is played more as a bruiser than assassin and the same goes for pantheon especially seing how his damage takes a long time to unload and he has low mobility. The reason no escpape assassins are unhealthy is because they are very binary. If they kill the carry they are succesful and \"has done their job\" but if they don't they might as well not be there. Anything in between and they need a bruiser or another assassin to waste mobility or spells on the carry or he will heal up through lifesteal or just poke at a safe range in the case of an apc.\n\nAs for the change I proposed then apperently I was not very clear but I meant to take away the ult damage and replace it with % missing health on basic attacks. This keeps her early game strong but foces her to time her ult to when she can go all in on a carry and murder them. This would also make use of her random attack speed on her e and focus her into a bruiser build which it seems you do not prefer. That being said I doubt there is only one way to fix her.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-03-19T17:26:29.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally love Evelynn's play style, but from the standpoint of the assassin's perspective, I can certainly understand the issue. I don't play her as an assassin and have always gone bruiser, but nothing about her kit screams assassin other then her invisibility. Her ultimate does nothing from the standpoint of an assassin. \n\nNot only that, I would consider it to actually be an engage tool...Assassins do NOT engage, they wait for the fight to start, then go in for the clean up. \n\nHowever the reason why the ultimate is so lackluster I would argue is because of Evelynn's passive. \n\nYou said that her ultimate is probably one of the worst ultimate in the game, I personally disagree (MF ultimate to me is the worst :p ), although if you're arguing from the standpoint of an assassin, you do have a point, it definitely could be considered the worst as it does nothing for an assassin game play. But her passive is arguably one of the best hands down in the game. I can't really think of another passive which influences a champion's play style so heavily like Evelynn's. \n\nSo in short, something needs to go. Either the invisibility needs to be tweaked to give the ultimate more oomph, or we keep the ultimate the way it is since her passive is so powerful. Her biggest problem lies in the fact her power budget lies so much in her perma stealth, her perma stealth was actually why I started playing her, it made her so good in lower elos.","replies":[{"poster":"Adrian Umbra","date":"2015-03-19T21:10:55.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MF ultimate is less flexible, but is a massive damage tool and a classic wombo combo followup for nuking CCed targets.  The main reason I'm looking to get the ult tweaked is that it just feels unrewarding to use, regardless of how.  You'll notice most of my suggestions weren't flat out buffs to her ult so much as adjustments of the power budget.  I realize how much of her power lies in her stealth, but with the current situation, her stats and abilities are so far below her piers' that she just can't compete.\n\nWith the addition of the Mandrake ward, Eve's going to take a significant indirect nerf, probably on par with DFG's removal.

Riot can say whatever they want about their game, they can make whatever design decisions they want, but in the end if they try to force an assassin to engage fights there will be consequences.  And that's why Evelynn's really not an assassin any more.  A secondary engage tool needs to meaningfully piggyback off the first, something like Gnar's ult, Zyra's ult, or Kennen's ult is a meaningful secondary engage to lock up or destroy opponents coming down off the initial one.  Eve's ult doesn't even come close to stacking up to these and, to add insult to injury, has a higher starting cooldown than any of them (and remember that Eve falls off lategame).\n\nI'm also well aware that they're buffing her passive and changing her W so that she has less sticking power but more slow cleansing power (you got it wrong that each auto will reduce the CD, it's on spell hit).  They've been giving her odd, small changes for a few patches now and it feels like they're honestly so scared to buff Eve that they're curbing their changes almost before they even become buffs, which worries me, especially with the Mandrake ward coming in, which will be a rather significant indirect nerf to Eve that Riot will inevitably be slow to follow up on or pull a Veigar/Mordekaiser with.\n\nAnd as someone who has been playing Eve for going on four years now (she was the second character I bought, way back in winter of 2011), I'm aware of her strengths and weaknesses.  I had enough time playing old Eve that I had the positioning for hanging out of sight of Oracle's Elixer memorized.  I'd stalk prey until they were isolated, take them out, and retreat back into the shadows.  And it's been so long since that playstyle has existed on Evelynn that I'm getting the feeling that people have forgotten that she hasn't been an actual assassin for a long, long time now.\n\nSo yes, numbers changes would help her.  Maybe if they actually helped out some of her gimped ratios or changed her so that she actually dealt a single kind of damage again, she would actually be able to build damage and not feel gimped.  But that's not the point of this thread.  The point of this thread is that her ultimate feels unsatisfying to use, even in optimal conditions, like you're describing.  Even as followup initiation, the BEST CASE SCENARIO, it is outclassed by so many other ults with lower cooldowns that nobody's willing to pick Eve for a followup initiator when they could just pick a bruiser and get better rewards for lower risk.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Adrian Umbra","date":"2015-03-18T17:37:09.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First and final bump","replies":[]}]}
