However, this particular rework is such an irritating one, especially with so many players saying he&#039;s in a better place or to trust Riot, that I feel the need to counter some of the silly arguments I&#039;ve seen and setting facts straight.\n\n> Mordekaiser can use his W on a minion, his solo lane ability is still there.\n\nMordekaiser cannot use his W on a minion, if he wants to play in a solo lane or even ends up in a 1vX scenario, he is down an ability.  CertainlyT has flat out stated that he couldn&#039;t find a healthy way for Mordekaiser to exist in a solo lane, so apparently he needs to be a duo laner now.\n\n> His E is totally gimped/his E is so much better.\n\nHis level 1 damage with E is better, his E damage when it is maxed is worse (by ~10-30 damage depending on level).  Yes, this gets better as he builds AD.  But the fact still remains that his wave clear got hit pretty hard, especially with the removal of his Q AoE.\n\n> He&#039;s unusable in his current state, so this rework is fine since they&#039;re making him usable.\n\nHe&#039;s totally usable in his current state.  Viability is also not a reason to destroy a champion&#039;s identity like this.\n\n> His shield is stronger since it scales off health.\n\nHis shield already scaled off resistances (which he lost from his W), you still need to fill up the bar, his shield generation was nerfed, and do people legitimately want Mordekaiser to have to build everything?  As things stand, he needs health, resistances, AD, AP, and MS.\n\n> Calm down, it&#039;s on the PBE, so nothing is final.\n\n{{champion:69}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:37}}   I&#039;ve lost a lot of trust in Riot because they push changes like this through despite player protest and then disappear after promising followup.\n\n> DRAGON GHOS-\n\nI&#039;m sick and tired of hearing about this as an excuse to stuff his entire power budget there.  A situational minion does nothing to help Morde for 95% of the game, which is where the rest of his power budget comes in.\n\n> Q DAMAGE SO HIGH!\n\nHis Q damage is spread across 3 hits.  On a non-mobile melee champion with no CC.  Sure, it&#039;s gonna hit like a truck if you level it, the enemy stands still for you, and you build offense, but it also lost the wave clear AoE element that Mordekaiser loved.\n\n> Mordekaiser will still be the same champion.\n\nThis is one that I heavily disagree with.  An AP solo lane burst mage who pushes waves and farms to lategame is not the same as an AD duo lane bruiser who tries to bully his lane and has a lot of his damage locked in a 200 range radius around him.  The only things that I feel stayed the same are the durability aspect, the immobility, and his ult, all of which were made worse by the rework.\n\nEdit:\n\n> These changes were necessary for him to be reworked.\n\nChanges were necessary for him to become a better champion.  But I'm really questioning how being more easily kited, forced bot lane, and built AD makes him easier to balance short of throwing him in a trash heap and calling it a day.  Changes were necessary, I'll agree.  But I'm baffled why Riot thinks THESE changes were necessary.\n\nIf you have any other arguments to add, think I&#039;m wrong, or have anything else to say, post a comment.  I&#039;ll try to reply as I can.","replies":[{"poster":"Aaravos","date":"2015-08-05T20:17:23.891+0000","up_votes":78,"down_votes":4,"body":"\"CertainlyT has flat out stated that he couldn't find a healthy way for Mordekaiser to exist in a solo lane\" like he ever made a healthy kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Bisaknosp","date":"2015-08-06T02:40:30.992+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"why cant i upvote this more times?","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-08-06T15:52:10.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I was reading, I went back up to upvote, only to see I'd already done it. \n\nAlso, His Q shouldn't be changed.

With the item changes in the same patch, they want all of these fighter-style champions out with their new items (and changes to current ones) enough for judgement before worlds. So regardless of whether these champions stay the same, or further changes are made, the changes will go through - for better or (more likely) for worse. I'm actually not against the idea of putting Morde into bot lane as long as it is handled well. You would expect that this would be handled well, since Riot has a lot of experience now with these types of mini-reworks and tentative changes. It's also being done by a designer who has done a lot of larger-scale work. But after reading the changes, I am skeptical that they have addressed the rather massive glaring issue that should have honestly been at the top of things to address. Why play him in his new role?\n\nI haven't heard CertainlyT directly answer this question. He has avoided it to the best of his abilities, but I'm not falling for it. Simply saying that you can play it \"instead of a typical ADC\" is NOT an answer. That is the definition of what he would be, yes, but it's not a reason to play him instead of an ADC. Currently, in his current state, he is horrible there. He has trouble CSing with his lower range and lesser early-game laning, has little harass with the change to his Q and will get poked out hard with lower base HP, worse shield generation, and having to use his health as a resource (with low HP regen as the cherry on the sundae). I doubt anyone will read this anyways, so I guess I'll stop ranting.","replies":[{"poster":"Adrian Umbra","date":"2015-08-05T20:18:53.796+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why force him out of a solo lane?

CertainlyT has flat out stated that he couldn't find a healthy way for Mordekaiser to exist in a solo lane, so apparently he needs to be a duo laner now.\n\nThis part does suck however they basically doubled the effective damage and gave it a heal.  As the damage does stack for both people using it.\n\nW: Reworked\n•New passive: Mordekaiser receives full experience from any lane minion he kills\n•New active -- Harvesters of Sorrow: Mordekaiser and target ally champion gain 75 MS while moving toward one another.\n**•When close to one another, both deal magic damage to nearby enemies over 4 seconds.**\n•Ability can be reactivated to instantly deal ~40% of the total DoT and heal Mordekaiser and his ally for the damage dealt (heal takes 3 units maximum; 33% heal to minions)\n•Health cost removed.\n\n>His level 1 damage with E is better, his E damage when it is maxed is worse (by ~10-30 damage depending on level). Yes, this gets better as he builds AD. But the fact still remains that his wave clear got hit pretty hard, especially with the removal of his Q AoE.\n\nThis is accurate as at lvl 1 no ad items on runes he gets 38 bonus damage and at lvl 18 he would receive 86 bonus damage with no ad items at all.  Which means at lvl 18 a loss of 9 damage if you have 0 ad items. However you will out scale this with just masterys/runes.\n\nE:\n•Base damage reduced from 70/115/160/205/250 >>> 35/65/95/125/155\n•Now also scales with 0.6 total AD\n•Cooldown from 6 >>>> 6/5.75/5.5/5.25/5\n•Now grants 15% of maximum shield on champion hits\n\n\n>His shield already scaled off resistances (which he lost from his W), you still need to fill up the bar, his shield generation was nerfed, and do people legitimately want Mordekaiser to have to build everything?

However your ap burst mordes shield is drastically nerfed.\n\nAs far as the generation of the shield it is actually a overall net buff as the changed to e outlined above give it 15% of MAX shield on top of the damage generation.(e is the most reliable skill morde has outside of ult)  Making a Bruiser build far better over all.\n\n>I'm sick and tired of hearing about this as an excuse to stuff his entire power budget there. A situational minion does nothing to help Morde for 95% of the game, which is where the rest of his power budget comes in.\n\n^ agreed.

Although having just played him on the PBE against a ahri mid I can tell you that you can still shove a lane plenty hard.  And the damage from the q is insane and is all off of scaling with ap/ad not off lvl which means it is always maxed last.  Let me say it again, **Never Never** max q first on the new morde.\n\n>This is one that I heavily disagree with. An AP solo lane burst mage who pushes waves and farms to lategame is not the same as an AD duo lane bruiser who tries to bully his lane and has a lot of his damage locked in a 200 range radius around him. The only things that I feel stayed the same are the durability aspect, the immobility, and his ult, all of which were made worse by the rework.\n\nThis is solely your opinion and not really based off the original design of the character.   For several seasons morde has only been built as a Burst mage.  However he was never intended to be a burst mage but a heavy sustain bruiser.   He is meant to go into a battle and keep in it with his shield and sustained damage.  While he will not be the same as he has been since mid s3 till today.  he will be closer inline with his intended character design.","replies":[{"poster":"Adrian Umbra","date":"2015-08-05T22:27:46.811+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm concerned for the usability of his W more than its raw damage.

There's an extreme need for everything in Morde's build and I'm not sure Riot really wants to keep that.\n\nThey are really trying to push him more into the bruiser role and have said it on many occasions the most recent to my memory was the last time they tweaked him in patch 5.4 \nquote taken from 5.4 patch notes as a point of reference for the rework\n\"It's no secret we've long considered Mordekaiser a thematically confused champion out the gate. Visually speaking, this guy's a walking, talking suit of armor with a giant mace. If that doesn't say scrappy fighter, we're not entirely sure what does. That said, Morde's found far more success in the present game as a bursty AP mage, picking up an early Deathfire Grasp to blow up and, subsequently, convert enemy marksmen into their team's worst nightmare.\n\nSo what's all this mean? Well, as customer numero uno for DFG (he actually might have been second with Veigar leading the way, but we're not ones to get in the way of a good reference) we didn't want to just take away Mordekaiser's core build without any form of compensation (although as we mentioned in the patch 5.2 foreword, the results have been a little off of expectation). We also wanted to take this opportunity to try tying Mordekaiser and his thematic identity a little closer together (scrappy tank man!), but when we finally arrived at that world, we realized it wasn't a very exciting one.\n\nAnd here we are now.\n\nThese changes aren't going to solve Morde's identity crisis in the present, but we did find a few ways to clean up his ghostly interactions so he can get the most out of his exploitative ways. Additionally, we really liked the new Creeping Death 'magnet' mechanic we were testing out with fighter Mordekaiser, so we figured we could give some extra utility love when he's hunting high priority targets with a dive buddy. So, once again: not a holistic solution but one we felt was better at preserving Mordekaiser's unique identity. \"\n \n\nThis is how they want to portray morde and this patch while not something I like is doing that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArkenStorm","date":"2015-08-06T05:23:59.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my thoughts on his build\n> [{quoted}](name=ArkenStorm,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=s1JauvO3,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-08-05T15:51:54.203+0000)\n>\n> i suppose that building {{item:3124}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3158}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3151}}  instead of {{item:3116}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3158}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3157}}  might be ok\n\nthe second build is what i currently build on live, sustained ap is the way i go, while still being dang tanky. idk if i can still do that with the changes, but im hoping the first item set in that quote will be a decent/viable build","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xl Kirito lx","date":"2015-08-05T20:31:31.818+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sure, I'll try my hand here.

Ahri got large scale buffs after the removal of DFG, and say what you will, but Veigars instant stun was slightly toxic.

I accept the fact that this will get downvoted by the masses for expressing an opinion that contradicts the current popular one, but such is the life on the Gameplay and Balance board.  \n\nWorth noting, I've lost all respect for anything that the boards say in terms of balance.  \"Let's buff Elise.\" \"Let's nerf Ekko.\" \"Riven OP, nerf.\" Albeit, the last one seems more like a joke anymore, people still repeat it.","replies":[{"poster":"Adrian Umbra","date":"2015-08-05T20:43:25.065+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiora and Ahri were good changes.

I still think removing his perma slow sucked but his change is tolerable.  Ashe they went the other way and gave her gp's old passive which was basically cutting the skill needed on ashe by a lot.  \n\nReally though the only reason the ashe and gp \"reworks\" weren't bad was they didn't really change much.  Sion is fun but you know what, he is a different champ now.  All they did was release a new champ that looked a lot like an old one while deleting an older fun champ.  As far as fiora I haven't seen anyting about it yet.\n\nThere are very FEW things the rework department has put out that I liked, but beyond just my opinion they pretty much ruin what was good about the champs they touch.  Saying not Everything they do is crap, is like saying not everything ted bundy did was murder.  (I know a bit extreme but it was the first thing that popped into my head {I knew a guy who actually picked him up hitchhiking across state lines and phoned the police letting them know where he'd dropped him off so it's a common example}).  Basically though the rework department kills champs them goes all Dr. Frankenstien on them but never seems to do a good job.\n\nEDIT: just looked at fiora's rework... it looks like a pile of shit... fiora was born, breed and all around made to make use of the tiamat, Hell they nerfed the thing just because of her...
