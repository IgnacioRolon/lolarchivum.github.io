Also I find it a bit funny how nonchalant people are reacting to the idea of a Bird-God coming back from the dead. Like does nonsense like that happen often? Are people aware of other Ascended?

This means that the only people who witnessed the event were Azir, who died and was only ressurected in recent times, Xerath, who spent a millennia in a tomb with Renekton, and the population of the capital, who all died instantly as Xerath's plan unfolded. \n\nThe story is incomplete for just about everyone in Runeterra, and so the details known about the return of the Empire by the wider population of Valoran are going to be extremely limited and based upon what was left behind: the myths, legends and history of Shurima, and given how Azir's father was described by Xerath as being essentially a mad man, it's safe to say the Emperor was not viewed as a shining example of excellence all the time, and the stories that endured throught he ages were of the _tyranny_ of the Emperors, not their benevolence if they even had any. Azir, being the last emperor and someone partially blamed for its fall because of his own hubris, will also fall under scrutiny because of the stories about him and the legacy of the emperors.\n\nOnly Azir, Xerath, Nasus and Sivir really have any real idea of what truly happened back then. Four people in the entire world. I wouldn't be surprised if Azir's return as an Ascended sparked fear and terror across Shurima as people feared the wrath of the returned emperor, and in a part of the world like Ionia, which is a _continent_ in its own right, the details would be even muddier.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2016-04-29T04:39:42.829+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2016-04-29T04:41:41.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that your \"I give up sharjo beat me again\" face","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2016-04-29T06:36:11.364+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, but only because I gave up on beating sharjo a long time ago.

And maybe Taliyah has some help from one of the factions in Freljord (I think it`s probably Ashe since she seems pretty chill:) ).\nAnd then we can have another big event battle thing with everything turning for the better at the end and Xerath getting banished from Shurima.
