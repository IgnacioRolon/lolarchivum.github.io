Though it looked promising, it was eventually cancelled due the game's inability to develop a large community by the end of it's Open Beta. I'm bringing up this story because Dawngate had an incredibly interesting way of developing it's lore which I honestly think League should adopt. It had a Webcomic, known as \"The Dawngate Chronicles\". **\n\nHere's an example of some of the pages. \nhttps://cmmedia.global.ssl.fastly.net/459a1345f29ce1ed0455/24892348/960x1250.jpeg\nhttps://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/5ed4f717114079.562b5e739f1ed.jpg\n\n**The comic was updated 3 times a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) and had a few story arcs throughout it's run, usually with the focus of familiarizing readers with the Heroes in the game. It was good, like really freaking good. The art was amazing, the stories were engaging and fun, being able to see the characters you play as interact with their world and other Heroes, it was all just so well done. It is in my eyes, how MOBA lore should be handled. The Poppy and Ekko comics are some of the most well received pieces of Lore ever created, Why can't a Webcomic be the main way League's stories are told?**","replies":[{"poster":"paradoxiq","date":"2015-12-11T04:49:05.670+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi League ppls! I was Dawngate's EP. Just got pointed here by the twitters and wanted to write a thing ... \n\nStory is ironically challenging in this genre: MOBAs are games defined by characters, yet the gameplay can't afford the moments required to develop those characters beyond their mechanics. Nor should it: games are _not_ stories, and in MOBA, the expression of skill through the character is not only paramount, it's really all that matters. Gameplay first. No time for cut-scenes in a 10 player pvp game!\n\nBut good stories and the characters that bring them to life are fucking beautiful, and they make the expression of the character through those mechanics so much more meaningful and fun! Somehow, games _are_ stories, or they want to be ... they certainly share something core with them through agency and the resulting connection we all have as players.\n\nSo while gameplay was always paramount, we also invested in deep world-building for Dawngate, and in funny ideas like match-up specific VO between characters, and in vehicles like the Dawngate Chronicles web comic to explore how to could bring characters to life. To be honest, It was all for science. We did it because we dug it and believed in it and we wanted to bring gameplay and story closer together: some of it worked, some of it didn't.\n\nSo on behalf of the crew who brought the Dawngate Chronicles to life: so glad you guys dug it ... we all loved making it!\n\n\"Splash of color!\" :)","replies":[{"poster":"KING OF MASKS","date":"2015-12-12T02:01:04.126+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dawngate was an absolute treasure.

I mean the writers at Riot tell good stories, but it just comes as such a massive wave. I'm not even looking for some crazy overarching plot that involved all 128 champions.
