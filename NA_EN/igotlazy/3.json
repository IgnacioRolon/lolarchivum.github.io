That causes you to have a huge chunk of players stop caring about the playable character and ask if we'll see more of that framing device when it's supposed to be the playable character's biggest time to shine in the history of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-04-29T14:33:30.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But players also love hoping champions like these will become a champion one day, which they might\n*cough* Yone *cough*\n\nEDIT: I don't mean Yone specifically might become a champion one day, I have no idea.
