I'll need to relog into the game in order to actually play. This is probably related but the game also occasionally locks my pathing straight into the opponents fountain, resulting in first blood often being given to the other team. I don't know what the hell this glitch is, but I'd really like to know if anyone else has ever experienced something like this. No one I've ever played with has ever experienced this glitch but it seems to be happening to me more and more. It's a pain in the ass when I want to play ranked games. Please help!","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2016-08-19T04:36:06.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSnerfrK9qQ\n\nLike this?","replies":[{"poster":"Cupshakes","date":"2016-08-19T06:00:23.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's exactly it!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2016-08-19T07:17:49.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This video is well over a year old.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T22:15:29.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your suffering from input delay, which could be the result of an unstable network connection.
