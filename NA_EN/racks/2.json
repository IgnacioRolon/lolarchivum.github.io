It implies the champion doesn&#039;t require skill to play, they just need to have more stats than whoever they are against and then they point and click and win. Brand fits this idea completely. His stats outscale whoever he is laning against very quickly. So quickly that if he doesn&#039;t die before his first recall that is enough to outscale almost anyone he lanes against. He can return to lane and immediately jump on them and faceroll his keyboard and they will die.\r\n\r\nHe&#039;s too strong for how simple his kit is. He&#039;s the epitome of click on enemy to burst and and win as long as your stats are superior no outplaying required.\r\n\r\nWhen laning against Brand, the burden of outplaying is always on his opponent, not on him. He &quot;outplays&quot; his opponent by not dying and waiting until the moment he has better stats and outscales whoever he&#039;s against which usually happens by the 1st or 2nd recall. Since Brand&#039;s opponent has to harass and kill him early on to win he/she has to push the wave and show aggression which leaves him/her open to being ganked. If you die to Brand a single time he&#039;s automatically ahead and you are no longer allowed to CS. If Tryndamere dies to you it just takes a little longer for him to reach him outscaling point.\r\n\r\nHe doesn&#039;t have to earn his power it just happens from not dying early it&#039;s too easy for how strong he is.\r\n\r\nHe needs nerfs until he is reworked. He should be bottom tier like Singed until the rework arrives.","replies":[]}
