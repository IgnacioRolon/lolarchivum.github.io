ON ALL ABILITIES {{summoner:14}} {{summoner:14}} {{summoner:14}} \r\n\r\nQ: A skillshot that can stun with his already ignite passive... Holy crap so basically it a free stun that&#039;s almost unmissable if you use your other abilities already on the opponent which is izi pz\r\n\r\nW: AoE damage nuke, this should be an ultimate atleast because it do way too much damage for how safe it makes brand and it applies his passive so more ignite\r\n\r\nE: Even more AoE if done correctly, completely overpowered and can destroy a whole team in seconds with this ability alone with w. not even a skillshot\r\n\r\nR: Rofl this thing is so broken, if you throw it between two people it insta kills them both no counterplay involved. if there&#039;s a team they all pretty much have 10%hp instantly\r\n\r\nO hur hur he got nerfed? he has mana problems??? 10+ mana on w op.\r\n\r\nBut muh lack of mobility...  and laugh at assassins whilet hey can&#039;t hurt you cuz braindead stun and you insta 1 shot kill them.
