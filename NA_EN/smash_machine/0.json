But its a skin I already own (Old Saint Zilean) which confuses me, and I can't reroll it into a different skin without using two more shards. Riot why did I get a skin permanent for a skin I already own? And why is it that I can't reroll the permanent into another unowned permanent without using two other shards?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-15T16:41:57.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These chests still use the same rules as [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide), meaning that content you find is still random.  I know it doesn't feel good to you to find something you already have, but if I recall you may also be able to disenchant it for a large amount of essences.  You might be able to fuse together some shards you have.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Smash Machine","date":"2016-12-16T01:32:27.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(smartass comment incoming)\nIt allows me to disenchant for 260 essence, much wow.

Now we're up to a minimum of 5 (One Permanent is 3 shards, plus the 2 loose shards, for those who were having difficulties following), and a maximum of 9. This just isn't okay. I was actually going to start my own thread about it, but I'm tacking it onto this one with the hope that it might get noticed faster (PLEASE NOTICE ME SENPAI!!!), and it can get resolved faster. So I would advise everyone to hold on to duplicate skin permanents until we hear from Riot about this, unless we don't in which case it was intentional, which would really really REALLY annoy me. \n\nPlease don't annoy me okay?","replies":[]}]}
