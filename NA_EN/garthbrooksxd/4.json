I think a lot of people are going to get into this. Don&#039;t get me wrong I love 5v5. It is definitely funner than 3v3, but 3v3 offers an environment where you are less dependent on teammates and also the novelty of a different map/objectives etc.... Think we could see a world championship tournament in this environment?","replies":[{"poster":"MishaX","date":"2016-11-10T10:30:32.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easiest way to climb in rank is 3v3 with 3 mates. Op comp, less people to play at the same time, some champion are OP in 3v3, cause of the map (nocturn ult for example).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2016-11-09T22:22:53.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope so!
