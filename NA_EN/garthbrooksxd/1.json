Vayne has been hurting for a while, and as a result, you guys buffed her.(cool, even though Q buff was perhaps the wrong way to go though) but what baffles me is that there is a HUGE change coming to Stealth, and as a result it will likely buff Vayne quite a lot, so that with the Q change, will definitely result in her needing a nerf, which means it was possible she never needed an actual buff to begin with. Why buff a champion if such a massive, champion altering update is right around the corner? I don't want to see her worse off because the gun was jumped ( I am still a little mad over the buffs you gave Kog Maw and then blamed his state on his rework and not the buffs, so I apologize if I seem a bit hostile)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-10-12T02:11:13.377+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We weren't committed to these changes to stealth functionality at the time we were considering Vayne buffs.
