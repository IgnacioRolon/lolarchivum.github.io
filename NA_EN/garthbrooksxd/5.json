Definitely there are much more skilled players, like if you watch challenger players stream you can tell their game play is ridiculously better, but really why do people say gold is bad? Like if you can get gold, plat, diamond 5 etc... you&#039;re not bad per se, just compared to the top of the ladder you could easily get rekt by those players. Doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re bad at basketball just cuz ur not in the NBA aka challenger.\r\n\r\nTo compare, there are 8 million high school athletes, about 480,000 will play college sports. So that is, about 6% of high school athletes compete in college athletics. About 6% of the player base is plat or higher. So if you can make it to plat, that should be considered pretty decent :) \r\n\r\nOf course, of that 6%, only a few will go on to play professional sports aka master/challenger/lcs team play. And even in pro sports people can even compare and say that Alecs Burks is bad compared to Lebron James. That&#039;s like the equivalent of the difference between a low challenger player na compared to Faker.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not saying gold players are amazing or anything, definitely tons of room to improve, but if you can make it to gold then that&#039;s good enough to give urself a pat on the back. If you can make it to plat then you have the equivalent talent as a collegiate athlete.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: People, particularly streamers, should stop saying gold, plat, diamond 5 etc are shit. It takes a lot of practice to make it far up the ladder. No pro athlete demeans the people he/she played with when they were younger like that, and neither should league players say stuff like &quot;stay bronze&quot; &quot;stay silver&quot; &quot;stay gold&quot; etc... lol the tier just about another always has so much pride and hate on people they&#039;ve risen above in tier ranking... would like to see more good sportsmanship in this community and less elo shaming. Many people just play this game for fun and realize they&#039;ll never get to such and such rank, ya know?","replies":[{"poster":"Arya Riven","date":"2017-02-06T23:21:07.156+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because people think about their rank way too much to begin with.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-02-07T00:22:39.461+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":16,"body":"I hit plat so easily that I'm damn confident I can hit diamond. \n\nI still think I'm bad at the game.

Farm and map awareness in my opinion are absolute basics that should come automatic and not require practice.

That is just total BS\n\nI feel like my  comments are  way over some people's heads. What I am trying to  say  is that the reason people think Golds are bad are because they still have a very  low understanding  of the game. They are still working on what are considered the basics for high elo players. In comparison,  a Gold player saying to a high elo player that they work on things like map awareness  and last hitting is like a fresh 30 saying to a Gold player that they are working on things such as remembering to buy items before going to lane at level 1 or that they  are practicing  not getting hit by the tower all the time. Yes, these things take practice, but these things aren't things that make a player better in my opinion, they are just things that need to be learned in order to play the game properly.\n\nEvery season I level a smurf and run it up the ranks and silver and  gold feel no different from each other to me. The same mistakes that I get fed off of in silver I get fed off of in gold. The amount of improvement is so small that it is hard to take gold as a serious rank improvement over silver. When you hit around P3/P2 you start to get matched with people that are starting to get pretty good at the game but usually have problems with end game strats,, inefficient build paths or a lack of team fighting skills.","replies":[{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2017-02-07T16:46:47.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright so now we have established that what you ACTUALLY said is not what you WANTED to say.\n\nCSing and map awareness did not come naturally to anybody, rather high elo players are so used to doing it by this time that they don't really need to think about it as much.\n\nYou can be any rank you want but if you can't communicate your ideas clearly, nobody is going to take you seriously.\nI am not kidding when I say that I have never needed to apply my learnings from high school english class anywhere as much as these boards.","replies":[{"poster":"Thrëat","date":"2017-02-07T16:55:01.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Spaceman5pff,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5Eui2h7g,comment-id=00030002000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-02-07T16:46:47.924+0000)\n>\n> Alright so now we have established that what you ACTUALLY said is not what you WANTED to say.\n> \n> CSing and map awareness did not come naturally to anybody, rather high elo players are so used to doing it by this time that they don&#x27;t really need to think about it as much.\n> \n> You can be any rank you want but if you can&#x27;t communicate your ideas clearly, nobody is going to take you seriously.\n> I am not kidding when I say that I have never needed to apply my learnings from high school english class anywhere as much as these boards.\n\nIt was actually a comprehension issue, but ok.","replies":[{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2017-02-07T19:05:10.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Comprehension is about undertsanding the objective meaning of the words on the page.\n\nTelepathy is knowing what you MEANT when you said something totally different.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kudrov","date":"2017-02-07T17:02:03.712+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"the reality is the one expressed by a master player who just wrote something about this on the board, he said and realized that being in gold, plat or even diamond does not say much about a skill of a player because the system is totaly random and its pretty much all about luck for exemple : \n\n1 day you might do 5 games and the result might be 5 wins because you got matched with brillant peoples \n\nthe very next day you do 5 games (you played the whole 10 games at pretty much the same level of skills) and the result might be 5 looses because you got matched with total crap players.\n\ni would bet my whole household that alot of peoples can relate to that.","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-02-07T23:30:18.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">the reality is the one expressed by a master player who just wrote something about this on the board, he said and realized that being in gold, plat or even diamond does not say much about a skill of a player because the system is totaly random and its pretty much all about luck for exemple :\n\nhell no, yeah there's some chance... but if u are good you will climb.

Another thing people in this game don't seem to understand is that....in order to make it to diamond + elo, you pretty much have to play league 8+hrs a day. Idc who you are, you can't be a casual Diamond+ player. It takes a lot of playing and climbing to reach that high on the ladder. Some people simply do not have the time to play that much league","replies":[]},{"poster":"GemCrash","date":"2017-02-07T07:58:49.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"from my personal experience, any rank below diamond is heavily decided by pure luck.\nand a shit ton of diamonds are boosted.\nThat's from a player who played league for 6 years and experienced all of silver, gold, and plat for two seasons.","replies":[{"poster":"Myrmiron","date":"2017-02-07T09:36:52.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO it's all below Diamond 3, because low Diamond is full of boosted animals.","replies":[{"poster":"Who is Taliyah","date":"2017-02-07T09:45:41.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dang I'm 4 wins away from dia 3.
