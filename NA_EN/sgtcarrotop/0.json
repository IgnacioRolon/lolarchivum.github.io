In all seriousness new Quinn is extremely boring and frankly horrendously crafted. For starters her game play style is easily the most linear point, click, win kit out of all the adcs. Yes that includes you {{champion:119}} . Next, making her quite possibly the most mobile champ in the game is entirely pointless if the cost is all of her assassination potential, all of her dueling potential, and all of her escape potential. There is literally no point what so ever in having this kind of map presence if you&#039;re as threatening as a wet paper towel.... and just as vulnerable.  \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t think i even have to go into the joy and love Quinn mains had for playing as valor. But I&#039;m going to anyway. The days of joyously screaming KA-KAW when playing as valor are over. Taking out that core theme of a character is so unnaturally cruel and unusual.  It would be like taking Olaf the Manly, Man of Men who parades the battlefield with blood soaked axes, and turning him into a limp dick gardener. It doesn&#039;t make sense and it&#039;s a huge step down in character quality. \r\n\r\nAnd finally. The biggest issue is that this new Quinn just fundamentally doesn&#039;t work. In essence Quinn is now what i would like to call a Crit caster.  Primarily meant for midlane now, this current Quinn  contends with common mids in the early game by being an AD caster of sorts. Building crit into mid and late game for a cooldown on her passive Harrier to proc much more often in team fights.  In truth this is a very solid idea in theory, but in practice falls apart.  Allow me to explain.\r\nWhile It&#039;s true this new Quinn does absolutely phenomenal damage, all the damage in the world means nothing if it can&#039;t be applied. Quinn is still on the lower spectrum of rang among marksmen.  This means mid lane she is almost always out ranged, and out zoned.  Her squishiness compounding this issue even further making risk vs reward plays borderline suicidal. So unless your simply better as a player than your midlane opponent or have a counter pick, your midlane will be either losing, defensive, or reliant on your jungler. \r\n Then comes Quinns Bread n Butter. Tag team is basically your &quot;give up on mid and try to pick up some kills by ganking in the hopes of accelerating your build to mid and late game&quot;  button. Only issue is that well.... its completely stupid and has no place in a competitive game of this caliber. Wards are king, and positioning is queen. Godly speed means nothing if it trips over itself on the slightest tap.  As it stands Quinns ult exists to get you killed faster.  It absolutely EXCELS at bringing you into situations that you cannot get out of.  \r\n\r\nA good example is {{champion:120}} . He has great mobility and his damage isn&#039;t something to laugh at. When we look at Hecarim we see that he has the potential to engage AND escape all in one fight. If you so choose to Initiate with Hecarims ult you can use his Devastating Charge to escape if things turn sour, and vice versa.  Simply put, almost all the champs in game that &quot;get the fuck in there&quot; can also &quot;get the fuck out&quot;. This is absolutely key to how league of legends plays.  We can even see this as a universal truth  among champs. Just take a look at all these champs. {{champion:91}}  {{champion:23}}  {{champion:103}}  {{champion:24}}  {{champion:64}}  {{champion:35}}  {{champion:62}}  {{champion:5}}  {{champion:157}}  {{champion:238}}  {{champion:254}}  {{champion:18}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:114}} \r\n\r\nEach and everyone of these champs are prime examples of the parallel power of engages and escapes. Riot.  Are you are telling me that you made {{champion:133}}  with Top Tier engage power, but gave her literally no escape, no sustain, and no dueling potential in her kit.  Anyone who thinks this could ever possibly be a good idea has no concept of how this game actually plays...\r\n\r\nAnd just to add some credibility to my assertions, Yes i have tried the new Quinn extensively and even do well with her, but i still feel the clunkiness of her kit and the odds against me every step of the way. More importantly. It&#039;s boring. It&#039;s really, really, really is just plain boring. I never support the idea of sacrificing fun factor for viability factor. Taking away Quinns Uniqueness and simply adding damage is both an insult and just plain lazy. Come on Riot. You can do better.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2015-11-11T22:38:00.912+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you.\n\nYou point out one of the key things I've been saying about the Quinn rework. Because of the power in her ult, she has become a ball of stats (and by stats I mean base values and scalings). You will either have the stats you need to do the job Riot has forced her in, but that will then make you OP due to the sheer amount of mobility you have. On the other hand, if you don't have the stats you need, you will be completely useless.\n\nRight now, 5.22 Quinn is in the OP stage. This will lead to everybody picking her up, complaining about how OP she is, and an eventual nerf to bring down that damage, into the useless stage. This will make all the FoTM players to drop her, and to hardly any Quinn main liking these changes, she will have an even lower player base then before","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-12T00:55:30.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"So..

Its because old Quinns ult while immensely fun was in hindsight a bad ult. Turning a squishy adc into a melee assassin who uses their one escape as said assassination method is a sure fire way to feed. There's a reason why many referred to Quinn as a kamikaze carry. \n\nThat being said Quinn is now more or less still in the same predicament now just entirely lacking an escape of any kind. But you want to talk about bundles of stats? Lets talk about stats.  \nHere's a fun little fact. The execution scaling, base power, and cooldown are all better on this version of Quinn.  I can personally attest that Quinns Q currently can execute with an astronomical 900ish damage. This followed up by essentially a free crit doubles the shear nuke possible on a low target.  This new Quinn is quite literally BLOATED with stats. That is a fact you can confirm on your own should you be so inclined.\n\nEven with these clearly imbalanced stats Quinn is in a bad place right now suffering from survivability and applicability.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sgtcarrotop","date":"2015-11-11T22:45:56.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I fear you're exactly right.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BerserkInferno","date":"2015-11-12T00:59:07.539+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are nearly 800 posts about how riot completely screwed the pooch with the quinn rework and all the reasons why the pooch was screwed with it, yet [with classic riot style] they refused to listen to the community and basically said, \"oh you guys have these valid concerns and have pointed out all the flaws with our plan for quinn and valor....well that's tough you'll just have to live with it, because we won't not apply these changes.....because....reasons.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"CDMarco","date":"2015-11-11T22:41:05.958+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What they did to Quinn reminds me of what happened with the Karma rework.
