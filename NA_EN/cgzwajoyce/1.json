But it doesn't matter. Riot won't regard it nor even look at it or even consider what's being said. \r\n\r\nI've been coming on these boards for a while now seeing countless people posts about various issues concerning this game. Nothing is being done.\r\n\r\nAfter 8 years of playing this. I don't think I can continue. I don't think I have the patience to level up another account because my last account got banned because I had trolls and afks who pushed me to the edge. Or enemy teammates who wanna bm when I have people on my team just straight feeding and making me feel like shit.\r\n\r\nThis meta is by far the worst i've ever seen. It's almost like there is no counter play. And if you live in a fight for more than 3 seconds you're cc'd the entire time and die anyways.\r\n\r\nCool story. A champion like mundo can go {{item:3211}}  and all of sudden he is unkillable and does half of your health because he does % health dmg.\r\n\r\nLet's talk about the fact you buffed pretty much every assassin and bruiser in the game with the items for pre season. WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS. We are asking for damage to be lowered and runes to be eliminated. All of these runes making everything burst damage. OH I DASHED AND I KILLED PEOPLE SO I DO MORE DAMAGE NOW HAHAHAHA.\r\n\r\nHere is Riots logic. We scream for nerfs, they'll nerf something but put a buff in there anyways to replace it. OH WE ARE GONNA MAKE TOWERS STRONGER AND BETTER DEFENSE. But we are also gonna give rewards for people who destroy them quicker. \r\n\r\nYou don't like assassins. HAHA HOLD MY BEER. {{champion:555}}  INTRODUCING A SUPP ASSASSIN.\r\n\r\nI mean God dang WTF. Why do you intent on doing this to your playerbase. Damage is way too high. It takes no skill to press q anymore. Or R. You insta win if you have items and 2 level lead.\r\n\r\nYou know why i'm toxic? Cause most of my placement matches on this account I lost. 3 of them legitimately being lost because an afk in my games. 2 of them being lost by a toxic troll who decides to feed INTENTIONALLY because someone pissed him off. And I gotta sit here and hold my peace because some 10 year old who isn't even old enough to play the game is gonna steal time from MY DAY that i'm never getting back because I'm trying to move up in a ranked match?\r\n\r\nDo you know the only people punished by this system are the ones who type? But those who say nothing or maybe a couple of words can just come to lane your and feed your laner on purpose because they are pissed that you didn't leash for them? Nothing happens to them and to those who afk. Just those who hit the keyboard strokes.\r\n\r\nHere is the logic behind Riot's banning system. \"WELL AS FAR AS I SEE WE DON'T WANNA HIRE PEOPLE TO GO THROUGH REPORTS CAUSE WE ARE A CHEAP BILLIONAIRE COMPANY WHO'D RATHER HAVE IT AUTOMATED. On top of that let's shun anyone who gets banned just to make everyone think our system is perfect\". I see it time and time again. You get people threads who are upvoted who were wrongly banned. And all of sudden a rioter comes and post what they want us to think are chat logs. So this is how you lost all your player base. You banned them all. And you ran the other half away because you broke the game so much that nobody wants the frustration of losing at 5 minutes and waiting until 20 to ff.\r\n\r\n/rant over","replies":[{"poster":"Waka FIocka","date":"2019-12-06T23:02:06.847+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"idk i think it's funny how sensitive the mods and players are in regards to 'trolling' (literally something as small as saying \"GG EZ\" or \"does nobody know what a ward is?\" or \"this game is over. jg isn't botside at all for drakes and somehow magically not topside for herald/baron either\") . like legitimate criticism or snarky comments are bannable..\n\nBUT! then you have big streamers in games---live-- telling players on their team that they are dogshit at the game, afk in fountain buying control wards after selling all their gear LOL-- calling their team fucking r%%%%%ed and whatever else. but yeah riot cares so so sooo much about toxicity ! can't even mention someone's rank/playtime in chat boards about gameplay or your comment gets removed. my comment was removed the other day because some dude that doesn't play SR (or the game at all anymore) had so much to say about how supports can eat shit and deserve the nerfs to their income lol\n\ndude only played aram and urf a few times over a month ago. but nope, can't mention this on boards! unless you're a big time streamer of course, live for 5-15k viewers.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-12-07T00:59:59.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Waka FIocka,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=AHlcbrkv,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-12-06T23:02:06.847+0000)\n>\n> idk i think it's funny how sensitive the mods and players are in regards to 'trolling' (literally something as small as saying \"GG EZ\" or \"does nobody know what a ward is?\" or \"this game is over. jg isn't botside at all for drakes and somehow magically not topside for herald/baron either\") . like legitimate criticism or snarky comments are bannable..\n> \n> BUT! then you have big streamers in games---live-- telling players on their team that they are dogshit at the game, afk in fountain buying control wards after selling all their gear LOL-- calling their team fucking r%%%%%ed and whatever else. but yeah riot cares so so sooo much about toxicity ! can't even mention someone's rank/playtime in chat boards about gameplay or your comment gets removed. my comment was removed the other day because some dude that doesn't play SR (or the game at all anymore) had so much to say about how supports can eat shit and deserve the nerfs to their income lol\n> \n> dude only played aram and urf a few times over a month ago. but nope, can't mention this on boards! unless you're a big time streamer of course, live for 5-15k viewers.\n\nLmao id like to see a chat log where someone was banned for saying \"does no one know what a ward is?\"","replies":[{"poster":"Waka FIocka","date":"2019-12-07T12:10:59.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tele II,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=AHlcbrkv,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-12-07T00:59:59.018+0000)\n>\n> Lmao id like to see a chat log where someone was banned for saying \"does no one know what a ward is?\"\n\nyou'd be surprised... question anyone's knowledge on a mechanic of the game and you could seriously get reported and chat suspended, losing all your honor progress &amp; access to the free rewards lol","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-12-07T12:21:02.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to be surprised.

Can you post us an example?\n\nI didn't screenshot my game yesterday where my adc and jg were calling for toxicity reports for saying those exact same things I quoted. Those quotes didn't seem a little specific to you? If you really think players won't bandwagon report someone out of frustration for losing a game (no matter how hard the person making any constructive comments tries to win the game) then there's zero chance even a screenshot or proof could enlighten you my friend.\n\nmy games are usually good ones with no need for any communication. I don't call people names, I don't say someone is inting unless they really are (like the leona on enemy team a few games ago that would run up and stop moving until we killed her). If you're looking for some validation on my end I can't really provide it because I am not toxic :) \n\nI can, however,  repeat _again_ that sensitive players in your games will report you for the smallest constructive comments out of frustration from their game, or a mod will remove your post and give you a warning for mentioning someone's rank + playtime even though it can be very relevant to the topic at hand. Have I been suspended? No. Have I been banned? No. You know why? Because I don't type much at all in my games. It's the only way to protect yourself from getting in any trouble at all. And that, to me, is a bit of a problem. People wonder why the reddit and boards are not very active... to the point that 20 upvotes in 10 minutes is considered suspicious activity lmao","replies":[{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-12-10T02:34:06.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Waka FIocka,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=AHlcbrkv,comment-id=00030000000000000000,timestamp=2019-12-07T13:59:39.255+0000)\n>\n> I didn't screenshot my game yesterday where my adc and jg were calling for toxicity reports for saying those exact same things I quoted.

Thank god that doesnt mean Riot will punish the player theyre reporting. Like I said, I'd like to see a chat log, as in, they actually got punished for simply saying some shit like that.

There used to be (and should still be) far more to the game than that. \n\nAlso, there are ways to make game times shorter without making the game more snowbally. When people said games were getting too long and boring, Riot's response was just to cut off the last 25% of the game. In order to maintain some semblance of balance they then had to buff the damage of things like enchanters and mages in the early game and keep them relevant. But they also had to buff assassins/bursters to make sure that they didn't auto lose to scaling if they don't properly snowball and roam for the first 15-20 minutes.\n\nRiot's approach SHOULD HAVE been to try and find a way to fit all of the phases, and all of the elements that used to exist when the average game length was like 35 minutes...and streamline/condense them to all fit in a 28 minute window. Just chopping off the late game is completely idiotic.
