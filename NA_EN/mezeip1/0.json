After several attempts typing my password slowly, double checking CAPS, Hotkeys etc that nothing was affecting my keyboard or characters it has been deemed my password does not work anymore. I was wondering if a Riot employee can help me out because after going through the forgot a password link the email bot stopped working. Any help would be helpful. This is not my main account, my main is \"Mezeip\".","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-01T04:57:47.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can assist you in recovering your account if you submit a ticket with [**this form**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) and provide *as much information* about your account that you can recall.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
