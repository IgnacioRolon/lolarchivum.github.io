I rarely talk in game, get honored pretty frequently but rarely ever get multiple honors. (I play mostly flex atm which I know isn't the best place to farm honors since everyone honors their friends)\n\nMy friend who just got to 30 rage quits every other game and gets reported constantly and he's already honor level 4... HOW? It wouldn't be so bad if I had ANY idea how close I am to leveling. \n\nIs it because my account is 3 years old? Is getting 3 honors the only way to progress at all? How after all this time playing 4 games every other day am I still level 2?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-09T04:33:56.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Always keep in mind that everyone plays a different amount of games, and in those games they get different amounts of honors. Not everyone is going to progress at the same rate, especially when you start factoring in any punishments and reports they get after games. The Honor system isn't meant for you to compare your progress to others.\n\nYou'll steadily get there as long as you keep playing games and don't end up getting punished, even if you never get honored yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Player","date":"2017-10-09T23:56:28.326+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"me and a friend ONLY play together. same games, always premade. he's honor lvl 5, I'm 2. how is that even possible? I got no bans, no chat restrictions, and I don't think people report me, since (as far as I'm aware) I'm not in anyway toxic. why is the honor system like this? of course you're not supposed to \"compare your progress\" but I don't wanna grind 10+ games a day just to get to honor 5 before the season ends. honors were introduced about a month ago (I think?) and I'm still 2, can I really get to 5 by the less-than-month that is left for this season?\n\nI started to enjoy league less and less thinking about it. I mean, don't give us rewards, I don't care. but give rewards to some players, contributed randomly?\nI don't see a pattern here, as for what I mentioned above, me and a friend of mine play the same games EXACTLY and NEVER play alone, yet he is level 5 honor. (I would understand him being 3 while I'm still 2. but 5?)\nthis puts two people in two different classes, as one player can get to 5, get the rewards, the loading screen banner, and all affiliated with honor levels, but I can't, I don't understand why.\nI get it - that it's not a bug, however, why am i supposed to grind games just to level up? a friend of mine who plays once a week and i (who plays roughly 1-2 games per day), why is that different?

I believe it depends on how frequently you play and are honored on that. Like, I play almost every single day at least 2-3 games, and in that, I was honored about every other game.  So if you get honored a lot within a short time span, i think you'll level up faster rather than getting an honor here and there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sauvagess","date":"2017-10-08T14:07:38.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've been playing every day, multiple games a day, begging for honors from my teammates and I'm still stuck at honor 2. I've never been punished for anything, I've had all 3 honor ribbons in the past, and my friends who don't even play and a person I know who just started playing the game fresh are levels above me in honor.\n\nThis seriously makes no sense at all and it's negatively affecting my gameplay.","replies":[]}]}
