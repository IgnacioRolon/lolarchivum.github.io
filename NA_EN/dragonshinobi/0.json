It causes problems either way. Mute them and focus on the game instead, don't make it worse.\n\nIf you want to discuss the validity of your punishment I recommend posting the reform card and letting us know what prior punishments you may have already had. To contest a ban you have to submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), but Riot will typically not reduce or remove a punishment unless it was in error.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuthillick","date":"2017-01-07T10:13:43.349+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright. Talking back AND harassing is in fact toxic. Toxic doesn't only include racism, homophobia, etc. If you think of what a toxin is in real life it is something that is deliberately there to lower the quality of whatever it is used on. Translated to league that includes harassing and talking back. You are making a conscious decision to harass and talk back to them which causes toxicity.\n\nYou admitted you conducted the behavior that resulted in your permaban. I doubt you will get unbanned.","replies":[{"poster":"UMADDBRAHHH","date":"2017-01-07T16:15:48.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wrote in all caps, non curse words, non suicidal words.

You made a conscious decision to send that message which has an incredibly low, almost impossibly low, chance to provide anything positive. I am going to guess it wasn't sent to provoke a productive review of gameplay and epiphany from the targeted player. It was sent to be hurtful and is harassment. You should be banned for that. Just because you didn't swear doesn't mean you didn't harass and weren't toxic.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DragonShinobi","date":"2017-01-07T10:04:29.534+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:82}} i was playing lee sin right? i went 16/18 and my yasuo and vel koz team mate was harassing me cause they were feeding and they called me a noob also this cassiopea on my team harassed me called me a child they were all making fun of me and my score","replies":[]},{"poster":"what you deserve","date":"2017-01-07T09:53:28.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"if you weren't toxic then you wouldn't have been perma banned. the only time you'll get permabanned without previous bans for toxicity is when you use hate speech","replies":[]},{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-01-07T17:32:26.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post your reform card\nThose logs will give insight as to why you were banned\n(DeepTerrorNami said this)\n\nYou attacked in retaliation, why an eye for an eye strategy always works I hear.....","replies":[]},{"poster":"UMADDBRAHHH","date":"2017-01-07T16:15:05.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got that too.
