We're all here to play a game and have fun, some of us choose to support the game by spending money, others do not.  But spending money does not make you a more valuable player to Riot.  Riot is here providing us a service, and their job includes ensuring to the best of their ability that the general player base can enjoy this service without feeling threatened or abused.  If that means they need to remove access to players causing emotional harm and stress intentionally to other players, than that is what they have to do in order to provide a healthier environment for their game, despite any amount of money they could have gotten from that banned player.  \n\nOn top of this spending money does not give someone the right to intentionally cause stress or emotionally abuse other people, you are given every opportunity to read the Terms of Service that you \"Accept\" in order to play this game.  Upon clicking that button you have agreed that you have read and fully understand those rules and that you will follow them.  Ignorance to these rules is in itself a violation of them since you agreed that you were aware of them.  \n\nUltimately nobody is perfect, people make mistakes and sometimes our emotions get the better of us.  Riot understands this and that is why the reform system exists at all.  If you receive even a single chat restriction you need to stop and realize that what you are doing is not appropriate and you need to make sure that you are actively trying to be a better person if you want to continue playing the game you enjoy.","replies":[]}]}]}
