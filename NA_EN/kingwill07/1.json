I understand that they want to win so bad they pick him. To be real with I mean he is an Op Champion which i think needs to be nerfed or fixed. I mean this guy has a low cooldown plus his passive his a sheild and he has a windwall. WTF Riot why give him a sheild with a sheild.  Its bad enough that he has that mobility with e and he runs away while poking you with Q but come on this guy can block and ashe ult and also a Miss fortune ult with a windwall. He already has two passive which he crits. come on. I keep forgeting that you have to break his sheild with one hit before you flame him but some players ult him with his sheild on and he just walks away unharmed and builds it up amd get back in again. whats the point of this champ. even Zed which i think is not bad now cannot beat a yasuo.","replies":[{"poster":"Lleajy","date":"2018-03-31T22:36:57.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lately ?\n\nIt has always been an overplayed champ. The glass-canon retarded gameplay and the japanese side is attracting a lot of kids.\n\nI would reduce the dash count, and remove the wind shield block on ults.

But tbh, Yasuo isn’t that good unless the player has played a lot of Yasuo and can survive the early game, or if the lane opponent is just bad.\n\nConqueror gave him a well needed boost, but he still has a long way to go to get back to what he was like before they started cutting him apart.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GodlyBane","date":"2018-03-29T20:00:39.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"yasuo isnt that good rn. Low base hp (squishy) too item reliable, if the yas player isnt good, he just dies in a team fight in a few seconds, no not even.\n\nyas is bad rn, in fact, they are BUFFING him soon, listen, you honestly need to shut up and know how to play against him. So many bronzies in this elo just go into lane, stand right next to their own minions at low hp, only for me to beyblade, auto, ignite them and boom they die because they dont know anything.\n\nYasuo is below balanced, conquerer just made his damage output more convenient and less mechanical oriented. try trundle or yi with conquerer, then you can see if conq yas is worse or conq yi is worse","replies":[]},{"poster":"gabetheguy","date":"2018-03-29T19:47:02.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"yasuo is utterly mediocre at best. you're just bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bultz","date":"2018-03-29T18:55:46.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Don't you fucking even dare fucking start this circle jerk again.
