I was banned for my account using unauthorized 3rd party apps for an unfair advantage, however i play with my stream on. People see me play all the time. Ive never use scripts or anything else for an unfair advantage . I really need help from the community cause they refuse to actually look into my account and are extremely impersonal . They just say we have evidence and are sure there was no mistake and this case will be closed. They even spelled my name wrong when adressing my summoner name. I have 1000s of hours invested into my account and probably a grand at least invested in skins and in game items through all the gifts i have gotten over the 5 years of playing. They gave me no warning, just banned it. I have given out 25$ gift cards on my stream and give to the community and strengthen it . Share this and get me upvotes so someone takes notice to this mistake please.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-02-01T01:54:27.433+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"You present this as if you were, for a fact, banned for streaming software.\n\nYou don't get banned for streaming software.

(Just guessing here mind you.)  From watching one or two recent streamers, I have noticed that some of the streaming software used, provided indications of where certain shots might land, ranges of skillshots, etc.  Sure, it might not be scripting as such from the player's perspective - but it could constitute an unfair advantage were the streamer also to see the streamed content.\n\nMoreover, if you were running a 3rd party software program at the same time as doing the stream, and it is recognized by Riot as granting a user an advantage, then you could well have triggered a scripting flag.\n\nThat could be enough for a ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2017-02-01T14:09:58.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats not streaming software, that's scripting software","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-02-01T00:54:39.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to provide some additional information in the more likely event that they didn't make a mistake, it's highly unlikely a recording software triggered an illegal app/modification flag which resulted in your ban.\n\nWhat specific applications do you use while playing League? Sometimes players will use X program's feature for a harmless modification, but if that program has illegal feature built in the entire thing is off limits (Mkjogo for example).\n\nDo you share your computer with anyone else that plays League, play on a public computer, have you ever shared your account information with someone else or use the same login info for other games/accounts which may have been compromised?
