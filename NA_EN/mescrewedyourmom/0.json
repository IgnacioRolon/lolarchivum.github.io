I blame him then he reports me for toxic? This lee is trolling and being toxic to me as well, but our teammate duo with him so they all report me then I got banned, my honour level dropped to lv 0. \r\nWhat should I do with this case?? My jungle is trolling and taking my farm, I can not blame, I can not afk, and I got banned because they are duo??\r\nIs this how you treat the solo player?? Don't you think the lee has to banned as well?\r\n\r\nBeing a jungle don't bring smite, toxic to mid lane player, taking mid lane's farm, and rage quit for the last 10 mins(we could win but he rages quit).\r\n\r\nI request Riot stuff to recheck this case, go check the chat log and replay, don't just ban me because they were a group player. Be fair, okay??","replies":[{"poster":"AutumnË‡","date":"2019-12-07T22:46:32.214+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This game taught us don't play alone and we should suffer other's faults? funny","replies":[]},{"poster":"Clockwork Mouse","date":"2019-12-03T20:44:23.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Should have just played along with him.
