I think the system messed up and thinks it redeemed but i still have no rp from the card. I restarted the client several times any suggestions to get it to work?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-21T18:25:35.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll have to take a closer look at this, so I recommend reaching out in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
