Improvements to another system, LeaverBuster, will tune and upgrade its ability to further address ranked play, ensuring aggressive and severe consequences to maintain the competitive, sportsmanlike spirit of the mode.\n\nSource: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/upgrading-tribunal\n\nThe new Tribunal is still a work in progress and Riot is making progress on the system. I don't know much more about the Tribunal changes than the information provided above.

When I look at a player's profile who disconnects/quits, I ultimately don't see a series of gray bars that say \"Leave\", but rather see blues and reds. Leaverbuster restricts players who leave on a regular basis, and as it is a relatively automated system, the efficiency of the system is much better than the Tribunal's.","replies":[{"poster":"Im Genie","date":"2015-06-10T20:23:26.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
