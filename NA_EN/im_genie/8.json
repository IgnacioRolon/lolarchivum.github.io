He keep attending in ranked game and it won't stop right there. riot should has auto ban if he played over 2 games and get reported from others.\n\ni have a link the record, i couldn't stand any longer, if i can show u guys what he said in game, i will because he wanted to do it. i happen to me everyday. i tried to check another one get reported after 3 or 6 days, he was still there for nothing happens.\n","replies":[]}
