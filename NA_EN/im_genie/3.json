Some players using G-Sync displays have reported that turning off G-Sync has resolved their FPS issues. Other players are using the Nvidia **375.xx** drivers, which have been causing unstable FPS. If you're running this driver, I *strongly recommend* rolling back to an [earlier driver](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us) or one of the newer **376.xx** drivers.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BamBamxxxx","date":"2016-12-06T01:44:11.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been experiencing split second FPS drops. I recently upgraded my graphic drivers, and Nvidia drivers are well known to often be unstable, so I'm trying to see if that might be the cause.
