My last game with a little kid get toxic by someone in team and she stay in base over 10 mins, just cause she knew that if she afks they will vote remake and she gets penalty. That&#039;s why she just go around the base and did nothing. That&#039;s worse than Afk cuz u cant do anything with them.\r\nIf riot can add kick button in game with 4 votes (for both team) they won&#039;t do any bad things in game as toxic, feeding, harass or stay and do nothing","replies":[]}
