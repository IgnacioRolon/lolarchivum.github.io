But there is no such thing as a troll pick in the rules.\n\nFor example, it was not  too long ago that picking nautilus or sion support was an extreme troll pick... until people realized hey... it works.\n\nAnd yes, while you can counter and say. well what about something like, sona jungle or support evelynn. Something that has a high chance of just no success at all.  Its important to realize there is not rule against it. Because out there, there is probably someone who could actually pull it off.\n\nAs far as riot can control... no champion can NOT be played in any role. They do this to allow freedom to the players.","replies":[]}]}
