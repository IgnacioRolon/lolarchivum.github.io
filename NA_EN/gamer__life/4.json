You cant speak to anyone at Riot. Only way to to go though the support staff and they are useless. Try sending a complain in and you get ignored by the support staff. Try and get any problems sort all the support staff is give how they have had the same problem, yet they do nothing to sort it. They want you to buy skins but when comes down to anything else you get ignored! Good job Riot!","replies":[]}
