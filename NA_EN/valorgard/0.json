I'd run through the steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure your network is setup in the best way, and if it happens *a lot*, I would definitely switch to an ethernet cable instead of wifi.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-12-11T15:32:01.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried reinstalling the client?
