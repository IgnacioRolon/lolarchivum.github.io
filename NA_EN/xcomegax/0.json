Whether the existence of such accounts is open for debate, bans are a great tool to prevent them from ever becoming too popular.\n> - Bans also prevent facing the same character several times in a row. Just played against a Varus or a Jhin that made your life miserable? Wanna play again and be 100% sure you won't face them? Drop a ban.\n> - Bans can also help if you're getting the same character several times in a row. Some very strange times, you get Mao'Kai twice. What are the odds, right? Well, you can just ban him and not even risk it.\n> \n> To all the mods reading this: **The post is not just people wanting bans, but plenty of people discussing the issue. There's plenty of content alright in the posts that also happen to be asking for votes up.**\n\n","replies":[]}
