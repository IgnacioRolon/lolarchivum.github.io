I main support and I play Nami a lot. Recently around when Bard was released, it seemed that Nami&#039;s Ebb and Flow only works half its healing capacity for allies. When in game (Summoner&#039;s Rift or ARAM) I check how much it is supposed to heal and when I heal an ally, they get half of what they should actually be healed for. I tested this in a custom match with a bot, and it sometimes heals full and sometimes it heals half.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-05-15T23:31:13.263+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just want to be sure that you are aware that they debuffed all healing in ARAM to only work for 50%?","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Volibear","date":"2015-05-16T01:52:24.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He said he tested it with a bot though, and you can't use bots on Howling Abyss.  Weird.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-05-16T01:56:11.664+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"His report is not very detailed and he has not a single screenshot or a video. He said he did it in both ARAM and SR, and said sometimes it's half sometimes it is full; without him providing anything else, it's not a stretch to think he was seeing half on HA and full on SR.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-16T00:06:01.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, if you're only seeing reduced healing on Howling Abyss, this is working as intended.","replies":[]}]}]}
