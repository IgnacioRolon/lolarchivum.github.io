It keeps freezing ingame between min 19 and 20, not always at the same time but always in this 1 min. It just freezes and I have to kill it with the task manager to close it and reconnect afterwards. I already went through everything of the [Troubleshooting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) but it didnt really helped. It doesnt matter if I run it in fullscreen, borderless-fullscreen or windowed.\r\n\r\nHere are my specs: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5yu6q884l4fgel9/specs.txt?dl=0\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nmono","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-11T19:06:39.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on Windows 10?  There's been an issue where an update auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which caused freezing for some players.  Try disabling that in addition to the guide you went over.
