Some particles that have shimmer in them are getting changed and these heavily effect my fps. Like the glow of Illaois weapon or Nunus w or Bards Magical Journey and a few more. And there are more of them every Patch. These effects are now looking like many dots/little squares arranged in rows and columns. There are other glowy effects like Ekkos trail to his Ultimate clone, wich are not glowing in this specific way. They look much more like one area, not single Pixels.\r\n\r\nI have gone through all steps explained in the Fps guide but even if i play on the lowest Settings possible i can only reach around 10 fps with these effects on my screen. But if none of these effects are on screen i have fps around the 90s. Im playing on an old iMac and i know these are not the main focus. Just asking if there is an intended fix to this or not. A possible solution could be that there is an option in the game settings to turn these effects off or reduce their quality to a minimum. I hope my intend in this post/request is clear.\r\n\r\nEnglish is just my third language so i know its hard to read and i apologize for it. Thanks for reading anyways :D","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-30T20:19:31.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear about the issues you're having here, and that the guide didn't help.  :(  Download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) in this case to grab some logs for context, and attach it to a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
