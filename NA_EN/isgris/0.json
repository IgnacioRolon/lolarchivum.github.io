I honestly couldn't see what card i was picking while looking at the champion model almost at all. Had to try to look at the w ability witch limited the gameplay a lot.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua8f_0Q199s","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ua8f_0Q199s/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"All cards are showing when pressing w. Makes it impossible to choose the right card when watching the model. Maybe this bug is only on this skin? Personally tested Classic - Horrowing skin and this. Unluckily Cutpurse was the only one i had to play a ranked with. Hope this gets fixed, or at least people get to know about it","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-09T18:36:51.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Isgris -\n\nThanks for the report!
