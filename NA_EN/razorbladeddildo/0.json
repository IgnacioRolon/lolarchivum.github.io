At first it was a bug splat issue during a ranked game that forced me to restart my computer. Next when i try to start games the client stays but the game window disappears (why we have 2 windows i don't know) If the game crashes the \"reconnect\" button no longer appears when i restart the client. What the heck was in that last update? This latest attempt to start I got an error message that said \"riot doesnt detect an internet connection\" then the client rolled back the update to the previous version and when i opened it again it auto updated and DISAPPEARED AGAIN. It's still running in the background but I can't access it. I've played this game (not on this account) for 4 years now without issue. 1 of those years on this computer which I bought new. Did the repair, i have the logs, I submitted a ticket but its been almost a week and I'm kinda pissed that this happens right when I hit 30 on this account and start attempting ranked games.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-29T02:21:47.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like your connection to the servers is pretty unstable.
