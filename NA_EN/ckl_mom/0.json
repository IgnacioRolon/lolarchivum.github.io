While I understand it may work for you personally, Riot decided the low success rate wasn't worth the system's continued existence, and cut the experiment.\n\nAs for removing chat entirely? You could, but I believe Riot is operating on the basis that it has enough money -- it doesn't need people playing the game if the only way they can be civil is to be denied the ability to communicate at all.
