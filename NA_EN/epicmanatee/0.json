I've been going through some shit IRL and I tend to take out my frustration on the people I'm playing with when they make even minor mistakes. I'm kinda confused though, because I thought you are supposed to get a warning? Then if you continue being bad after the warning you get banned. I got no warning, and I would have stopped if I got one. This really fucking sucks for me because I spent money on the worlds mission pass thing so I could get the Golden Championship Ashe Chroma and Ward, and I can't get it if I can't play the missions. Thanks for taking my money Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Jikker","date":"2020-01-05T19:15:32.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please do not necro old threads as doing so violates the [**Board Universal Rules**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/ITFIpNUE).

Now your warning is two tiers of chat restrictions before your 14 day punishment unless you showed extreme toxicity such as racism, hate speech, or encouragement of self harm.","replies":[{"poster":"EpicManatee","date":"2017-10-15T18:15:27.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that sucks. I'm kinda toxic in general but I get very very toxic when people piss me off, which happens frequently since basically everybody in this game is at least somewhat toxic.\n\nSkipping punishments feels really unfair regardless of the supposed severity of toxicity. I have never had any problems before, and never had any warnings. The only problem is how I communicate in chat, so give me a chat restriction and then there are no problems going forward. Plus If I am given a chat restriction I will have a good chance to practice remaining calm while playing. With a ban I get no chance to practice or learn before I am expected to go back into the game fully reformed.\n\nIt doesn't make much sense why they would stop doing message warnings. I think most people would stop their behavior if they got an actual warning like that. I definitely would have stopped if I got one. I would have just unbound the enter key so I couldn't talk. Ugh.","replies":[{"poster":"19348180DEL1","date":"2017-10-15T18:35:25.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason they won't give you a warning is because you didn't heed the first warnings. If everyone knew they'd get a final warning (not like 14-day ban is not a big enough warning) then they'd be toxic up to the last warning and then settle down.\n\nThat's not fair to the playerbase that is not at all negative. To know that Riot would intentionally say \"Well he hasn't gotten his final warning yet so we won't ban him\" is like saying \"The people sending the reports? They don't matter. Only you do.\" would be bad on their part. They are doing it right.\n\nTake it for what it is. Reform. Reform or get banned.\n______________________________________\nAlso, if we are negative in a vast majority of our games, there is a chance, great or small, that we positively will cause someone else to be negative from our brush with them. Negative to whom is not the matter, the matter is that our negativity will have rubbed off on someone else and we would start a chain reaction of reports.\n\nIn a business where its a free product... People are important and you have to keep the vast majority happy.\n\nThe needs of the many outweigh the consistently toxic few.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-10-15T18:30:56.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do you need Riot's warning when you already know you're reactions range from \"kinda toxic\" to \"very very toxic\"?

Your very first warning comes with a message that you've been reported consistently negative behavior.\n\nYou get about 2-3 Chat Restrictions\n\nYou get a 14-day Ban.\n\nIf severe enough, player reports can then trigger the Perma-ban.\n\nThe idea is that your irritating people and that people are voicing out against your actions. For whatever reason. Whether or not those reasons are legit or not is not the issue, but triggering the automated system takes a lot of doing.\n\nIf the timeframe is short enough, you're report pool gets more and more sensitive, so its not like just 1 or 2 games or 1 or 2 people reporting you is going to trigger this.\n\nIf you're lucky and its just a 14-day ban... I recommend taking that 14 day ban as a vacation.\n\nThe next thing that comes is the Permaban and it is extremely difficult to lift than the others (nigh impossible without really good reasons like technical issues on their end or a dire emergency that you can somehow prove).","replies":[]}]}
