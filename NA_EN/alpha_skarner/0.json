I have the Voice Volume at 100%, but whenever he talks, in both forms, his voice is so quiet. Not only that, but for some odd reason his voice would randomly jump back up to its normal volume for one line of dialogue before dropping back down to his quiet whispery voice. Does anyone know whats the cause of this or experience the same issue? I love Project Yi&#039;s voice so much and I want to know how to fix it so I can hear his badass voice again!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-22T21:13:12.376+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Alpha Skarner! \n\nWe're in the process of seeing what we can do to raise the volume. Since it's a legendary skin, there's a bit more to it than just moving a slider. We're hoping to have this completed soon, but it's certainly on our radar!","replies":[{"poster":"cocacolalips","date":"2016-02-23T00:26:14.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you could have a look at DJ Sona too, that would be great.\n\nHer 3 background unique musics are inaudible.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-23T20:56:07.775+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the case of Sona, she gains layers of music as she levels up/uses skills. When she dies, layers fall off, which may be why it's not as loud as you'd expect. \n\nReally obvious question - do you have the volume controls turned up?","replies":[{"poster":"cocacolalips","date":"2016-02-24T03:47:55.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I do.\n\nIs the volume the same for the person who plays Sona and the 4 other players on her team?\n\nBecause It's my experience playing with someone else who plays as Sona with this skin, and every time I ask them, they agree. \n\nEven with everything set to the maximum (both in game and out of the game volume settings), Sona's musics are really difficult to hear (barely) and as soon as some action is happening, spell effects, characters voices, announcements, whatever, it gets lost instantly in all the noise.\n\nI did not know about the progressive ramp up of the volume as you play more, I can't recall any difference, I don't think it's very noticeable.\n\nIt's the only noise that I have trouble hearing at all, I would have to guess it's the skin. And it's a real shame because that skin looks awesome, but without the music, it must have been a real let down for all the people who bought it (and to some extent, the persons on their team)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"im trying","date":"2016-02-23T07:57:16.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought I was the only one with that problem. I really hope they are able to fix this, I play PROJECT: Yi almost everyday and his voice over is one of the best in the game. \n\nYou know that there are 'move' quotes and 'attack' quotes right? When Yi says a 'move' quote, his voice is REALLY quiet, however, when he says an 'attack' quote, his voice volume is normal. And his quotes when he is in his ultimate are also REALLY quiet. This is the problem I'm having.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KillerBurak601","date":"2016-02-22T22:48:47.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried to inform you for whole 2 months but atleast its on your radar.
