I'm experiencing some sick lagspikes after 6.9 patch. My connection was always decent ( Eune , 60mbps download speed ) But when this patch came out it make the game unplayable for me. I'm getting lagspikes constantly (around 100-150 ms ).It works If I play on wired connection but in Wifi it sucks.. Riot what happened ? ( I'm already in touch with 1 Rioter IT guy but he didnt reply for a whole day so I guess he doesnt have any idea what is the problem. )","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-11T21:42:48.090+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This definitely sucks and is not something we want you to have at all when trying to play League.  Keep in mind though that these issues do not seem related to the latest patch, even though there seems to be strong correlation.  Patches that we release may change how the game itself works, but it does not affect the connection your computer has to the individual game server.  This is not to say the problem is on your end, it may very well be on Riots, but we need to start eliminating root causes so we can find the culprit.\n\nBefore anything else, I need to talk about wifi connections -- they are inherently unstable and are ***not recommended*** to be used with League of Legends.  We can help you troubleshoot a little bit, but due to the nature of wifi the first step will always be to get off wifi if possible.  For the OP, since it works perfectly fine in wired, but not on wifi, the root cause does appear to be the wifi itself.\n\nIf there lag spikes persist consistently, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).  It should help to resolve these spikes and will also allow us to start eliminating the most common root causes so we can dig further.\n\nLet me know if you are still experiencing issues!","replies":[{"poster":"D0RłMÁRÜ","date":"2016-05-12T15:18:47.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe the servers have some issue?? because me, and almost all lol palyers i know experinced the same problem, good internet, but the MS wont go lower then 100. Too much of a coincidence.

However, these are incredibly rare, and if you experience issues game to game, it is very unlikely to be a fault of the game servers. This is why we want to eliminate as many root causes as possible!\n\nAlso, I would caution using the argument that people posting in Help and Support indicate a larger issue.  Consider walking into a doctor's office.  Everyone in the waiting room is sick, but just because the waiting room (like Help and Support) is full of sick people, does not mean everyone or the majority of the population is sick.  We want to take these issues on one at a time and get these resolved ASAP!","replies":[{"poster":"Twizty","date":"2016-05-12T21:50:37.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i mean and by no disrespect i work for a ISP , im having issues as well with this connectivity problem did a ticket did all the networking the whole 9 yards , none of that work , i pinged my modem at work , no packet loss , i checked my DBMVS coming from the pole to the house when im at work all solid no signal leakage , changed out my modem , still the same issue , updated all my drivers . nothing running in the back ground . and im still experiencing this issue from a week ago when 6.9 hit . before than it worked fine . i understand the whole troubleshooting policy and guidlines lol trust me . but when a customer calls me ive done everything to my own account for my isp that i would give my customer . so i do not know if you all are having packet routing issues or what but the connection from your servers to us and vise versa are not the same as it was before.

Been trying to get help on this forum for an entire week. I've about given up, which must be Riot's desire. So many people have said they've been playing for years with no connectivity issues until patch 6.9 but nothing is being done to fix it. I can't play ranked at all and even normal aren't enjoyable because of these horrible, crippling lag spikes. They are not on my end, at all. I've run internet speed tests, flushed dns / followed troubleshooting, and no other web service (including streaming) or other video games (overwatch, magic online, dota 2) are affected by ANY LAG WHATSOEVER. My ping in game is always 60-70 but occasionally it spikes to 300-5,000 ms. \n\nI am in dire need of help, but i'm feeling so apathetic because I doubt it will come.","replies":[{"poster":"SherlockYue","date":"2016-05-11T20:56:18.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, before patch 6.9 everything was just fine, now I can only use wire to play the game instead of wifi which is super inconvenient.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vacus","date":"2016-05-11T20:52:18.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having packet loss instead of crippling ping spikes, but same deal.\n\nWeirdly, mine always seems to go away after a while.
