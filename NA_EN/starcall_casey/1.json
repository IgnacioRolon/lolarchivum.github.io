Then this stuff started to happen. Everything on my computer runs fine, and League runs fine. The only weird thing is, is that in Task Manager, it's process will shoot from the normal 500MB to 1200-1500MB in the Memory section and freeze/crash on me. Like, I don't get lag or anything. Just 8 hours later, boom, it freezes up.\n\nIt has never run up that high in a few hours before. It literally started happening after this current patch. It's even been happening to one of my friends I play with often, but the League client doesn't seem to crash on me as much as it does on me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Positioning King","date":"2015-03-04T18:03:37.537+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The LoL client... changed and glitched your wallpaper?\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb and say you have an *actual* virus, as well as having League installed.

Try also using something like Malwarebytes Antimalware (it has a free version) and run a full scan. It shouldn't interfere with AVG, and it only runs (free version at least) when you specifically tell it to.\n\nGood luck on fixing things.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"burzum aar√ªrz","date":"2015-04-05T18:08:28.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a big problem with LoL Client too. When i install it, its attached to it a batch file that delets LoL. Its saves the batch file in AppData so everytime i turn my computer on, it delets League of Legends. It was getting super anoying becuase apparently, it created annother batch file that used the time on my computer to see if the batch that deletes League of Legends was still there, and if i tryed to erase it, it would creat annother one that also deleted LoL. I downloaded Comodo Firewall because the firewall has a option to block certain programs from enterfering with another programs, in a way that it blocked the batch file, but didnt erased it. That way i could stop the problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TornVenom","date":"2015-03-04T07:39:55.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I was invited to a match after trying several times to start my own and the status changed to red and said could not connect to pvp server.
