With lower base attack speed, diana doesnt benefit as much from attack speed as other champion with high attack speed.","replies":[{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2015-10-05T20:07:08.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a bit counterintuitive and/or restrictive though. Diana is a character that has a three-shot proc on her auto-attacks and a lot of sticking power. She naturally dives head first into fights and tries to assassinate a target, but she's gimped trying to tap into her more auto-attack oriented playstyle because buying Nashor's on her isn't as efficient as building it on Teemo, Kayle, Azir or anyone else. But they gave her a band-aid increased 20% attack speed as part of her passive, which entirely negates the point and misleads players into thinking she's meant to build some attack speed. It's weird.","replies":[{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-10-05T22:20:59.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's because she was meant to be a jungler and they wanted to have as much control over her clearing power as possible (ex: AS runes are a lot less effective, but as a baseline Diana clears well). It's really just a lever to pull.\n\nAlso her base AS isn't really that low at 0.625","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-10-05T19:11:33.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just pink ward the debuff!
