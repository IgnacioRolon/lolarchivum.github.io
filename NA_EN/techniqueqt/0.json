I tried everything, downloaded a bunch of things I really didn't need, wasted like three days of my life trying to figure out what's wrong but nothing seems to work!? My logins are normal, I go to que but after I select my champion, instead of loading screen, it brings me to this  blackscreen for about 10 seconds then it tells me that I have to check my network connection!? my connection is fine, ever since that 6.15 update I've been having this problem. Please fix ASAP. thanks","replies":[]}]}
