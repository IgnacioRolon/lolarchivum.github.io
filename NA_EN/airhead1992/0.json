We're stuck here trying to do grass roots product testing without any technical documentation.   Pisses me off.  Just when I think I have the answer, the problem rears it's ugly head again.  Just in here to get in on the class-action against the vulture capitalists who will buy Rito at fire sale prices when they jump the shark for good.  On a side note: Leaverbuster is still broken AI.  it should at least communicate with bugsplat or check the error logs to determine that a game crash does not equate to AFK behavior.   Has anybody from Rito commented here yet?  Since they employ systems engineers and windows specialists, perhaps they could pass along a tip, whether it's LoL's bug fault or not.
