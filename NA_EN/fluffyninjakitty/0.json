Was this the game with Miss Fortune?  It looks like it may have resulted in a disappearing game, meaning it could have crashed.  In this case, it would act as if it never existed so your stats should be okay.  Let me know if that's the case.","replies":[{"poster":"Im Naut Tilted ","date":"2017-06-21T19:23:17.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just had the same issue but I was in an ARAM game playing Darius.

After Pick and Ban when the game starts I only get a blackscreen with an information that says i couldn't connect to the game. Even reconnecting doesn't work and after i close the Client I cant even log in anymore because of \"incorrect password\" even tough I have entered the right one. After some time the Client shows a message about some problems with the patch and that the launcher tries to reinstall an older one but nothing has happend since. Even reinstalling doesn't fix the problem for me. After a few hours the launcher works fine again for 2-3 game and then the same problem occurs over and over again. So I have no clue whats going on and i lost about 4 ranked games due to that. I guess I just stop playing for now until there is a fix available.\n\nEDIT: I even got a Leaverbuster for a bug in the Client, feels bad man.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LEBRON JAME5","date":"2017-05-21T04:09:33.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same thing happened to me! I got kicked from the loading screen of my game (literally the last game of my promos), and I cannot get back into the client now for an \"incorrect password\".
