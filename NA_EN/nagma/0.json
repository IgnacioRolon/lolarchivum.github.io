Or you would like one to act as damage and the other as utility?\n\nMiasma is useless. At least, when I played her last it felt like that. Small aoe, negligible damage per tick, slow does not feel significant, very small aoe... it's biggest use for me was the free vision - Q does everything W does and does it better.\n\nIf I may suggest some potential thoughts, RiotRepertoir, I'd like to reexplore the identity of Cass. Who does Riot think her to be? Who does Riot want her to be? \n\nCass is Kat's sister but she is not the same. She is not an assassin with extreme burst & mobility. She is almost an antithesis of Kat, in mage form. Yet the current hypercarry 500+ stack kit is basically making her do extreme burst. That shouldn't happen. Cass is not a sword, she is a sweet poison. Not sharp or pointy but a corrosive acid. Her gameplay, her essence is subtle, gradual, and ultimately terrifying. She is not a femme fatale, but rather a siren slowing singing sailors beneath the sorry, salty seas, smiling all the while. \n\nTo me, killing is just a job for Kat. She enjoys the the action, sure - the thrill, the chase, the dancing with knives only to escape like a legend. But it's just the family trade, she is the eldest Noxian and her father's legacy. Yet Cass chose what she became; she had another available path and she didn't take it. Suffering is her life. It is her pleasure, her goal. After her tragic disfigurement due to a broken oath over a strangely serpentine sword - no offense, but her role in the new Shurima lore feels to me like bullshit - she has become the seductress, the schemer, the secretress. \n\nSo let's make a kit that reflects that. Right now Cass feels like a mage Nasus. You just wait for stacks - passive - and then spam low cd abilities - namely e. That is the game play. Her ult feels out of place too, both with her identity and kit due to the unreliable nature of the stun and its relatively long cooldown. Her e is so broken - restores mana on kill, increases poison damage, spell vamps, -  whereas her w is meaningless. \n\nCass deserves a kit which does not boast of immediate power at any point of the game, but rather of assured reliability. I don't mean technically; I mean such that her damage does not depend on a time-based/confrontational passive (which isn't even her style). Maybe this isn't making sense; if so, I apologize. I just want to get all of my thoughts down and open so I can better articulate what is in my head.\n\nI really like the comparison to singed. I don't think his kit should be copied, but the uniqueness of his gameplay - the way he broke the meta, completely flouted conventions to pursue his own goals and have confidence in them, was so refreshing, so satisfying, and _Singed_. Cass merits a similar unique identity (hell, all the champs really should, so please stop with the three stack passives and &health true damage). When you play Kat her identity is clear and transparent and so damn godlike when you execute her skills with the mastery she worked so damn hard to obtain. An expert assassin with a very hypercarry feel on an ult reset. You are rewarding players for doing what Kat should and punishing them when they don't do it well. We should ensure the same happens to Cass in regards to satisfaction and association with her identity and gameplay.\n\nBut it is easy for me to talk and very hard to actually construct a kit. I recognize this and I apologize if it seems I am un-understanding.\nAllow me to point out what to me are flaws in her current kit:\n\n-Ridiculously bad passive\nIt needs to be under her control, not some time-based aspect which seems so randomly created. Furthermore, constant confrontation doesn't seem her style, but more like Kat's. When a viper strikes, it strikes once. And then slithers away confident in its prey's demise. Snakes, scorpions, and spiders share those scheming qualities - let the passive reflect it.\nI have no ideas about thsi right now, but I'm sure something will come up. Maybe something with shedding skins - something like Anivia egg except different. When she has lost say more than 70% of her health, she can channel for a few seconds and \"shed a skin\". All it does is restore some health - dependent on her bonus health - and restore all amor/magic resist values, removing any defensive debuffs.\nThere is obviously some sort of internal cooldown and can be broken by cc - she can't use it in combat, and if she uses it in lane she will lose some time/control. But it gives her a way to compete with harass/sustain as an immobile DoT mage.\n\n-Actually a great Q\nI really like how Q is right now. I think it does just what it should - low cd, scaling DoT, and gives ms on champion hit. The last part is great and huge - offers utility that is indirect, by which I mean flexible. Can be used for either offense or defense. Really like it rght now.\n\n- A \"near subpar ability to Q\" W\nThis offers nothing except free vision and a slow which is just not significant enough. I propose Miasma to have a larger radius, time-scaling damage damage, lasts longer, larger cd, much more significant mana cost and with some sort of utility effect that feels utterly useless in the first two seconds but is devastating after 5 or 6. Devastating in light of her other abilities.\nPerhaps, it releases a poison gas cloud which first slows then blinds then briefly knocks down. Or perhaps it melts magic resist with a debuff whose duration and severity depend on how long the targets stood in miasma, with both getting worse and getting worse _worser_ every second the targets remain in Miasma. Regardless, its like a Malzahar W except the damage is not constant over time but heavily skewed depending on time, and comes with a utility effect that seems insignificant at 1/2 s but can only be ignored at one's peril 4 or 5 seconds in.\nAlso, larger CD to ensure Cass uses it well and positions appropriately. Move the free vision to Q.\n\n-Currently Obscenely Broken E\nYou gotta scrap this mate. At least, the current spamming aspect to it. I'ts just not her. She is not a Ryze to faceroll the keys.\nI love the fact it restores mana (on kill) and enhances poison damage. But maybe, E is like a \"mark\" ability. She can choose monster/champion to mark, which causes all poison damage to deal additional X% of itself as %health true damage. I like this ability having both a passive and active - with the passive giving slight mana regen buff on minion/monster kill, perhaps a significant damage evasion buff on champ kill. Nothing on assist - Cass is a proud woman; she likes to be the one her victims think of last, and the only one. The mark ability is NOT fixed, but free to shift but it has a price. Damage she takes from the target gives her a taste of her own medicine and it burns her health too.\n\n- Really Out of Place R\nIt doesn't feel right to me. Perhaps, I am in the minority here, but I don't think she deserves any hard CC on her ult like that. Her ult is too Medusa/Ekans Paralyze mode. It should be distinct from Ahri and her charm as well. Perhaps, it should be like a seductive, secretive, smiling, singing siren. Its obvious I like that image, but I think it befits her style. And her ult should equally awe and terror inducing, beauty on the outside and unimaginable horror and pain on the inside.\n\nHopefully, this is helpful. I'm trying to give some of my insights and i'd love to continue this conversation further if it would be of use to you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oerba No Naja","date":"2016-01-20T08:43:23.464+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like them to work on the same purpose ' poisoning and dmgs ' \nbut with new different mechanics on both poison , so twin fangs and her ult could interact in some way depending the poison .\nCassio could be a interresting champion , actually her kit is boring and toxic .","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-01-20T10:45:50.023+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Toxic.\nHue.","replies":[{"poster":"OmegaTree119","date":"2016-01-20T19:58:27.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nagoh Shan","date":"2016-01-21T07:36:15.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If she's going to scale and remain a Hypercarry type champ, her W can't really be utility.\n\nBut you guys can be tricky, and make an ability a damage threat that feels appropriate.\n\nExample Miasma:\n\nCassiopeia launches a Miasma at a target location for 7s granting vision. The Miasma slows units, applies Grevious wounds, and grows in size over time. \n\nThe first enemy champion effected, that is not already infected, is infected by the Miasma refreshing it's duration, causing it to follow the infected champion, and affecting enemy units in it's radius (think Zilean bomb, but a poison cloud). \n\nEnemy champions affected by the Miasma take damage whenever they deal damage/are dealt damage/Use an ability/attack/are attacked/move x units/insert some other triggering effect that I missed (not all effects need to be used, just providing examples of possible triggers) If the infected enemy dies before the duration of the Miasma ends, their Miasma disappears.\n\nI think a mixture of visions is needed in order to move on. A hyper-scaling DoT mage that is target agnostic, and not much of a lane bully in the early levels, but scales well with time (if that makes sense) acting as sort of a Mage Nasus.

Q should be focused more into a damage threat imo, use that as the basis for the whole poison-dot theme of her. w should be made into more of a utility spell though.

(debilitating meaning like how it does now it slows, but the longer the enemy remains in the aoe the harsher the slow, and to not make it generic maybe after a certain period of staying in the poison make the effects grow worse, like mr shred/dmg reduc./etc., just something other than a mere slow and a little dmg to make it so that the enemy REALLY does not want to stand there for too long.) e and r are fine for the most part, though e may need a small dmg nerf as q is getting a dmg buff, and her passive tbh idk what to do with it, so I'll leave that up in the air to decide as to what to do with it, though I personally like it a bit rn.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"magic pole","date":"2016-01-19T20:50:55.136+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh man...that classic cass splash \n\n{{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanjie","date":"2016-01-19T19:07:02.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"She's probably not included in it.","replies":[{"poster":"Oerba No Naja","date":"2016-01-19T21:30:49.830+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"rip{{champion:69}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2016-01-20T01:03:02.764+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"man i miss that old splash the current one is ugly its worse than the new {{champion:55}} and {{champion:114}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-01-20T05:00:15.776+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Good lord.\n\nHer old splash was so much better.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Nagma","date":"2016-01-20T15:59:32.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i replaced the old splash instead of the current one thanks wooxy","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2016-01-20T02:47:18.729+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I half agree and half, disagree.

That would of course require lowering the number of stacks a bit and increasing the mana per stack to balance things out. I think it's worth rewarding people for actually interacting with stuff and not incentivizing them to cast spells just for stacks at the fountain and while just walking places. I also feel that it should reach max stacks slightly faster than it does now, though that may need to accompany a small ryze nerf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2016-01-20T16:36:36.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm as it is I think {{champion:69}}  fills a pretty similar role as {{champion:13}} being immobile but high DPS mages with medium range","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miraweave","date":"2016-01-19T19:03:17.427+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":7,"body":"Do you people not realize that her Q base damage literally wasn't changed with the rework and her E was *by far* her main source of damage pre rework just as it is now?\n\nWhat the rework did was make it harder to spam Q to force people out of lane, and that's because a champion who scales extremely well into the lategame shouldn't be a massive lane bully.

The ratio did because the ratio was retarded.\n\nThe point I'm making is that Cass wasn't ever a 'poison mage'. Twin Fang has always been the most important ability in her kit.\n\nShe's also still a totally reasonable champion right now. She's got a tough earlygame, but then she finishes an item and a half and is a monster.","replies":[{"poster":"Nagma","date":"2016-01-19T19:20:30.952+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know she was in \" viable \" during all the season 5 , but meta shifted assasin , shorter game ect ... blabla  46 % global winrate and played by cass mains ( 2% pick rate )  bla bla .. \n\nwhatever healty # balanced  , her current kit is just retarded and boring / awful to play .she is toxic to play and to play against \nAnd i feel like the mage update is the opportunity to make her change . the most of the immobile mages ( things like vel koz )  are fine in term of balance   but it doesnt mean they cant get a rework .
