It is the same shape when executing a ping.  This bug causes me to not be able to utilize my pings in anyway and prevents me from clicking on the minimap as well as clicking on enemies to see their stats and items.  After enough time with the bug it eventually corrects itself but then with more combos the bug presents itself again.  I can&#039;t figure out what button combos are initiating the bug but its very easy to replicate.  Just play a game with rekenton and see for yourself.  \r\nPlease fix as I cannot easily communicate with team via alert pings, utilize the minimap, nor can I click on my enemies to find item info on them.","replies":[{"poster":"Dunkrius2g","date":"2015-06-14T06:43:25.202+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can confirm.
