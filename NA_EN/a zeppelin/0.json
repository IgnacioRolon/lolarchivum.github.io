Would you be able to provide video/more information in terms of what was going on right before this occurred?","replies":[{"poster":"A Zeppelin","date":"2017-05-31T01:04:49.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I downloaded the replay and looked back at it, and, unfortunately/fortunately (depending on how you look at it), the bug didn't reoccur. I can't say I recall when I remember this happening, and I don't believe it did occur when I said it did in the original post (after a gank from Nidalee in the bot lane). The picture was taken after 10 minutes in, and I don't think there was any special interaction between me or anyone in the game. It just kinda happened. Maybe it's just a weird, rare occurrence that, for some reason, everyone in the game could see.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-05-31T19:31:32.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really appreciate you taking the time to check out the reply (weird things can happen, and you may know better than I if/when it occurred, haha). It may have been a one time deal, but if everyone can see it, it's not something personally wrong with your local files. \n\nLemme have some folks dig around a bit more and see if we can get some sort of a repro. That overlay looks like it may be related to her when she levels up her ult, or maybe something odd happened with the recall. Either way, we can check it out again.\n\nThanks for the additional context!","replies":[{"poster":"A Zeppelin","date":"2017-06-01T02:40:59.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I looked through the replay again, and it happened twice when I wasn't looking, so I'll keep looking through it and see if I can't identify any weird interactions between me and someone else.","replies":[{"poster":"A Zeppelin","date":"2017-06-01T02:57:30.088+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe I found the issue. Lulu polymorphed me in the middle of my auto attack animation, and you can even see that, in my polymorphed form, I was glowing blue in certain areas, and the blue shining part of the gun there as well. I'm just surprised at how well that was timed, because that's like a split second window for that to happen. \n\nHere's the video link by the way, it's unlisted:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLonddnezNY&feature=youtu.be\n\n*Edit: Sorry for recording at x0.25 speed, I just thought it might be helpful to see it in really slow motion.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-06-01T16:36:49.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ohhhh dammit. Lulu's Polymorph doesn't play nice with *anything* in the game because of how it works behind the scenes. *No, it isn't coded as a minion.*\n\nThanks for looking into this more.
