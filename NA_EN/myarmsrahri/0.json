I feel like it was an admin that banned me for an argument that i chose to be the bigger person and mute him. Can you please help me understand? I've spent several hundreds of dollars on skins on my account and i'd really appreciate an understanding. Also, can you please post what the other person said to me and explain how i get banned when he was worse than anything i said? He provoked everything and then I get banned?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nMyArmsRahri","replies":[{"poster":"Hazy Shade","date":"2019-05-05T21:24:13.875+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure.

You can fucking say any fucking shit you want in-game and you'll never be punished for it.  Only when you turn that \"fuck\" into \"fuck you\" will that get you banned.  In any case, it is irrelevant to your punishment.  I'm just letting you know that cuss word alone do not get people punished.\n\nYou did engaged in quite a bit of flaming.  This chat log is fairly mild, but still toxic albeit mild.  If you have a pattern of this type of mild behavior in majority of your games and you've already had the 10 and 25 chat restriction, then the punishment is 14-day ban.  If this is perma, then you must already had the 14-day.  Do not think of it as THIS chat log got you banned.  Think of it as this chat log PLUS the previous punishments got you banned because that is how Rito's punishment system work.  Your past toxic/punishment history ALWAYS get taken into consideration when issuing next punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"MyArmsRAhri","date":"2019-05-06T19:53:45.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Can you please help me get unbanned?
