Recently, the game was working fine for a while and then mid game would freeze and force my computer to restart.\r\n\r\nThis has now developed into making my computer crash by just having the client open, not even logged in yet! It survives for a minute or so and then force reboots, often causing weird things to happen on the laptop screen, such as horizontal lines and a weird flickering, and displacement of screen, before force rebooting. The computer's fans begin to whir pretty intensely, and it just gets stronger and stronger until the computer shuts down.\r\n\r\nWhen it reboots, it doesn't actually turn back on, and I have to leave it for about 12 hours before it turns on, long after the computer has cooled down to room temperature. \r\n\r\nI don't believe this is a problem with my Mac in general as I can operate much higher intensity programmes than League of Legends with no issues , such as Sibelius 7, Logic pro x, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro...... etc.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that happened before these issues started happening is I introduced an external monitor to my macbook, a 27\" acer screen that operated in 1920-1080 resolution. This worked fine for a while, and then the issues started. I have since removed the monitor and it has made no difference to the performance of League so I don't really know if it was what caused the issue, but just putting it out there. \r\n\r\nDon't really want to open league again to generate some log files but I can try again to do so with hextech repair tool if people think it would actually hold crucial information. I tried reinstalling the game but the computer just crashed when the client was about 90% updated, and the fans were operating pretty strongly the whole time the client was open.\r\n\r\nMy computer is a normal early 2011 macbook pro running el capitan, 15\", but with ram recently upgraded from 4gb to 16gb, after the game was having issues. the upgrade in ram has done nothing to assist with leagues running capabilities.\r\n\r\nPlease help, I miss league!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-31T04:45:57.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed that you mentioned your entire Mac will shut off when you start league. Since it also takes 12 hours for it to physically cool down after being way too hot.....this is definitely an issue of overheating. Computers will do this as a safety precaution to help avoid any fires that might happen due to that overheating. \n\nReach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so our tech guys can troubleshoot more.
