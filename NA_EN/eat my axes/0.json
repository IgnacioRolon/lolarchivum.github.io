You go to court, and you're convicted on the DUI charge, because you really were drunk. The drug charge gets dismissed because you prove they weren't really your drugs. Then, due to some oversight the judge doesn't order jail time and/or the court doesn't assess a fine for the DUI.\n\nA while later you get a second DUI. This time the judge orders an enhanced fine because it's a second or subsequent conviction. _The fact you didn't have to serve a punishment for the first crime doesn't reduce the severity of the second or subsequent offense_.\n\nIn fact, sometimes it isn't an 'oversight' at all.

But from what I'm gathering from your response is that he was reached the two-week ban punishment without realizing it because Riot messed up. While I certainly don't want to advocate for someone who is toxic, as Riot has stated previously, very few players reach permaban, they usually reform before that.

We get people like the OP who are perma'd because of Riot's fuck-ups, but we also have players like T1 who threw away more than their fair share of chances and still get unbanned.

If you issued a two week at the same time an account was compromised it would appear that the ban was to protect the account or caused during the compromise. If you fail to reinstate the ban *and clarify what went on*, then you messed it up. You basically just skipped over the entire purpose of the two week suspension which is \"hey this is your last chance, get your shit together or else\".\n\nI'm not defending OPs behaviour or the validity of his ban, but if he never got his due warning and what happened wasnt made clear, you didn't follow the discipline procedure properly on your end.

Riot actually did something. It sucks that that happened. And it looked like riot wasn't going to do anything. At least it's not riot Korea. They banned cowsep because of his post about how Koreans are toxic pieces of shit and one of the games he showed as proof is the game where he got a blue rammis because this guy is probably a north korean refugee who still hates people of American descent that called him a Yankee and told him to go home. Also skt bang was in the game begging him not to int and you could tell he was pissed in his stream. That guy didn't get banned. They would've done far worse or you wouldn't be banned in the first place because their ban system is fucked.if it did ban you u would be fucked and would have to buy a lvl 30 acct and rush it back to your elo or buy exp boosts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicalDemons","date":"2018-04-10T20:14:25.760+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I first saw the picture I thought you were gonna complain about being banned for inting, like damn 10 games in a row unlucky.
