I am able to login and get into a queue, but as soon as I agree to get into a match the Maestro error pops up and forces the client to shut down. I've tried all the fixes I have been able to find (uninstall antivirus, use a client fixer, uninstall League and reinstall, etc.) nothing seems to work. Does anyone know what I can do so that I may play again?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-13T23:43:23.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue can be caused if you are having hiccups in your connection, so you end up disconnecting intermittent and getting kicked off.  I know you've tried a few things so far, though a reinstall won't really fix a network issue.  Instead, go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide for a fix.
