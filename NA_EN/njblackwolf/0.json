Is this just how mystery skins work now? Or did I get a gift of the same thing I effectively bought via mystery skin?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-17T04:39:14.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most likely that \"good behavior\" gift was either the key fragment or Honor capsule you got.
