If I hit try again or the x, the error immediately comes back and I have to use task manager to close League.\n\nI've tried all the steps in the link above, and I've tried uninstalling/reinstalling completely.

I've tried this is multiple browsers.\n\nUPDATE: I deleted all the files and got them from my brother's computer. I can get through the launcher, however now I get a bug splat when I try to play a game.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainLamington","date":"2017-01-10T03:54:12.170+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me too!

I did the dns server change thing and reset my computer. League has opened up and begun an update, which is more than it was doing before. I'll keep you updated on if it completes or fails, but for now it seems okay.\n\nAfter it's fixed, should I go and change my dns server setting back to what they were? or will that break League when I try to open it in the future?\n\nAnd thanks for the help Mr. Red Name! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Big Dïck Energy","date":"2017-01-10T04:52:41.925+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly the same Issue I'm having!

Again, these issues pop up every time URF event comes along. It's because as a free to play game (with various other business model nuances that actually make riot a pretty great company for their employees and players) but they do have limited server availability, which I understand.
