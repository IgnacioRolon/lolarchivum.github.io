In fact, I can say that I have mostly played ARAM. I like the 1 lane action. But there is always something wrong with this mode : the teams are rarely balanced. Most of the time, one team has every potentiel to crush to other team and we can bet who will win even before game starts. Too often it&#039;s only 1 team that has too much cc, too much tank, greater champs match, etc.\n\nI know it&#039;s random and that balancing the teams can seem hard in a random mode. But Riot, I have a solution that I am here suggesting to you.\n\nWhen the random program randomly builds the teams, the champs should still be given randomly, but in each team, every time, there should be :\n\n1 tank\n1 supp\n1 adc\n1 assassin\n1 mage\n\nNever 2 of the same class.\n\nBut which champion of each class would still be random.\n\nThat is my sugestion to you Riot and I hope you will read it and consider it very seriously.\n\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"The KnightOwl","date":"2017-01-19T02:49:55.490+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a team full of malphite, gragas, alistar, etc. is really just the most broken thing on this mode, not healers. Tbh I used to play ARAM much more and felt it a lot more balanced before they put the snowball summoner. That shit makes engages waaaaaaaaaaaaay too easy, 3 tanks throw snowballs every 20 seconds and when 1 finally lands... GG. Hell, you can even hit a nearby minion, use that to engage from, it's just stupid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kledy McKledFace","date":"2017-01-19T02:41:28.091+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Id rather see some champion balances instead, like a ultra nerf to sona on this map shes around 65% winrate","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-19T03:00:51.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about ziggs, sona, nidalee, varus and leona?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2017-01-19T18:22:58.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"First, the proposed role distribution is missing Fighters.\n\nSecondly, such heavy restrictions on ARAM team comps severely harms the depth, and thus the longevity and replayability, of ARAM. It'd be much more likely to repeatedly encounter the same champs.\n\nFinally, winning from champ select doesn't happen nearly as often as you seem to think. It's more common at high MMRs, but it's often possible to win from adapting better to the teams/matchups, especially in lower MMRs.","replies":[]}]}
