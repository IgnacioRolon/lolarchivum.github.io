I&#039;m curious as to what Riot&#039;s outlook of League of Legends is. \r\nDo these bi-weekly(correct me if I am wrong) patches happen in hopes of moving the game towards a point where most of the champions are on equal ground? \r\n  I have no idea what I&#039;m talking about when it comes to numbers, but would it be wishful thinking to want to see a game based on strategy? There are definitely enough champions for varying strategies, and I think a lot of people can agree that more champions seeing play is a good thing.\r\n  \r\nAre these patches just to make changes just for the sake of change?

But the problem doesn't come from the champion itself, but more from the lack of willingness of the player to try and contribute to a balanced team composition, which comes down to skill > champion once again since it's a player related issue.","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2017-03-18T22:11:00.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2017-03-18T22:22:15.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's always been like that. riot even admits they made champions that are just terrible champions. champions that are unfun. champions that are unbalanced. champions that are broken or outdated. once you put something like that into a game it's hard to remove it.\n\nthe hopes are that by adding new things they can either give a purpose to those champs or strategies without having to remove them entirely. however sometime recent they've came to the conclusion that adding things isnt working. so they're trying to redo everything they've already added. the problem with that is that it takes a LONG time to do that. by the time they get the tank update figured out it supports will need to be tweaked all over again.\n\nso no there's no end game here. it's just lets make the game interesting for next year.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2017-03-18T20:17:27.933+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The vast majority of champions are viable.
