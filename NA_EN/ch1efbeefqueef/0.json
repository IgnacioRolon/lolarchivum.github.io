There are the pros who travel the world and compete for various silver cups. And there is us, average casual everyday &quot;play a game after work&quot; type people. Kennen to you is completely different than Kennen to the pros etc.\r\n\r\nSo I was thinking, and it might sound over ambitious or a little naive but why don&#039;t they just make two completely different clients or something?\r\n\r\nLike one for us the casuals and one for the pros. Same game, same champs, same everything. One exception though. Each client has it&#039;s own balance team designated to it. The pro pool balancing team focuses on making changes to champions with high level coordinated play in mind; whilst the Casual pool balancing team perhaps focuses on changes that are more focused on the player at least slightly moreso then the team. \r\n\r\nCall me crazy, call it impossible, but you know what? I would like it, and i don&#039;t think i&#039;m the only one who would. \r\n\r\nAnyone else think this would be a cool idea? Anyone care to expand?","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2017-02-15T23:05:00.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would probably be pretty frustrating to pro players to do this.\n\nImagine if the only way you could practice the game solo was on patch 5.16 (picking a random number) but when it came time to play your serious team games you played on 7.3.\n\nIt would only work if the game stayed relatively similar between the two with only a few minor number tweaks between live and pro play but keeping it like that would be a nightmare.\n\nThe easiest thing to get thrown off would be build paths and at that point does riot balance so that the new build path on the pro patch matches the build path on live? \n\nI'll try to give an random example of what I am talking about but it is hard to describe how this can go off the rails.\n\nWhat if on live Sion becomes an mid lane ad burst champ but in the pro play patch he is still a tank and his playstyle as a result veers off in 2 different directions which suddenly makes vayne op on one version so her attack speed has to be nerfed and that makes frozen heart a better buy and so on.... meanwhile none of this stuff happens on the other version so all of these changes cascade in completely different directions.\n\nNot saying any of this nonsense would happen but it is easy to see how one or two small changes can affect the game as a whole and make the two into completely different games very quickly.","replies":[{"poster":"Ch1efBeefQueef","date":"2017-02-15T23:41:38.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You raise a good point, however to my knowledge the pros don't practice in soloq. Im positive they practice as 5 against other teams of a similar caliber. I Have even heard of pro teams having their own backup players playing custom 5v5s with the teams current roster for practicing.

But upon further thought I must decline considering the fact that the balancing conundrum that riot faces today would be solved, i figure it would be easier for them to balance the game for both parties separately.

They don't want pro play to become a different beast that ordinary people can't relate to.\n\nBesides, what do you think will come of it if Riot doesn't consider balance for high level coordinated play? It will just lead to a lot of OP champions, its just that most can't access what makes them OP most of the time, but that doesn't mean that it won't cause problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Ch1efBeefQueef","date":"2017-02-15T23:47:06.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, I think this is where I disagree with Riots approach to the game. I don't see any good that can come out of giving the player base a false illusion of being like a pro besides revenue for them. And when the discussion comes down to money we will lose 10 times out of 10. Regarding new champ releases, I'm frankly tired of new champs and have been for a couple years. I feel like we have enough variety in this game, and considering how rocky the balancing is going, introducing new champs every couple months just metastasizes the problem even more.

Not exactly a insurmountable task, if given the proper tools its mostly in the hands of the players. Alright so maybe it is insurmountable to get people to work together. XD\n\nI don't know how you got on champ releases or what that has to do with anything. But, I find that new champions are a very good thing, the game gets stale without them, besides, the new champions are far more interesting then the old ones.","replies":[{"poster":"Ch1efBeefQueef","date":"2017-02-16T00:19:23.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For most of us, realistically we can make it to challenger one day. If we work hard and learn lessons every game. But even in the current state of the game I can't say the same for becoming a professional. It's out of the realm of possibility even in my ambitious mind, comparable to winning the lottery. As far as coordination I have thought many times that a voice chat system would work wonders for that.  And the new release blurb, I don't really know where that came from, i'm pretty gassed, long work week. But yeah, I guess i'm just salty with most of Riots new champs and reworks as I find them to be poorly balanced a majority of the time. Which probably has something to do with the pros vs. casuals conundrum once again. I dunno.","replies":[{"poster":"Valderis Vandala","date":"2017-02-16T01:09:53.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really doubt new champions or reworks being unbalanced has anything to do with pro play. Unless pro's have secret tournaments before the new champion releases where they get to use them and affect the stats on release.\n\nIf your looking to blame anyone, blame the PBE people and the balance teams, but what's the point of that really, not like these people are perfect. Properly balancing champions requires a lot of data and time and a lot of testing.\n\nFeels more like I'm talking to an old man who can't keep up with the youngsters anymore.
