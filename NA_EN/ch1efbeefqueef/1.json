You are in elo heaven, yes yes i know im crazy for saying that but i will repeat it a thousand times; you are in elo heaven. \n\nI mean sure, your fellow players might be toxic at times and sure they might play a few really bad games. But i would like to inform you that it gets worse as you climb. As you ascend through the ladder of ranked solo queue you will find more and more bloated egos as you climb. People who think they are the best because they are in silver. Or people who think they are gifted because they are in gold. Plats and diamonds who wont even listen to you because they think they are gods. But its all bullshit. \n\nI was in bronze for a year, i said it was elo hell, then i got to silver and my eyes opened up. Then i got to gold and i am losing hope about my dreams of climbing to diamond, not because i dont have what it takes to get better and achieve my goals; but because i dont have what it takes to be demoralized game after game. \n\nIf you are insulted by another bronze player it usually goes like this: &quot;fite me irl %%%it your a nerd!&quot; This is literally funny for me to hear from another player. But the true anger and the true sadness comes from people who are full of themselves. They lock in their choice champ, and usually only know 2 rolls. They dont care about you at all, and if things go sour, they get nasty. \n\nI find bronze games seem to be on a more friendly yet unstable level. People back each other up when they do well and are open to new ideas and concepts and even give rolls to other players. When they are losing they do become quite different but it happens to the best of us. But when you get up in ranks, it doesn't matter anymore, win or lose, there will be no honors at the end of the game. No friendly pat on the back, no conversation at all. But they stay the way they are when they are losing, they get flustered and blame you they become toxic. \n\nYou are with a good group of people not because they are mechanical geniuses, but because they are innocent players with true heart. That all fades away and becomes numb as they get higher up the ladder though. \n\nIn conclusion, please do me and everyone else a favor and when you do get out of &quot;elo hell&quot; which i know you will, do so with pride and humility, and try to bring that human attitude you had to the rest of your games as a player. Because this community can use some humanity. Feel free to dump the toxic attitude if you have it though, cause that doesnt help anyone especially yourself. \n\nGood luck and have fun, and dont forget to spam click the dislike button and type in TL:DR followed by a negative comment. Have an excellent day.","replies":[{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2015-08-27T06:29:30.353+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember kids:\n\nChoose Bronze.

I watch many of them start turning into toxic, raging tryhards who won't play more than 3 champions even in bot games and who become almost unable to have fun in the game anymore because they're always looking to either improve their skills or show off how awesome they are to other people who don't care.\n\nBonus Storytime:\n\nI remember one tale of an aspiring player in high silver.  He played League with his girlfriend, a silver (now gold) support main, and I knew him because I was one of his girlfriend's best friends since before they met.  One day his girlfriend decided she wanted to practice something that wasn't support (Nidalee) and wanted to practice throwing spears from purple side, with him trying to dodge them with his main Kha'zix.  I popped into the game on my then-main Darius to dunk bots because I didn't have anything better to do.\n\nThis lasted about ten minutes before he started getting 'competitive' - He was upset that my bot-dunking was giving me a higher kill total since I had more bots in my lane.  No longer content with just dodging spears he started going aggro on our friend, even though she was just there to practice spears and couldn't play Nidalee very well at all.  When I chided him for killing her he proceeded to go after me as well.  I lost him as a friend at the exact moment I killed him on his main with roughly equal gold in two straight 1v1s.  This did not compute for him; he was ranked, he was awesome, and I was just some bot-gaming, noncompetitive, PvP-fearing scrub.  He rage-quit the match and Skype within five seconds of each other and didn't speak to either of us for a week.  We didn't really become friends again until after his real life forced him to stop playing Ranked.\n\nSome people just take competition too seriously and forget that underneath allthe MMR and divisions and Elo, it's just a game and should be played to have fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2015-08-27T22:10:01.147+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I was growing up I had a friend who was so obsessed with winning.
