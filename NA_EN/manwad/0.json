Like, as far as I know only Garen has something like that on his E. Hecarim's a jungler and while, in my experience, he's not bad, little things like that hinder him. \r\n\r\nA farm jungler who has restrictions on his farming, like, why?","replies":[{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2014-12-21T04:50:40.274+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was released in Season 2 when the jungle was super easy to clear.

Tiny things, like reduced mana cost on his Rampage and a higher healing cap. \n\nSo, come 5.1, he could have it removed.
