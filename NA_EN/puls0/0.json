What happens if you try in incognito, another browser, or [clearing your cache](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752694-Clearing-Browser-History-and-Cookies)?  That could dissolve anything that was failing to properly redirect you.  We do have transfers available for purchase through the in-game store, and it does cost RP.  Personally, because your level is still pretty low I would suggest creating another account on your closest region.  You could still play on NA if you want, but your ping would be improved on EU.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
