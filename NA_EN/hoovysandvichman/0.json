It took time to figure out runes and masteries that gave me the best edge for my play style. Ultimately, there will be a best \"new\" rune choice for a specific champ, not playing style, and most will adopt that. So yea, welcome to Riots new cookie cutter concept.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-08T18:56:47.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I am... quite disappointed with the resolve tree generally, I do not see whatever you are seeing to prevent ad teemo. Building off-type damage looks easier than ever.","replies":[]}]}
