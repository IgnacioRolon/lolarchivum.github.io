Based on what you'd said to me, that would be grounds for a 2 week suspension for griefing.\n\nThe expectation is that you stay in the game the whole time, trying your best to win until a nexus explodes or a surrender vote passes. Giving up early, messing around while teammates are trying, standing under turrets for multiple stretches of time, is how this penalty could be applied.\n(11:54:26 PM) Curse of Ester: So if I pull out my ethernet cable and d/c, that would just get me a leaverbuster, correct?\n(11:55:05 PM) IronSights: It might. If determine that some one is doing that intentionally, it can be grounds for a ban.\n(11:55:20 PM) Curse of Ester: well there's obviously no way to detect if it was done intentionally.\n(11:55:24 PM) Curse of Ester: but I understand.\n(11:55:51 PM) Curse of Ester: next time I am trolled by an afk/threatening duo, I will simply pull out my ethernet cable and just take the leaverbuster penalty rather than playing the game.\n(11:56:27 PM) Curse of Ester: thanks for the tip.\n(11:56:35 PM) Curse of Ester: much better than 2 week ban.\n(11:56:35 PM) IronSights: I wouldn't recommend that, because it can escalate this accounts 2 week to a permanent ban. We don't want that.\n\nInstead we ask that you play the game out as best you can, wait for the surrender vote, or for a team to win.\n(11:56:53 PM) Curse of Ester: well I won't do it often, just rarely when people do stuff like this. thanks for the advice.\n(11:57:02 PM) Curse of Ester: that's a much better alternative than 2 weeks.\n(11:57:24 PM) Curse of Ester: finally got some good advice from a rioter, i appreciate that.\n(11:58:20 PM) IronSights: Again I don't recommend that, since it can lead to a permanent ban, but please let me know if you have any other questions.\n(11:58:38 PM) Curse of Ester: clearly the afk that ruined the game for 9 other people isn't taken as seriously, as the guy has played games today.\n(11:58:48 PM) Curse of Ester: meanwhile i'm 2 week banned :)\n(11:58:57 PM) Curse of Ester: good system\n(11:59:01 PM) Curse of Ester: XD\n(11:59:54 PM) IronSights: If you'd like me to review that player again, if you think they left on purpose I will absolutely give it a nother look, and take the appropriate actions.\n\nDo you have reason to believe they left on purpose, or never connected in the first place?\n(12:00:58 AM) Curse of Ester: the player literally typed in chat \"afk incoming\" or something along those lines. they threatened to afk me in another lobby that dodged. I had them several times last night. it's just absurd, really. it shouldn't be \"let me review that other player if you think they deserve it\". it should be \"ok, we realize that it's not always black and white in these games, and this is an instance where we can see it from two sides\"\n(12:02:03 AM) Curse of Ester: i don't understand why i'm held to a higher standard when i still at least attempt to play, albeit not traditionally, and someone else who threatens afk (literally typed in chat) and then actually afks, gets to continue playing with nothing.\n(12:02:26 AM) Curse of Ester: you will notice i didn't int, run it down, afk, or anything like that. the game was a 4v5.\n(12:02:42 AM) Curse of Ester: and the alternative is to unplug my ethernet cable and take a 5 minute penalty.\n(12:02:50 AM) Curse of Ester: but I chose to stay in the game and not take leaverbuster.\n(12:02:58 AM) Curse of Ester: instead I get 2 weeks\n(12:04:12 AM) IronSights: We're not justifying any other players behavior, and we're not saying your behavior is worse than theirs. It's totally possible they have been penalized and you can't tell, or maybe they will be penalized later. I can't say for privacy reasons, and because it isn't relevant to your penalty.\n\nAll I can tell you is that I will review them and take the appropriate actions based on what I see.\n(12:04:29 AM) Curse of Ester: so in essence, nothing happens\n(12:05:30 AM) Curse of Ester: can you see this from my point of view at all?\n(12:05:44 AM) Curse of Ester: i mean honestly, i get that you guys have to stick to a script for the most part, but i know you're a human being.\n(12:07:25 AM) Curse of Ester: and i get that people make bad judgments in competitive games sometimes. if i could go back, i should have just afk'd and taken the leaverbuster. doesn't that seem bizarre to you that that's the alternative to playing? 5 minute penalty on queue vs. 2 week ban?\n(12:07:31 AM) IronSights: I can see it from your perspective yes. I saw what the other players were doing in that game, and I get that you felt like the game was over, why try. I know what you did that, it makes sense to me.\n\nThat just doesn't mean the penalty should be lifted.\n\nAnd no, I didn't say that nothing will happen, I said that you'll probably never be able to tell, and that's intentional. We will handle their penalty, we can only talk to you about healing your account over time.\n(12:08:33 AM) Curse of Ester: that is just so strange.\n(12:09:12 AM) Curse of Ester: if i leave a game, i have to wait a few minutes before i can play again. if i stay in it and don't int but am not \"trying my hardest\", i'm banned for 2 wees.\n(12:09:13 AM) Curse of Ester: weeks*\n(12:10:01 AM) Curse of Ester: so it's obviously preferable to riot that i just fully leave a game as long as i do it super rarely.\n(12:10:28 AM) Curse of Ester: which is what i will do from now on if i'm concerned that i may not try too hard.\n(12:12:36 AM) IronSights: (i had this typed out but deleted it, but after seeing where you'd like to focus on, I will send it).\n\nYou keep mentioning that if you decided to AFK that you would get leaverbuster, or a lesser penalty.\n\nI need to be clear, if we determine that some one is intentionally leaving games, if some one reports you for intentionally leaving the game, that can be penalized just as hard as inting. We will look into the match and determine what the penalty should be based on what we find, including the accounts history. So I wouldn't say there is a weird situation where leaving the game earns you less penalties.\n\nAgain, the expectation is that you play the game out no matter what anyone else is saying or doing. If you leave, you should be willing to face a report, review and penalties for that.\n\nWe would rather you not earn any more penalties like that in the future, so I'm trying to equip you with ways to respond to those players without earning your own penalties.\n(12:13:11 AM) Curse of Ester: i have already left several games on other accounts and never received anything other than leaverbuster.\n(12:13:26 AM) Curse of Ester: so my own personal experience goes against your statements.\n(12:13:32 AM) Curse of Ester: over the years.\n(12:14:00 AM) Curse of Ester: albeit it's rare, i have afk'd games before, never received anything beyond leaverbuster.\n(12:14:11 AM) Curse of Ester: (not on this account, though)\n(12:14:25 AM) Curse of Ester: and even when I have afk'd, sometimes I don't even get a leaverbuster.\n(12:14:54 AM) IronSights: That's okay. You don't have to believe me, I'm just letting you know how our systems work from our perspective.\n\nIf you perceive it to be different from your end, that's okay. I'm just telling you what I know to be true.\n(12:15:17 AM) Curse of Ester: but if it was true, I would have received a punishment for it by now.\n(12:15:19 AM) IronSights: But if you have other questions about our systems, lay them on me. That's what im here for.\n(12:15:31 AM) Curse of Ester: as I am admitting I have done it several times.\n(12:16:01 AM) Curse of Ester: well i don't have any questions really, but i think the system in place is very flawed as proven by our conversation.\n(12:16:13 AM) Curse of Ester: and i will take your advice earlier that leaverbuster is far preferable to a 2 week ban.\n(12:16:52 AM) Curse of Ester: and although i can't really tell if you believe in the current system or that's simply what you have to say, i do appreciate your time despite the clear bias of the current system toward afk/not trying in a game.\n(12:18:22 AM) IronSights: Well I definitely agree our systems aren't perfect, no system is. That's totally fair.\n(12:18:52 AM) Curse of Ester: i don't expect them to be. however, i expect human beings to see that there are flaws and rectify them when found.\n(12:19:07 AM) Curse of Ester: that's just basic customer service and empathy toward others.\n(12:19:18 AM) Curse of Ester: merry christmas.\n(12:20:08 AM) IronSights: If you would like to submit specific feedback for how you'd improve the system, I can point you in the right direction.\n\nIf you don't have anything else for me, I will wish you a happy holiday as well\n(12:20:15 AM) IronSights: and close this one out for you\n(12:20:40 AM) Curse of Ester: no, i don't want to submit feedback. that's not my job. the company should hire people that can do that and pay them appropriately\n(12:20:43 AM) Curse of Ester: like riot lyte.\n(12:20:45 AM) Curse of Ester: he was a good man.\n(12:20:52 AM) Curse of Ester: cya!\n(12:20:56 AM) IronSights: I know it's frustrating when you don't agree with the ruling, so I do want to empower you to share that if you feel passionately about it.\n(12:21:01 AM) IronSights: I wish you the best, cya as well\n(12:22:26 AM) *** IronSights left the chat ***","replies":[{"poster":"Farkinob","date":"2018-12-22T02:46:19.016+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were being smart with the Riot employee tbh; that's probably why they didn't go out of their way to help you; and of course they have to remain professional.
