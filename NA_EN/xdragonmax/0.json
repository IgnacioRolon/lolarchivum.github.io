So normally I would go to my client and wait for the button to say reconnect into game. However, this time, it just kept saying \"Game is still in progress...\". So my team was forced to play in a 4v5 game. Can anyone explain why it won't say reconnect?{{champion:67}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-23T00:58:13.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might be having a network problem here that is failing to connect to the game server and acknowledge that the game ended.
