But when I run the client patcher it 90% of the time wont open and will remain like this: http://prntscr.com/bxcijh . The times it does finally open it will say scanning files and when it hits 2 or 3 files it will say an unspecified error has occured. I have reinstalled the Launcher/Files multiple times now and it's starting to get on my nerves. If anyone knows a fix or has any idea how to fix this it would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-25T22:35:09.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the patcher won't open, it's often caused by League not having the proper system permissions to run. Because League interacts with files in and outside of the League folder, along with different software packages, not having proper permissions to do so can prevent League from running at all. Our [permissions guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) goes over the most common solutions for this. \n\nLet me know if this guide helped out at all. \n\n*P.S. I totally dig your sweet S.A.O. wallpaper. :)*","replies":[]}]}
