Is there anything I can do?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"Here's the story. I get into a game and everything is going fine (well not really, we were kind of getting our asses kicked). So anyways, about 7 minutes into the game, when I'm level 4, our midlaner, Zyra, comes down to bot lane (I'm ADC). I ask her to leave, and she doesn't. She eventually gets hooked (after being in my lane for about 2 minutes) and dies in a 1v4. She then yells at me for not backing her up, and says she's gonna keep coming bot lane now. I ask her to leave about a hundred times, and all she says is \"this is what you get for not helping\". Every time I ask her to leave, she says \"You should have helped\". She dies about 3 more times, and this gets me really mad because it is a ranked game and I hate losing because of trolls. Then I find out that our jungler, Rek'Sai, is Zyra's duo partner. They both start berating me and calling me names, and also flame other players on the team as well (saying things like \"look at Darius build\" when all he had was double doran's and ninja tabi). I try and defend Darius and point out that Zyra's build isn't much better (Righteous Glory rush on mid Zyra), and I get flamed by Rek'Sai and Zyra. Rek'Sai says \"it's because she gave up on this game along time ago.\" By this point I've already cursed them out a bunch and they both threaten to report me, which they did. I then find out that I got permanently banned from the game for being toxic. Now, I was toxic, there is no denying that and I will freely admit it. However, it is only because I was cursing out trolls in a ranked game. In hindsight, sure, maybe I should have just muted them and reported them after. But like I said, this was a ranked game and I was annoyed that I was gonna lose the game because I was getting trolled. I let my emotions get the better of me and started flaming them. Yes, I was toxic, but I was only cursing these guys out because they were intentionally throwing the game and trying to get me pissed off, and that is something I don't think I should get banned for. Is there anything I can do to possibly overturn the ban? Like I said, I was being toxic, but I was only being toxic because I was being trolled in a ranked game.","replies":[]}
