Lots of it.\n\nI love Zyra.  And I completely side with Rainslight here.  Zyra does Zyra things... which can easily be up to 9 plants at a time in a very small area.  Hell I already have trouble figuring out what is going on sometimes (I'm just happy it tends to end with me alive).\n\nThe range indicator could help, but honestly just practice.  You'll fail a lot, but that's what practice is for.  You find out WHY you fail and correct it.  Then you fail a little less until you end up being good - but never give up that bit of finding out WHY you fail, that's the key to improving.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2016-07-29T16:50:48.578+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"the biggest issue i have vs {{champion:143}} is the fact you need to WALK over the unsprouted plants to kill them, instead of attacking them.\n\nbecause as soon as u get near them she sprouts them. so you cant really step on them to kill them.\n\ndamned if you do, damned if you don't.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Zudane","date":"2016-07-29T18:49:07.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"...\n\nThat's seriously the biggest thing about her.  If you could kill the seeds from far away then she would be utterly useless because their range isn't that far.  Zyra is great at pushing and keeping people back - but if you can kite Zyra she's worthless, that range is necessary and the seeds can be used as bait.\n\nBe mindful of the seeds but don't go out of your way for them.  Unless you get near them there isn't much reason for them to be sprouted (and if they are then they won't do much damage).  Step on ones that are in your path or near you (or when Zyra is further away), but don't chase them down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2016-07-29T19:36:13.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She doesn't have Zac priority so if you attempt to step on it you will over half the time just end up destroying them before her Q/E ever goes off.
