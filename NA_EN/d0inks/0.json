Just today, playing something as simple as poro king, my ms reached to a fucking 11 000 and I am NOT exaggerating that, it really did reach that number. I'm very unsure of what to do to fix this problem as I've tried quite a few simple option changes in my PC, and everything else runs just fine. If I can play gMod with flying colors, I should be able to play league without issues. I'm really hoping that the client update changes this tomorrow but until then, I really don't have any way to play league, which is a shame. I've seen others with this problem and it would be excellent to have a real solution to fix it. Until then i guess i can still watch league, but it's just not the same.\r\n\r\nThanks and good luck to those in search of a solution. \r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-24T02:39:26.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ping spikes over 9000 are a pretty clear sign that something interrupted your connection with our servers somehow.
