I've got a problem I'd like to share with the LoL tech support boards because I'm concerned about it and was wondering if anyone else was experiencing the same issue.\r\n\r\nI am from the UK and I play regularly on the NA servers with 99 ms. Ever since yesterday [2nd September 2016], the League of Legends client and actual gameplay has been annoyingly laggy for me. It has been working perfectly all year long with no input delay and no latency whatsoever until it started yesterday and I'm just puzzled as to why it is even happening. None of my settings have changed, my in-game ping remains stable as it always has and I am having no issues playing any other game online, except league and ONLY on the NA server. I do not experience this problem when I switch to EU-W, so there must be something wrong with the connection to the NA servers, something must have changed? I'm trying to find out what it could be.\r\n\r\nThe lag is difficult to describe because it is very subtle. It's not your usual 300+ ping spikes or game-freezing FPS related lag, it's just subtle and I can feel it in everything I do while playing. The best way to describe it is it's as if I'm playing the game in water, everything just feels heavy, slow and delayed in its response. I can identify this by how long it takes for the client to load a friend's profile when I try to view it. Usually, it's instant and all of the information loads straight away. However, since yesterday, if I try to view a profile on the client, it takes ages to load and the \"Retrieving data from server......... Loading...\" message will appear and stay there for a while - the connection to the Riot client seems abysmally slow and the information on the profile I'm trying to view will load one portion at a time, not all at once. Furthermore, while in-game, the lag effects every champion I play and makes them feel like they are 10x heavier. Inputs are slower to respond, skills are delayed and sometimes plays will happen all at once due to slight rubber-banding. It honestly makes the game unplayable. It sounds like a packet loss issue and this may be connected to why I am only experiencing this while playing on NA and not on EU-W.\r\n\r\nSo far, I have tried doing a client repair which went through successfully with no issues but did not fix the problem. I have also reset my router, tried changing my internet settings [different wireless frequencies/channels etc.] which did not solve the problem and I have even run ping tests through the CMD to Riot's NA server using the \"ping 104.160.131.3 -t\" command and there doesn't seem to be a problem I can identify with the results given back to me as they convey a normal \"time=99ms\" which moves up to 102ms every six to twelve or so pings [is that normal?].\r\n\r\nI thought that maybe this problem would go away after a day but it is still persisting through to today. I'm wondering what on earth the issue is and if anyone else is experiencing this, please post to confirm and share your thoughts on any potential reasons as to why this could suddenly be occurring? I'd like to reiterate the fact that I am NOT experiencing this problem AT ALL on the EU-West servers and the game plays perfectly as it usually does while playing on EU with no client lag and no gameplay lag. This is an NA server issue only. My ISP is BT [British Telecoms] just for reference.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-06T20:54:27.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there may be an issue directly with your ISP routing the the NA server that's causing the problem. We can look into this by running a traceroute with http://winmtr.net/. Simply use the IP Address 104.160.131.1 and run a trace for 5 minutes before exporting your results as text and pasting them here in a response.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
