This option would help a lot summoners who still have HDD type hard disk drives and do have the option to upgrade to SSD yet. Sounds easy for Riot's Developers :D\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-16T02:12:51.327+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y'know, that could actually be a useful feature for a lot of our players I think.
