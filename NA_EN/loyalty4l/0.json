You could literally not play any games and if they are all mostly wining their games it'll say your MMR went down or is below average (it didn't actually move) and if they lose a bunch it'll say your MMR is higher than average.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-26T20:12:27.144+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/JE7uIIu.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-04-26T20:17:30.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"<3 you too Porocles.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-26T18:52:01.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"MMR is a hidden value, so if you're getting results from third party sites they may be inaccurate but your placement in ranked is a solid indicator.  Per the [Matchmaking Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide), LP is based on a few factors like if matchmaking thinks you're going to win or lose a match.  You might be at a point where matchmaking believes you're in a solid place, so you may have to work a bit harder towards proving the system otherwise.  Hope that helps clear things up, and good luck!","replies":[]}]}
