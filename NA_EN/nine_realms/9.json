Most missions ARE event-only, the Hextech crafting system is a complete joke with abysmal disenchantment rewards and outrageous enchantment costs, Honor only giving a single key fragment once every week or so along with being extremely hard to increase, etc. Doesn't really matter that the new runes system replaced IP costs, considering that IP is just that. IP. It has never cost money. Almost no one has an equal chest to key ratio because of the Honor fragment system and capsules only give champion shards.

You&#x27;re kinda proving me right if you don&#x27;t explain WHY we need more free shit.\n\nTrust me, friend, I get your point. But now, listen to mine: runes have always been free. They have NEVER costed RP, and considering they were a major point of gameplay, it was a good thing they were available with IP. Plain and simple, runes don't count. Champions have always been free, they also have never relied on RP prices. Both these items are gameplay-reliant, hence why they aren't microtransaction-reliant.\n\nHextech crafting is where Riot's generosity gets iffy for me. Due to the current system we have, lots of players have an inbalance in loot. Plenty of chests but no keys, or even the rare no chests but plenty of keys. Even when disregarding this problem, it takes a crazy amount of orange essence to enchant skin shards in comparison to how much you disenchant them for. What I want is not free things per say, what I want is an equal and fair hextech crafting system. Either that, or just remove it all together. The Pizza Delivery Sivir skin shard disenchants for 270 OE, but enchants for 1050. It's almost 4x the cost. 3.8 to be exact.\n\nSo not only are chests increasingly harder to even open, but even when you do open them, there is little chance you will be rewarded with anything. There are very few legendary skins and even fewer ultimate skins. Compared to the 700+ other skins in the RNG, these \"premium cosmetics\" you spoke of in your reply are few and far inbetween. I'm not asking for anything crazy like a free skin a week, I'm asking for a fair system. \n\nTo be honest, I don't even really care for the suggestion the OP gave, but I do disagree with the fact that Riot gives us tons of free stuff. This isn't a \"small indie company\" anymore, it's a multi-billion dollar company owned by the biggest game investor in the world.\n\n\nTLDR: Fix the Hextech crafting system ratios, literally all we need.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2018-06-06T23:29:14.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can get behind that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"1RiceBowl1x","date":"2018-06-07T06:49:19.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Compare how much stuff you can get for free, and the rate at which you can get free stuff in League of Legends.

So, I don't even get your point with this one.\nThe Rune System was a scam in the first place and realistically cost players more money now because they need to get more Rune Pages to actually stay relevant while playing the game.\nThe BE shop gives out chromas for BE? I think there are mystery icons (and maybe (maybe) mystery ward skins) you can get for BE too? Woohoo~\n\nAnd as for the Hextech Crafting system; honestly, you just don't want to get me started with how terrible of a 'Free Loot System' it is. I'll give you the short version though; it takes 6 Legendary skin shards to upgrade 1, single Legendary skin shard.\nYee, real nice. On top of too the expectations for getting an S are silly high considering LoL literally encourages you to keep your champion pool smaller than larger. So you're allowed a whole total of 4 chests, gaining one chest per week after obtaining one, and then have to wait on key shards that have a disgustingly low drop rate.\nAdd in as well, even after cramming on a champion _you don't play_ to finally earn a Hextech Chest, it's not even the Masterwork chest, so chances are you'll end up with a Champion Shard. Wow!\n\nYou're literally trying to pull _the most_ literal nonsense out of thin air to argue a multi-million dollar company is losing money by barely giving out free stuff?

THey gave like 20% and it is not some small thing for the 100 millions of players league has and you have definelty of these players like 35% who not even spent one cent for the game cause you realy don't need it. and than riot gives a free system to everyone, a system they worked a half-1 year on it. And they not sell it to us, they gave it to us for free AND even pays some compensation.\nPeople bitched around that they not refunded 100% but realy: If you buy clothes and can't wear them anymore, you don't get anything. If you buy a car you definetly can't sell it after 7 years for the full price again. Especialy you don't get a free car after it too. But riot did that. This is not praising of a god developer but it just clearing that riot already does more as they need to do.\n\nSadly it is the basic principle where riot tries to give a finger and the comunity tries to grab the whole hand with the human on it.
