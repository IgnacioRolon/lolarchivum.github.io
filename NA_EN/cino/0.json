And it&#039;s justified\nRiot, we know you guys are gamers, and WE know that YOU know what makes games inherently fun. \n\nI am NOT knocking on League of Legends. Since season 3 when I started, I have LOVED league of legends. For about 90% of my time playing. Unfortunately season 6 is the 10%. I don&#039;t even care about balance at this point, It&#039;s really just Dynamic Queue\n\nGames are meant to empower a player. Whether it&#039;s living out a fantasy or just feeling strong. This has always been a struggle in league, playing with 5 strangers and having to work together to win? Sometimes you can feel helpless but the cooperation can be rewarding, and it&#039;s a cool challenge. Now it&#039;s just a struggle. Feeling totally helpless. At the disposal of premades that you can&#039;t handle and defeat as opponents. And, that you can&#039;t work with as teammates, often the victim of abuse. Feeling powerless, helpless, weak, whatever you want to call it, is what every player does NOT want. If you're concerned about Solo players being \"the most toxic\", congratulations - now they're constantly mad and it's going to be a lot worse! But the helplessness doesn't stop when the game ends. Good luck attemtping to root out toxicity when a solo player will get slammed with 4 reports for disagreeing with their 4 man premade temamates, or just feeding. \n\nI mean, you're just being hypocritical. You CONSTANTLY say how your main goal when tuning a champion is making them feel strong. So how can you be comfortable with making the PLAYER feel weak?\n\nIt isn&#039;t healthy and we don&#039;t like it, you can admit it. You made a mistake but we&#039;ll still love you Riot, if you just acknowledge it and listen to people. I'm not even saying remove Dynamic, just make Solo Q a choice again, if possible  {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}\n\nEDIT\nApparently some people actually think it's a non factor? Well I'll begin with a fact I guess\n\nSuperior communication and coordination is a direct advantage in a MOBA. This is not debatable\n\nThe entire point of solo q was to overcome the challenge of lack of communication, and to work as a team to be successful. This is gone. And no, 2 duos were not the same as a 4 man premade\n\nI mean, I don't play ranked much, I'm silver 3. Last year I was almost gold and 75% of players I play with right now have the gold border. At this silver/gold level, early leads OFTEN win. \n\nWhen I see a team rotate perfectly, take dragon, and then push down mid lane 12 minutes in, it's blatantly obvious it's a premade. Players at this level cannot coordinate objective control as fast or effectively. And at this level, and shit, even at the LCS level, a major early lead can win the game\n\nAnd that's exactly what happens. It's SO easy for premades to faceroll a team simply because their coordination allows them to take an early lead and capitalize on their advantage. Contesting dragon, splitting top after taking Rift, rotating bot/mid, calling out summoner and cooldowns, coordinating ganks. Sure a duo is an advantage, but 4? The synchronization is simply unfair\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's awesome, but there's a place for it.\n\nRanked 5s\n\n+ **Apparently this post is rude and condescending.**\n\nLook, It's not out of stubbornness or selfishness that I ask this\nThe system of choosing to play either solo/duo, or choosing to play as a full team of 5 has been PERFECTLY FINE for the last I don't even know how many years. I have nothing against premades, they just don't belong in the same games as players who wish to play solo as they have for _years_. I'll say it again, **it belongs in Ranked 5's\n**\nI've seen several \"Dynamic Queue was a great fix\" Alright, but **_NOTHING WAS BROKEN_**\nNew Champ select? AWESOME fix. Dynamic Queue?

It's not even like the game as a whole is bad, the solo ranked experience just makes every single flaw in the game outshine every good aspect so amazingly that one can consider leaving the game altogether.\n\nAnd the solution is so simple. They don't even need make a whole new queue. Just let solo players opt out of playing with premade players. Or on the extreme end, just revert the queues. We saw it happen when server crashed so it's not like it's an impossibility.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lithium Rosa","date":"2016-04-25T21:54:03.302+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"a\" mistake?\nNo no they made hundreds of them, actually the number is so big that I start to suspect they are screwing this game intentionally","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr W","date":"2016-04-25T17:00:26.212+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":12,"body":"They aren't going to reply.

Their main argument is boosting. How many people are boosted? I've never seen statistics. is it 1/100? 1/1000? They just state their rank is meaningless because omg everyone is boosting up to diamond. \n\nDo you even know how the system works? Up to a certain point you can only play with someone a tier away from you. So if your are silver you can only with with golds or bronze. I don't see how a silver playing with golds is boosting. Above plat it's even less than that because they start limiting it by divisions.\n\nEven with those restrictions matchmaking tries to balance out teams from there. So if you are gold and play with a silver, the enemy team will most likely have a silver also.","replies":[{"poster":"Grinding","date":"2016-04-25T19:08:56.646+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"there's more to boosting now, its not simply being carried, you can have 3 people work well together but are mediocre separate, say a top, mid, jg they feed off each other ganks and what not, then when they play alone they don't get a baby sitter or someone to give them kills to help back in the game, or lets say they just have one good player who can carry the other 2, i know plenty of people that have been silver for a couple seasons, but now they are mid gold easy because of  DQ, and no they haven't got any better i know the players that are carrying  them, DQ is garbage system for a competitive ladder even on paper is doesn't make any sense, then include the fact that literally relies on solo players who only want to play alone, it alienates millions of players while using them to make larger amount of players happy, needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few until the few leave and take many with them.","replies":[{"poster":"DtMayo","date":"2016-04-25T19:22:38.464+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":12,"body":"They aren't boosting. They are working as a team in a team game to climb rank. What is wrong with that? I'm sorry I can't take you for your word that they are no better than they used to be. Also dq only relies on solo players for four man premades.\n\nThat's just a silly argument that people shouldn't be able to play well together and climb rank.
