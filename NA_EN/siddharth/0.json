We're unable to assist with game file modifications, and doing so is at your own risk.  This is because it could potentially corrupt your client or crash your game.  I could only advise restoring your client to the [supported language](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751594-Changing-Game-Language).","replies":[{"poster":"Kobold","date":"2016-07-15T15:57:10.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there any support going forward for selecting different languages for the game while being in a different region. This has been requested since Season 2 at the least and should be able to be done with the new client. There is no conceivable reason it should not be implementable with the new client coming up as it is a completely re-coded client, Unless the programmers of the client are hard locking it into one language/region information. \n\nSince you are only part of player support please get this over to the Client developers, thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}
