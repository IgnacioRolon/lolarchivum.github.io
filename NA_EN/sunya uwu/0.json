She's a poke-based champion with high mobility to try to engage on a target she has already poked or attempt to escape an all-in.

You remember that old bullshit adage \"just CC them\", right? Well, not every champ has CC, and so that should mean that Nidalee essentially has a free pass against them? Obviously she will counter some champions, just as some counter her, but currently her heal serves to minimize the damage of her counters while exacerbating her strengths against people she herself counters. \n\nNot only that, but even if she doesn't need the heal herself she can use it on other people, so that they get healed for 45/85/125/165/205 (+50% AP)  in addition to gaining up to 20/30/40/50/60% attack speed (Source: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Nidalee ) So if she doesn't need the heal, she can pass it on as a life-saving tool for someone else on her team, or use it as a straight-up AS steroid for her carry, or whoever else is nearby that does well with high attack speed (Diana, for instance).\n\nShe could use some form of sustain, certainly. I don't see why not. But make it have some form of interaction beyond \"lol I clicked someone and healed them for ridiculous numbers while giving them a large AS steroid.\" Hell, let it keep the AS, but force the target to AA for smaller heals over the duration of a buff. Anything but an interaction-less heal on a long-range escape artist. Viktor has to AA for maximum damage, Ziggs has to AA for maximum damage, Lux has to AA for maximum damage, Xerath has to get up close and hit something for some form of mana sustain. Why? Because they're long-ranged and hard to interact with if you don't or can't force some kind of interaction.
