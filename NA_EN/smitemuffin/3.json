If he doesn't he gets deleted himself. There's always something Rengar can do if he's behind, and that's split push. So he can make himself useful if your team gets ahead of him, and the fact that his ultimate gives him the strength it does allows him to be a strong assassin with a unique and powerful mechanic that makes up for the lack of unconditional gap closers in his kit. \n\nAs for not being able to do anything against him, Rengars generally go for the carries. It's a repetitive pattern, and expected. Good warding and fast reflexes can make any Rengar useless as long as you have the hard CC to do so.
