Part of the problem is that their items are just flat-out _better_ than anyone else&#039;s.

They're playing for lots and lots of money, of course they're going to play the comps that give them the most edge. And since they likely spend hours and hours co-ordinating together to make these sorts of comps work...\n\nNot saying there isn't a problem with some champions, and items, but some of the things that work in the LCS work simply because of the team, not because of the champions and/or items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-03-07T14:20:05.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got to be perfectly honest, I don't see triple adc comps much anymore.  Maybe sometimes double adc if they got corki, ez or jhin mid. Triple only happens if the jungler/top is graves or quinn (and quinn doesn't really feel like an adc, more of a burst assasin with nice map mobility).\n\nJust pick rammus, malph or taric into that comp.  \n\nAlso side note:  Think the ap itemization is getting an update with the upcoming mage update.","replies":[]}]}
