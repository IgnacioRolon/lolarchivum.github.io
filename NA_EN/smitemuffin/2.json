I always do that. For example, I play AD Fizz in ranked because I already have hundreds of games with him, I have full awareness of what I can do, what should I do, and when to pick AD Fizz. The result is that I have a very high winrate with him because not only I know how to play him, but people don't know how to counter him.\n\n(AD Fizz is no longer a meta pick. Since the last nerfs, people stopped using him AD entirely. However, I still use him as an AD off-tank at top lane. I've even found a way to compensate for the W nerfs, but not for the ult nerfs)\n\nAnd for that same reason I don't play Master Yi mid/top. I don't have a lot of idea on how to play him in lane, I would be easily beaten, even though I am already accustomed to use Yi (but only on the jungle).\n\nThere is nothing wrong in going off meta. The problem is when you use something that you don't have idea how to play. However, this rule applies to meta picks anyway (I don't play Riven even though she is meta, I don't know how to play her properly) - It is just that people sadly associate the idea of going with a off-meta pick with trolling or not knowing how to use that pick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2015-11-06T03:42:07.398+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you can still do it.

Most people have that one champ they always want banned. With how you seem so sure this will happen leads me to believe you are the type that's going to intentionally ban a teammates champ since the only way you can be as sure of it as you are is if you do it. In all of my games everyone has something they don't want to fight","replies":[{"poster":"Smitemuffin","date":"2015-11-05T19:47:12.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to be absolutely clear, this is the League of Legends forum.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"I Miss Cannon","date":"2015-11-05T17:37:47.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Irelia, Rumble, Vladimir\nJust to name three picks that don't get banned and are pretty strong.

You don't actually show your intent or even tell your allies. You get in and it tells you where you're going, usually your primary role you picked, then everyone can CHOOSE to show what champ they're going to use or about what they're going to use. So far on the PBE, I haven't had any of my picks banned even when they're completely off the wall like Soraka Jungle. I can see Live being a bit more butthurt about it all, but you don't HAVE to show what champion you're going to use. There's no penalty for not showing it.","replies":[]}]}
