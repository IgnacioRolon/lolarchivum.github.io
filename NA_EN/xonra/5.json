Lee Ult kicks her back over the blue pit, she just LB jumps BACK to him. Lee Flashes the wall to his own mid turret. LB follows, her jump comes off cooldown finally, she jumps, kills Lee under his own turret, then just jumps out safely.\n\n\nWhy should any champion have this much mobility? When you have zero safety anywhere on the map and can kick her over a wall to still be followed over TWO walls and killed under your turret...that is a bit silly. It wasn't even as if the LB was fed, cause at the time he only had 2 kills, so it wasn't a fed LB doing this, nor great mechanical plays. \n\nI don't get it.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-06-07T00:28:06.114+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":3,"body":"She out-mobility'd a Lee Sin who burned a flash *and* his ult.\n\nNow, I'm not a huge fan of Lee Sin, but even I feel sorry for him.","replies":[{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2015-06-07T00:33:54.877+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=tombdragon,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=zAuwR3VR,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-06-07T00:28:06.114+0000)\n>\n> She out-mobility'd a Lee Sin who burned a flash *and* his ult.\n> \n> Now, I'm not a huge fan of Lee Sin, but even I feel sorry for him.\n\nExactly this. And He didn't use flash (LB). It was all his jumps. Lee sin ulted him over a wall to get away, ward hopped over a wall, and flashed over a second wall....still killed under a turret.\n\nSeriously, how is that okay?

Lee sin also didnt use his mobility to get away - he used his ward hop on a pink ward he was standing less than 200 units from, which actually placed him closer to LB instead of further away. \n\nalso take in mind that most professional Lee Sins run 21-9-0. Rush didnt buy a cinderhulk - his only defensive stats came from a sightstone. He was also level 7 while LB was 10. \n\nif an assasin cant kill someone who isnt tanky and 3 levels behind with both of her summoners, im not sure what you expect from this game.\n\nEDIT - and 2 kills with +40 cs is pretty fed in a professional game. whenever you see solo kills in a professional game, the 'killing' team almost always wins.
