Enough is enough, re-enable him like we all know you will after you reveal in Act 4 (or however you want to go about it) that's he's actually alive so those who want to play him, can again, particularly in the current featured game mode that won't be around forever.\n\nIt feels so disingenuous all the Rioters putting on this act that GP is dead (not to mention you all pretending to act surprised) which actually goes against your desire to tell stories (can't tell stories without characters, can't get people interested if their fave champs are gone, and can't have interesting stories without conflict so if you're serious about a good story then MF won't just autowin like you're making her out to right now).\n\nAnd no i'm not a fan, i'm just shocked that you guys are letting lore, something i'm sure Rioters have proclaimed the vast majority of people don't care about, affect the game in such a negative way. Wasn't the mass IoW retcon specifically to decouple lore from gameplay? I guess in a way i'm concerned that you might just be poker-facing this and that GP dieing is intended which is just a bone-headed move, you waste your time revamping the characters lore only to kill him before we have any meaningful stories about him. Not to mention you can't possibly intend to keep him banned forever for countless reason I won't waste my time listing, plus when you do unban him and GP is still dead that will just lessen people's interest in even playing him as if I cared for lore I wouldn't be nearly as interested in playing a champ who no longer exists anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cuix","date":"2015-08-01T19:14:45.576+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was a cool lore tie-in experiment, and I appreciate Riot making such a bold move.
