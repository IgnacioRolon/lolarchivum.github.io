I've yet to get a single honor win or lose on both accounts. Most people just skip the honor screen that pops up and don't honor anyone (especially if they lose, which is some salt right there). \r\n\r\nI know the purpose of it, I know it hasn't been out long, but it doesn't seem I'm seeing anymore honors than I did before. It really doesn't help that you can only get ONE for some pointless reason. So instead of seeing 2 teamworks and an honorable opponent or something, I see nothing at all. Carried 2 games on my other account with 11+ kills and 2 and then 3 deaths. Not a single honor, not a GG after the game. No one seems to actually care sadly, and again I know it is early, but it is a bummer seeing people not seeming to care much more now than they did before.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tainze","date":"2017-06-30T03:50:19.298+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo!

(and i even accidentally honored her because i'm a goddamn idiot, but you know, i wanted to try the new stuff thingie) (oh i got no honors despite singlehandedly carrying that game splitpushing for days that if trick2g could see me he would have awarded me the gold medal of splitpushhood)\n\nI mean, what are you guys up to?
