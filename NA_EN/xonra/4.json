That is a fact, and there are more then enough videos to prove that. Can you climb with a feeder? yes.\nCan you climb with 3 none stop feeders in a match? most likely no, but is there a chance? yes. You post like you think having the mind set will allow players to climb no matter what. That is not true, and we have seen proof of that as well. Does it help to have a good mind set in games? Yes, but that will not have affects on the outcome of the match. \n\nIf the whole team works together then yes all things are possible, but that is the hidden issue that is not being talked about. This is a team base game, and there for in order to climb no matter what you have to work together. That is fact. How ever no matter what you do to a team base video game, you can not force random people who don't know each other to work together, and the odds/math behind this say its very very low % that you will get random people to work together, and react in sync. \n\nNow back in the day when matches last long amounts of time the odds of carrying ones self out of bad matches were very high because of how much time there was to farm, and make choices, but as of today matches give very very little windows open to give players chances to carry them self's \n\nAnother point that does not get talked about is all players in a single match want to carry the match. When you have 5 players wanting the same thing to carry then you will always have players fighting with each other rather than working with each other. When you have 5 players wanting that kill, and fighting for it every match then your not getting team work. All your doing for your game is having players fight over who should be the best on the team. \n\nNothing in this game is an incentive to work together. Only to fight each other to prove who is the best on the team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"hhaavviikk","date":"2019-04-16T05:31:56.002+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"you're right it's a coinflip that's why ANYONE can end up in masters, hell I'll probably be in masters this season but be stuck in tin next season, faker has been known to be stuck in bronze as well, bloody coinflip ranked","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2019-04-16T03:48:38.197+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":43,"body":"How could rank be made that it wasn't a coinflip though?

You need to win the other three games to get 65% wr and rank up. Or you win 40% you lose 40% and you fight for 20%.  If you are only having a serious competitive game 20-30% of the time that shows how seriously bad the system is as it stands. \n\nI think a lot of the problems that cause rants, other than just having such a high percentage of non-competitive “coin flip” games is that it tends to run in cycles.   You can get a hot streak and win 7-8 out of 10 then all of a sudden bam. You can’t even get a competitive game for a whole weekend even though your still playing well personally.  \n\nTo further the point in how bad the ranking and mmr systems are, when you watch or read “how to rank up” videos or post the first recommendation is to op.gg your team.  If “dodging” is first step you need to take in ranking up the system is seriously flawed.\n\nThe second recommendation to ranking up is to only play certain rolls.  That show all rolls are not created or valued equally by rito.  This means your personal skill has little to no value on your rank.  It’s also part of the reason why there is a need for autofill. Everyone needs to play the rank up mode of the moment.   The system needs to incorporate a players personal skill at all positions into its ranking system.\n\nSticking with the how to rank up guides I’ve seen many suggesting not to play ranked during high troll time.  Many weekends or summer.  Again showing there is a huge problem with rito controlling it’s games.  Yes rito can do things to help reduce the trolls.  They just don’t because it would take some effort that doesn’t directly lead to income. No one thinks of the indirect income that is lost due to so many players having a negative game experience. \n\nLast thing I want to touch on for toxic players and player currently under punishment of some sort.  It was suggested they be banned from rank while the time is being served.   The issue with that as stated was then it hurts the normals.   Well I would suggest that they don’t get into normal normals either.   They would joun up for normals, but then the system would identify them as “under punishment” and put them into a separate group to play with other under punishment players. Yes that might give longer queues but you know what, they are being punished and longer queues  will have a larger impact on player behavior than not being able to chat ever could hope for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iDarkWind","date":"2019-04-16T15:35:18.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You guys telling it only matters coinflip when there are youtubers out there doing unranked to challenger series and monstly suceed... idk man.","replies":[{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2019-04-16T16:46:16.659+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically the elitist argument of being diamond+ to climb?

They will be and this should be a player expectation.  There is a concept in Elo and MMR called uncertainty. The systems do not and realistically can not know ones  \"skill\" with 100% accuracy with 0 data. Elo and MMR ratings are meant to represent a Mean range of performances and become more accurate over time. So some times those 50% fair games are going to be onsided shitshows. This does not break the system, it does not make them flawed, because there is nothing out there that can account for everything with the accuracy required to predict skill off 0 data.  Skill is a mix of innate talent and gained knowlage.   I'm going to give a slighty abstract analogy here to highlight the difficulty of accomplishing a predictive system that accounts for skill.  There are 150 hypothetical people in a room. I want you to rate them by how well they can make tikka masala competitvly vs echother, cooking is after all a skill and you can judge who is a better cook by the end result. Now You know none of them, You don't get to see them, you don't get to hear them, talk to them, your not allowed their names, your allowed 0 interaction with them.  How accurate do you think your going to be when your asked to rate them befor takeing a bite of the end result?  To many people are expecting and asking of MM  and MMR this as they expect it to know player skill with out games played. \n\nNext up, expectations for what a mean range can mean. People need to keep in mind that a mean  average can be identical but have different values. (100,50,0)  (50,50,50)  (0, 150,0.) ( 77,46,27) All 4 sets have the same mean. Applied to League this means that players even at the exact same MMR with 100% accuracy to their \"skill\" do not have identical best and worst case expectations.\n\nMore things impact it. Player skill changes, new champions with low knowledge can hurt. Buffs can help, nerfs can hurt. Your Mains being banned can hurt, your hard counter being banned can help. ETC ETC. then funky fringe cases that probably are not of any statistical significance still apply if you only look at single matches, like  if some one uses another persons account cuz then all data prior is invalidated.\n\nThe nice think about MMR is it does get to a workably fair range eventually, it never locks you in so changes positive or negative will move you correctly up and down the ladder.\nThe down side, time invested, it requires data points. Also despite best efforts of the MM it will make you some trash games. It does not account for player behaviors. \n\nIts workable and its better then a massive # of other options. Its also superior to 0 attempts for match making.\n\nI love MMR systems, I am not wild that most players are completely unrealistic of their expectations. I don't think riots is inherently the best option out there because I feel they care to much about player perception. Blatantly my oppenion but Duoing needs to be reworked to function of hidden MMR ranges to never go past what MM would build as a  \"fair\" match. Additionally this season by adding new tiers (this only makes players feel a bit better about things in multiple divisions with 0 actual impact on how MMR functions.) positional que (Rewards OTPs/players with low champion pools, make folks feel better about getting auto filled.) and changing the starting MMR for \"newbies\" (addresses the silver complaints about getting new players in their matches... despite the fact they would end up with more wins from weak players then losses.)\n\nEnd result, I don't think It breaks MMR given that I can look at the ladder and see its still moveing good players up and bad ones down. I do think it impacts match quality. I largly think player behavior systems are the best place to invest time and money currently to make the game more enjoyable… MMR wont deal with toxicity besides moving people so toxic they lose games frequently enough for being that toxic.\n\n\nPhew. Ok so this was probably a much longer response then you expected. If you took the time to go over it thanks for your time. I Hope you find it educational and if this was mostly stuff you already know my bad. If I provided a fact (my opinions are all just imo so i tried to be clear when it was an opinion) on something  that's provably incorrect please inform me. If my post is accurate on the facts all is well, its what I strive for. Some support would be nice cuz half the reason I went off is to educate others but you and others don't owe me your time.\n\nI really hope this cleared up why you can see why really good and bad players can be in a match even when it was made to be fair and has a identical team MMR or variance of less then 10.","replies":[{"poster":"IainG10","date":"2019-04-19T02:02:18.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And all that before we take into account things like Smurfs bending the system over backwards...\n\nApparently before I started playing, there was a more visible rating system; it was changed to the Ranked Tier system because players were disheartened to see their position on the ladder not move very much (even though the ladder was the whole server). The thing is, now everything is hidden behind Tiers, we actually have less of an indication how good someone actually is... We have a general idea, but even that is slightly useless when you take into account Demotion Protection and Promotions. \n\nPersonally, I'd much rather go back to that old system; I'd also like to see the back of variable LP change, Promotions and Demotion Protection. Another good addition would be to modulate MMR based on number of games; if the system can take, say, 10s longer to put people below 100 total games (across all Seasons) with others of that play rate, then it probably should. I've seen quite a few games where one team has a slightly higher win rate on a lower number of games, vs a team with a lower win rate but far more games played; and almost always the more experienced team wins. winning 60% of 10 games is far less statistically accurate than 60% of 100 games when assessing skill.\n\nYou mentioned things like different win rates on different champions, and whilst Riot _could_ really refine things down by making you pick before listing, that really would screw queue times into the deep unacceptable. I agree that there are variables in the MMR system that are never going to be controlled. That said I would like to see Autofill go away as well; Ranked is meant to be about playing your best, and being thrown into an off-role you almost never play isn't really your best... (I am a Supp Main though, so it's not like I've ever really had an issue with queue times...).\n\nIt is nice to see a well-reasoned response though, rather than either vitriol or pointless anecdotal/purely opinion-based spurge (like we're seeing with the 'Should there be bans in ARAM?' discussion right now; it's all either 'I only play ARAM and I hated bans' or rants about ARAM-only accounts).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Eonslegacy","date":"2019-04-16T16:18:31.565+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You dont seem to understand anything said correctly.\nBut you are at least slightly close to what they mean.","replies":[]}]}]}
