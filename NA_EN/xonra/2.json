I know this isn't the PBE area, but more eyes here than there overall.\r\n\r\nI am wondering if there are people getting pushed further into the queue somehow or something because I've been sitting here 10 minutes, and in that time my position in the Queue just keeps going up (I'm about 500 higher in the queue than when I started, and my wait time just keeps increasing).\r\n\r\nThis happening to anyone else? Started at around 1100 and I'm now at 1614 somehow.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-30T17:12:00.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Xonra,\n\nThere was a large volume of players logging in yesterday due to all the preseason changes being updated on PBE.

I've applied two straight years and along with others have never heard anything back yet some players who rarely play league applied and got a pbe account within two weeks. Why is it we never hear anything even a reason as to why we haven't been accepted? \n\nI read a post where someone threatened to uninstall league over no harrowing skins this year and you guys responded. Really?\n\nWhy is it that I cannot get a response on something like this? \n\nWhy are players who have been applying for months on in not getting anything yet people who play once a week get it?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-03T00:50:56.885+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey NightEfx,\n\nI'd responded to the other thread because I had context behind the release of skins, as well as how the normal Harrowing event is being modified and done differently from other years. \n\nAs for the PBE, I don't handle who gets accepted/rejected. However, who we accept depends on what we'd like tested. \n\nIn general, we're looking for highly active level 30 accounts (but if there's something we're testing for new players, we'll be looking for active lower levels). If we're releasing a new jungler, we'd be looking for experienced jungle mains. \n\nIn addition, we do consider a player's toxicity level when going through applications, so, if you're not a positive player, you'll be less likely to receive an invitation to the PBE community.","replies":[{"poster":"NightEfx","date":"2015-11-03T02:20:28.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Who would I need to speak with because I'm very upset at this point and it's even more upsetting reading people who don't even play the game frequently get accepted within two weeks of applying.
