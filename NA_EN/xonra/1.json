I got out of a game where it told me I got the S and the token to go unlock Mastery 6 and I was all excited and went to check, and despite knowing I had received around 5-6 keys shards (mostly a mental tally of seeing the message about it pop up) total stored up, I had one key shard when I went to check. I haven't used them I know for a fact, as the 2 chests I had are still sitting here, and I had to buy a mystery champ token to get the blue essence for the Mastery 6.\n\nStarting to see quite a few annoying bugs just today with the client, first I'm perma stuck on \"Autofill Activated\" for some reason (5 games in a row that I noticed it), despite how many times I am autofilled (Yes I am aware I got some games mid, sometimes we get awkwardly filled), and now I'm getting the message saying I got a key shard multiple times, but I don't actually have said key shards in my Loot. \n\n------------------------\n\nP.S. The Autofill issue seems to have resolved itself for whatever reason, but since posting the first variation of this thread in the wrong section, I \"received\" another key shard, but I still have only 1 in my Loot.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-30T18:11:43.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on the updated client?  I'm curious if it's not dismissing the notification and possible spamming you with that message?\n\nLooking into this for you, the last key fragment I've seen was obtained on the 23rd.  The one before that was the 14th.  I do see you've made 2 keys so far with the fragments obtained since the beginning of the month.  This unlocked content including Sandstorm Katarina and Program Soraka.  This brings your total fragment  at 1.    If this doesn't clear things up, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we can offer more context individually through there.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2016-12-31T06:36:09.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am on the updated client, yes.\n\nBasically at the end of the game when it gives you the message about receiving a key shard, it gives that as normal, and not every game. It is why I thought little of it until I finally went to check and saw that despite getting multiple of that message over...truthfully I'm not sure how many games.\n\nAlso, the 23rd probably sounds about right, but I've gotten multiple of the notification since then, but as I said not received the keys for those specifically. Most of the notifications have come this week but had a few last week. And correct I did make some keys out of what I had, which is why I knew I had the one shard left.\n\nAppreciate the response, and I'll toss up a support ticket. I'm not stressing it as I didn't really \"lose\" anything, but I didn't know if this was a bug or just an awkward occurrence.","replies":[]}]}]}
