I think the two side twists and bangs in the front could be a little more free flowing and a little bit neater, the strawberry pigtails in the back are absolutely adorable, but the front just looks fucking stupid and I, personally, wish they were changed because right now the front looks like you guys didn't know what to do with it.\n\nOH, and one more thing, extend the claws to look more devilish and sinistar cause right now she looks like she gots glaze dipped bugles on her fingers. LMAO \n\nReference if you guys don't know what BUGLES are, \n\nhttps://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi5.walmartimages.com%2Fasr%2F5ebab00c-ef7a-4c3b-a763-937cd75b9148_1.643bd9791c63697885a73464ef1c3d10.jpeg%3FodnHeight%3D450%26odnWidth%3D450%26odnBg%3DFFFFFF&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1 \n\nTell me your thoughts, do you guys think these seem like reasonable changes? ♥️","replies":[]}
