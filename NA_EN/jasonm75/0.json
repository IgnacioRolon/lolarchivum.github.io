Is this a common issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T22:45:10.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That number two is signifying that you have two of the same skin shard. If you were to click and disenchant, you'll get the essence and still have another to work with. As it turns out, you could actually perform another random shard reroll using both of those shards if you wanted. \n\nI did also notice the other most recent skin you got was Medieval Twitch, which wasn't a shard but was automatically redeemed. Congrats on that rare skin first of all!! Second, you'll be able to find that skin tucked away in your collection already ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"Jasonm75","date":"2017-08-09T19:47:47.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WOW I haven't realised that this skin is so rare!  Thank you so much for your response- now I understand how this Hextech system works!  You made my day :)","replies":[]}]}]}
