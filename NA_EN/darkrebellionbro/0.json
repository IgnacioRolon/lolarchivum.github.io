To be honest the main reason I got it is because it's free but right now that seems to be the only good thing about it.  (No offense)  The reason why is because I've been having this extremely frustrating problem on multiplayer.  Every time I try to join a lobby to play with other people on the custom game lobby I get disconnected and they give me this message: \" The owner has banned you from this custom game.\"  Did I do something wrong or something?   Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"TSM Morris","date":"2016-08-15T18:19:27.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Click play>classic>summoner's rift>intro or beginner\n\nYou have to level up to unlock the other stuff, nobody plays custom games to play league.

Custom matches are generally when other players are wanting to play with their friends or people from specific sub-communities of League, and may be a less friendly environment for someone new to League who's trying to learn the ropes.
