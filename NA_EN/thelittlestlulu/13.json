Just be patient.\n\nThis doesn't actually solve the core problem here, which is that mastery of a champion is still gated by something completely unrelated to that mastery.  The current implementation is obviously unacceptable, requiring RP to get any reasonable amount of mastery, but allowing IP really doesn't solve anything as comprehensively as I think people want.\n\nEach champion shard, when disenchanted, is worth somewhere in the ballpark of 200-400 blue essence.  This means that every mastery level will require roughly 2-3 champion shards, and depending on the cost this can add up.\n\nLet's say that each champion shard costs 1000 IP, right?  This means that every mastery level costs 2000-3000 IP, and if we assume an average IP gain of 80 per game this means every mastery level takes about 25-37.5 games **in addition to the mastery totals already gained beforehand**.\n\n---\n\nYou know what would be a more organic way to do this?  Disenchanting mastery tokens into white essence that can then replace blue essence in the recipe for mastery.  Not only does this encourage playing the champion well for longer, it means that champion mastery can be earned exclusively by dedicating oneself to a champion and playing that champion well.  Isn't that the entire point of Champion Mastery to begin with?","replies":[{"poster":"dunkeroni","date":"2016-05-28T08:15:56.791+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"I'm sure you can get 1000-2000 IP by playing that champion if you want.

You could just keep playing that champion if you want, but it won't get you 6-7 any faster after you already have your S tokens. For that you have to actually decide that you WANT that champion to get mastery 6-7 by spending something that is untied to that champion specifically. This means you can't automatically get mastery 6-7 on every champion that you play enough, because those mastery points should indicate that you not only are good, but you want to show it off on that champion more than any others. This means that players with higher masteries actually like the champion enough to upgrade it, instead of just showing that they play enough to accrue a huge pile of mastery points (like with lv 5 masteries).\n\nIn short: If mastery 6-7 had the same progression as every other mastery (or some bastardized version where you earned points to be converted into other points by playing the same champion), then it would be just as meaningless as mastery 5.

I may not need mastery with that particular champion to obtain the white essence requirement, but I still need the tokens specific to that champion.  My ability to play the game at a high level consistently would be enough to let me show my mastery, and would be **far** more relevant than my ability to pay RP/IP for the same result.\n\n> The way it is now, you can get up to mastery 5 by just playing the champion, after that you need to get S ranks.

Do these people not deserve to be able to show mastery simply because they aren't willing or able to spend high amounts of resources?\n\n>This means that players with higher masteries actually like the champion enough to upgrade it, instead of just showing that they play enough to accrue a huge pile of mastery points (like with lv 5 masteries).\n\nI have thirteen mastery tokens that I can't spend because of the arbitrary essence restriction.  I love each of these champions, but because I'm unwilling to spend RP (soon IP) I am not allowed to show that I am dedicated to them.  I've demonstrated my time investment by accruing enough mastery points and I've demonstrated my skill by accruing enough mastery tokens, so why can't I show off these achievements?\n\n> In short: If mastery 6-7 had the same progression as every other mastery (or some bastardized version where you earned points to be converted into other points by playing the same champion), then it would be just as meaningless as mastery 5.

IP has the exact same problems, but since it's an easier resource to obtain than RP it's at a lower grade.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2016-05-28T12:28:25.767+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like it would be just as effective to require a couple more tokens per level and remove the essence requirement altoghther.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2016-05-28T16:38:00.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hyrum Graff,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8LAfusJA,comment-id=0003000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-05-28T12:28:25.767+0000)\n>\n> It seems like it would be just as effective to require a couple more tokens per level and remove the essence requirement altoghther.\n\nTrue story.

You have to accumulate 2 of them. In order to actually use them, you either need 500 blue essence, a Teemo shard, or a Teemo permanent. All of those can only come from chests. The statistically most probable way of unlocking the Mastery 6 icon is getting random champion shards and disenchanting them. It takes around 2-3 champion shards to get 500 blue essence. \n> \n> Then whenever you get a S or better playing Teemo, you get a &quot;Teemo Mastery 7&quot; token. You need 3 of them.

I really hope they change that because I already got chests on almost all the champs I play..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Firefox509","date":"2016-05-28T04:38:14.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"The whole point of this thread is you have to play  other champions and get an S grade to get a chest so you can even begin to get champ shards to get essense to craft the mastery 6 and 7. \n\nIn order to get mastery 6 and 7 you need blue essence or the champion's shard from hextech crafting. Which means you need chests. \nYou can only get 1 chest per champion. if you play nothing but one champion you can only get 1 chest, ever. \n\nMeaning you have to play other champions to get chests to get essence to get mastery 6 & 7 which is completely retarded.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralimak","date":"2016-05-28T13:51:26.905+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Mystery Coin\" - gives you only champion shards - purchased with IP or RP.

I know I did, and I got plenty of champion shards. And I'm like \"whoa, I have these champs already, what do?\"\n\nThen this new mastery system comes out, and I use my champion shards to make blue essence for my lvl 7 Azir <3\n\nThe mastery system works really well because if you've been around long enough you still have a use for champion shards for champs you probably have already.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, if you don't want to grind to get chests, then don't. Mastery level isn't a requirement, it's just an option. Personally I'd be more than willing to drop $5 or $10 to ensure I'd have enough essence to get 1 or 2 champions to 6/7, but something something different strokes for different folks. \n\nRiot could've just made lvl 6 and 7 based off of masstery points, but then you'd see Boards spammed with \"Riot put in no thought to this it's so dumb...btw wtf am i supposed to use blue essence for I have all the champs rito pls\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-05-29T01:40:56.514+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The question is:\nWhy would you want Mastery Level 7 on Lulu?\n\nIt's blue, while level 6 is purple.\n\nI'm getting mixed signals here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meriipu","date":"2016-05-28T23:05:00.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"aha how many times are you going to make this thread when they already said it is being fixed","replies":[]},{"poster":"ilija326","date":"2016-05-28T17:37:02.019+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"totaly agree with everything this guy says but ffs \"LOOK AT ME I MAIN LULU I HAVE 500K POINTS\" on every post.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HolyLimits101","date":"2016-05-28T12:39:17.335+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They said they would add purchasable random champion shards for IP so just wait man.","replies":[]}]}
