Ever since Demon-blade Trynd all legendary skins have had new voice overs. The controversy over DT Lulu was because it was the first non-release skin at 1350 yet as far as many players could tell it was a recolor with custom particles. As you've said the work on pix was hard to notice. Without the animation's to pix DT Lulu would only qualify as a 975 skin on the grounds of her custom particles (which is a shaky argument at best given recent releases).\n\nIf it was before your time and you haven't spoken to anyone with more relevant experience then just don't post about it.

I'm not sorry for what I'm doing because Rioters should at least google something before posting about it.\n\nWhen Riot Whist was talking about animation timing, how much time goes into making different animations, and even how animations are generally used in League, those were well thought out posts the clearly conveyed an understanding of the material being discussed. Riot Whist, please keep posting on the boards posts like these.\n\nRioters are human but when they make the decision to post on these boards under a red-name account they are making the choice to speak from a position of authority. That carries with it the expectation that when they are speaking of information about League of Legends, and when presenting that information as fact, the information will be verifiably true. \n\nRiot Whist chose to post under a riot account, a position of authority. Riot Whist did not do basic fact checking before posting and even admitted to a 1 in 5 chance of being wrong. Riot Whist did not do basic fact checking until multiple players called BS. Riot Whist then changes gears by saying that the scenario where incorrect information is posted and later corrected is preferable to not posting information at all.\n\nIf that last part doesn't seem to follow, it is because it doesn't. This is an authority figure justifying not doing basic fact checking by claiming something only vaguely related to the matter at hand that everyone can get behind. Posting something over nothing is definitely better than nothing at all but that has little to do with basic fact checking nor does it excuse neglecting to do so. That a Rioter would defend themselves not doing basic fact checking by distracting everyone with mass-appeal statement that limits everything discussed to two unrelated topics is disheartening.\n\nIf I'm a dick for this then so be it, because all I'm really asking is that when you aren't sure of something, say so. Failing that, then as an authority figure when it come to the point where you are typing or thinking something like \"I'm 82% sure.\" please stop and fact-check yourself.

We only have so much time to work, we could animate a long dance, or make a shorter fun looping dance and put that saved time into polish on more frequently seen animations and bonus unneeded, but nice to have, animations like tower attacks.\n\n\nI'd argue emotes are a worthwhile development time sink despite the fact they do not benefit the gameplay, however, I think they have diminishing returns with the time spent on them in most cases. While I think some dances are too short and could use extra time to put in variations to the loop (Trundle), some dances I think are just too long to the point it stops adding value (Caitlyn). \n\n\nDevelopment is a balancing act - we only get X time to spend, so we need to spend it wisely.
