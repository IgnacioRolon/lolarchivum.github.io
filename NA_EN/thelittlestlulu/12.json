The trouble is dealing with the buggy \"sticking\" mechanic. It's hotbox is just so dodgy. You might toss it as a champion and it prioritized a minion. You might be targeting on specific minion in a pack for zoning purposes and it sticks to one outside of the range you were looking for. Don't get me started on team fights. Good luck getting two to stick to the same champion. More often than not, you will throw it into a pack with a target in mind and one sticks but the next hits someone else. \n\nThe problem with the ability is that there are 3 gates to its effectiveness: it's toss range, it's sticking range, and it's prioritizing of targets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"magic pole","date":"2015-07-26T18:42:11.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the delay is long enough that unless you tag them with the bomb, they most likely won't suffer the damage.\n\nthe hitbox of the bomb itself is quite small, and it is a slow moving lob.

I also forgot to be more specific and add the fact its based off their max HP. So, being able to gain an extra 70%(+) health regen based of your max health for at least 4 seconds seems awesome to me.\n\nSay you are with a Graves. At max level, he has 18.575 health regen and has 1979.12 max heath. If Zilean we to use his max W on Graves, he'd be healing 1385.384 bonus (this is every 5 seconds, so every second, he regenerates 277 health). This is not useless, because this happens up to 6 seconds.\n\nOr, if he boosts just the health regen by the certain %. He can boost it at max level to be able to do (at least) 31.5775 (which would be more fair now looking at numbers). With, at least 500 AP, he is now able to raise up the % to 120% and now he regenerates +22.29 over 3 (or more) seconds. \n\nI'm not saying Zilean can't have a better ability like the one you said, but with this much better kit, he would be able to be a competitive pick.

This is more tanky than it needs to be. This is Galio's W only without the bonus armor and magic resist for a even less time. Since its 100% of that damage was reverted into a heal, I don't see the need. It's also worse considering they NEED to take damage for it to work. And, if they do not take damage in the last 1.5 seconds, its null. They also might only receive that one shot, ability damage or whatever damage from only 1.5 seconds ago (ergo, more likely 100-500 heal). That's not only tough for Riot to develop, but hard to use. Its great for if a enemy gangs up on your ADC, but its also a troll move. You revert supposedly all the damage, you put no cap on the point at which it ends. The sad thing is, my heal that goes over the next 3 seconds, will only heal at max level (if we go with the 50% heal) is 30% of his health over 3 seconds. You on the other hand want to revert all the damage. That's not fun, nor is it fair. With no cool down reducing W anymore, he cannot just keep redoing the heal. It, itself should cost 100 mana (now scaling from 60/70/80/90/100 mana per use). It will also now only heal for 10/20/30/40/50% (+[3% AP]%) (now if he gets even 1000 AP, it will now only do a +30% heal which in turn only allows 48% heal at most the first 3 seconds) now that I looked at the numbers. This is so that his heals aren't crazy. His cool down should be 16 seconds (flat) to stop any over doses. \n\nHis early game heal would also be very weak, only allowing a 10% heal (maybe 11.5% or more) over the 3 seconds (which means he'd only be able to get about a 6% heal over the 3 seconds and up to a 12% heal if used again).","replies":[{"poster":"Personwithhat","date":"2015-07-27T01:25:11.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CD is nothing ona zilean.

In which time people can easily avoid them.\n\nI really wish they would look into either an alternate means of utilizing his Q's or change the throw speed > activation time on them to at least make them reliable.\n\nBecause at this point, I'd rather have the old Q's back and remove the stun from it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krinu","date":"2015-07-26T23:03:27.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the problems with him right now boil down to:\n- He doesn't have a passive.\n- His Q is soft countered by *boots* and is flat out useless against champions with dashes.\n\nNow, obviously, there are countless different things you could do for a passive. But... if you want my $0.02... I think it should be something like this:\n\n**Timeless, Eternal: All effects with a duration applied by Zilean last (X * level)% longer.**\n\nIt plays into his time theme, it makes him scary late game (where he's had issues with falling off in performance), and it opens some fun interactions with items on-use abilities.\n\nAs for his the second problem, how about this: **Rewind: Reduces the remaining cooldown of Time Bomb and Time Warp by 10 seconds. Additionally, Zilean's knowledge of the future increases the enemy Champion pickup radius of his next bomb used within 5 seconds by 100%.**\n\nI suppose you could always just hang a passive \"increases bomb pickup radius by 25%\" effect on either Rewind or Time Bomb, but frankly, that might make him *too* good. This way makes his nearly impossible to land double-bomb a little easier to pull off without turning him into another Morgana-esque safe laner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Harrys Nut Shack","date":"2015-07-25T23:08:24.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They need to start by giving him a non-useless passive and go from there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ComannderShepard","date":"2015-07-25T20:01:14.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"im in the .82%  :0.  \n\nDouble Q's are incredibly hard to land.  If you try to play him as a support (like me) it's very hard to have an impact because bombs do relatively low damage and you run out of mana if you are constantly trying to double Q.  E feels mediocre (in lane anyways) and can only really help for ganks and other situational scenarios.  His ult is still there though.
