Maybe in the early game if the enemy tried to fight you 1v1, but he had no mobility and relatively low base move speed. \n\nOnce you entered the mid game, and had constant team fights rather than 1v1s. There were a copule of optimal ways to play malz depending on your opponents and team. \n\n1) Q silence the burst mages and assassins to delay their damage and allow your team to get the initial lead in the fight. Use your W on the front line and E the focus target or lowest health (to make bounce more likely). The R was best used as targeted focus power or peel for a more fed carry. \n\n2) Q silence the tanks to prevent peeling of your assassins. W could be used as a zoning tool to split up the enemy back line from the front line or into two groups. E was too short range to reach the back line most of the time, so you'd normally throw it onto the squishiest front line to just get it doing damage, or hold it to for the first enemy to drop low. R could be used to hold the carry in place while the tanks are silenced, or on the tanks to allow your assassins to get in and kill the carries. \n\nOr some combination of those two.\n\n\nThose are just the AP versions though. \n\nIf it's an AD malz, then it's a lot more complex, but basically focus on voidling micro, W becomes a pure zoning tool, Q is still useful as a disruption though you want to be using it off CD. E is just a targeting tool for your voidlings, and you hold onto R until you've stacked your voidlings or to prevent a mobile enemy from disengaging.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LoLKiru","date":"2017-04-22T19:43:02.411+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XTRMN00B1337,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XVbxGRNH,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-04-22T19:08:01.260+0000)\n>\n> Riot only reverts reworks if the old champion was healthy.

RIP**.\n\n\n - Current Call of the Void inherently goes against Malzahar's immobile nature because as a spell with delay (Now in spell cast), it basically had more range when enemies were moving towards you and less range when moving away.  The whole \"gotta wait a few seconds to cast Q to reset E\" has resulted in a spell where instead of nuking people who dare enter your space, you are now trying to chase them as they run away and hopefully reset your Q so that your E doesn't just \"tickle\" them.\n\n\n - Current Voidlings have been nerfed to the point of uselessness **UNLESS** someone (i.e. Malzahar himself) tanks damage for them... Yea... uhum... 10/10 best design.... so wonderful.  Anyways... There is also the fact that people keep saying Voidlings are easier to control now... when they have the same priorities as before except... Directing them with auto attacks when E was not in effect was taken away and the leash was taken away (Which allowed you to pull back your Voidlings before they died and gave money to the enemy)... But its apparently easier to control them now according to the community right?\n\n\n - Malefic Visions for one does less damage, so its a weak spell on its own.  Secondly as stated before for Call of the Void, its reset function caused a weird kit that forces you to chase after people as an immobile champion in order to maximize your damage output.  Thirdly (A more minor issue) it does not give back flat amount of mana per bounce anymore and instead returns 2% of your max mana per bounce.  Old E got to rank 5 at level 9 and gave back 26 mana.  New E won't give you back that amount until level 15 assuming you had bought a Morellonomicon by then.  However if you don't get a mana item at all, Malzahar will only return 21-22 mana per bounce... at level 18 >_>\n\n\n - Old pool could be placed anywhere, anytime, for whatever you needed it for.  New pool can only be placed where an enemy targeted by your ult is.  Nuff Said.\n\n\n - And finally... Nether Grasp **lost its flat damage** which used to deal death to assassins or other squishies that dived the backline because he used to be anti-assassin/anti-dive.  Now his kit makes him assassin-proof (Not 100% guaranteed).  Anti-Assassin =/= Assassin-Proof.  It also makes it so that QSS now completely negates its damage by allowing people to walk off the pool rather than taking flat damage through the tether.\n\n\n - Bonus gripes go to:\n    - Base armor reduced by 2\n    - Movement speed reduced by 5\n    - Auto Attack Range reduced by 50\n\n---\n\nI honestly don't know how people see these differences and justify trying to say his kit is the same. **(Screams internally)**","replies":[{"poster":"Scary Door","date":"2017-04-23T14:46:43.458+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree completely.  \n\nRiot basically redesigned a kit for what they claim was an \"unhealthy\" original design, but the redesign was so binary that it was either destined to be completely overpowered and oppressive or utterly useless and not at all fun to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2017-04-24T00:05:04.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"inb4 sejuani rework ^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2017-04-23T23:17:27.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont forget that the reduced mana costs coupled with the lesser impact of the E mana return (plus a whole lot of changes like faster Q and actual afk farming) destroyed his skillfloor and made him mega uber easy to play, compared to the niche 2% pickrate champion that existed for several years, which is also mainly why he became this broken abomination.\n\nAnd all those gutted bases and ratios?

Just how like the rework was the kind of rework i'd expect to see from someone who had never touched the champion prior to being told they'd be reworking them.\n\nThat said, the biggest difference is that, while his basic mechanics haven't changed, all they really accomplished with the rework was to make it more simplistic for the malzahar player by removing their agency. \nNo longer does the player have control over how much damage they will do, instead it's all been shifted to the W, which is basically just a fire and forget weapon. \nOn top of that, they added basically no real value to his kit with the passive (even before all the nerfs), they just took the voidling blocking mechanic which skilled players could take advantage of and made it available to people of any experience or skill level.\n\nI've used this analogy before, but this is actually what the malzahar rework was like. They took a car, broke it down into pieces, then reassembled it as a boat, added in a few necessary pieces, then held it all together with duct tap to make it functional.\n\nThe reason the only meaningful nerfs have been to his passive and W, is because those were the new pieces which they added, and they are literally carrying the rest of the, now useless, kit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-04-23T00:13:31.053+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":17,"body":"I like the {{champion:90}}  update, I haven't seen any issue with it.","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-04-23T01:16:08.986+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"He doesn't fit the identity he should.
