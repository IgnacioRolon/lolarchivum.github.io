Janna getting stuff taken away from her is the kind of thing that just happens in the background, it's expected and normal now. Meanwhile the must ban list is getting up near 12 champs and Janna is nowhere close to it but don't worry about that we've got supports to murder LOOK OVER THERE SONA DAMAGED THE ADC GET HER\n\n I think part of it is that Janna doesn't rely on one particular item.

R u kidding me. MAYBE if teemo has a ton of shrooms up which take a crap ton of mana. Pre 6 teemo is easy unless you're xin or something similar. Lulu has a speed up/polymorph, an aoe slow, and a shield. Teemo only has one of those pre 6.\n\nShe's a Mage. Why wouldn't she use more mana. Even then it isn't really a big problem for her unless you're spamming spells in which case it should be. Once she has a catalyst/forbidden idol it's really not a problem at all. If you think she has mana problems look at lissandra. She has a passive that is only useful for mana, and she still has mana issues.\n\nThey don't have to be hyper aggressive. Playing just about any Melee against her is hell. She may be a counter against aggressive champs, but she doesn't even have to play that safe or outplay you. You can do everything right, yet she lives just by clicking r and e on herself.\n\nI don't hate lulu, but you have to understand that she is incredibly obnoxious/frustrating to lane against as most melee champs.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-03-11T12:09:16.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing inherently, but Riot is intending to nerf her usefulness for pro-tier play.\nShe's a priority pick because you can take her in an early rotation and flex her to three different spots.
