Lately I&#039;ve been only able to see the bad things in people.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been particularly worried about the fate of healthcare lately though. Now I&#039;m on sertraline and there&#039;s a chance I&#039;d wind up killing myself if I wasn&#039;t, and fortunately that stuff is actually rather cheap, but my brother is on suboxone which is vastly more expensive, and is pretty much relying on obamacare to be able to get it. I really don&#039;t know what I would do if he got cut off considering I can barely afford my own medicine, so I just sit here worrying and hoping that doesn&#039;t happen.","replies":[]}
