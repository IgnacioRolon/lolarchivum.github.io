I thought she was going to be released in patch 6.24, but I did not notice the small writing, at first, that said she will be released later on in the patch. They are implementing the item sets, but riot said it will likely slip past the beta, meaning creating item sets will be added after the legacy client is no longer available. It took them a while to make the new client and it is far from being complete, so just be patient. It is better if they take their time to give us a good new client rather than rush it and have a crappy new client with loads of bugs. You can still make item sets now, and maybe prepare some in advance, but if you know what items you want you can just search for them in the all items tab. Saves time if you think about what items you want before you back so you can just quickly grab them when you do back. It eventually would become almost second nature. I find myself relying less on my items sets and more on my knowledge of items and match ups so I build according to the match. Maybe there is a new build that is working really well and you want to copy it, have it up on a mobile device to reference from in the mean time until we can once again create item sets in the new client. You can sort through items in the store so it really should not take 20+ seconds to look for an item.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2016-12-08T19:53:27.329+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"More like \"6 years later\", if you ask me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-12-08T23:58:12.289+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"6 months, haha, the tribunal has slipped past them for how many years now?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Oglaf","date":"2016-12-08T17:38:04.893+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even better question: Why would they remove the item sets but keep the utterly useless \"Summoner's Spells\"-tab in the new client?","replies":[{"poster":"Tentacle Advisor","date":"2016-12-08T23:55:14.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I've always wondered what that tab was ever needed for, to begin with?","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-12-09T01:03:06.875+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't even give you the numbers for the spells (not even cooldowns).
