When the game first came out, it was pretty chaotic, and you could play any champion in any role and be successful because few people had to knowledge required to counter pick. Then, as people started realising the value of farm, they  started assigning themselves dedicated lanes to farm in. But oh no, there are more players than lanes, better have someone dedicated to farming the jungle so the team has more gold. And so the role of jungler developed. \n\nBut there were still 3 lanes and 4 players, so it was clear that there would not  be enough income to sustain 4 carry champions, so someone would have to go without farm and try and help the team as much as possible without carrying by damage. And so the role of support developed.\n\nNow which type of character would benefit most from having this support lane with them? Tanks don't need to be supported because they are more valuable for their utility. Mages can't be supported because splitting the exp would put them behind in lvls and therefore make their abilities do less dmg. However, marksmen are perfect candidates for being supported, because they rely predominantly on gold and not on levels, because they do most of their damage with autos. And so the support/ADC combo was developed. This duo lane was assigned bot lane because it is closest to dragon and therefore can have most impact on dragon fights.\n\nThe association with mid lane and high damage carries is simply because mid is (obviously) the central lane, so these carries can have most impact on the entire map. They also get a slight level advantage (which therefore makes their abilities do more damage) because the minions reach mid lane faster. And so the roles of carry midlaners developed.\n\nNow look at top lane. Before herald, there was nothing of any importance on that side of the map, so you were unlikely to receive any help from your team due to the lost pressure on bot lane/dragon if the jungler was to come top. Therefore top laners need to be champions that are able to survive on their own with little assistance from their team. This means is was unreliable to play any carries top, because if you fell behind your team would be unable to help and you would be useless. It was therefore logical that top laners would be champions that do not require much gold to operate and would still be useful to their team (through utility/peel) if they fell behind. And so tanky and bruiser champions were played top.\n\nI'm  not entirely sure why I wrote all this out, but I guess I just wanted to demonstrate how the pros didn't just pick lane numbers out of a hat and decide to role with it. There is a reason this meta has existed for 5+ years and not seen any major changes, and that's because this meta is logical and optimal.","replies":[{"poster":"Totalwanabe","date":"2016-07-18T07:30:50.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"logical yes optimal is left to interpretation, what i love to do is play out of meta sometime has a jungler i will forsake jungle and do a 2 tops deny farm and dominate kill the enemy top the positive effect it will have is your team will get the lead fast and hard, negative effect is rest of your team will have a more stressful time in lane until teamfight start to occur.

A Jungler makes life harder for themselves and their teams of they don&#x27;t have Smite, a Support makes it harder on the team without a Sightstone.\n> \n> I&#x27;ve built Sightstone on carries when I&#x27;ve had a Support too self-centered to do their job. It results in lost pressure on the map, because someone who is suppose to be threatening an objective, or defending a tower, or farming a wave, is off roaming around the map trying to get vision. There&#x27;s a reason Supports and Junglers are the best suited to carry Sightstones, their play pattern supports it better than any other position.\n\nA jungler needs smite because they can't buy their jungle item or clear without dying aka useless\nA support doesn't become useless if they don't have sight stone...","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-07-16T23:42:27.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A Jungler can do it, it's just much harder.

Much more than a jungler without smite. \n\nA jungler without smite can't buy his jungle item, ganks like 15x less than the enemy jungler, loses damage, loses objective control, loses sustain.\n\nA support without sightstone has 3 less wards around the map. (Which can be lowered down to 2 if you use green trinket)\n\n???","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Support","date":"2016-07-17T16:58:08.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but with a sightstone you can also pick up the sweeper trinket, which will deny the enemy vision and potentially remove all of their wards from an entire section of the map, making for easy picks and objective taking. And don't say \"get sweeper without sightstone because then you have no wards to see the enemy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
