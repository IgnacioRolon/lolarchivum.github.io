(Assuming people are respecting the honor system.) Dynamic Queue can take solo Skill and sub divide it between the different roles. Which can highlight peoples best positions, as well as the best champions in said position.\n\nAlso, the concept of individual skill and team performance is not mutually exclusive to either Q. Communication and teamwork can be present or absent regardless if a team is a premade or 5 strangers. And anyone who is performing poorly on a individual level is going to drag their team down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crownsy","date":"2016-01-28T18:25:57.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":12,"body":"oh bullshit. True solo Q was a measurement of : did I get 4 decent teammates, or do we have a troll or two?\n\nI for one am much more happy with playing with the 3 - 4 people I've been playing with, and only needing one person to be a decent teammate.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkwind","date":"2016-01-28T20:11:12.420+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"it is true that a given game has a certain amount of chance or luck involved. Also, your true average performance can never be known. However, we can use solo queue and statistics to become extremely confident that our estimate of your performance over the course of a large number of games is close to your true performance. \n\nThe way we can do this is through the use of a concept known as [Regression toward the Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean). The idea is that as sample size N increases, the probability that the sample mean, Xbar, is close to the population mean, mu, increases. So, as we play more games of solo queue, we become more confident that the performance measured in the games in solo q accurately represents the total performance. \n\nWe can use Xbar as a [Point Estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_estimation); this point estimate is your current Elo. However, a Point Estimate is only a guess. It could be right, but it is much more likely to be wrong. So in this sense, it's true that Xbar (your current elo) is probably wrong. Fortunately, we can use [Confidence Intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval#Theoretical_example) to create a range that we are _very_ confident that mu lies within. Even better, we can control HOW confident we are that mu is within the range by altering the width of the Confidence Interval. Without access to the data behind league and league systems, I couldn't tell you exactly how confident I could be that you're within 50 LP of your true Elo after say, 100 games. However, I _can_ tell you about what it will look like. After a large number of games- which could be 100, 250, or 1000 depending upon [Variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance), but is likely to be close to 100-250 in my opinion- I'd expect to be at least 95% confident that Xbar was within +/- 50 LP of mu. Further, I'd expect to be at least 99.999999% confident that Xbar was within +/- 500 LP (difference between silver/gold, ect). At that confidence level, I'd expect 3 players per 300,000,000 ranked players to be off by 500 LP or more after that given large number of games. I consider this pretty conservative, as it's entirely plausible that I would be order of magnitude more confident about each of these cases than I've described. I would be very surprised to find that the confidence interval were less precise than I have described here.\n\nAdditionally, given that trolls/unskilled players are randomly occurring, and assuming that you are not unskilled or a troll, this estimate is actually biased in your favor. The probability of your team getting one or more trolls is given by:\n1-[1-(Probability of a Given Player Being A Troll)]^4. \nThe probability of your team getting one or more trolls is given by:\n1-[1-(Probability of a Given Player Being a Troll)]^5.\n\nThe first number will always be less than the second, because YOU are guaranteed to not be a troll, thus biasing the result in your favor. So in conclusion, while you are correct that an individual game is partially a game of chance, over the course of a large number of games this chance is mitigated to the point of being irrelevant.\n\nIf the wikipedia articles are too archaic for you, and you'd like to understand what I'm talkign about, I'd recommend Khan Academy. There are serveral videos there on the relevant topics that are quite good and easy to understand.","replies":[{"poster":"00110001","date":"2016-01-28T20:23:49.354+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wow, I hope you realize, you just popped the heads of about 99.9% who will read this...gj!\n\nTbh, the participation award comment sums it up, that is all that dynamic queue is...so fucking American.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-01-28T18:43:55.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheLittlestLulu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=V5QOoe8Y,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-01-28T15:46:26.394+0000)\n>\n> So why even let mixed teams be in the same ranked queue?\n\nTo reduce queue times and allow teams of friends that normally play together still be able to queue up if one of their regulars is missing.","replies":[{"poster":"Celeste Benal","date":"2016-01-28T19:55:16.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Fuck that shit.
