It feels like you never intended to give things the proper support and this project was probably doomed from the start due to RIot's poor attitude towards their own creation.\n\n> I believe League is in a better place today for the time and effort we spent doubling down on SR, rather than splitting focus on Dominion.\n\nYour belief is misplaced. The MOBA genre is growing stagnant, and you seem to believe the old formula is the only one that works. With at least half a dozen MOBAs whose core game mode is essentially the same, with essentially the same map design and the same strategy and the same roles, all trying to capitalize on a set size fan base, it's honestly refreshing to see companies like Blizzard innovating the genre even a little bit. You guys could learn something from them. Even Smite, whose core game mode is basically identical to yours, has a variety of maps and modes that all see play time (Except their capture & hold mode admittedly, although I feel its design was inferior to Dominion).","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheLittlestLulu","date":"2016-02-10T22:12:33.695+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=L4T3NCY,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HcRmmLvE,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2016-02-10T22:00:14.090+0000)\n>\n>\n> \n> The large majority of players immediately bounced from the mode even when it was first released\n\nYeah that had nothing to do with things like you guys letting Kassadin utterly demolish the gamemode until it was far too late, and just in general immediately showing you had no intention to properly support the gamemode. :^)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-02-10T22:17:03.922+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=L4T3NCY,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HcRmmLvE,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2016-02-10T22:00:14.090+0000)\n>\n> copy pasta from another thread:\n> \n> RE the \"chicken & egg\" analogy for Dominion support: The large majority of players immediately bounced from the mode even when it was first released, preferring Summoner's Rift gameplay instead.
