The team with the lead does have a higher chance to acquire the buff but it is the jungler's job to fight that objective, if he manages to steal it, he would have avoided a crazy snowball or even he could be effectively equalizing teams. Jungling isn't about focus ganking one lane anymore, in fact it never was but now they must keep higher attention on legendary monsters or face a probable defeat.\n\nIt's not only the jungler's job to keep an eye on the herald but top must also AT LEAST keep it warded, again, coordinated teams have a crazy advantage here. If the enemy team rushes the herald under your nose, you deserve to be set back during the time the buff lasts, but admittedly it's not end of the world, the longer the enemy with the buff stays alive, the worse his effects are going to be, so the natural answer, once again, is to focus on taking that person down.\n\nCurrently people is ignoring rift herald because its effects aren't completely understood, I played a game where the enemy team wasn't aware of the power from dragons and we got 4 dragons for free, 3 of them were infernal dragons... Since I played adc I didn't know how the interaction with herald was but judging by how the game went on, I think the enemy Jungler didn't even try to get it and lost a huge chance of making a big impact.","replies":[{"poster":"RIPDusty","date":"2016-05-04T20:12:57.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except that the buff lasts through death, unless i read the patch notes wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Scyvis","date":"2016-05-04T20:23:07.598+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could be mistaken but I think he is saying that they cant use the buff while dead/walking back to lane.
