That being said the last two patches, with both the prehistoric and pool party skins I&#039;ve logged on hoping for individual splash arts and been disappointed. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not that the splash&#039;s look bad, it&#039;s just that they look a bit too crammed. Like &quot;OH we have to fit 5 champs in here so we&#039;ll scrunch them all in the art in a way that doesn&#039;t really allow any of the champs to have a cool setting that caters to them.&quot; \r\n\r\nAnd it&#039;s not even like you always did this, the old pool party skins or even last years winter wonderland skins all had individual splash arts. \r\n\r\nI understand that it&#039;s cheaper for riot but I really hope that that&#039;s not the main reason for this. So I guess the question is will we ever get cool individual splash arts for champions or will we always get groups from now on.","replies":[{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-06-12T19:19:17.239+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Draven's freaking riding Rek'Sai.

For example, Draven is riding Rek'Sai, Zac's spitting water at Lulu's Polymorph, Mundo is rockin' out, and Lulu is splashing around.

And I want to say that I appreciate that you always respond to questions about skins because I've seen you're a pretty active rioter on here.\n\nAnyway I guess to clarify I meant more solo for group ones like the lunar revel skins. Jinx, Nidalee, Etc... all could have been in the same skin but weren't. And I don't even know if they are a group because they have different prefixes. Those were really cool and since then we've had only group splashes for themes.\n\nThanks again though for stopping by!

The other people in the post came up with very logical counter arguments about how last year Pool party skins were EPIC a sexy Leona laying on a nice beach (Which isn't saying Pool Party at all.) having her OWN splash art FEATURING other champions in MINOR ROLES who don't have a skin. Showing that she's not having Beach Party all by herself. \"Having a party alone isn't nearly as fun as it is with friends!\"\n\nI do find combining skins acceptable when its the SEASON Champion team that won because that makes sense why would they not share a splash art.\nPentakill is also reasonable but still you could show the scene in different angles and give the other champions MINOR roles in the background and give Sona a MAJOR SOLO!\nSoccer Team, Kinda reasonable can't see other ways of making it work.\n\n\nAll I'm saying being as long term summoner and an  being inspired by all your splashes which DRIVED ME TO BECOME A BETTER ARTIST it's a blow to my heart{{item:3110}}  when I see you guys do this. Nothing is wrong with spliting them up either it's easy to make them EXIST without having to completely share their spotlight you guys know this. please try to obstain from this I see the bilgewater skins come out. The Twisted Fate with Gangplank the duo looks awesome not gonna lie they least have enough space in their splash art to seem SOMEWHAT INDIVIDUALIZE. \n\nanother thing that slightly bothers me is that the consistency of GP's new splash art it only portrays half his body. WHILE ALL of the OTHER CHAMPS DISPLAY THE WHOLE FIGURE!!!! just seems like a good tease but if you're going for consistency and clarity this isnt the way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Puri Puri Taric","date":"2015-06-14T11:41:26.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"still waiting for that taric","replies":[]},{"poster":"nosafterburn","date":"2015-06-12T21:32:03.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait, does this mean that you guys are against having robot blood moon skins? poor ori, blitz, rumble, and vik.\n=P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Legacy of Xion","date":"2015-06-14T15:49:48.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Katey, some of those skins are 1350.\n\nThey DESERVE their own splashes.\n\nAnd Katey, Zac deserves HIS OWN splash.
