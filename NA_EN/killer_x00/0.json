So what did they tell you?\n\nThey basically took a look at my history on that account, and saw that I was actually a very sportsmanlike player(i.e. constantly encouraging teammates, helping prevent flaming amongst teammates, etc.) and saw that my toxicity was a blue moon type of deal. Just a bad day, bad game, etc. Along with this, the system banned me for \"unhelpful chat,\" not even flaming, borderline toxicity.\n\nOn top of this though, I had to speak to multiple Riot employees, as some of them are incredibly uncooperative and refuse to elaborate or give valid reasoning behind my ban.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"覺 Sona 覺","date":"2018-11-06T03:46:18.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Periscope,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=u2QMs6v2,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-11-02T08:01:23.798+0000)\n>\n> Sorry, but they do not unban accounts unless done in error.\n\nThis isn't quite true. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-11-06T04:01:47.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you referring to your account, where you were unbanned and had your honor restored?","replies":[{"poster":"覺 Sona 覺","date":"2018-11-06T08:28:02.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Periscope,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=u2QMs6v2,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2018-11-06T04:01:47.505+0000)\n>\n> Are you referring to your account, where you were unbanned and had your honor restored?\n\nHmm?
