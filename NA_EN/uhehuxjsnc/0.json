Yahoo seems to have deleted all of my old emails prior to 2010. So Riot, what do I need to do so that if this does happen, I can prove ownership over my account?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-02T22:55:03.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our account team may ask a series of different questions to help verify ownership, so having a screenshot (which isn't usually asked) or remembering your sign up address isn't absolutely crucial.  It can help, but not a deal breaker!  That said, thanks for playing for so long!  <3\n\nWe can look into your icon request!
