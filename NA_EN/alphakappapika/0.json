Since Xerath IS magic, its very possible that, even if Xerath is more powerfull, Galio could simply \"eat\" him and use his energy to live a hundred years or something like that.\n\nEven Syndra could be a better option to defeat Galio in that case, because at least she has a physical body.","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2017-03-09T16:22:05.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is always over dose.\n\nXerath's arcane body is so immense, It would definitely hurt even someone who has magic absortion.
