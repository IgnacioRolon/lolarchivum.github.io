Recently my PC have decided that I should not play League on good frames anymore. I have a high end gaming laptop with a Nvidia GTX 980 graphics card. \r\nToday I was trying to play League, got into a game and only got 37 FPS, on low settings or high, doesnt matter. 37. Tried my on board intel graphics card, which is shit and got around 60fps. \r\nFunny thing is, right after I turn on/off anti aliasing or vertical sync, or change the FPS limiter in the setting, i get max FPS, around 350ish for around 5 seconds, before going back to, you guessed it, 37. I dont have any issues with my other games like H1Z1 or Overwatch, which I run on ultra setting and getting good FPS.  Tried reinstalling league and my graphics drivers, with no luck. \r\nCurrent mood: 750/750 {{item:3070}} \r\n\r\nAnyone know a fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-04T04:36:12.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooof, I'm pretty jealous of that beefy video card. I'm still rocking a GTX 680 in my rig. {{item:3070}} \n\nRight, let's get down to business (to defeat the huns)!\n\n___\n\nThere are a few things that could be causing your low and erratic FPS. First, if you're running Windows 10, be sure you've [disabled the Windows Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html). The *Game DVR* feature inside the game bar has been causing FPS issues and crashes for some players, so it's a quick step to check if this was your issue.\n\nIf that didn't resolve your issue, I'd recommend working through the rest of the steps inside our [FPS troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) that you haven't touched on, as they commonly resolve these issue. Should you still encounter issues with your FPS after trying all of this, please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"yabeg","date":"2018-01-17T11:27:25.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi guys, I have the same problem and I tried the trouble shouting guide and nothing worked.
