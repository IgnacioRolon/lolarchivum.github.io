Yesterday I was having connection issues but I thought it would be fine since I went through all the steps to \"fix\" my league. Wanna know why i but fix in \" marks? Because these so called fixes didn't do jack sheit, if anything this made the problem x10 worse then it was before. Here is my problem I get in to champ select pick my champ, lock, you know how it goes. Then you know how it's suppose to go from the draft to the loading screen instantly? Yea that takes 5 minutes or more. Well isnt that wonderful, by that time everyone has already loaded in and it's laning time. After I wait and wait and wait I get into the loading screen. Then what do you know it crashes a couple more times then eventually it works after 20 fking minutes. This is so silly I just want to play league. Nothing else is cucked except when I try to play please fix this. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-02T17:49:56.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to help you out so you can get to playing during your time off, but I need more details.
