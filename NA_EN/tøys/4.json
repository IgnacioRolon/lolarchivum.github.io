Yesterday I was having connection issues but I thought it would be fine since I went through all the steps to \"fix\" my league. Wanna know why i but fix in \" marks? Because these so called fixes didn't do jack sheit, if anything this made the problem x10 worse then it was before. Here is my problem I get in to champ select pick my champ, lock, you know how it goes. Then you know how it's suppose to go from the draft to the loading screen instantly? Yea that takes 5 minutes or more. Well isnt that wonderful, by that time everyone has already loaded in and it's laning time. After I wait and wait and wait I get into the loading screen. Then what do you know it crashes a couple more times then eventually it works after 20 fking minutes. This is so silly I just want to play league. Nothing else is cucked except when I try to play please fix this. Also I dont think it's my computer because im getting 200 fps and I dont think its my internet because I have 30 ping. Thank you.\n\nUpdate: The only error message I get is during the crash it says failed to connect to the server etc retry or cancel. I tied the hextech patcher, I tried changing internets, reseting my pc, repair launcher, deleteting then dowloading league, and a couple other various fixes. I see a black screen.\n\nUpdate 2: I continue ti try and nothing is working as I type this its been 5 miin since picking ended and the loading screen was suppose to show up.\n\nUpdate 3: I used the stopwatch on my phone and went in a custom game and from the time it took to pick a champion till I got in game was 6:02.80. This started yesterday and all I did was download some osu beatmaps and skins you need help me.\n\nUpdate 4: Tried it in normal game took 20 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2016-11-02T23:19:51.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's a few things I can suggest as someone who has had similar situations:\n\n1) Go to this path if you did not move your game files when installing, C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends , and click on the lol.launcher.admin.
