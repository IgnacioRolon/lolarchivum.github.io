Today I logged onto  league and I noticed my client was being a lot slower then usual then I tried to play a game. I hit accept then I went from the main page to a black screen. Then after probaly 30 seconds then it puts me inn the picking phase. I pick my champion and lock then it goes from picking to the loading screen. It was a bunch of empty portraits that all said not connected. It wouldent let me alt tab out of it it wouldent let me task manager it wouldent let me do anything. I waited for a good 7 minutes then I was put into the after game lobby and it said I left the game and got a leave in the match history Leaver (Remake).
