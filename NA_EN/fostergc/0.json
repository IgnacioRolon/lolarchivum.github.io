Per usual, every 3rd hit would cause her w's passive to take effect, doing extra damage to the tower. Now, if I hit a minion twice, and hold my w's passive until i get to a tower, I can literally keep hitting the tower and my w's passive no longer resets, so i constantly do extra damage. \r\n\r\nIt's broken dawg.","replies":[{"poster":"QuinnsDeathGardn","date":"2019-03-21T23:53:08.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have noticed this issue with neeko too, but it seems to work some games and others not. In some games, it will proc on turrets, and in others it simply won't proc or stack off of turrets.

It was that the W didn't proc on the tower ( it didn't consumes or contribute to the stacks or apply extra damage..), it only shows the animation of the empowered auto attack on the tower, just like with Sona I believe.","replies":[]}]}
