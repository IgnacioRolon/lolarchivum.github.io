Today I attempted to log in to league to find that my Username or Password was incorrect. I attempted to reset my password, however the e-mail was never sent to me. After this I thought that I had been hacked, which is peculiar since I play on a mac. I checked all my other accounts for other things such as Amazon/Twitch, and none of my other accounts have been compromised leading me to believe that I have not been hacked. I also could not log in to my account through the website. Since the e-mail was never sent to me, I don't really know what to think. Apparently this situation happened to my friends earlier this week. This is definitely not a caps-lock issue, or anything like that.\n\nThe account in question has\nUsername: SlangTerm\nSummoner Name: Shooting Stars\nTicket #: #30329719","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-18T23:57:46.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and pulled up your account, and it does look like some suspicious activity could have been taking place without your knowing.
