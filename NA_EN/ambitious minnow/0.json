I'll start again, Blue Buff start is dead. \n\nYou can start Red buff and clear the red side of jg, and hit level 3, before you decide to go to a scut, the other side of your jg, another side of the enemy's jg, or a gank.  With me so far?  You can even leave 3 raptors.  So enough xp in Red side alone to hit level 3 before choosing next stage of pathing.\n\nYou cannot due this with the entire blue side of the jungle.  Before at least you could do Blue > Gromp > 2 little wolves and finally the scuttler.\n\nNaming a bunch of other pathing options is ignoring the fact that more xp on red side means red side is optimal start.\n\n\n\nAm I wrong?  Look at this list.  LOOK AT IT.  Do YOU see the two obvious kinds of champs that win jg?\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/JMOayaz.png[/img]\n\nThis is SUPER IMPORTANT because it drastically hampers the jg pool realistically down to two categories you need to fit in to have high win rate:  Fighter and AoE champ.  Not about cc, not about assassin, farming, none of that.  It's about being a jgler who is optimized to start with the red buff.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/5T5PEQi.png[/img]\n","replies":[{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-05-02T13:16:49.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUwYZUFzs7g\n\nbtw you forgot to mark {{champion:102}}  a red buff starter.","replies":[{"poster":"Ambitious Minnow","date":"2019-05-02T17:59:34.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Corrector1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UViT8aE7,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2019-05-02T13:16:49.999+0000)\n>\n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUwYZUFzs7g\n> \n> btw you forgot to mark {{champion:102}}  a red buff starter.\n\nNo look at the second picture.

YES BLUE IS SUB OPTIMAL!  THAT IS EXACLTY WHAT I AM SAYING!  THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT!  Why should one side of the jg be objectively favored as the starting side?  Because of the multiple monster camps on red side, it is better suited for certain jgs, and those are the only ones that have high success rates in jg.  Not becuase 'blue is suboptimal' as a buff, but becuase starting blue side is suboptimal = because it's rigged you can't hit level 3 on blue side.\n\nP.S. - Seems to me like I adapt just fine.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/ee0kije.png[/img]\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alzon","date":"2019-05-02T18:07:25.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scuttle change didn’t do much from the perspective of top lane.
