Now I know matchmaking depends on my rank as well as many other variables but I feel that I am getting matched with idiots. Now it COULD just be me, but I doubt that because I see my friends get uneven matchmaking as well. I am not the smartest or most skillful in my tier (Bronze IV _currently_)  but I cannot carry the whole team if people troll, feed, afk, or just play stupid. I use to be Gold IV or V in Season 4 and now I am Bronze IV. I remember  how easy it was to rely on my teammates towards  teamwork in Gold V but in Bronze IV there are people that just lack common sense. I just know that people are going to say \"If you cannot carry yourself out of Bronze, then you belong in Bronze\" or \"You should have the best score in the game if you are getting bad players on your team.\" I want to to eradicate the perception of those things as well in my discussion. \n\nSo I am in Bronze IV and I would consider myself mediocre. Say for instance, bot lane feeds the enemy adc, top lane and mid lane are doing fairly ok due to my early game ganks as a jungler. As mid game approaches, the enemy adc has over 10 kills and all of them come from bot lane. We end up losing the game to a Draven with 28 kills and 8 deaths. This game was a 5v4 because the enemy Ahri had disconnected. I have been on a losing streak due to games like this where people lack the common sense not to feed or do wolves camp during a teamfight. For the games that I am fed in, I try my best to everything I can to help the team such as split push, ward and even give constructive criticism as to people builds compared to the game length or their role. The chances of me receiving a feeder, troll, or afk is the same on my team as the other team is _not_ necessarily true either. Matchmaking assigns me to a team determined by my skill. So if I had been one of the top players in Bronze or I had a streak of wins then I would most likely get matched with someone below my skill level in order for me to \"carry\" them. However, as with anything in life, it is all dependent on your intelligence and knowing what to do and what not to do. I completely understand this but I don&#039;t think the teammates that I receive understand this. \n\nFinally I want to address the score issue. My score is mediocre or slightly negative in my bad games. Here is the thing though, when a lane feeds and the enemy laner for that team snowballs you hard or uses that to their fullest advantage then it is hard for me to do anything against it, especially if they have their whole team on me. A few games ago, I had been carrying with Mordekaiser and since I was the only good person on my team with a score such as 7 kills or 2 deaths, they all focused me hard and had been focusing me hard the rest of the game until my k/d turned to absolute thrash. Nothing I can do about that but I want to know what I can do if games like that happen for me, so that is why I ask the community for enlightenment.","replies":[]}
