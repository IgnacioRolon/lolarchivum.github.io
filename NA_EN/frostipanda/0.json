On pad down lane in jungle you name it, suddenly me and a ally tarics game crashed at the same time (We were both seeing the dragon everywhere, no one else was) and then we couldn&#039;t see him anymore in the fog of war upon coming back in however from that point on whenever he came out of the fog into someones view we crashed. Every time.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll be banning him every match I play because this just ruined our whole game and ended with me being absent half the match, Taric being gone more then that and our ADC leaving at 10 mins because Taric was having so many problems, please look into these bugs and get them fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-25T01:08:11.297+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey FrostiPanda - \n\nThanks for the report!
