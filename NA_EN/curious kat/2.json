And let me just say, it is seriously fucked up in the RNG department recently. And with many other bugs that i will list, I&#039;m pretty sure the RNG as turned into Rigged Number Generator. Instead of Random number generator. Been seeing the same champs over and over again regardless of f2p rotation. I&#039;m talking 4-5 times in a row. \r\n\r\n1. Snowballs are fucked up and have a delay sometimes, you press it, it doesn&#039;t go off, you move around a bit and boop, 3 seconds later it flies out, not internet related either. Nighthawk router, wired connection, 100 down, 20 up, no packet loss, no bullshit &quot;it&#039;s not our fault&quot; to explain that one. PLUS, it happens to EVERYONE who uses snowball alot, and they complain about it as well. Not just me, but many team mates in matches iv&#039;e played over the last month or so have complained about it.\r\n\r\n2. Emotes are broken. They disappear like you have none. Id&#039;e say 4 out of 5 ARAMS you have no emotes. Definitely more times than not for sure. It&#039;s like a luxury to have the silly things. Not tooooo big a deal, but, it exists, and has existed since emotes came out.\r\n\r\n3. Health pads are not visible sometimes. And the only way you can tell they are there is via spawn timers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIX YOUR MODE. I know you care only for worlds right now, but fuckin A, fix your damn shit please. These bugs have been an issue way before Worlds, so no excuse that &quot;we are to busy to know about it or fix it&quot;. Fuck off with that shit.","replies":[{"poster":"seasaltcake","date":"2018-10-18T14:42:24.804+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Seriously I paid for my emotes, not being able to use them even half the time because ARAM isn't riot's favorite kid is really depressing.
