From there on i was able to snowball, get fed, hit level 18 before anyone else and 1vs3 people. But no S grade v.v\r\n\r\nWhat gives man how does this crap work now a days? halp Rito v.v","replies":[{"poster":"Deaddorks2","date":"2016-09-20T15:27:24.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grades are determined off kills, deaths, assists, cs, & team performance. Based on how well people in your elo play that champion, your scores in those categories are compared the the average and you receive a grade. For example if you get so many kills but you still have a few deaths, it might still be possible to get an S, but at least on most of my champions, to get an S+ (Gold 4) you need to have 10+ kills, 3- deaths, and really good cs also.\n\nBased on your example, 8 deaths is alot, and is hard to get a good grade with that. Also based off the score of the game im going to guess it went at least 40-50 minutes, and your cs isnt that good for that (only 6 per min or 1/2 the minions that spawn in a lane). So thats probably why. Also maybe you had a teamate that carried you?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ClatoVerataNicto","date":"2016-09-20T07:37:58.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is percentile based on total performance of that champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-20T07:33:57.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"depends on how well your teamates did along with the enemies, and at what times did you end up achieving 8 deaths.","replies":[]}]}
