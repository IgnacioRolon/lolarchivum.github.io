Though most supports are designed with the ADC in mind, Yuumi is one of the rare ones in which the win condition is consistently to support the other 3 members on her team.\n\nNot only that, but her ultimate's rooting can be delayed for a very long time, allowing people who were 'waiting out' important spells and CCs to be rooted by the tail end of Yuumi's ult, or just to be caught by it as she's moving around the battlefield at a ridiculous rate.\n\nHer ratios are garbage (at first glance) not because they don't scale, but because they scale ridiculously well in different ways.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"IP Masquerena","date":"2019-05-18T12:20:23.413+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yuumi also has the issue of \"needs a team with a wallnut instead of a pea as brain\", because she can't do anything solo, she needs her team.\n\nA bad ADC will also make Yuumi look bad, and since we all know how ADCs work, \"it's Yuumi's fault\".\n\nI think you does indeed need a few more minor buffs, BUT, if you have a good player on Yuumi and a team behind her, or well, in front of her, she's strong even now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2019-05-18T02:33:20.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"buy one gold item at the start of the game, then build full ap after. there.","replies":[{"poster":"Sewer Side","date":"2019-05-18T04:12:40.969+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"With her ratios, you’re better off building AD.","replies":[{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2019-05-18T07:13:06.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to go ap in order to utilize the w share the most, due to the way it interacts with {{item:3089}} which might be the only potentially strong item that works with her kit.\n\n\nAd means you need to actually put yourself at risk in order to auto the enemy multiple times, and she is REALLY squishy.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hong Kong Annie","date":"2019-05-18T14:33:16.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In pane she does seem weak.
