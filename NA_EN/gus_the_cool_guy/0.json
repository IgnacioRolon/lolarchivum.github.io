Kha'zix is no where near bad, and you have no idea what you are even saying.","replies":[{"poster":"LongHair Fox","date":"2014-11-19T20:10:25.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> lol. Kha'zix is no where near bad, and you have no idea what you are even saying.\n\n\nBeside from NFL not being \"one of the most successful entertainment industries\" (it has nowhere near the viewer count as football (yes you would call it soccer) and is almost non existent outside of America) i got a couple of things wrong with what you are saying.\nNow don't get me wrong a can see why you would say what you do and i agree with your evidence but i believe there is a simpler reason than the one you are giving.\nI think riot's definition of \"balance and interesting choices\" and entertainment value from \"LCSbigplays\" are the same. You say yourself that counterplay is a big reason for assassins being nerfed and being too big of a lane bully is also a reason. But bringing more counterplay to a champ also makes it easier to balance them and it is at the core of making a champ healthy. In fact i would say that only a game where every move has counterplay is balanced and that is also the only fun thing to watch (imaging the extreme where nothing has counterplay and every move can be guessed from the start since there will always be a correct move that is strongest and has no counterplay).\nThat being said i believe lee will be nerfed (he is oppressing) just like zed was and possibly even changed as lucian was. Not to saying he will be weak but he will be changed. I even think tryndamere said that they want to change him but have kept off because of play preassure.\n\nSome of your examples are correct but others are not. I do however believe this is enough to make my point: Riot does not only nerf or buff champions based on their performance or entertainment value in the pro scene but also based on their entertainment values in soloqueue as you can easily see from warwick and poppy reworks being on their way. It may seem like they only do based on the pro scene but this is because any popular champion in the pro scene becomes played a lot in solo queue and their fault become very glaring to riot.","replies":[{"poster":"AetherKingdom","date":"2014-11-19T20:16:51.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">You say yourself that counterplay is a big reason for assassins being nerfed and being too big of a lane bully is also a reason.

My argument however still stands. It is boring to watch or play against champions with no counterplay. Giving counterplay also means being able to balance for every level and making LCSbigplays possible.","replies":[{"poster":"AetherKingdom","date":"2014-11-19T21:36:11.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> > >You say yourself that counterplay is a big reason for assassins being nerfed and being too big of a lane bully is also a reason.

I don't see where he should be nerfed.\n\nNow I do however think that {{champion:107}} could use some nerfs, not big ones mind you but some small ones. longer cd or some kinda cost to his free abilitys.
