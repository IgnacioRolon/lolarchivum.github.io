Does it mean that RANGED attacks grant 0 stack ? I&#039;m confused about the sentence.\r\n\r\n2) About the passive &quot;Guinsoo Rage&quot; : does it work like the Phantom Hit of the live Sated Devourer ? I want to know if it means that Vayne&#039;s W will proc every 2 hit (same for Jax, Aatrox and so on). I&#039;m also confused about this one. I know that Xin Zhao&#039;s W critical strike is an &quot;on-attack&quot; effect but according to many wikia, Vayne&#039;s W, Jax&#039;s R and Aatrox&#039;s W are &quot;on-hit&quot; effects.","replies":[{"poster":"Beuhlakor","date":"2016-04-19T21:32:03.940+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I got a friend who has a PBE account and he tested quickly everything regarding Guinsoo in a custom game :\n\n1) Ranged attacks and melee attacks both grant 1 stack.\n\n2) \"Guinsoo Rage\" passive works EXACTLY like the live Sated Devourer. It means that {{champion:24}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:266}}  will proc every 2 AA instead of every 3 AA.\n\n3) I'm sorry Riot, but are you OUT OF YOUR MIND ? It is also going to push {{champion:10}} and {{champion:203}} back to their \"BAN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE\" status, back when Sated Devourer was working for every ranged AA.","replies":[{"poster":"Brahmsauce","date":"2016-04-19T22:07:18.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is hilarious if true.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-04-19T21:58:07.513+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oops, that should just read attacks at this point, it's one stack for both ranged and melee.\n\nThe passive works just like the current Devourer double hit one.
