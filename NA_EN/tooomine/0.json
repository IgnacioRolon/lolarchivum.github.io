Its only a day into the event,  so don&#039;t take everything that I&#039;m about to say too heavily.  \r\n\r\nit LOOKS like you guys nailed this one.  we&#039;re talking out of the park, here, actually, not just a home run. \r\n\r\nHere&#039;s why:  \r\n\r\nI&#039;m new, this will be my first full season that  i have played from one worlds tournament to another. Your inclusion of an FAQ during your Client Bilgewater experience was a friggin godsend for me. \r\n\r\nThank you. \r\n\r\nYour microsite for the bilgewater event is a few far strides above the sion release site, and the shurima microsite.  \r\n\r\nI friggin love the choose a path feature for the summoner icons, and the fact that my interaction with this sire started in-client. That&#039;s by far the best part about it so far.  everything started from the client, I didn&#039;t have to dig through the web to find information on what was happening in the game (or from the game devs).  \r\n\r\nAnd,  since I am throwing in two cents,  I just wanted to point out that i&#039;ve seen the small things you guys have done this season as a direct result of queries from riot games players (veigar ult now scaling with AP,  addressing item blanace in 5.14 patch notes, etc) and say that I appreciated them.  \r\n\r\nNow,  though, I return to play, and I return to play fully stoked about it.  \r\n\r\nPeace.","replies":[{"poster":"Pabro","date":"2015-07-22T20:32:06.356+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the note!
