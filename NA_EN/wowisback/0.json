Woke up this morning decided to play my morning league game, and I literally Dc-d probably 20-25 times, got called a troll and told i was going to be reported, all well by me i can see why. What I dont understand is how I played 12 games yesterday, with 23 ping 125-150 fps, to trying to play today and I dc that much and on top of that my ping wasnt 23??? it was 43? why? Ive restarted my router, my computer twice, league client so many times I cant remember and nothing helped it, but its MY INTERNET? Right? so why did my phone not dc from the wifi? how about the tab with pandora running didnt stop? How about the league homepage when i was submitting a report? hmmmm.... This makes no sense what so ever. Please, help asap.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-08T23:58:40.810+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Patches only change local files inside your League directory, therefore they're *very unlikely* to affect your connection. Different servers or services are located in different locations, therefore you could have a poor connection to one site/game but not another. Since local network settings are the most common causes of these types of issues, I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step in resolving this.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change in your connection.","replies":[{"poster":"wowisback","date":"2016-09-09T00:03:40.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yesterday I had 23 ping no lag  or d/cs, and today i had 43 and it skyrocketed up to 220ms. I dont get what your insinuating, you act like i would make this up and i checked my logs all my games that are on there are from the 8th of Sep, when this game happened on the 9th of Sep AFTER the patch?????","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-11T15:30:02.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I certainly don't think you're making up your connection problem, I'm just clarifying that local file changes, such as a patch to League, cannot impact or change your connection to the servers. What can definitely impact your connection are certain settings with your network, which can usually be resolved by working through the connection guide I linked. \n\nIf you've worked through all the steps in that guide and still encounter issues with high latency, please let me know.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"wowisback","date":"2016-09-09T00:29:43.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you look at my logs and tell me if something is wrong?
