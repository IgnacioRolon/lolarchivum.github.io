I hope you kept the voice actor for {{champion:266}} or at least made him sound somewhat the same, as i love hes voice as it is now.\r\n\r\n2. The new champion, will it be a &quot;he&quot; or a &quot;she&quot; ( ͡&deg; ͜ʖ ͡&deg;).\r\n\r\n3. All i&#039;m hoping is that  {{champion:84}} won&#039;t be so obnoxious after 6 to be played against.  Any info we can get on that one?","replies":[]}
