He loses every single extended trade against a conqueror user, his cooldowns are humongous early, and he has no in combat sustain. His whole point is to scale up his passive, and his E is garbage and an actual DPS loss single target and around minions until several points in it.\n\nWith Illaoi, all you need to do when she pulls out your spirit is get on her face and fight her, sidestepping the tentacle smashes, which most champs like jax/riven/irelia have ease doing, and jax's counterattack also reduces the smash damage since it's an aoe spell.\n\nJust look at the highest rated NA challenger Illaoi, Dirty Mobs. He has to play like a complete pussy until lv6 all the time. Illaoi lives and dies by her ult on top of a spirit. That's why she is in such a bad state. Against opponents who trim her tentacles and don't make a point to facetank her W tentacles, she gets bursted to death in top lane.\n\nLook at Dirtymobs matches against Revenge's Riven and Irelia, dragoonsmash's Darius or even TFblade's Jax.

I usually use veigar against him. He counters only my basic attacks, but all of my dmg comes from spells, with wild burst. When i see that he wants to jump, i just use my E around myself, so it will protect me. In early i can simply farm under my turret, even if miss minions, i will be stronger anyways because every minions i kill with Q will make me stronger, while this effect obviously wont work on jax. \n\nSupports against him: Janna: knock up with Q, knock back with ult. Poppy: counters his jump, knock back twice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-08-17T08:11:33.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:421}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Support Position","date":"2019-08-17T01:53:23.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:3}} {{summoner:1}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3140}} {{item:3157}} \n\nDoesnt work?
