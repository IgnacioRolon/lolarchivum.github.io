I do not want to turn this into any kind of complaint about the jungle, however I will say this. The jungle is the role that I feel goes through the most changes, whether it&#039;s the items, the camps, the champions, this role consistently changes forcing you jungle mains out there to adapt constantly. \r\nPersonally, I have been an on and off jungler since day 1. I love the role, and I really enjoy watching the role change, and learning to adapt. I say on and off because I can&#039;t do what you jungle mains can, I can not take the hate when things go wrong, probably because of how stubborn I am. But you guys can do this. You sit through every game watching people do well and trash talk the enemy team, or watching them feed and tell their opponents how they got camped and got no assistance. You know your rotations, but you know you have to give them up because top lane is losing and demands help. \r\nWhen I play as the adc I know I yell at you, because I know if you feed me, I&#039;ll enjoy the game more because I&#039;ll be doing more dmg. When I play as top I know I beg and plead for assistance because I&#039;m behind and can&#039;t compete with my opponent. When I play as mid I know I tell you to go bot and gank while I sit and farm. When I support I&#039;m usually pretty chill, but i&#039;m watching you to nag you if you do something wrong.\r\nYou guys deal with this in the majority of your games, I know when I jungle I do. I just want to say thank you for putting up with me, and our teammates for those harsh 40 minutes. I want to say thanks for not only learning a new system each patch, but for explaining it to our team when the patch hits. Above all else I want to say I respect you guys, you guys make me want to be a better jungler, and I hope you never let your teammates bring you down.
