If you think about it, she was good before 5.6, I loved playing her in 5.5, and now with Cinderhulk the problem is not that \"oh man a tank is really good we gotta nerf her\". I think the issue is that Sejuani (to me personally) is much better than the *other* tank junglers. I say this not only based off win rate, or by popularity, but because now her clear is good, her presence is amazing, and because her ganks are phenomenal for 2 reasons. \r\n1. A typical gank would have her Q in, W, and then E. The thing with Sej is even if you miss your Q, you're still on top of the enemy (unless maybe they flashed), and can still w, e, making extremely easy for lanes to kill the enemy. \r\n2. When I play sej i start top side buff and lvl 2 gank top lane, 100% of the time get their flash or they die, but this is because i always tell top not to push and that I'm going to gank early so top knows to trade with them from the start. Getting early flashes makes for very easy follows up since there is almost no other way to get away from her. \r\nHonestly, I'm sad to see the nerf, I've been loving winning with her, but it's easy, and I think the nerf was deserved. I'm actually surprised they didn't nerf the slow on her E, instead they buffed the damage. I think the rage at Riot is for no reason, Vi was still nerfed, J4 is not as good of a tank at Sej/Naut/Cho/rammus, and now rammus is even suppose to get a buff! I think it's a fun time to be a jungler, there has been a lot changing this season already, and i think its fun to get to try new things each patch. Personally, my hat is going off to Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"1st HanarSpectre","date":"2015-03-18T18:03:21.538+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if you are a Sejuani player, even if you don't agree 100% with the need for nerfs.

Now you can still get that slow on the whole team, but you have to be in the trenches tanking dmg to do it, which i think will make her more killable and less indestructible which is fair.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"helli0n","date":"2015-03-18T20:22:48.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"So I should still buy her?
