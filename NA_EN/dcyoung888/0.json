Unfortunately, it appears there was a miscommunication here that ended up on the site - Championship Zed and Championship Riven are not intended to be on sale for 30% within this bundle, and so the total listed was incorrect. Total without champions should come to 3996RP, as you experienced (975 for Zed and Riven, 682 for Thresh, Shyvana, and Kalista). We've notified the team that handles the site, and it should be updated soon!\n\nRiot's  Sir Stabbington  - about 6 hours ago******","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaze Zephyrus","date":"2016-09-27T03:34:07.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is showing up as 3996 RP on my store as well instead of the 2705 RP Riot said it should be.
