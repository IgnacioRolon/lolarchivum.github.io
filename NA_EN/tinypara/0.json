If you look at just runes you have access to conqueror, bloodline, &amp; ravenous in order to sustain through the game and this makes getting grievous more important. When looking at this there are 3 options: Bramble, executioner, and morellos. I think that the oblivion orb is fine at it's pricepoint &amp; that the other 1400 gold should be looked at. Make a 1200 gold item that builds into morellos that applies grievous with a 200 combine cost. Tanks have access to grievous for 1k, any ad champion for 800, all ap champs have to pay 3000. Just wanted to toss this idea out there and see if there could be some support behind it.","replies":[{"poster":"AÃ¤trox","date":"2020-02-19T18:23:38.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#Don'tBuffGrievousWounds ;(","replies":[{"poster":"TinyPara","date":"2020-02-19T19:14:38.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's more about balancing the options. Mages have to invest 3k gold if their team is too stupid to spend 800-1000 gold. The other option would be to increase the cost on the other items or have it only on finished items which I don't feel is necessary.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kazekiba","date":"2020-02-19T18:13:11.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No take the pen off Oblivion orb and swap it with the GW +lower cost to 1000ish.","replies":[{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2020-02-19T18:39:40.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This^^^\n\nHaving grevious AND pen on the orb is like if last wisper as a component also had grevious wounds.

It's beyond broken and that also means that heals are completely unbalanced.\n\nIt's literally impossible to balance the game around cheap GW items of this strength.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smiling Frog","date":"2020-02-19T18:19:10.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:14}} I am a joke to you ?","replies":[]}]}
