HELP","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello guys, I ended up in Platinum for season 7, and I have received awards such as Victorious Graves Chromes and the banner. But, I can't find my Victorious Ward Skin. Like whenever I'm in the champ select, I only see my default skin and my other ward skins. I have received 10 chat restriction before, but I already finished 10 games before season ended. I don't know if that has to do with that, but based on what I read on the Riot's season award's eligibility page, that doesn't seem to be the case.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions or help? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"The Spiral Being","date":"2018-01-22T01:23:05.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont seem to have mine either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-18T17:21:08.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, the victorious ward was rewarded for climbing silver or higher in more than one ranked queue per the [rewards guide](https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/2017-ranked-season-ends).  I do see rewards being granted for solo queue, but I wasn't able to locate placements in another queue.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dragonz4325","date":"2017-11-18T16:34:18.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"me too im silver and i heard i can get a  victorius ward skin but dont seem to have it.","replies":[]}]}
