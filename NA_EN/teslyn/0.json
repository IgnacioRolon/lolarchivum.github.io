Fear not summoners.. ARAM has its own elo so they normally go on winning streaks and just deal with other people with ARAM accounts. still annoying.\r\n\r\nSupports spike in power before the carries. If you support gets a kill it is better for the team in early game. dont think you needed to get everything. (Translation. Support items are cheaper and more effective in early to mid game.)\r\n\r\nhopefully you learned something.. and for god sakes put down a ward.  I am not on my home computer and i am running off +200 ping. i have dropped a bit in elo.. so give me some help.  your kindly friendly support main. \r\n{{item:2055}} &lt;-- these arnt free, but they last forever.","replies":[{"poster":"SoundChaosDebug","date":"2018-03-02T00:12:55.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"in before stop watch zonyas shared cool downs next patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ashen Rider","date":"2018-03-02T16:16:02.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Teslyn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dfeUR7RL,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-03-01T23:58:35.261+0000)\n> \n> {{champion:41}} when you upgrade to raise moral.. it resets your ult. so.. before you upgrade pop that ult. then if you want ult again.\n\nI'm 95% sure this got fixed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2018-03-02T14:26:02.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also in aram poros will stare at poro abusers when they are in the bush. {{item:2054}} feed them.
