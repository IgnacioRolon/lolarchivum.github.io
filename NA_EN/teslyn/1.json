Even if he does no damage whatsoever he is still incredibly unsatisfying to play against because you have to devote a lot more resources to killing him than what is normal for champions like him. \n\nLow-elo translation: You have to work very hard to catch up and kill him, even if he is far behind. He is great at running away, thus you have to spend lots of time (and perhaps even summoner spells) to catch and kill him even if he's 0/7\n\nWhich leads me to my second reason for disliking him - whenever he is picked on my team i KNOW he's going to go 0/7.

Namely people getting the mary sue mindset in thinking {{champion:157}} is just like their typical Sasuke Uchiha who is so cool that beyond certain scripted losts, he pretty much EZ wins every fight. So those people end up thinking Yasuo will EZ win also and end up just feeding instead because they think they are some bloke who gets a instant one shot pistol and fire it like a machine gun and said bullets can also fly thru walls and they can see past walls, they think they only need to press one button and everything dies, when they instead just press one button and kill themselves in the process.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2017-06-22T11:56:09.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't hate Yasuo, but the only thing that i find annoying on him is his Q.
