If she wasn't such a manawhore, I'd honestly get a Nashor's on her as a CDR item considering AA'ing makes your plants super focus and stop being retarded.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chortle","date":"2015-10-25T18:04:37.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"passive is shitty, but her mana and low MS are common issues in many immobile cc heavy mages","replies":[{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2015-10-25T23:47:46.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her snare has the least hold time in the league. It's not that much of a snare really, and her ult knockup is hard to hit.","replies":[{"poster":"Chortle","date":"2015-10-25T23:51:20.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, it can go through minions and can root multiple targets so it's fairly strong in that regard. Very easy to set up a full damage ult with it. If you place your enemies in the center of your ult, the knockup will have a very high chance of being triggered unless they use their flashes/escapes.\n\nShe is very good at picking off enemies","replies":[{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2015-10-26T01:20:24.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I like how it can go through minions and stuff. I'm a level 5 Zyra so the ult isn't that hard for me to hit but for others not used to her it can be. She's a beast at picking off squishies. I just wish they would fix her up.","replies":[{"poster":"Chortle","date":"2015-10-26T02:42:51.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like the plant AI buff was very nice. I noticed it a ton tbh\n\nHer ult is also great for zoning.

I love taking her mid more than sup. I've beaten Ahri, Yasuo, Ekko, Zed, among others even a Veigar.

The times she won I traded back cause of my passive killing her lol. I wish the delay wasn't on it though, that can really hurt the window of you being able to get a revenge kill.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-10-25T19:22:12.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really wouldn't say Zyra is a heavy CC mage though. She has a snare and her ult has a knock up that's impossible to hit. (Also a slow that nobody really uses). At the very least they could rework her passive to allow good Zyra players to not go oom after 2 - 3 abilities early game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BadmoonBC","date":"2015-10-26T03:16:39.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it just me or is this champion the squishiest fucking champ in the game?

It's prevented me from getting so many kills and really is infuriating.
