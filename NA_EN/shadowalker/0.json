While this increase of attack range does not count a range attack Since Windwall can not block the attack. Thus Kayle should not be able to use Runaan&#039;s Hurricane since it is for ranged units only. I think that the attack should either be a ranged attack, So able to be blocked by wind wall. Or that Kayle, as a melee champ should not be able to take advantage of a Ranged champions item. It would be like allowing a thresh to use titanic hydra if he was close enough to attack without doing and range animation.","replies":[{"poster":"woelmuis","date":"2016-01-29T18:43:22.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Active: Yasuo creates a gust of wind that travels forward to form a wall in front of him.

Vel'Koz and Thresh both have ranged auto attacks that have no projectile and would thus go through Windwall.\n\nIf Kayle doesn't activate her E, she doesn't get the bolts from Runaan's when she attacks. When it is active, she gains the bolts.\n\ntl;dr: Kayle's E does make her ranged, she just doesn't have a projectile auto attack.","replies":[]}]}
