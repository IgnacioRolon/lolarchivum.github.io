Because of their current queue size, they haven't had a chance to respond quite yet. They'll get back to you as soon as they can! \n\nIn the meantime, I can provide a little context as well. When you have consistently high ping only while playing league, there could be some sort of break in the connection between your network and our game servers. Check out our [Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to see if we can patch up that connection.","replies":[]}]}
