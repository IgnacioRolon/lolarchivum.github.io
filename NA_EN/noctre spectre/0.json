After all,Lux was the one that came first then they made the other 4. They have different poses which shows that there was a lot of effort put into making them, and I think theyre very nice. The new ones were made all together so they have a different style than the old ones. sure the new ones kind of have lazy backgrounds, but if you group them seperately, you can tell which Star Guardian is from which group.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Unfavourable","date":"2017-08-17T13:55:38.020+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"While they are add it remove ezreal and change it to quinn...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Empress Lux","date":"2017-08-25T22:35:25.370+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does anyone know if you still can get the border if it is gifted?","replies":[{"poster":"dat faking fizz","date":"2017-09-02T05:20:28.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me know if u find out !
