Some players point out riot not wanting to give access to all game content via ARAM by unlocking every champ in a random \"for fun\" game mode, but at the same time, my counter argument to that is that given enough time in blind pick, a player without ever purchasing a single champion, will also eventually get to experience every champion through \"FREE WEEK\" access. So I feel this argument as some players have pointed out, is not a valid reason as to why there can't be all champions unlocked in ARAM.\n\nEdit 2: Solid contribution\n> [{quoted}](name=Ayame Isaki,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yETFlOKF,comment-id=000f,timestamp=2016-03-18T13:54:39.849+0000)\n>\n> Personally, I think this is a terrible idea.
