Ive tracked boosted accounts before and they never end up banned even 6 months down the line. So I guess its ok to account share and be boosted because riots way of &quot;solving it&quot; is to do nothing! Only way to get banned is by verbal abuse. Instance guy literally inting in a game I won. We all reported him. Hes still playing. Great work getting \"toxic\" players out of the game LMFAO. Its literally the opposite. ","replies":[]}
