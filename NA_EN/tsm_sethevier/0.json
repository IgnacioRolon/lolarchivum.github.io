If you manage to get to level 9 (which is rare), you can have 9 champs on the board. You can also combine two spatula's to get a force of nature which allows you to have one extra on the board. So having 9 champs legitally is possible, but when the bench is full, the game just automatically places the champ onto the board which is the biggest problem. Most people by default either sell the champ for the item or switch it out or something like that. What should happen is the champ should be displayed on the board, but grayed out so it can't be used. Basically it will sit there, but it can't perform unless the bench is cleared of a space and the champ automatically moves to the spot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheGrabber","date":"2019-08-03T13:08:46.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately MOST players use this glitch/cheat and Riot have to take a position on that.

This locks you in place, and is a severe enough disadvantage that you'll very likely want to break it before very long.\n\nAlso, there aren't many other options.  They would have to add an extra spot to the end of the bench specifically for extra carousel champs (which honestly I think is a good idea), but until something like that gets added, it is what it is.","replies":[]}]}
