Riot can't preemptively ban players before they show annoying behavior.\n\nThough as a tip for the game, if there's a low health enemy that has no hope of escape nor hope of killing any teammates, it's generally a good idea to let someone on your team that scales well with items kill them. Note, I am not saying that this was the situation that you experienced.\n\nIf you feel like killing the enemy quickly was the best option, mentally dismiss their opinion on \"kill steal\", it's just the ramblings of someone who's salty.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-30T20:40:46.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a very easy solution for this problem:\n\nIf you got a kill(steal) instead of an assist: \"same gold for the team\".\nIf you got a kill instead of nothing at all: \"more gold for the team\".\n\nBoth are guaranteed to make them flip out and start smashing their face against their keyboard, and typically stops further salting in chat, except in the most pathetically stupid cases.\n\nIn some rare situations an ADC who got KSed by their support will simply ragequit or sit at base; this is a case of \"nothing of value was lost\", because someone this unstable and bratty would feed or ragequit before 20 no matter what you try do to make them happy.","replies":[{"poster":"S0kaX","date":"2016-12-30T20:43:03.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoleBilon","date":"2016-12-30T21:13:33.001+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you think KS should be punishable you must be rly soft man, next thing you know ill get banned for even playing with you IN YOUR GAME, grow some balls plz you'll need them in your life","replies":[{"poster":"S0kaX","date":"2016-12-30T21:34:25.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"it's not that it offends me, it irritates me.","replies":[{"poster":"GoleBilon","date":"2016-12-30T22:06:41.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"just like in life there are some things that irritate you but are common and legal same is with this  :) hope i helped grow some balls :D","replies":[{"poster":"S0kaX","date":"2016-12-30T22:16:24.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Now I discovered something new that irritates me.
