Out-play, to me, is when your opponent is about to kill you and you make a quick decision with relatively low health and resource and somehow come out on top with one or two moves.   The other day I was playing Elise and I was up against a Garen with a Jax jungle.  I had taken some significant damage, and Jax activated his E and jumped at me under my turret, so I nailed him with a cocoon and he got stuck and killed by the turret.  Garen hits his Q on me, and I E in spider form, he tanks damage, I pop back in and bite him and the turret finishes him off as he tried to flash away.  That is out-playing.  Being able to do 100% crit with 2 items, having a 550 health shield that regens during combat, and nearly instant cooldown on all abilities is not out-playing anybody.\n\nA champion with no resource, almost no cooldown, and tons of damage and shield and windwalls cannot out-play, he can only out-cheap.  Teemo and Riven I agree with you, because if you play Teemo without map awareness you die pretty quickly.  Riven also has weaknesses, mostly in terms of only doing physical damage and being extremely reliant on melee attacks.  I cannot agree on Yasuo, although his E on a 3 second cooldown if it doesn't kill the target would fix most of the issues. \n\nCass, eh.  I'm one game from level 7 with her, and she's one of my all-time favorite champs.  However, countering him, I honestly love going with {{champion:90}}  although I notice they are screwing with his ult now.  Wonder why all the champs who counter him are getting these odd reworks and nerfs..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The JigSAW","date":"2017-02-08T14:59:47.355+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"The thing I have an issue with is when somebody claims Yasuo out-plays you.  Being super cheap doesn't mean you get out-played, same way as if a seven footer beats down a four foot midget with one punch - it isn't being out-fought its being overmatched by a bully.  \n\nTake these champions into focus as a stark contrast:\n\nYasuo has a shield that regenerates during combat, up to 550 health.  His Q goes to 1.3 seconds at max rank/cdr and does base + 1.0 AD damage, and on the third shot releases a tornado going about 7 body lengths away applying on-hit effects and lifesteal at full amount.  His W blocks any projectile and basic attacks from ranged champs for four seconds and cannot be destroyed.  His E -begins- at 0.5 sec cooldown, stacks twice, and is AP and BONUS AD scaling which allows him to dodge everything and anything from skillshots.  The ult itself is not so much damage as a full shield grant and 50% bonus armor pen on critical strikes for 15 seconds, which is a red herring.  Yasuo with 50% crit has 100% crit so he ALWAYS hits critical strikes.  His passive grants double critical strike chance at the measly loss of 10% critical damage.  He also has no mana and his ult goes to a 29 second cooldown or less at rank 3.\n\nCamille is a champion who uses mana, has decently high cooldowns at first, and her passive allows her a 20% max health shield for 1.5 seconds of the damage type primarily used of whomever she basic attacks.  Her Q has two shots, bonus damage on the first and true damage as a percentage of damage on the second IF used within 1.5 seconds of the first attack.  Her W is an AOE wave clear, deals small max health damage and heals her for about 10% of her health.  Her E has a 1 (now 0.75 second) stun and grants a small amount of attack speed IF she hits an enemy champion.  Oh, and her ult imprisons people who dive her for four seconds (now, removed within 1 second after death) so they can kill her and waltz away.  She has no bonus crit, armor pen, low cooldowns, or lack of resources.\n\nCamille has been nerfed SEVEN TIMES in the last three months since her release in December.  The shield was 2 seconds long, now its 1.5 seconds.  Her Q's empowered shot lost damage, her W slow is reduced, her E mana cost is raised, her E stun is reduced, her ult now vanishes within a second of her death and the W damage was dropped as well.  Seven times.\n\nIn the last two years Yasuo has received a 10-50 base damage reduction on his E, and gets bonus AD scaling on it to compensate.  This was the significant nerf!\n\nCamille doesn't deserve the crap being done to her.  Yasuo deserves far worse, but will not receive it.  The changes to buff Yi and ruin Malzahar only make the broken champions far more powerful and their counters far less able to do something about it.  Have you noticed all the champions who can shut Yasuo down outside of Garen have been basically nerfed every single patch? It isn't coincidence.","replies":[{"poster":"S0kaX","date":"2017-02-08T15:43:20.758+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.

That made him even worse.  Season 4 had a few common sense nerfs, and if you played him before season 5, you'd understand all of them were called for.\n\nHis latest nerf is removing base damage while adding a NEW source of damage to combine with his AP scaling.  Now, I've seen Yasuos build Rageblade to do MORE damage with the E than you could before, taking advantage of the AP scale with some bonus AD.  \n\nSo, season 4 he gets basically balanced and after that its basically all bug fixes and visual updates.  Then they raise his shield to 550 health again.   The season 6 and 7 patch notes are basically all bug fixes, a buff to his shield, a nerf to his growth of attack speed and the disingenuous \"now, he only has the 50% armor pen when he critically strikes\" - when he has 50% crit chance, he gets 100% crit chance, so that's every hit.  \n\nI appreciate the attempts to defend a champ you obviously like, but if they put his E on a fixed 3 second cooldown if the target he dashes through is not killed many of these issues would be resolved immediately.

It's a nerf, and even a fully stacked rageblade cover it.\n\nHis shield (510 max level, not 550) was terrible before the change, but that buff also made his flow recharge slower at lower levels to create a greater window of vulnerability.

His reasoning was that he wasn't good at any other champion, and he used Yasuo to get kills and pentas and posted them on YouTube.  I have two ways to tell if a champion is broken: \n\n1. A person does well with a champion who performs poorly with that class of champion in general\n2. A person can come back from a 0/3 or higher deficit to carry a game and snowball wildly\n\nYasuo meets both of those criteria.  We're all sick of the champ, I routinely beat and kill them but at the same time, I hate dealing with it.  I also refuse to say who I'll use against him since Riot finds them and nerfs them purposely so they end up getting crushed by cancer the wonder samurai and his broken buddies.\n\nIf you think people like Yi, Yasuo, Xin, Tryndamere, etc do not require significant nerfs, I'm wondering if any of those are your main champions.  Seems people who main them have a ton of excuses why their precious shouldn't be put on the nerfing block.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-02-08T15:11:19.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The JigSAW,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=j0sa7pyx,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2017-02-08T15:04:29.885+0000)\n>\n> There was a person in a game not too long ago I played with that was a ten year old who used Yasuo and only Yasuo. \n\ngreat, that is called a ONE TRICK and it exists for every champions\n\nstop making me lose time\ni don't play with ten year old people, i play with master tier players that know how to play against yasuo","replies":[{"poster":"The JigSAW","date":"2017-02-14T13:30:27.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can beat him fine, its the people who can't that feed him non-stop that causes a problem.\n\nAnd if you think you're as good as you say you are, come to NA where your diamond is our bronze iv.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-02-14T13:36:25.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Keep hidding behind that xd, meanwhile i destroyed NA with 200 pings like i destroy low elo and got to plat 1 when my account was on NA\n\n\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/92a71270b683170f93de5d8cdac5eae1.png","replies":[{"poster":"The JigSAW","date":"2017-02-18T14:45:40.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ain't hiding.
