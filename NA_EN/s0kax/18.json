It's just that because people hav a \"being nice just makes me look weak\" mentality their attempts to be nice come off at best as passive aggressive. \n\nI've had games when I've told my team how to play, I've been in games with that Yasuo player who thinks he's Faker. I didn't shit on him for messing up, I explained, as Nami that Yasuo you can ult off of my wave. That if he stayed with me he can get an ult off easier.
