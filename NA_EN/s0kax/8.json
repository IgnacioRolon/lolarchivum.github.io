Sometimes, a particular champion or playstyle just suits you better. Its about being good with THAT champion, not being bad with others. \n\nIt depends how you choose to look at things.\nFor example in competitive you can see, that for the most part everyone is \"good\" at the same things, naturally some teams tend to be better than others, and this doesn't always hold, but it tends to be the case\n\nThing is for most levels of play, it is mostly not being as bad at a certain champion as you are at others, chances are that if you are better at some off meta champion than the meta champions, you either suck at the meta champions, or at the game(for example one of the reasons that I'm bad at lee sin(Aside from me being bad at lee sin), is that I'm just not a very good jungler overall, and lee sin is all about abusing his early game pressure to the max, which I'm not good at, due to not being a very good jungler).\n\n> Its not about your comparative skill with other champions, but your success rate with said champion.\n\nDue to the way matchmaking works, these two are inseparable, I'd be feeding on pretty much anything in challenger, and getting fed on pretty much anything in gold.\n\n>Now, that doesn&#x27;t mean that their are not other champions who are by the numbers better. That is most certainly the case. And if someone wanted to learn champion A over their favorite champion B because A does the same general stuff just better, they would probably have a higher chance of success once they were familiar enough. This is all true.\n\nThing is this is more or less true for all champions, as you've probably noticed the competitive scene doesn't really have much niche picks, the way riot balances this game has ended up with most things overlapping pretty hard, it's just a question of who brings more to the table(And to be clear this is very deeply tied to balancing philosophies, there are plenty of niche picks in competitive dota, this isn't something rooted in the game).\n\n> The point of this thread, and others like it, is to encourage people to play the game and ENJOY it by playing the champions that they personally like.\n\nYes, circlejerk crap, this is actually terrible advice.\n\n>Letting them know that it if you work at getting your champion down, and learn the core mechanics on how to actually win the game, you can climb.

I may be bad at Shen and he&#x27;s also too nerfed, but you don&#x27;t see me saying he&#x27;s unplayable since there are some people who can succeed with him, as there are people who can succeed with Aatrox.\n\ncheck again buddy, I am an Aatrox one trick on 3 seperate accounts with a total of 700k mastery points across the 3. Hes the ONLY champion i play outside of special game modes such as ARAM, URF, ETC.\n\nShen has actually been fairly strong, and is still in a contenting spot. He does his job effectively, hes a tank\n\nAatrox is designed as a life drain diver / scrapper style champion which he is very ineffective at.\n\nIf you actually look at the numbers for aatrox hes currently at 45TH winrate, which is terrible.\n\nWinrate ASSIDE, his average KDA ( this includes assists ) sits at almost HALF of ANY OTHER CHAMPION IN HIS CLASS\n\nJust because someone wins games on aatrox doesnt mean he is effective, in most cases he has a good team comp capable of carrying this lack luster champion.\n\nAatrox has ONE deticated main above diamond and thats in both NA and EU, so again, you are talking about something i feel like you have not even remotely looked into.
