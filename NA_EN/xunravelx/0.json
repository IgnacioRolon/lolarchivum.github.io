That said, I do think you're onto something with regards to items that have unique effects or cause/effect considerations.  For the most part, our item system uses gates like gold, and opportunity costs in the form of limited inventory space.\n\nWhat about an item that cost gold to activate its special power?  What about an item that took up TWO inventory slots?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2019-10-15T09:52:23.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mask is useless in any build other than with 5xIJ\nIJ is the best tank item in the game that every tank must build(maybe even 2-3 of them) or they lose, but tanks hate buying this because -15% speed is really annoying","replies":[{"poster":"xUnRavelx","date":"2019-10-15T10:04:26.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Posui Gart,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=jEpXGFAE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-10-15T09:52:23.684+0000)\n>\n> Mask is useless in any build other than with 5xIJ\n> IJ is the best tank item in the game that every tank must build(maybe even 2-3 of them) or they lose, but tanks hate buying this because -15% speed is really annoying\n\nThanks for your insight.

Just try to avoid making items that feel bad for the player who is supposed to use it\nHaving permanent -ms is not ok, because permanent ms is something that is needed for everything: roaming between lanes, farming minion waves/jungle, dodging spells, chasing/escaping etc. The game is just worse in every aspect when you don't have enough ms, and thats why boots are bought on every champion(with 2 exceptions)\nOn the other side, having an active that decreases your MS to 100 and gives something in return for a short time is ok, because player can try to minimise the penalty by positioning himself first and then using it. Of course he can misplay it and end up almost rooted under the focus of enemy ranged champions, but that's player's mistake, not the item's fault","replies":[{"poster":"xUnRavelx","date":"2019-10-15T10:59:40.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Posui Gart,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=jEpXGFAE,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-10-15T10:33:00.114+0000)\n>\n> Its ok.

Sounds good","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
