There's real counterplay and decision-making around using this item for its intended purpose- scouting.  If enemies are nearby and you don't realize it, they can jump on you in your weakened state.  Really, really clever.  Great job!","replies":[]},{"poster":"cheex919","date":"2019-10-16T22:18:34.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rigged vest seems kinda too strong with the 50% ap. Ap is the easiest stat to increase for sure, i can get 800 with 1 infernal, death cap and essential ap items. this would also put veigar high tier, cause he scales.... with ap. good for sticky ap champs though, like zac.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2019-10-15T20:10:46.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rigged Vest seems to have odd stats.\n\nThe stats make it look like Mage option, though under no circumstances will it be worth it.\nMajority of Mages will not want you to be near them and I am against it being Wildcard Item (that allows you with little effort to get advantage in situation where you should be at disadvantage). Even someone like Swain keeps little distance.\nNot to mentoin that the damage you take isn't worth it. It sounds like you can oneshot entire team because it's AoE, but once again, in majority practical cases, you'll be glad to hit one guy. Much better to just go for Hextech Gunblade at that point, not taking the damage you deal plus the slow makes it more worth than this.\n\nTanks would use it better. They will be near group of enemies, they can mitigate damage taken. But the stats would make it meh choice for them I presume. But maybe I am wrong at this aspect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Freewalker","date":"2019-10-15T15:30:08.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Rigged Vest**\nIt's okay. Like an AP {{item:3077}} item. Kinda basic though.\n\n**Light Wardens Coat**\nI like the idea of Light Wardens Coat, but it seems a bit too expensive for an item that a support will use. Especially since the AP gained isn't anything more than AP sup items currently provide.\n\nMy suggestion: get rid of the {{item:3108}}.","replies":[]}]}
