This variant you've noticed where you're stuck in spectator mode is something we're troubleshooting and investigating at the moment. Can you try a few things to see if it helps? These have been ordered from least intrusive to more:\n\n1) Disable the \"Close client during game\" feature:\n\n * Navigate to the \"General section\"\n * Disable \"Close client during game\"\n * Re-log into League of Legends\n\n2) Reset local League Client settings:\n\n - Log into League\n - Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n - Once there they will need to delete the LeagueClientSettings.yaml file\n - Attempt to load into a custom game\n\n3) Reset all your configuration settings (Your hotkeys and in-game settings will reset as well):\n\n - Log into League\n - Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n - Delete the Config folder\n - Attempt to load into a custom game\n\nIf any of the three things fixed it, can you tell me which one did the trick?\n\nIf your issue persists, it'd be super helpful if you could gather some logs from your computer and reach out to my colleagues through the [Support Site](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

It could be a problem on Riot's end. Wait a day or so, and see if the problem persists. \n\n-----\n\nIf it is still happening after as a day, and is only happening in spectate mode, it could be a corrupt file. Try running a client repair by opening the client (no need to log in), click the gear in the top right corner, and press \"initiate full repair\".\n\n\n----\n\nIf that doesn't help, then it is most likely a connection issue. it is highly recommended that you start with the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) by Riot Support. This will create proper firewall exceptions, scan your connection settings, etc., fixing a wide variety of common connection issues.\n\n---------\n\n\nIf the problem isn't fixed by the repair tool, try out Riot Support's [Connection Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).
