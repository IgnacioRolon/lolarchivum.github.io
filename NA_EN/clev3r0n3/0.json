People who are penalized, generally don't want to have a penalty. We perma-ban people when they reach a point that they are not going to change their behavior. These are the people that fail to understand their behavior is unacceptable after numerous penalties.\n\n> The last couple season though they instituted autobanning and now people get banned left and right, that's a real issue, it makes the game lackluster.\n\nI fail to understand how banning people makes a game lackluster.\n\n> Here's what's actually happening \"all of the toxic people are finding partners and clans and then group reporting people that they troll all game and getting them autobanned since bots don't distinguish whats actual toxicity and what's just a group of dicks reporting because they're in a clan\".\n\n'Ganging up on' someone via reports doesn't do anything. 1 report is the same as 9. More reports does not increase the chance of a game being reviewed. All it takes is a single report.\n\n> I'm literally saying that toxicity is part of any competitive gaming, always has been, always will be. \n\nI am literally saying this is not true. A small group of people may have been unsportsmanlike, but the majority are fed up with this behavior. It will not be tolerated. If that's your idea of fun then we don't want you here. Go play another game. Good luck finding another game studio that doesn't feel the same way.\n\n> It's very simple, this game has a giant player base, unfortunately since even farting in someones general direction gets your account suspended and then banned these days...\n\nThe vast majority of player never receive any type of penalty. Of those that do, they only receive one. Of those that got one, most never receive another .. and so it goes. If you are getting penalized, you are in a very very very small group. If you are getting penalized over and over .. you are the 'unsportsmanlike elite'.\n\n> there is literally 0 reason to invest a dime in any skins in this game. \n\nI agree. This game is free to play. You don't need to invest a dime. If you want to though, feel free. I have a few skins I love.\n\n> Now of course you can be none toxic and good for you if you are, however a majority of the people are people, people react to other people acting like dicks\n\nNo. The majority do not. Not even a minority. A very very small minority. The perception problem is that there are 10 players in each game. So one unsportsmanlike player ruins the game for 9 other people. Add negativity bias to this and it compounds.\n\n> So riot has literally killed their own game with their own autoban system.\n\nActually, unsportsmanlike people kill the game. By removing them from the game it becomes more enjoyable, which increases player retention.","replies":[{"poster":"Clev3r0n3","date":"2018-04-24T22:00:15.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":22,"body":"I'll address your points 1 at a time since there seem to be a lot of them.\n\n1) This being a small purpose built forum is actually in itself a problem, I was told once by a mod that there is a reddit forum too and yet I had no idea that it even existed before he told me as it's not really advertised anywhere visible. More importantly this forum is the main place for us to speak because it's the most visible place we know that directly relates to the game. Second on this very same topic, is that you guys ban over stuff that isn't immensely bad behavior and I wish I could tell you that it is but most of the time you ban people for simply defending their position, not even in a toxic profane way, just basic defending. And I've heard that \"you shouldn't defend yourself just mute them\", but you know what you guys put a chat into the game and then punish people for using it?\n\n2) The game becomes lackluster when you ban and punish a good chunk of the community for having a few douches on a the team who endlessly troll and flame, it would be nice if the douches are the ones that get punished but most of the time they just gang up and tilt someone on the team and that person is the one that gets punished. So yea completely lackluster.\n\n3) You say 1 report is like 9 but I can tell you for a fact that I've been reported by 1 person in multiple games and very rarely does that actually do anything however every single time I get reported by 2+ people of the same clan in any game I immediately have a punishment or ban. So you're flat out wrong about that one.\n\n4) You think toxicity isn't part of competitive gaming? I dare you to find me a competitive game that has chat and doesn't have toxicity, please, I'll wait. Some of the top ranked people in the world have gotten banned for toxicity, and you think it isn't part of gaming? Come on man. I'd love to see the stats on the  \"small amount of people receive 1 penalty and never another one\". \n\n5) final point I know this game is free to play, and I know that you don't need to invest a dime but what I'm saying is I had no problem investing money in a game that was worth playing without getting banned every other month, but I personally and everyone I've talked to wouldn't even consider spending money on a game that bans people left and right.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-04-24T22:19:49.691+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really hope Tantram comes back to respond again to you... but I love how you're telling the person who coded the systems and literally can see how many times you've been reported - I love how you're telling him that you know better than him.\n\nYou keep saying things like \"good chunk of the community\" - it's not - it's a very small minority.

I just thought i'd give my two cents there.\n\nI used to be a typical extreme rager over mistakes and whatnot but I've severely calmed my chat down and now I barely type at all unless it's for communication purposes. \n\nWhat I think the problem is personally is just how black-and-white it is. Just a matter of opinion, but I think context matters. One word can be used in many different ways, but no matter what way, it will result in a punishment. From what I understand there's a list of blacklisted words. I saw somebody's forum post where they said they got punished because they said \"kys ???\" in response to somebody actually telling them that, and they got punished for it anyway. Maybe they left part of the story out where they were really toxic, but I wouldn't know. I have another friend I was playing with one game, and it was a normal game, where he said he was \"just trolling\" (not literally obviously, meaning just having fun kinda) and I think he said \"stfu\" once maybe in response to our team flaming him over stupid things. He got banned right after the game. Granted, he did mention getting punished before, but in a situation like that, I just personally don't think it's a ban-worthy offense.\n\nI just have a problem with how heavy handed the punishments are while also not considering context whatsoever. Over the internet things can get cloudy and messages can be misinterpreted. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but I've never agreed with trying to silence people for saying certain words. Not my decision as a company, but I can't help but feel like I'm walking on eggshells when I type something like \"lets get this ****ing dragon\" or I \"boss somebody around\" by telling them to ward their river, afraid I'll get reported and have it seen as an argument.\n\nBut I didn't develop the system, so I'm just going from a mix of anecdotal evidence.

I'm pretty confident I should have nailed the important bits, though]\n\nThis **did** actually happen during the autoban system... it's just the system did **not** issue the punishment. In fact, the lack of a punishment despite a **huge** amount of reports is what lead to Riot looking at the case manually to determine what was happening there (could have been an edge case that should be detected, after all).\n\nBut wait, there's more:\nDespite manually issuing a punishment after the review, they actually were very firm that this is an edge case that needs to be handled manually... so they very much confirmed that the autoban's verdict (which was: **not** punishing Singed) was actually correct.\n\nYou think that's all? Think again:\nThe person that was banned themselves actually posted in the thread that blew up on the issue, and acknowledged what he had been doing wrong (which was basically the way he went about communicating his strategy to his teammates).\n\nSince I'm on a roll regarding how ridiculous that example is, I might add one final bit:\nRiot revised their policy after a similar case with a Nunu support. That Singed would, under Riot's current policy, not actually receive a 14-day ban.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nThe autoban system did **not** issue a punishment (which was the intended outcome).\nRiot **manually** issued this punishment because a large number of reports did **not** lead to a punishment.\nThe person who was punished understood why he was punished.\nThe policy changed and such a ban wouldn't actually happen anymore.\n\nBest.

The game will have just as toxic if not a more toxic community but the people who actually enjoyed playing this game will quit and play something else where they don&#x27;t get banned by toxic idiots.\n\nYou seem to misunderstand what vocal minority means.\n\nYou are the loudest, but a minority.
