I mean are you serious riot. Do you test your crap or just release it and see how it goes. Hes freaking game breaking tanky with no defensive items. And his ap damage is crazy right off the bat. Its outrageous the combo. Plus the pull, plus the ult, plus the range, like seriously? He can hit you under tower, he can pull you under tower, he can ult you near his tower atleast take tower out of the ult","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-17T06:01:46.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This section is for reporting bugs.

It really depends on what Champions you're playing. Mordekasier is really easy to counter, if you Build QSS, it can stop his R and you can move freely, Maokai W can stop his R, this is how: when he is channeling his R, use Maokai W while he channels it and It will cancel it out. If you play Gangplank you can Counter his R with his Blood Oranges. Malzhar can use his Spell shield to counter it, same Goes with Morgana Spell Shield can cancel it out. Well, they do Test Their Champions but remember most of the Riot teams barely play the game. \n\n\nQuit Whining and Use the Practice tool to Test stuff out, It's there for a reason.","replies":[]}]}
