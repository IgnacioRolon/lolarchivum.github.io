I would like to know how i can track people that offend me inside your Game since the game itself doesnt disable the set of rules that are present within my country and the EU.

You just break into the RIto servers, look up the IP (and timestamp) of his logins. Then you hack into his ISP's database, and look up the address. Or if he has a credit card connected to his account, you just have to hack into the bank's database. Easy peasy!\n\nJokes aside, they wont give YOU personally the information. If you call the police and explain your situation (be careful to wait until they finish laughing because if you talk while they are rolling on the floor, they would lose valuable information). Then the police can request information from Rito (and probably they would have to give the info to the police, i'm not sure). Otherwise you as just a random person have no right to request this information from Rito.\n\nPs.: What did you get this upset? Did you fall for a \"Joe joke\"? xD","replies":[]}]}
