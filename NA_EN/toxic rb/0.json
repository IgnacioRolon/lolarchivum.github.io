Not saying that Sion isn't great and also really fun as well in this, because he definitely is. Glad to know someone else can think outside of the extremely tiny box that the community has created. You should also try Gnar, Trundle, and Urgot.

I did bork/runaan's on sona too, and about the time my teammates were getting counterred by kat midgame builds, I started to carry.

We won.\n\n{{champion:41}} : He turns out to not be as OP as you'd think. I think since the barrel nerf, he doesn't pose much of a threat. He's also VERY lategame in a group of all GPs. He also can't counterbuild really. He has a very specific critbuild he needs to be useful eventually in fights. I bet you though, a pre-made of GPs could rock. So far, the standard plan is for people to stack GP ults, but once the enemy is out of it, who cares? Probably what would work better is a coordinated set of simultaneous but SPREAD OUT ults in one lane, so there's nowhere to go. But again, you'd need a premade.\n\nAll this to say: None of these champs are easy to get, but they're all really fun to play. It still boggles my mind that majority picks are so loppsided towards 10 champs that LITERALLY make up 70% of all picks. \n\n#\\#OfA-Teambuilder","replies":[]},{"poster":"Guyy Fieri","date":"2015-10-23T04:20:37.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:161}} is nuts in this.
