Clearly a name of Shuriman origin, and seems to indicate that Kai is not a gender-specific name. Is the Kai'sa styling to indicate the use of the name on a female, a relic of Shuriman naming that's extremely uncommon (as no other Shuriman character has it), or a specific thing used for giving names to Void creatures? If the latter, what does \"Sa\" add to it's meaning, given that Kai seems to be such a common name? Is it the Shuriman Void equivalent of \"Jane Doe?\"","replies":[{"poster":"KuroCaliber","date":"2018-06-21T17:39:16.164+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her original name used to be Kaisa.
