It doesn't make sense. People are going to get mad at the game and are going to get mad at teammates. That's why there is a mute button. You should be muting the toxic players, not banning them. The fact that my bot lane can go 0-16 in ranked and not be banned for throwing but yet I get banned for flaming them for throwing is completely ridiculous. If you are going to ban people for toxicity, a week long ban should be the *max*. IS riot seriously perma banning people for yelling at throwing teammates? Are you kidding me? If you don't like a person in chat you should mute but be done with it end of story. Why are toxic players getting banned but trolls get away scott free? This game doesn't even have voice coms, (Which it desperately needs in my opinion). In the end, There is absolutely no reason anyone should be getting banned for toxicity when there is literally a mute button. Why don't we ban the trolls that make these players get angry instead of the toxic players who might actually be competent players.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-22T04:20:32.816+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because toxicity is a symptom, not a cause.

I'm sure there's **someone** out there who only says the N word, for example, but the **vast majority** of people who are toxic in one way (ex: flaming) are also toxic in other ways (ex: griefing, afk, etc).\n\nThis goes along with what you're saying - the problem is the player and the attitude that they can do whatever they want for their own pleasure.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Argent Wolf","date":"2019-11-22T06:13:06.730+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sooo.... you want to be able to throw a tantrum like a 5 year old, but also do it in my ears?  fuck no.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2019-11-22T04:14:47.439+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"toxicity, and the reputation this game has for it, drives customers away. \n\nwhy would ANY business allow something that takes money directly out of their pockets?

Sure you could be bantering, but the other person may not know that. Players also like to try and get out of it by saying \"it's not bannable\" and \"it's not verbal abuse\" and such and such excuses to make it seem like it's okay, but it's not. In truth, it all shares a common purpose and that is to annoy other players and harass. Just saying anything rude and simple like \"you're bad,\" anything just as bad or even worse is completely uncalled for. It's not okay and no one should be doing it in the first place.\n\nI like what Riot is doing with the system and it's the right way to go. Toxicity needs to be rooted of the gaming community and I applaud their efforts to do so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colte","date":"2019-11-22T04:43:51.920+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"there being a mute button doesn't change the fact that toxicity and hate speech could lead victims to extreme choices (suicide etc)\n\nit is not an excuse to be okay to severely harass people just because they're bad at the game, not everyone is on the same kill level and it's entirely riot's fault for ruining the matchmaking and also rewarding players for creating smurfs which means new players would always get smashed by better players and fail their learning phase.\n\nthe meta is too burst oriented which gives little room to learn how to manuever, react and win fights. hell even platinum players doesn't seem to know how to win games..\n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kawaii Godzilla","date":"2019-11-22T13:16:42.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh yes, add voice comms so i can hear children with impulse control problems call me every expletive and slur that they can think of. _Wonderful_\n\n/s","replies":[]},{"poster":"ï¬‚oo","date":"2019-11-22T07:20:55.637+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mute button was a bandaid fix and doesn't allow you to be flaming your teammates.\nIt's been asked for by the community because people like you don't know how to behave.

It;s not pleasant to listen to and it derails the game from the more important matters. Yes there's a mute button but it's meant to be a band-aid solution at most and not a get out of jail free card for poor chat behavior. Besides, what good does flaming an inter or troll do? Aside from coddling your ego, absolutely nothing, and more often then not just makes things worse since they want a negative reaction from you. Don't give them that, chances are they'll stop or just dig their graves deeper. Best of all: you don't go down with them.\n\nWhile Riot is willing to give people chances to shape up, the number is not infinite, and eventually they have to remove those who are more interested in acting up than behaving civilly or maturely, since them staying is more harmful in the long run than them leaving. Also, you can be as good at the game as you want, but as players like Dardoch prove that doesn't matter if your reputation is being an obnoxious jerk since that can overshadow your skill.\n\nFinally VC technically does exist, but only for premades. That said if you can't be bothered to behave yourself with text chat then how can you expect others to believe you'll behave with voice chat? Seems pretty selfish if you ask me.","replies":[]}]}
