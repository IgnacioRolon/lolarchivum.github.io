Around 5-10 seconds after I load into the game, my screen freezes and the entire sound system distorts. I can't seem to alternate tab out of it nor control alternate delete. I have to hard restart my computer for it to work. Already tried reinstalling league but still doesn't fix the problem. Someone help please!!! :(\r\n\r\n\r\nI just found this T-shirt my newsfeed a while back. i don't know much about Teespring Arctic Ops Varus T-Shirt. Can you suggest me how it will be?\r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/2cp6sNO","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-08T15:23:03.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, I can't vouch for the quality of teespring, since I've never purchased products from their site. Keep in mind that the shirt itself is not official Riot merchandise, so it may not be of the same quality as those on our [merch site](https://na.merch.riotgames.com/en/).\n\nAs for your system freezes, if you're running Windows 10, it's likely to be caused by the game DVR feature that was enabled by the anniversary update for windows 10. You can [disable the game bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) with this guide to see if it resolved the problem.\n\nLet me know if that worked for you.","replies":[]}]}
