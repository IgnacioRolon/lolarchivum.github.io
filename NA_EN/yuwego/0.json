However, I'm just not good still and I keep going negative which causes my team to ignore my input for game progress.  I know what to do and how to play because my fiance has been playing for WAY longer than I have but I still can't get away from feeding fever.  I ping, I call mia's, I don't take unnecessary risks and I don't go into fights that I know I can't win BUT I still keep getting caught and unintentionally feeding which, in turn, pisses my team off and gets reported.  I thought that maybe it was a champ issue, so I bought my first champ and thought I could play a good Tristana--the same thing started happening after a few games.  I thought \"Okay, maybe I'm just not a good ADC.\"  So I went mage and bought Lissandra, that didn't work out well AT ALL, just recently I bought Trynd and refunded him the next day.  I am trying to learn with Kat and MF because I like their styles and I feel like I do a little bit better with them but the same crap still happens.  Am I just having bad luck and being matched with terrible players and trolls, or do I just suck and should uninstall the game (the last bit is a joke, I just really want to get better)?  Please, I appreciate any and all advice and tips and tricks so that I can improve my game.  I want to be platinum someday, but I know at this rate I won't ever get there!  Also, if anyone wants to just play co-op or something with me and just coach me, I'd be happy with that! :)","replies":[{"poster":"fdissht","date":"2015-01-14T02:42:27.965+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're not even lvl 30 yet, don't worry, people shouldn't care too much about dying too much.

Trust me. Stay away from ranked. Even if a friend wants to duo with you. Buy most of the champions first. Get good in all the lanes. FINISH YOUR RUNE PAGES. If you do that and just keep playing and trying to do better in the laning phase to beat your opponent you should be good. Basically in laning phase you just want to practice last hitting. The more cs you have the more gold you get. The more gold you get the more items. Don't go for kills in laning phase. Keep poking your enemy down and last hitting minions at the same time. Only go for a kill if your jungler is there, the enemy turret dives you, or the enemy is low enough where you KNOW you will secure the kill. One last thing. Watch streamers. They will give out helpful  advice most of the time.

Make her use different champions but you play only one. Its fastest and best way of understanding how certain lanes works and how you should play in future. It will hurt and you will feel pretty bad about her whooping your ass but every time you get closer to beating her, you will feel better. Plus she might choose champs that are really bad against yours and you will understand how counterpick works (meaning sometimes you just can't fight or you will die regardless how good you are).\n\nRecord and watch some replays of your games. Watch streams and read lol Wiki if you don't understand what happend and why you died so fast. \n\nThere are TONS of guides that will help you train faster and more effective. They are all free and easy to find. Just ask your fiance about them, she will tell you if its good or not. Every player in LoL used guide at some point.

Kat is useless if the enemy team has moderate CC. Your picking a snow ball champ and failing and you wonder why people do not listen to you? Your making bad game choices right from the start and then not backing them up. No one in there right mind will listen to you in game. \n\nWhen playing mid grab someone with some ulity so if you fall behind you are still of value to the team. \n\nWhen playing ADC pick someone with some kind of mobility(MF does not have mobility). Learn corki, cait, ez, lucian, trist(though getting kit reworked in 5.2).

The LCS is starting up next weekend I recommend watching and paying attention during team fights and I mean pay attention. If you want to learn more about a specific champion or role then just watch that person during one of the fights. Playing safer will win your more games because during solo queue matches there is almost always one team that throws the match by going over aggressive or just makes a small mistake to cost a team fight or dragon. If you are playing katarina I enjoy building a Twin Shadows first item because it gives her some CC and is also helpful when escaping, plus the move speed is just generally good for melee champs right now. Learning last hitting of minions is also extremely important as otherwise you will not earn gold from minions. If you are ahead in your lane and you find time where you are alone in lane and the enemies are dead/shopping and returning to lane try to make a roam to one of the nearby lanes, even if you dont do anything but show your face it will change the way your opponents will be playing.  Watch the map if you are going aggressive on someone but see that someone is missing in another lane just be prepared to make a retreat at any time or just back off right away if you dont want to risk giving a kill and getting nothing out of it. \n\nI am not a great player by any standards but I have been playing since season 1 and I am almost always watching league streams as long as I am at my computer because I have dual monitors. http://www.twitch.tv/sickmotionlol this is a very good streamer but he mainly plays top lane. He often talks about mistakes he makes and mistakes people he is playing with makes. But mostly just ward and play safe until you learn the limits of the champions you are playing as/against. If you havent already just learn what every champion does as far as their abilities goes because if you are playing against someone and they do something and you go \"whut was that?\" you are at a disadvantage. Also dont worry about refunding champions you bought with IP... only refund skins you bought with rp because you only get 3 refunds for the rest of time. Dont buy champs with rp even if you really want to play them... it just is not worth the money but then again I dont have money to spend so yeah... You can add me if you want and I can play some games with you. You are always going to be running into trolls, feeders and leavers in this game the best thing you can do is just stay calm and focus on your own playing because that is how you get better.\n\n\n\nedit: I should probably say the streamer I linked streams pretty late at night so you might not be up when he streams.
