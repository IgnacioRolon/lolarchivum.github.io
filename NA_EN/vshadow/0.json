Personally, I have been with this game since season 2 through the good, bad and ugly, even though im still bronze this season, I always enjoy queing up and playing games, even if we do get our as*** kicked.\r\n\r\nSocial rules state that if I ask a question, it is polite that I answer first to get the ball rolling, so here we go.\r\nThe last two years have been really rough for me, particularly may of 2014, school was just ending and I had made it though one more year, keep in mind im pretty young (15) and was just finishing middle school, the morning of the \"party day\" that had been planned from the first day, I received a call that one of my 4 or so friends, but definitely my closest, considering I didnt have many friends. Anyways, today's going to be awesome. Were all hanging out after the school party and are going to do what nerds do best, kick ass in ranked 5's. (We never did actually win alot of games) But to sum it up, I received a call from a shaky voice, caller ID identified it as Shawn, the overly obsessed Assassins creed player. He delivered the news that my best friend, the one who was with me through everything was found hanging in her garage, suicide. I never really got over it, I had my suicidal phase and my depression phase, but now, almost a year later, the therapists say I suffer from PTSD, that explains the not sleeping part, actually the whole reason I am writing this post, because when in times like this, when I wake up with cold sweat from the vivid nightmares, I get up, grab a coke and play a few league games, it keeps my mind off things and I always have fun doing it.\r\nSo thats what league means to me, it helps me cope with the loss of my closest friend, who had been there for me every time I needed someone.\r\n\r\nLike I said, this is ***NOT*** a poor me post, I simply am curious about what league means for others.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-02-18T02:54:13.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me it means winning, I am easily the most competitive person you will meet, IDC if it is my little pony happy adventure time, i am finding a way to kick your as*. This game has also helped me stay in contact with friends who live across the country whom I would probably never talk to if we didn't play this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ethereal311","date":"2015-02-16T10:17:03.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I generally play League not for the social aspect since I have very few friends that I can regularly play with, but more so for the thrill of working a strategy out and attaining victory through it. I play a bunch of non-meta (when the opportunity and situation arises) champions and attempt to make them work and learn about their strengths and weaknesses through that. Not to mention I'm starting to produce actual video content and literature on the LoL universe, so I'm intending to continue with both of those.","replies":[]}]}
