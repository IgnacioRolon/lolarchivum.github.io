PLEASE HELP","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I was playing a flex game with my friend and after the game stats just never loaded. After i clicked skip stats I was returned to the normal page, however when i tried to start a new game it said i couldn't. I then restarted league and it instantly loaded the TM client and asked me to reconnect. At this point I told my friend and he said it was happening to him too. Its been around 30 min now and we still cant do anything. Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-21T22:03:53.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be having an issue with a ghost game. The game servers might not have ever told your client that the match was over, so now it still thinks there's a game you need to reconnect to. Typically these will clear up with enough time, have you been able to get back in yet?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lion pride king","date":"2017-09-21T19:05:53.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem as you !
