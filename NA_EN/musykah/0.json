I received an email from Riot today saying I was banned for using a third party program and cheating. It really confused me since I spent way too much money to risk losing my account. I know I suck at the game, but I don't take those kinds of risks. I am not stupid enough to just give out my login info out. This just came out of nowhere. I already submitted a ticket about the issue and will update once I get a response.\r\n\r\nI just want to know if anyone else got banned for the same reason?","replies":[{"poster":"Last Bre√†th","date":"2017-09-04T15:02:19.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi!\n\nI got banned ( my main account in EUNE) for the same reason and like you submitted a ticket. You wont get unbanned, because they trust more on their broken bots for catching hackers. Riot Support will answer you just like me. They will say why you are banned ( I can't understand why), tell you what is the unfair in using 3rd party programs and that you must keep in mind that you are responsible for all activity on your account. At the end of the message will say that they won't be able to go into the specifics of an account's exploit abuse, as divulging this information could compromise future investigations.\n\nYou will not get your money back.\nYou have to start with a brand new level 1 account. ( and you will never be sure the new account wont be banned again for a false reason)\n\nI am sorry. Wish you all the best for ahead!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dragdronzer","date":"2017-09-04T09:32:37.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My username or password are same.

Most of the games played were ranked. I **NEVER** play ranked games especially if I'm playing completely alone. Now I know for sure someone got a hold of my login info. I really hope I get a response soon. Even though I haven't played recently, I really like the game and was planning to come back to it some day.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-03T22:50:21.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and pulled up your account, and it does actually look like someone most likely hacked their way onto your account. It's hard for me personally to be able to say when the hacking happened and when the scripting happening, but go ahead and reach out to our account agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) letting them know that the programs might have been used by someone who had access to your account.","replies":[{"poster":"Musykah","date":"2017-09-04T00:33:16.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for responding.
