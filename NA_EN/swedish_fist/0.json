Of course there is the post game report system but it doesn&#039;t matter the tribunal system more than likely wont notice this individual to the probably obnoxious numbers of reports or just gives a warning. There is nothing you can do in this case  but its extremely wrong that an individual can troll to such an extend on not face more serious consequences even before the match happens. usually individuals that intentionally feed have done it before and yet they remain and keep doing it. \r\n\r\nI have no idea what riot should do in regards to this growing problem or if im just insane and unlucky to keep getting matched up with these individuals. either way it makes me more and more upset every time it happens and while I don&#039;t think ill ever quit league, it has come to the point that some days i don&#039;t want to ladder anymore due to this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2016-08-11T03:40:28.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"doesn't dodging only cost 3 LP?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Itankyou","date":"2016-08-11T02:39:00.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If riot stopped banning toxic players, there would be less in lower levels because all anyone does is smurf anymore.

Honestly they should bring back the tribunal, at least just for player reviews (let players flag legit reports for review by staff).\n\nThe current mass number of idiot children that report everyone regardless of what they did is what makes it impossible for riot to have staff reviewing every report, sadly. \nThere should be feedback if you are falsely reporting, and eventual restriction on ability to report at all.","replies":[{"poster":"OnionRanger","date":"2016-08-11T03:35:28.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do what Dota 2 does. You get 3 reports per week and if the person you reported gets punished(chat ban or low priority) you get refunded one report. That stops 12 years olds form reporting everyone on their team cause they fed and are mad they are garbage at the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
