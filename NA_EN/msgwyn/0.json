I could only really find mac users complaining about this, although this happened on my windows computer. For windows computers it is actually really simple.

The first is that another crash may have occured and lingering in the background.  I recommend restarting your PC just in case this might be the reason. \n\nThe other may be a security setting that's preventing the patcher or client from launching properly.  I suggest using the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide in case a restart didn't' help.
