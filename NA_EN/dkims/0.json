How hard is it to just tell your design team to spend a little bit of time to fix a minor hitbox if the consequences of it can be game breaking? You don't even have to purge every hitbox immediately and spend a lot of overtime money to fix these. Just slowly fix them when people are clearly complaining about it with clear evidence. I don't think it's excusable for an error like this to exist for multiple seasons.","replies":[{"poster":"FizCap","date":"2017-10-26T16:56:09.069+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"The hook was legit, the hook model is just smaller than the hitbox","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Skill Tank","date":"2017-10-26T17:04:11.635+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's the whole point, lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Guttler","date":"2017-10-26T17:14:35.482+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember that most skillshots in LOL have lollypopping.
