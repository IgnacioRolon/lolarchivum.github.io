Right now though, I'm watching my stolen gf's account playing ranked, something she was supposed to do after she got to a good knowledge level of the game. RIOT please respond faster... Don't let this guy ruin her account's MMR. She lost the account to a link she was sent by him... What if he's spreading the link through her account, impersonating her? We really need some help, and faster. I mean, don't think it is reasonable responding to tickets of THIS importance after a whole day or more. I can tell you from first-hand experience that Ubisoft and Blizzard support responded almost immediatly, and for issues of much lesser importance. Thanks for anyone that might read this, or any MOD that might respond to me...  We really need an account lockdown so it can be kept safe until this issue has been resolved...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-19T20:21:23.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally understand the sense of urgency, but rest easy knowing that our account team will be able to help her.  We aren't able to assist through third party, so we'll have to work with her directly, and we can look into any reparations as well as locking the account in the meantime.   If there's a ticket number I can look into that, but I have to emphasis that we won't be able to correspond with you directly since it's not technically your account.  Our account team has a bit of a higher volume than usual, but we'll reply back to her ticket as soon as we can.","replies":[{"poster":"AdCsTi","date":"2017-10-19T22:19:52.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I simply want the account to be locked, as of now, the account was being still used by the hacker. The ticket's number is supposed to be #32222314, but the link that was sent her to edit her ticket etc, isn't really accessible since it requires her to login, even though this kind of ticket needs you to be logged out of your account (not that she can log in to hers as it has been hacked). If you could speed up the proccess of locking her account and maybe the core suspect that is probably the hacker I would appreciate it. Also I speak on behalf of her since I'm a bit more tech-savvy. Thanks for any help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-19T22:27:08.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey friend, I've applied a security lock on the account.  \n\nShe will want to use our [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) which doesn't require logging in.  This will also allow her to input an email address we can directly reach out to, instead of logging into the ticketing system.\n\nOur account team will work with her from there!","replies":[{"poster":"AdCsTi","date":"2017-10-20T07:12:49.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She did send a ticket first before having me post about this on the forums. Anyways, a mod responded to her, probably determined through her ticket that she indeed is the original owner, and sent her a link to reset her email and password. Thanks for the help, really. I do wonder though, what happens with the person that sent her the link and stole her account, I mean, chat logs clearly show him sending her a link that redirects you to a classic fake page. Thanks in advance for any response.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-20T15:14:33.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad we were able to assist here.  Her best bet is to speak with her specialist to get anymore context.  I don't know the details of your security so I can't really say for sure, but often folks find their accounts compromised through phishing, account sharing, or leaving their info unsafe.  I recommend checking out our[ account protection guide ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account)to help keep your info safe in and outside of league.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
