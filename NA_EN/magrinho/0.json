I've already bought RP only for the transfer and it would suck if I couldn't do this transaction. Could anyone help me?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMagrinho.","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-21T14:32:30.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They've been working on a fix for the transfer system for a while now, and are still fixing up some issues. It may still take a few more weeks, so you'll just have to be patient until it's available again. The [Transfer Service Update](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/rlu6awv4-transfer-service-update) thread was pinned, and was made just over 4 weeks ago. In that thread, they stated it may take another 5-6 weeks. Hopefully it will be working within the next 1 to 2 weeks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-21T22:54:03.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just here to confirm!
