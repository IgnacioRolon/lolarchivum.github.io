The worst part is it seems almost malicious.\n\nEDIT: Well I'm glad that so many people are with me on this! :D Just wanted to say the other day I had more terrible minion related experiences! For instance.. when I was trying to walk through a minion wall.. (Im pretty sure that they were minions. I believe i was playing galio in the mid lane as well so it could be that he has a big model idk) But he wouldn't even attempt to move repathing and such... instead he got stuck solid and me trying not to blow my flash(because it was a silly reason to do so) sees a xin coming in for a gank..I tried with all my might to get free... alas.. I had to flash.. but xin... I couldnt escape the xin all because of those minions of malicious intent! Please, I know that this thread is relatively old(five months) but please continue to share your experiences! :) Until then, maybe I'll see you on the rift! ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2015-09-03T18:18:10.526+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"How...did they get...the car in that position?","replies":[{"poster":"Yosuke Apperu","date":"2015-09-03T18:22:01.775+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same way that your minions plan your demise..
