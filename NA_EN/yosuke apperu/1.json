I understand that it&#039;s preseason and you guys and girls at riot are working your butts off to improve the game this season even more than the last.. A better game sounds nice.. but in all this chaos we haven&#039;t really heard any calming statements from you guys. May we please have a written statement or something of some sort telling us the direction that you want the game to go? What you hope to accomplish etc? I don&#039;t want to be like most and call you guys names and just make vulgar rants out of anger. I want to give you guys the benefit of a doubt! I really do! :) Just let us know what&#039;s going on a bit more, post on the boards a little bit more often. When you screw something up, own up to it.. and maybe players will start doing the same. (For example that warlord&#039;s bloodlust mastery is just a balance nightmare) Just say &quot;We goofed!&quot; . I&#039;ll admit my mistakes too! For instance recalling when the entire enemy team is dead instead of pushing.. or making bad baron calls.. or underestimating the amount of cc that a team may have.. I got a little off topic so I&#039;m sorry about that.. I also want to give a shout out to RIOT&#039;s own KATEYKHAOS.. You put up with so much of the forum&#039;s crap. We appreciate how you try to keep us informed and you do all you can. You have my gratitude for what it&#039;s worth &lt;3","replies":[]}
