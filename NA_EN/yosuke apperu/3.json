The nature of it makes Yasuo kind of niche. In some team comps, it's borderline useless unless the player is really skilled and can proc it themselves; in other team comps, it's kind of overbearing since it's built as a wombo-combo ult; not necessarily a problem, esp if you have ways to play around that (stop the initial engage and Yasuo doesn't have many tools to combo off of).\n\nI think my issue with it is that the cooldown drops so drastically; why does it need to be 30 seconds at max rank? Especially since Yasuo is more late-game oriented with how he's reliant on getting a few items, his ult makes him even more powerful at that point since the armor pen and all his stats from items means he deals ridiculous amounts of damage, and the low cooldown means if he fails he can try again really soon afterwards. It's a really game changing ultimate, I don't see why there's such a low cost to failure.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-08-03T20:17:34.627+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">why does it need to be 30 seconds at max rank?\n\nThis is my main complaint about Blitzcrank's ultimate at all ranks.\n\nAlongside Yasuo, it's just a little short for an ultimate cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-08-03T20:59:10.903+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm with you on that","replies":[]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2015-08-03T21:30:55.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well a blitz ult won't kill you...it will screw you over but blitz alone doesn't have enough power to kill you unless he is ahead and you are the adc.

His ultimate could get a 60/55/50 second cool down and no one would even mind (unless they are crazed yasuo mains). His passive shouldn't allow bonus critical damage. Not with no way of dodging such critical damages. I've played as and against with full critical and seen that even tanks don't stand a chance. It's worse than Tryndamere but even with Master Yi, his swipe animation is very fast. If we could just take that off and put back his MS boost then I'd be fine. I liked the small MS boost he'd get. It allowed his shield meter to replenish easier and its easy to stop. Just give him a up to +10 MS boost every 10 points he gains back for his shield.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-08-03T20:15:54.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really? His ult could do no damage and it's still an instant, auto-targeted wombo combo AoE CC from 1200 range. That itself isn't a huge problem, there are plenty of wombo-combos in the game with more flexibility, so sure, there's a trade off there, but the cooldown (or lack of) just seems absurd. I mean sure, the damage makes the issue worse, but in a drawn out fight he can ult twice. That's kind of ridiculous. Like, late game Yasuo doesn't have to make the choice between using his ult in a skirmish or save it for a larger teamfight; he'll pretty much always have it up. It's not just, as I said before, that there's a low cost to failure; there's a low cost period. Using his ult in a 1v1 late game doesn't cost him anything since he'll have it up for the next skirmish or next teamfight; it's much more difficult to coordinate attacks based on Yasuo's ult being down like you could for most other champions.\n\nOn the flipside, because it's a combo ultimate, he's typically not using it on cooldown, so why is it that low at all? It's just unnecessary power imo. It feels like it should be an ultimate that's saved for that one gamechanging fight, not just used at every possible moment just because you always have it up.\n\nHis passive is pretty interesting, since it encourages him to rush crit chance as fast as possible, which generally means a stattik shiv. That itself doesn't offer a ton of damage, plus, unlike most squishy melee carries' (ie. Yi, Trynd, Riven, Fiora) first items (ie. BotRK, Hydra), it doesn't give him any sustain. It fits the 'late game carry' mentality since it puts off his powerspike until 2-3 items (though it's questionable how much that really matters, given his overall short CDs and absurd mobility inside a minion wave and teamfight), but it's something to keep in mind. Basically, there's a reason for it; whether it's a good reason is debatable (like, is it okay to have a champion with a weak early-mid game, barring the crazy mechanical outplays that are possible with his kit, to have them spike astronomically in the late game? Given the community's sentiment towards Vayne and pre-rework Tristana, I don't think many people are a fan, but I could be wrong). By contrast, I see no reason his ult cooldown should be as low as it is.","replies":[{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2015-08-03T21:39:35.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In his defense some other assasins have their ult pretty much up all the time. {{champion:39}}  (50 sec cd) {{champion:55}} (45 sec cd without passive) {{champion:84}} (15 sec per charge so around 45 sec total without passive) {{champion:91}} (55 sec cd)","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-08-03T21:49:09.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Their ults aren't AoE CC, just damage and some utility.
