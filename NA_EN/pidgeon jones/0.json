I'm Pidgeon Jones and I'm starting a network of lower tiered, toxicity free players interested in playing either ranked 5s or dynamic queue with other players. The club will feature both free agents looking to join a team and team captains looking for players, hopefully with about a 60/40 ratio with free agents winning. I will also be looking for consistently friendly, nice players to fill out some moderation roles down the road, in the mean time I will be handling invites and moderation alone as actively as I can. \r\n\r\n\r\nOnce you're either on a team or your team is full, you'll be removed from Team Builder and invited to a group reserved for teams made through our club for scrimming, competing and playing together. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rules are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. No toxicity. This means not only out of free agents and team captains, but players on a captains team either. \r\nThis is an environment geared towards people trying to find their fit in a team and no one should have to deal with toxicity.\r\n\r\nThis is a blanket rule that includes racism, sexism or any other form of putting someone down.\r\n2. Microphones required from free agents and captains unless there's an agreement about you not having a mic.\r\n3. If you're in the club as a captain, the rest of your team doesn't need to be invited.\r\n\r\n\r\n**POST HERE TO REQUEST AN INVITE, IN YOUR POST LET ME KNOW IF YOU'RE A FREE AGENT OR CAPTAIN.**","replies":[{"poster":"xEvilknight","date":"2016-03-19T02:34:40.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:412}} Free Agent\n\nIGN: xEvilknight\nRole: Support \nOff-role: Fill\nFavourite Champions: Thresh / Nami / Bard / Karma\nRank S6: Gold 1 (S4 = Gold, S5 = Platinum)","replies":[]},{"poster":"I KRI I","date":"2016-03-19T02:30:53.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Free Agent\n\nIGN: I KRI I","replies":[]},{"poster":"ORG Deathmark","date":"2016-03-19T02:22:20.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: 1HitWonderX\nI am a captain and would definitely like to join the club and see what's going on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mole Lord","date":"2016-03-19T02:14:10.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Free Agent- IGN: CinnamonChef","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jackmeister","date":"2016-03-19T01:46:07.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Free Agent sounds good,\n\nIGN: Killerfire","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lìghts Out","date":"2016-03-19T01:36:16.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Free Agent\nIGN: Dyrti Deeds","replies":[]},{"poster":"KrimzinHaZe","date":"2016-03-17T17:52:44.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems Fun, I'll go for Free Agent\n\nIGN: Boltstorm200","replies":[]},{"poster":"Verstaka","date":"2016-03-17T17:49:00.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Free Agent\nIGN: Verstaka\n\nI currently only have headphones as my mic died about a week back.
