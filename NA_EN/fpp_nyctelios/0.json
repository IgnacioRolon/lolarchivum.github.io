Its been a little more than a month from they day i got unsuspended, ive been playing daily, 2-10 games per day, and i can say ive really reformed. I do get honors from teammates, premade or not, but have rarely gotten the \"most honorable\" award after a game, maybe 1-2 times. My honor level is still 0 after all this progress ive made and im starting to feel frustrated. My account has had no suspensions in the past. Im really trying to get my honor level to rise here but i do need some help. I just noticed the tournaments require someone to be at least honor level 2, and i just dont think its right that im not able to participate in them with my friends because i really am reformed. What exactly do you have to do to get out of honor level 0 when your account has 0 past suspenions and no more report history ? Because come on, \"play to win\" isnt what you have to do to get out of it... Ive been trying to hard Riot..","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-13T22:15:33.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A 14 day is a Final Warning, so it may take a bit to get your honor up.  Getting honor means you're on the right track, so definitely keep it up.  Just be sure to be consistent, though, because having unsportsmanlike conduct in between can still slow down those gains.  Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Fpp Nyctelios","date":"2017-12-15T19:48:56.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guys... Final Warning ? What are you talking about ? I got reported in 2 games of being toxic -yes, i was really toxic-. BUT doesnt \"final\" warning require other warnings to have taken place ? I never got chat restricted, i never got any sort of ban before. I dont want to offend you in any way sir but i think the way your system works is wrong. I never got any other warning and dont remember being toxic ever before. Do you really think giving someone a 14day ban after 2 toxic games and then proceeding to keep him honor lvl 0 for that long is right ? I have so many games on LoL, and i got reported in only 2 of them. Is that what i truly deserve ? And i dont really mind about my honor being level 0, but this doesnt allow me to participate to tournaments with my friends like everyone because of 2 games. I dont think i deserve this punishment, i seriously dont.","replies":[]}]}]}
