I last changed the password like a year ago or so, I remember some previous passwords to the account if that helps at all. I don't remember if league accounts use security questions or recovery emails but if they do I can do that. If any more proof is needed just ask and I'll provide what I have","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-16T02:30:23.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as you can remember some key information about some of that account's activity (not including passwords, any hacker might be able to figure that out as well) we should be able to help you get back in that smurf!
