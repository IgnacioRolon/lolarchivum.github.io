There are a lot of files and software packages League relies on that are located outside of the League directory. In order to access and interact with these files and packages, League requires proper system permissions. Our [permissions guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) will provide some good starting steps to ensure that League can run. \n\nLet me know if this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Àley Oop","date":"2016-08-01T02:55:10.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fixed all of the systems permission and it still didnt work, I tried downloading and running as an administrator and still nothing.
