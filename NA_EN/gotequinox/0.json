I dont see a point in using them if it doesn’t help you get better. Anyways, a few weeks ago i was perma-banned from league due to “the use of 3rd party software/exploits”. \r\n\r\nI have an idea as to why they might have seen this as possible but i don’t think i would’ve gotten banned since they have the tools to look into games and logs.\r\n\r\n So here she my idea, i’m playing ezreal in The Rift. I see Ashe backing off to recall. She goes in the fog of war and i count and predict her recall. I ult on their fountain and i kill her. i thought it was the coolest thing ever since i’ve only seen it in montages. After that little celebration i boasted and typed into all-chat something along the lines of “haha got you Ashe.” I can see how they may think “i was exploiting” (-Riot support) given the circumstances and my response. But like i said, they can check the logs. Unfortunately they have, and for some reason i’ve been banned.\r\n\r\nI wrote this because i wanted to let people know. They also won’t  tell me what game or even the date i was supposedly “exploiting” so that they can “protect the integrity of league” and “prevent the bypass of further exploits” I’m innocent. It doesn’t help my case to say that i don’t have proof i wasn’t exploiting, but i wish Riot could saythe same. Or at least show me some kind of evidence. I know it probably goes against their privacy policy or whatever but i don’t want to stay banned for absolutely no reason at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-06T22:28:39.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your best bet would be to bring this up to a PB specialist in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) though it sounds like you already made a ticket.  I don't have the tools or resources to look into this for you personally, and it would be up to them to consider your appeal.  We would overturn a suspension if it was a mistake, though.  PB won't offer specifics because our risk team doesn't want to risk giving hints towards those who are working to circumvent or find ways to make their exploits undetectable.  Keep chatting with your specialist if you have anymore concerns or questions.","replies":[{"poster":"GotEquinox","date":"2018-01-13T00:25:21.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I didn't tell them the full story like i did here, but do you think it might help if i do? I honestly just want my account back. I'm sure anyone would be frustrated if they were going through what i am. I'll most definitely re-submit another ticket if this extra information may work as a crutch to help me get the account back. If not then i guess i gotta go smurfing :( Thank you for your response, mine is late because i didnt read it until just now haha.","replies":[]}]}]}
