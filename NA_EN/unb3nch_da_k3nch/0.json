I find it very annoying that to do most \"missions\" we need to use specific summoner icons to get experience for it. I understand being apart of the experience etc. but we have missions up most of the time that require us to equip a random icon. I had thought that the icons were originally supposed to be a way of expressing ourselves and this takes away from that. I find it frustrating that I cant have an icon of my choosing (lets say to match my friends), play games of league, and NOT get the missions completed as well, even though I complete the objectives. It seems as though I have had my icon forced on me for a while. I was wondering if there was any way to get this resolved. \r\n\r\nI'm sorry that I ranted about this but I just feel very strongly about this. Thanks for your time.{{champion:223}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-27T21:22:13.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problems with feeling strongly about something you enjoy! I can understand why you'd want to avoid being pushed into a certain icon choice just to take part in an event for free stuff, but you should voice feedback like this over in Client Discussion or Gameplay to make sure others can find it and chime in. That'll get a lot more visibility to your post as well!","replies":[]}]}
