The masterful application of force is what matters, not the aesthetic.\n\nRight, but swordsman implies the use of swords and has nothing to do with punching; I'd say your example is reversed. A good swordsman might occasionally punch someone where applicable and that doesn't necessarily make him a worse swordsman but if two swordsman walk into a ring and one of them has to forgo the sword and punch the other to win, you could look at that as they are a better fighter but a worse swordsman. And to bring it more on point, it would be more like a swordsman steps into a ring with a mechanical arm built to enable his sword fighting if we were talking about Qiyana needing a weapon to use/channel her elemental powers. As soon as that swordsman walks into the ring without his mechanical arm he is toast in the same way Qiyana walking into the ring without her blade against an elementalist who doesn't need a focus is toast. Granted it doesn't say anywhere that she needs the hoop or that it enables her in any way and this is all just a theoretical based on the theoretical that they worked some kind of that aspect into her lore to tie the hoop into it.\n\n> If for some reason you can craft tools to amplify your powers, you're no lesser an elementalist, just a smart one who takes every edge.\n\nThis is all perspective. It's a pretty classic trope to have magic users clash over these differing perspectives on what makes a greater or lesser practitioner. If you have a toy and can beat me in a fight with it but I can beat you in a fight if you dont have it who is greater and who is lesser?\n\nNow the style thing I actually agree on, the hoola hoop is a great way to drama queen as far as I can tell, but that still doesn't explain why she isnt an \"elementalist with a bunch of elementalist abilities that just happens to also have a hoola hoop for show\" as opposed to an \"elementalist with a bunch of hoola hoop abilities that just happens to also do some elementalist stuff.\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hemulen Magi","date":"2019-06-10T14:39:27.440+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I thought it was odd.
