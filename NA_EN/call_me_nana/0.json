I code very seldom, but when I do it's mostly to tinker with XML/SQL/RAML/Java/Perl/Javascript and such. Lots of web-focused languages and some static languages. \n\nMy main mission though is more around business technology strategy for Talent and supporting our key systems that keep the lights on - stuff like your HRIS, Payroll, Comp, and so on. I also work with our infrastructure engineers to explain what data we have, the process in place and how that gets surfaced through API's and consumed by our other internal intranet applications. \n\nIt's pretty cool because it's a pretty young company with a LOT of talented people who are building the unique, quality of life applications that help make Riot an awesome place to work.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2017-06-20T06:56:42.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see.

Relax.\n> \n> I&#x27;m pretty sure if it was that simple, he would be replaced with the machine i was comparing it to.\n\nIn theory, I'm the person that is replacing the manual tasks with technology. My best suggestion in these times is to be the person who knows and empathizes with the work so you know how to be a solutions architect (which is probably the closest title I can think of as to what I actually do). I translate functional and technical need into an actionable plan with our systems team, and then help deliver the solutions and support it as need arises.\n\nOne could argue that that is a typical IT Engineer's responsibilities, and you'd be absolutely right. Talent systems solutions vary from company to company - sometimes it falls under IT and sometimes it falls under HR/Talent. I make the argument that having it fall under Talent sets the team up for success much better, since you are working directly with your customers - those that are using your solutions and the best points for your feedback loop. The closer you are to the problems, the better you'll be able to design solutions for them.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2017-06-21T00:19:29.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**At Riot Fenyx's oath**\n\n\"I am the Admin in the dark.
