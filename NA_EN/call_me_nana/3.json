Therefore if she refreshes it fully she can spend 10 seconds out of every 13.6 seconds in shroud (cooldown is 7 + 6.6, duration is 7 + 3).\n\nThat's 73.5% of the time.  Granted, she's not going to have her shroud at rank 5 all game or have 40% CDR all game, but that's still about 3/4 of the time she can spend in her shroud.","replies":[{"poster":"hrooza dota ","date":"2018-09-10T23:30:15.582+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"im pretty sure the duration is set to 8 sec max at all levels","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Trias000","date":"2018-09-10T08:23:35.256+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Paroe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0MbFZKF5,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-09-10T03:27:43.703+0000)\n>\n> Why are you bitching about it anyway, when the previous iteration of it got next to no complaints\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Terozu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0MbFZKF5,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-09-10T03:58:24.251+0000)\n>\n> \n> Beyond turrets not making her targetable her shroud acts the exact same as it did prior to her rework.
