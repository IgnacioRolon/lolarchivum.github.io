MMR is more fluid than rank - someone performing badly will lose a *lot* of MMR in a dozen or two games, while their rank will not fall as much in the same time. This is to provide the rank a buffer zone for bad days/weeks or off champions/etc.\n\nThe hidden MMR of that player may very well have been lower than Gold 1, and the hidden MMR of OP been higher than silver 1.","replies":[]}]}]}
