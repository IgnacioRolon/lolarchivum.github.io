Ultimate Hat STILL has the problem of scaling terribly and the condition to fill it has actually gotten harder arguably. Let's use Ekko as an example. Ekko ult starts at 110 seconds. Ultimate Hat takes off a little less than 6 seconds for your first ultimate. Let's move ahead to a game you are probably pretty ahead. Level 11-16 with a fully stacked ultimate hat and 20% CDR (proto+lich). CDR drops your ult down from 90 to 72. Ultimate hat (which is multiplicative) drops it down to 61.2 seconds. 11 seconds off (this number is only just under 4 seconds if you are 0/0/0 at this point of CDR). How many times in a game have you NEEDED your ultimate and couldn't wait 11 seconds? Even in a scenario where you are grouping later on you are GOING to want to wait for the longest ult cooldown on your team like your Malphite's ultimate or your Leona ult or Janna ult or whatever making that time reduction useless there.\n\nAlso, btw at full build (30% CDR) and full stacks you lose less 7 seconds on your ulti again (49 to 41.65). The only assassins I could see MAYBE taking this are Kayn and Zed because they are looking for picks all game and can make plays with their ultimates due to how proactive they are. On the other hand, SA Kayn gives up A LOT of movement speed from Relentless Hunter in taking Ultimate Hat which is a main reason he gets kills in the first place and Zed might just take it if he doesn't feel like roaming and is fine with being at 1/5 for a majority of the game until bot lane leaks and comes to mid inevitably.","replies":[{"poster":"Steelflame","date":"2018-05-09T20:14:32.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kayn generally won't bother with Relentless Hunter because the insane sustain from Ravenous Hunter really buffs up his early game brawling, and lets him bypass worrying about sustain all game.   Relentless is more valuable if you don't have a lot of other sources of MS going, but Kayn's E and Ghostblade are enough to mean Relentless is well above the second MS soft-cap, doing little to nothing.\n\nMeanwhile, Kayn also doesn't care about his ult CD as much as many other champs.  His ult isn't the majority of his damage, but his Q and W are.   The main value of his ult is the utility of it, but that utility isn't essencial, because Kayn can beat out the 100% damage to kill a person without ult even every coming into play if ahead.  Rhaast may like it though, as his ult is a bit more crucial to his playstyle for the massive heal, but then it comes at the cost of not having Relentless Hunter, which considering Rhaast won't have Ghostblade or the buffed SA E MS, does significantly cut down on his wall distances.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2018-05-08T16:41:27.144+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have they decided what line they're putting it on?
