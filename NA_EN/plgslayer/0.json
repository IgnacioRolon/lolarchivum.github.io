I&#039;m getting very frustrated having to wait for dodging q&#039;s when in all reality I&#039;m not trying to. I would really love an answer as to how to fix this b4 I get banned for dodging to many times. And yes I have tried to delete and redownload the game.

I am also playing on a new computer, but when I get into a champ select don't choose my champion cuz ive instantly been kicked out due to this issue you'd think riot would question what is going on b4 throwing a 15 minute wait timer on me for me and my friends to suffer through who are also aware of this reoccurring issue. This is really upsetting my gameplay, I will try the repair tool and see how things go. Next time ill be uploading photos of this \"bug\"","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-10T18:07:38.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All the server can see is that you disconnected, and all the client can do is give a bug report.\n\nThe server cant trust the client to tell it that you disconnected due to situations beyond your control - if it did, every kiddie hacker would just spoof it to freely disconnect without any penalties whenever they want.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
