The original still had a dark background with a rainbow square border... It got changed to the circle after one of the patches. It's had 3 different versions. The bright rainbow one is not the one I bought the bundle for either, so I'm kind of irritated. They did the same thing to the rainbow star icon too :| Stop changing icons people paid for. It's really shitty. ","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-18T03:00:46.164+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"I.....I didn't say the circle was the original one o_O?

That was not how it was advertised in the bundle, and it's not what people paid for during the event. The image in the opening post is what the icon looked like during the event. After the event, it was changed to be a circle (due to a bug) without any border. Afterwards, it was changed to the bright version we have now. \n\nA lot of people bought the bundle specifically for that icon, since there was no other way to obtain it. It's fine if the rainbow was the way it was meant to look, but it feels horrible to buy one product to have it switched for another, particularly if you preferred the previous version. This happened with the star icon too.\n\nI don't mean to be mean about it, but it sucks paying for one thing and then getting something else.

If my post comes across that way I apologize. But as a customer, I think it sucks that the product was switched out. I'm not petty enough to file a ticket asking for my 15 dollars back (and I know they wouldn't anyways), but I do think the OP's request that both versions be granted to those who purchased the bundle is more than fair. The icon is already made. All you'd have to do is grant it to those who purchased the bundle. Don't really see why that is an unfair request at all. \n\nAdditionally most people interpreted the \"accidental\" change as the icon being made to be a circle, which was the second version of the icon. Which means the icon had 2 accidental versions before this third version.\n\nEdit: For reference, this is what the bugged icon looked like \nhttps://i.imgur.com/TYrD5CB.jpg","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2017-09-18T04:14:13.010+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look, this is dumb in my personal opinion.
