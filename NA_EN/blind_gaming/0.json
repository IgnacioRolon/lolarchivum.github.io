And the arguably disaster in the name of Trump is a clear example of what happens when a president is someone who can only think entirely in \"big money cash money I win you lose\" terms.\n\nClinton was not elected because of 2 reasons: Successful campaign in Trump's part, and Clinton's bad PR from past policy failures as well as recent political crisis. Not because she is a female or supposedly having menopause.\n\n\"Facts\" means very little if it's either just flat out wrong, it's completely undigested, or that you can't keep it relevant to what you're even talking about. If you are going to say this restaurant is bad because your computer maybe has a black casing, which can be true, but it means fking nothing and your reasoning is something worse than poor.\n\nAnd probably because your reasoning capability is like this, you wonder why a gaming forum dedicated to 1 particular game does not allow political arguments.\n\nPolitical arguments really is easily the most brain-dead section of all discussion online, because usually only the most ignorant, and/or most hateful, and/or the most biased people actually and actively participate in such events. No one wants that shit here, at least not without as some kind of random joke or a very small-scale discussion, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Blind Gaming","date":"2017-05-23T10:46:36.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact is it does take a ridiculous amount of time to pick up my file and slap approve or denied on it.

I fo not care about the words my wife and children use. I do care about my wife and children. Which word they use to convey any message to me or someone else is of no consequence. I don't even care if my kid uses a curse word. Why you may ask? because if the word is used correctly that's all that matters, not the word used. When your young you're taught certain words are bad while others are not. I believe some old fat guy decided he dont like certain words a long time ago. He then told his children not to use them and others fallowed suit. If you were never told said words were bad, you would never consider them to be as such. It is the sheer lack of wisdom people lack today that allow for such stupid things to take place in our world, like banning people for using certain words in a game. Most people lack the wisdom because they only know what they are taught. I did not have such a luxury growing up as my parents didn't even raise me. I raised myself and therefore taught myself to look at everything objectively and without traditional biases such as words being \"bad\". If you truly believe a word can be bad, please explain to me how this is possible, if not then stfu......I dont care to argue with people of feeble intelligence. \n    I've always been this way though. I have the mentality of: If I don't know you, I don't care about you. This held true with 9/11. I even laughed that day in school as I seen it on the tv and said \"HA, it was a demolition and an inside job.\". Meanwhile my classmates and teachers were all crying and I just couldn't understand why. I take no offense to any words of someone whom I don't know. Why should I? I merely like to participate in the apparent role playing being done within the match.\n    I dont believe a game company should be allowed to take advantage of their customers by banning an account that people have worked hard on and even put money into. I believe if they do ban them, then they should have to pay them back for every dollar spent. They should also have to pay them minimum wage for every hour played on the banned account.\n    I simply made a post about 9/11 and what I believed to be the truth and why. It was posted in the general discussions section, I thought that to be a suiting place for it. It was rather long and took me roughly 30 minutes to type it up and had several supporting facts for my beliefs.\n  ","replies":[{"poster":"Psyrix","date":"2017-05-23T09:50:22.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yet despite what you have said about words (to which i do slightly agree about btw) you are aware of the context in which certain words are used and the consequences of them.
