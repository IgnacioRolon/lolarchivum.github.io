I was looking at the LoL website for prepaid cards, and only $10 cards from Gamestop are accepted. Is the site outdated, or do you truly not accept $5 cards?","replies":[{"poster":"Saturnalia9","date":"2016-10-11T15:07:28.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Microsoft Rewards offers a $5 Gamestop Gift Card, and I had been wondering if Riot accepted those or not. The rewards system doesn't have an option for a $10 Gamestop Gift Card either, so apparently that's just not an option at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T03:10:42.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you may be referencing **Openbucks**, where you can exchange certain gift cards for RP. If so, it doesn't look like Gamestop is a card that's used in this system at the moment. Check out the [Openbucks FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201753254-Cash-and-Gift-Cards-Openbucks-) for more details on this system.\n\nIf you're just meaning Prepaid RP Cards, $10 is the minimum amount for these, so you cannot purchase a prepaid card for the $5 you currently have on your Gamestop card. I hope this clears up the confusion. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-10-10T06:43:43.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are no 5$ prepaid cards in LoL.
