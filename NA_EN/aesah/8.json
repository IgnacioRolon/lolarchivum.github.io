Welcome to Patch Chat, a Dev Corner thread we make to talk about our new patches every two weeks: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-71-notes . **Keep in mind that this is for discussing the current patch, not future content (e.g., Warwick)**\n\nI&#039;m Aesah on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of Diamond+ players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to LoL in terms of both balance and fun. We&#039;ll be watching this thread to answer as many questions as we can.\n\nIn 7.1, we&#039;re toning down how much agency junglers currently have over the game through decreasing the amount of experience they gain from the jungle. Some champions who have been overperforming that are receiving notable nerfs include Syndra, Ryze, Shyvana, Poppy, and Camille. Meanwhile, on the opposite end of the spectrum, we&#039;re buffing Draven, Kalista, Lucian, and Talon. The only item changed in this patch is the Zz&#039;rot Portal, which is getting a reduced range to discourage leaving it alone far away in the back and forgetting about it. There is still a lot of work to be done but these some first steps to delivering an excellent Season 7 experience!\n\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\n\nAdam &quot;Afic&quot; Cohen\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\nNicolas &ldquo;Gleeb&rdquo; Haddad\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\nBao &ldquo;Bao&rdquo; Lam\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes","replies":[{"poster":"TGDE Cobra","date":"2017-01-11T23:43:17.959+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"wtf votre mise a jour eest vrm long .. sa reste sure le 100% .. la je suis tann√© sa fait 1 heures que j'attend","replies":[{"poster":"playtestpenguin","date":"2017-01-11T23:45:18.891+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":0,"body":"wat","replies":[{"poster":"bony whimsark","date":"2017-01-12T00:45:53.564+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"so I got a 90 in grade 9 french, I am probably qualified for this job.\n\"wtf your *something* a day is *something* long.. the rest is 100%.. the I am *something* it is 1 hour.\"\nI guess he's concerned about something by long I guess???","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-01-12T01:01:09.602+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"Close^^\n\nI'm more than certain he's saying:\n\"WTF your update today is really long... it just stays at 100%...right now I'm fed up, I've been waiting for an hour.\"\n\nThe pbe had an update today, and what happens is they send out the patch files then lock it while they test stuff internally and make sure it went out/is working properly.
