Welcome to Patch Chat, a Dev Corner thread we make to talk about our new patches every two weeks: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-76-notes\n\nI&#039;m Aesah on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of Diamond+ players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to LoL in terms of both balance and fun. We&#039;ll be watching this thread to answer as many questions as we can.\n\nApart from the long-awaited Galio rework, 7.6 is a relatively smaller patch. Warlord&#039;s Bloodlust has been rebalanced to be better against tanks. Some champions that recieved buffs include Aatrox, Fiddlesticks, Cho&#039;gath, Gnar, Varus and Miss Fortune while on the other end Quinn was nerfed. \n\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\n\nAdam &quot;Afic&quot; Cohen\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\nNicolas &ldquo;Gleeb&rdquo; Haddad\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\nArnor &quot;TheLastAirbender&quot; Halldorsson","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-03-22T20:29:15.762+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm just wondering if you think any Supports are needing any changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2017-03-22T20:31:38.230+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":12,"body":"pls change it so that the lulus on my team stop feeding. \n:T","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2017-03-22T23:26:00.276+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry it's hard coded into our software that any Lulu players on Marshbouy's team will feed","replies":[{"poster":"GollGarr","date":"2017-03-23T02:26:41.993+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha{{item:3751}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2017-03-22T21:56:18.451+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.

If supports become a target for rework you should definately work on hitting the generalist enchanters that are splashable and work on giving them distinctive playstyles . Heals and Shields (while extremely powerful and game changing) tend to not be all that interesting from a gameplay perspective. Why would you sign up to be the equivalent of a babysitting healbot priest when you could be so much more?\n\ntl;dr come support update time please try to focus on Enchanters and their Items. Hopefully we see some crazy shit like {{champion:37}}  becoming a support specifically synergistic with AP champions rather than AD or maybe {{champion:117}} Hugify working like a temporary mini-ascension.","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2017-03-22T23:27:28.339+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well not everyone enjoys LoL the same way, some people like being a healer.

How many damage characters are too many? and how many tanks are too many? how many are just enough? also just because someone can heal due to items and masteries doesn't mean much. You really are complaining because the game has a very small amount of dedicated healer champions? in a game with over 120 champions? People like different playstyles, some like to roam, some like to be tanks, some like to splitpush to no end, some like to heal, some like to peel, some like do insane damage. There is never \"too many\" of a certain role as long as those champions in that role do something relatively unique from each other. Whether that means having something the others don't, or being more of a generalist than the others, or just specializing in something the others don't. Champions don't need 100% unique kits, you can make champions with almost identical kits but just having one aspect while the other on another aspect will make it distinct enough.\n\nI personally enjoy playing healers and a lot of people who play and main support also enjoy playing them and all of them kit wise are very distinct. Items on the other hand are something that seriously needs to be looked at so that supports don't build the exact same thing regardless of whether they are a healer, peeler, frontliner, etc etc","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2017-03-22T20:32:50.233+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know you guys can't give details but how are you liking the new sejuani maokai and zac?

I was surprised to find that this isn't the case: you seem to fly to whatever position the ally was when you *initially* targeted the ability from outside the cast range, even if you and they have both walked halfway across the map to get there. This seems potentially awful in situations where a Galio is trying to take the shortest route to save an ally and has simply hit the button and then shifted to watch the developing fight, hoping he gets there in time. It's very unexpected, especially since they don't gain the defenses until you're in range, suggesting that the spell hasn't actually been cast.\n\nIs this intentional behavior? Because it feels REALLY off, and I'm curious if you encountered this in playtesting.\n\n...although I'm sure you can do some crazy plays with this if you plan for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2017-03-22T21:54:23.816+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"That just sounds like a bug to me, will look into it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Butler Delta","date":"2017-03-22T21:06:45.834+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who is the best member of the playtest team and why is it King Cobra?","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2017-03-22T21:55:27.230+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"the best member of the playtest team is King Cobra because he's adorable","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Doonyster","date":"2017-03-22T23:31:33.094+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have any of the play test members played {{champion:45}} lately?\n\n His E delays the stun if the opponent does a lock on dash (Ex. {{champion:24}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:12}} ) to a champion that is inside of his event Horizon.
