Welcome to Patch Chat, a Dev Corner thread we make to talk about our new patches every two weeks: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-618-notes\n\nI&#039;m Aesah on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of Diamond+ players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to LoL in terms of both balance and fun. We&#039;ll be watching this thread to answer as many questions as we can.\n\nWhile we always keep normal and ranked games in mind for balance (e.g., the terror of tank Yasuo is getting hit here), 6.18 is the patch that Worlds will be played on so we&#039;re focusing a bit more on competitive play for this one. First  off, a few champions who&#039;ve fallen a bit behind in the meta have gotten some minor buffs (Lux, Nocturne, Miss Fortune, and Lee Sin). Primarily though, we&#039;re nerfing several champions that have caused pros to dismiss other options due to their just-a-bit-too-high power levels. Notable champions that received varying degrees of nerfs based on how overbearing their presence was include Ashe, Ekko, Gnar, Lissandra, Reksai, Taliyah, Shen, and Vladimir. We&#039;re expecting that tuning down these staples of competitive play will cause an increase in champion diversity while not completing butchering their viability in both competitive play as well as normal/ranked games.\n\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\n\nAdam &quot;Afic&quot; Cohen\nPreston &ldquo;Hinderaga&rdquo; Bunker\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\nShawn &ldquo;I Am The IRS&rdquo; Currie\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\nNicolas &ldquo;Gleeb&rdquo; Haddad\nDan &ldquo;Penguin&rdquo; Hardison\nMiles &ldquo;Daydreamin&rdquo; Hoard\nBao &ldquo;Bao&rdquo; Lam\nRobert &ldquo;RobertxLee&rdquo; Lee\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes","replies":[{"poster":"Clint Orris","date":"2016-09-08T19:37:55.903+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":14,"body":"Yasuo still isn't deleted sooo what else is there really to talk about","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2016-09-08T20:39:15.327+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":4,"body":"deleting teemo","replies":[{"poster":"The Red Goat","date":"2016-09-08T22:15:57.472+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I've got a question in regards to champions like Yasuo. By which I mean snowball reliant champions, of which I feel we're getting too many of them lately. I understand League is the kind of game that can change and grow by leaps and bounds over time, but I've started to see a very unhealthy trend where basically every game has at least 2 or 3 players using champions that can snowball of of even a single kill or the lack of a death. Yasuo is really only one example of this, but I can also reference Rengar, Zed, Ekko, Jax, Xin Hao, Darius, Fizz (one of the worst when it comes to this I've found), and several adc champs even like Lucian, Caitlynn, and Jinx as of late.\n\nMy question about all of this though is more or less just whether anyone at Riot might also be seeing this trend. Where the types of champs mentioned above get any kind of kill in one lane, and proceed to get a string of kills afterwards just because of that one. Putting them at \"Raid mode\" levels of unbalanced power creep. Another more vivid example of what I mean would be how Ekko, a champs designed to be a glass cannon-esk assassin, became a tanky mage bruiser for his standard playstyle. He was played tanky, yet he still slaughtered players that were supposedly evenly matched in level and items. To me, that level of power shouldn't really exist on many champions, because that kind of playstyle doesn't actually have counter-play. You just have to hope you can avoid that champion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Diminish","date":"2016-09-08T19:36:53.625+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi!\n\nFor full context on my response to the recent changes to Master/Challenger decays, [please check this thread out.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/E4mkbreZ-meddler-can-we-talk-about-master-tier-for-a-minute)\n\nWith the most recent patch, Challenger and Master players now have to commit more time than ever to maintain their rank.\n\nUnfortunately however, Master players are not recognized for competing and maintaining a high LP count throughout the season. A Master 400 LP player, who plays one game every day to maintain their rank, will receive the same end of season rewards as a Master 0 LP player who sat in diamond 1 all season to avoid the decay mechanics, and popped into Master a week before the season ends.\n\nWill you guys consider tiered rewards for Master, similar to how Challengers receive tiered rewards based on their placement? This would encourage healthy competition and a more reachable goal for low/mid Master players, and recognize the skill difference of 0LP and 400 LP Master players.\n\nIn a perfect world, I'd love to see physical rewards for Master players who reach a certain unannounced LP threshold, but that's totally up to you guys. In any case, please either reward Master players for reaching the higher ends of the tier, or relax the restrictions on Master tier.\n\nThanks for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2016-09-08T20:37:46.905+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Although this is something we (playtest team) haven't worked on, I can pass this concern along to the more relevant people.  \n\nYour concerns definitely seem valid to me, so hopefully the team working on that feature will be able to find a solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Diminish","date":"2016-09-08T21:02:25.106+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually have a question about gameplay, support item builds specifically.

This could be one of the changes that starts the addressing of how much mobility creep League has accumulated over time beyond the grounding effects recently introduced.","replies":[{"poster":"Cezium","date":"2016-09-10T20:38:15.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assassins and burst mages are pretty similar classes, with assassins generally having more mobility and burst mages not. Ahri is kind of a weird case because of the mobility inherent in her ult, but a general (short of Q) lack of mobility outside of it. The charm amp was... tough to work with just because it put so much power into one basic ability. I don't think that's great because her ability to find success or failure depends entirely on that one skill and none of her other skills mean much. There are other ways we can look at her thouh, although I'm not much of an Ahri expert so I don't think I have too many thoughts on her.\n\nNo, we're definitely aware of how powerful mobility is. We've worked on finding ways to counteract mobility (like grounding on Cass's W) to releasing champions that generally don't have dashes/blinks (mainly just movespeed increases). Trust me, our design teams are pretty aware of it, but to be fair it's just fun to be super fast. Everyone loves running around and jumping everywhere. There's a reason Lee Sin and Yasuo are so popular, and things like Jinx's passive are considered cool. I'm not one of those people (gimme those static juggernauts like Garen or Illaoi all day), and I feel like those champions without mobility are generally given a lot of power elsewhere to make up for it.\n\nAll of this is to say we are aware of how much mobility is in the game and it's definitely something our design teams consider (at least in my experience).","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2016-09-10T20:54:20.920+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">The charm amp was... tough to work with just because it put so much power into one basic ability.

You were punished for missing your skillshots and rewarded for patience, which also sounds like a healthy trade off.  Besides, DFG isn't in the game anymore for her to synergize with so the fear of the double-amp coming back should already be alleviated. \n\n>All of this is to say we are aware of how much mobility is in the game and it's definitely something our design teams consider (at least in my experience).\n\nThis was also said two years ago...right before **_Kalista_** was released...and then balancing and reworks came later where mobility was prioritized and / or _protected,_ thus adding to the mobility creep.

To be honest, though, I don't see nearly as many people complaining about Ahri that I used to see before I worked here, even given the high win/play rates. That says to me at least that something was probably done right.\n\nThat's fair too. I'm obviously not a part of the design teams and I can't make them eliminate all mobility from the game. For the most part, I feel like we're getting better. What was the last champion we released with a dash/blink? Kled I guess? Before that? Ekko/Kindred? And that doesn't count any of the reworks where generally speaking we've tuned up the less mobile champions like juggernauts and immobile mages to make them feel more rewarding.\n\nI get the sentiment though. It does feel like there is so much mobile bullshit out there and it can be really frustrating. I hate Ekko and Fizz and Yasuo.

I honestly don't have much context on Kalista because I started pretty far after her release, but I'd guess her passive was generally considered the more core part of her gameplay and so that's what we stuck with. I wouldn't really say Azir's problem stem from the range/mobility of his E at all.\n\nI personally generally like Juggernauts, although I think we sometimes give them too much. They are on the classes that I think are most clearly defined (lots of raw health and damage, very low cc and mobility). This does lead to issues where basically most of their gameplay is stat checking people (well I do X damage per second and you do Y damage per second and I have more health so... I win.). Yeah, they generally are compensating for the lack of mobility, but that's true for anything without mobility.

How about Yasuo and fizz? They seem a lil too strong still, esp when they build tank. \n\nAnd context on Shen nerfs?? Cmon guys I know he is really OP in the correct hands but in low elo he gets wrecked a lot. He def needs some buffs , instead of nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"Cezium","date":"2016-09-08T22:55:36.031+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"For MF, I like building Cleaver and other flat armour pen items like Ghostblade and Duskblade.\n\nFor Nocturne, that was definitely something we were a little worried about. The increased CC duration makes the fear pretty long and it could have some pretty negative effects on solo queue. The hope is that the changes do make Nocturne a little more powerful without completely destroying solo queue.\n\nFor Nocturne, it's mostly just flat armour pen items as well. I like Ghostblade and Duskblade, much like a lot of other AD assassins.\n\nYasuo got some nerfs as well. Fizz isn't overly strong at the moment I believe, although I agree he's very frustrating. Definitely my go to ban if Ekko and Yasuo are already banned.","replies":[]}]}]}
