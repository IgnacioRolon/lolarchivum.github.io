Welcome to Patch Chat, a Dev Corner thread we make to talk about our new patches every two weeks: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-72-notes \r\n\r\nI&#039;m Aesah on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of Diamond+ players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to LoL in terms of both balance and fun. We&#039;ll be watching this thread to answer as many questions as we can.\r\n\r\nThe big change we&#039;re looking forward to (well some of us, anyway) in 7.2 is the Warwick update. Warwick is a juggernaut/diver who we expect to shine primarily in the jungle. Underperforming champions that received buffs include Akali (slightly overcompensating Gunblade nerf), Gragas, Graves, Lulu, Master Yi, and Nidalee. On the other hand, Darius, Katarina, and Yasuo received nerfs to bring their power more in line with the rest of the cast. For items, Lethality as well as Duskblade and Edge of Night have been buffed to be more enticing to some of the struggling AD assassins. Support items have been slightly rebalanced (Redemption was crowding out other options). Gunblade&#039;s active component was nerfed as well.\r\n\r\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\r\n\r\nAdam &quot;Afic&quot; Cohen\r\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\r\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\r\nNicolas &ldquo;Gleeb&rdquo; Haddad\r\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\r\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\r\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\r\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\r\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\r\nArnor &quot;TheLastAirbender&quot; Halldorsson","replies":[{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2017-01-25T21:23:51.367+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"What on earth was the team thinking with the camp damage changes. Yea sure it will hurt the top end junglers so that they aren't as enter lane->murder->return to full clear, there are A LOT  of junglers that are in a poor to even non viable spot even before 7.2 and this will just hammer down the discrepancy. \n\nAatrox gets honerable mention for the issues he has been having for way too long but at least that has been recognized and hopefully the team is working on something. \n\nFiddle has been a very poor jungler thanks to the camp changes specifically and the recent change to him really only made his lane ability more viable as a support/mid champ, either fix his jungling or do a reverse of what you did to nid and push him completely out of the jungle. \n\nI don't even think fizz or ekko are even viable at all as junglers anymore, they aren't even niche picks anymore they are flat out non viable. \n\nKindred, the marksman made very specifically for the jungle is outperformed by every other marksman that can jungle and unlike them kindred doesn't have the option to go into lane at all, since it is flat out unviable. The excuse of the ult giving kindred something unique to offer isn't even a good one, bard, taric, kayle, and zilean offer similar niches to varying degree's and also benefit for not being useless for the rest of their kits.\n\nNid's buff is counterproductive with the amount of increased damage that will be received.\n\nthere are many others. how did a change like that go through without thinking outside of the one who will be toned down but instead will just be absolutely screwed over.

IE: the faster you clear the camp, the less XP given directly on first monster kill and the more small monsters appearing  in the camp giving in total same amount of XP, this way junglers who are too fast need to stay in the camp longer to get the XP and champions who suffer from jungling will have more chance to succeed by getting the same XP killing less monsters in the same amount of time.

I miss the days of DFG katarina or LB one shotting people.\n\nWell yes, that's because DFG was an abomination that should have never existed. The time you're talking about is an outlier though, season 3 was when tanks were basically unplayable and assassins were straight up retarded. I also consider S3 to be one of the worst seasons I've ever played, S2 was vastly superior and even with the Lee Sin every game fuckery in S4 it was still better. If you compare anything at all to S3 it's going to be low damage.\n\n>So personally I'm not feeling this damage creep the same way you are explaining it.\n\nWhen people talk about damage creep they're talking insane amount of damage all champs (including tanks) can get from the mastery trees. It's why assassins like Lebroken and Slutface are running around oneshotting everything in existence and why tanks like Poppy get such absurdly high damage output. They get, for no real investment a straight 5% increase in damage mastery.\n\n>Edit:\nWant to throw in that I am the assassin player on the team. My views here are not all of my teammates, I would actually be surprised if they did not disagree with me. They are just my thoughts as a player of the game.\n\nI still don't see your point, on average assassins are the most stupidly broken class right now. Champions like Katarina, Leblanc, Kha'zix and Rengar make the game a hellscape because of how absurd their burst is. Lethality also just got buffed so I'd be surprised if Zed and Talon don't join them in the pool of flat out retarded assassins.","replies":[{"poster":"CrimsonCobra3","date":"2017-02-03T00:10:02.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I still don&#x27;t see your point, on average assassins are the most stupidly broken class right now.

Or Katarina, if you're counting her as an assassin. I always thought of here as a [completely convoluted] melee burst aoe mage--like a battlemage, with no survivability. I extend the same concept to Fizz. And the only time I saw Akali was when she went tank top. However, now that assassins are good again, I see at least one a game on average. I know the update intended to give assassins diversity, and other means to win the game besides some linear 'run in, murder the adc, and run out' strategy, but to be honest, that's exactly what they're still good at. It's by far easier to kill the adc than anyone else, and if they can burst down anyone else in seconds then they're probably broken. (Or obscenely fed. Exception: full ap mages.) \n\nAll of that said, I think that's a problem with the class, not the update. The update just didn't fix it. I like the new thematics and playstyles of the updated assassins, I just think that they're still the classic assassin. Interestingly enough, I find playing other characters, with off-assassin kits, such as Wukong, Xin Zhao, Shaco (He's actually full assassin, but he's also weird), Jayce, Fiora, etc. to be fun, and usually a little more manageable. I'm not entirely sure why. (Most of those are Divers, my favorite class, but some are... not. (Shaco, Jayce.) NOTE: Jayce can be a pain.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2017-01-26T02:21:32.538+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot ThEntropist,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=pGVpHwMx,comment-id=00100000,timestamp=2017-01-26T00:25:21.061+0000)\n>\n> So personally I&#x27;m not feeling this damage creep the same way you are explaining it.\n\nThis comment makes me feel like I'm not playing the same game as you are.\n\nRight now, it feels like everyone deals so much damage that whoever strikes first tends to kill their opponent before they can do much (most specifically against squishies), and so reliability has become one of the most important things in the game.\nIf everyone can kill opponents quickly, then the one who can reliably land the first blow (e.g. with non-skillshot abilities) has a huge advantage, even if they technically deal less damage overall than a less-reliable champion.\n\nWith more damage flying around (combined with greatly reduced vision), it also means that jungle ganks tend to end up in kills much more often (again, especially against squishies), and that champions who are fragile and take a while to kill their opponents (such as ADCs) feel like they have much less agency because they are so easy to delete by tanky divers (who build tanky to avoid reprisals but get enough free damage to still eliminate a glasscannon quickly.)\n\nThe same also applies to glasscannon-vs-glasscannon interactions, where whoever has more reliable damage tends to make the other feel like there wasn't much that they could do.\n\n\nBasically, it feels bad to be a glasscannon damage dealer right now because everyone's damages have gone up so much that you die almost instantly, while the overall higher level of damage doesn't affect tanky champions quite as much because they are building defences while still dealing high damage - which usually makes them tough enough to survive that initial burst.","replies":[{"poster":"Skias","date":"2017-01-26T18:55:54.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nameless Voice,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=pGVpHwMx,comment-id=001000000002,timestamp=2017-01-26T02:21:32.538+0000)\n>\n> This comment makes me feel like I&#x27;m not playing the same game as you are.\n> \n> Right now, it feels like everyone deals so much damage that whoever strikes first tends to kill their opponent before they can do much (most specifically against squishies), and so reliability has become one of the most important things in the game.\n> If everyone can kill opponents quickly, then the one who can reliably land the first blow (e.g. with non-skillshot abilities) has a huge advantage, even if they technically deal less damage overall than a less-reliable champion.\n> \n> With more damage flying around (combined with greatly reduced vision), it also means that jungle ganks tend to end up in kills much more often (again, especially against squishies), and that champions who are fragile and take a while to kill their opponents (such as ADCs) feel like they have much less agency because they are so easy to delete by tanky divers (who build tanky to avoid reprisals but get enough free damage to still eliminate a glasscannon quickly.)\n> \n> The same also applies to glasscannon-vs-glasscannon interactions, where whoever has more reliable damage tends to make the other feel like there wasn&#x27;t much that they could do.\n> \n> \n> Basically, it feels bad to be a glasscannon damage dealer right now because everyone&#x27;s damages have gone up so much that you die almost instantly, while the overall higher level of damage doesn&#x27;t affect tanky champions quite as much because they are building defences while still dealing high damage - which usually makes them tough enough to survive that initial burst.\n\nI also feel this way.

It often feels like there is zero response to the extreme threat they offer, even with someone that is mostly utility like Taric. I've just plain stopped picking him bottom because I feel like I'm 100% ineffective. The slight MR increase hasn't felt like it made an impact. \n\nWill Riot reconsider giving Taric a small mana refund on Bravado against champions?

I mean, the charge up W was helping during gromp and drg. I didn't notice him being anything different the rest of the game. I think I saw the double strike change... twice?

Thanks for not hitting him too hard.\n I believe to further reduce cheese on his early laning, his W slow should scale with level into it- worse at early, better late? This way its less stressful for lane opponent that CANT fight him to go farm, not a death sentence. It also forces choice between E max and W max (after Q). I main this champion in low diamond elo, so im not just venting about him, but trying to reduce community frustration so his damage doesn't get nerfed again.
