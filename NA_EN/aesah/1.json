Welcome to Patch Chat, a Dev Corner thread we make to talk about our new patches every two weeks: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-623-notes\n\nI&#039;m Aesah on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of Diamond+ players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to LoL in terms of both balance and fun. We&#039;ll be watching this thread to answer as many questions as we can.\n\nWhile we&#039;re still waiting to see how the crazy updates in 6.22 shake out, but 6.23 brings some new interesting additions. The biggest one of note is Shyvana, who can now spit fireballs after ulting to play up her dragon fantasy. Anivia&#039;s control mage aspects are emphasized at the cost of some of her burst, while Malzahar&#039;s voidlings should have more clarity. Out fo the assassin update, Akali in particular was struggling and recieved some buffs. Shen recieved small defensive stat buffs as well. A few underused items in Blade of the Ruined King, Guinsoo&#039;s Rageblade, and Sterak&#039;s Gage were improved and will be a bit more appealing to champions that were considering them before. And of course, we&#039;re still working on improving the new client!\n\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\n\nAdam &quot;Afic&quot; Cohen\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\nNicolas &ldquo;Gleeb&rdquo; Haddad\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\nMiles &ldquo;Daydreamin&rdquo; Hoard\nBao &ldquo;Bao&rdquo; Lam\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes","replies":[{"poster":"Yuumi or Lose","date":"2016-11-25T17:19:02.834+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any thoughts on Heimerdinger?

Removal of MR aura on Aegis allows them to reliably burst low MR targets (such as ADCs) who aren't itemizing MR outside of runes and maybe a qss / hexdrinker later in their build.  \n\n2.  Many of the reworked assassins that often go mid lane, such as Talon, Katarina, and Akali, have low win rates as a result of either being undertuned in Akali's case or very difficult to play for champions like Katarina.  Players who have significant experience on AP mids benefit from going  against opponents who are not fully comfortable playing the newly reworked champions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yandere Yandere","date":"2016-11-25T19:05:11.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are your opinions on preseason so far?

I have seen a lot of ....sad people writing about the fact that her new passive gradually becomes quite useless, her damage taking too much time to deal and it's too little for an assassin. I am quite curious to what a diamond would think about all this for i have no idea x)\n\nBut for something that i have tried a bit more myself, shyvana.  I feel that she struggles with her W seeing that she must always choose if she wants mobility or damage. This because she lacks a non ultimate gap closer forcing her to use W to catch up to people she wants to gank but by the time she reaches them the W will be over leaving her with quite little damage.  Her current passive needs her to take 3 dragons or something in order to not be inferior to her previous passive and it seems quite strange. I personally enjoy playing shyvana but i find myself struggling a lot from when the enemy team is able to kite even shortly and the fact that i can't really pressure the enemy laners since they can run away before i can go near them. Her greatest virtue seems to be a relatively quick clearing speed and invades that rely on the enemy not warding their jungle since if she gets caught in there she will most likely die x)\n\nI cant but help to feel that shyvana's kit is a bit strange for a jungler. It seems more reasonable to play top but there are a lot that simply beat her silly 1v1, darius and fiora for two.  Any thoughts on all this? \n\nThanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2016-11-25T16:59:18.100+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Akali's new passive being useless only applies if you can't land two autoattacks, but given the increased reliability on W that seems fairly unlikely. We were definitely off-base on exactly how powerful the W would be though and released her too weak, hence buffs in 6.23. I expect this to be enough, but as someone with hundreds of Akali games myself, I'll be watching her closely to see if more are needed.\n\nAbout Shyvana I'm not an expert there but her new dragon E gives her additional power while she's being kited.","replies":[{"poster":"Hexten","date":"2016-11-26T03:06:40.736+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Akali is not in a state where number changes are going to fix her. She is having mechanical issues. Against competent opponents, they will not wait around Akali's shroud for her cooldowns, so shroud working is not as great as you would think it is. Especially given her dashing nature, her shroud doesn't follow with her hence it's not exactly working at full effect. Her shroud works if the opponent just sits in the shroud expecting to duel her one on one, but in practice, no competent player is going to do that. They will move away from shroud and kite.\n\nWhile Akali sits in shroud waiting for cooldowns for a second rotation, the target can move away from shroud since it's stationary. Hence Akali has to dash again inorder to stick onto the target but now she is forced out of her shroud and can't wait for her rotations anymore. if she stays in the shroud, the target just escapes out of her dash range, hence she cannot re-engage for a second rotation. This just seems counter-intuitive to her whole playstyle, which is to stick to targets. The ultimate range nerf also doesn't help with this as well. In earlier seasons, this shroud gameplay worked much better because she had better picking power with the original ultimate range in combination of her shroud. Given the original bursty nature of her ultimate, lowering the range to 700 made sense since it could be used to train a target down, R again and again and not spacing out R's to proc her Q's. But now since the bursty nature of her ultimate is removed, it makes more sense to space out her R's with triggering her Q's hence restoring the original ultimate range would help facilitate the intended playstyle much more better.\n\nAkali's winrate for both top and mid before the update was a solid ~50%. She is far weaker overall in all aspects kit wise. Again, as you said, shroud working doesn't make up how much power Akali lost as a result and the winrate shows this. \n\nAkali is now all about relying on triggering her Q and passive as her main source of damage, not her ultimate. Given the ultimate does negligible damage now compared to before, is there any point in the ultimate doing damage to begin with? Would it be better to completely shift off the damage of the ultimate and boost it's utility nature such as the range? This would give Akali the tools to achieve her intended playstyle of using R's to trigger Q's/passive. Keeping the damage on the ultimate doesn't help Akali do anything because R spamming doesn't work anymore, and it feels like it's leftover power that should be re-allocated somewhere else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nero of Vael","date":"2016-11-27T20:47:14.890+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Aesah,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=AfkzYAfg,comment-id=00080001,timestamp=2016-11-25T16:59:18.100+0000)\n>\n> About Shyvana I&#x27;m not an expert there but her new dragon E gives her additional power while she&#x27;s being kited.\n\nThis is only true while her ultimate- the longest cooldown she's got- is active. You want to fight as a dragon obviously but that option is not always available. Only being able to fight during a limited ult is a problem. I mentioned in an earlier post that we should somehow revisit our approach to her ultimate and passive and their relation to one another. I have an idea that involves something with taking dragons, once the third one is slain, her ultimate becomes a toggle. Don't get me wrong she still needs more on the way of defense given her kit style so perhaps the armor/mr values could be adjusted a tiny bit. Also, playing her in Twisted Treeline 3v3 was a nightmare. All her passive was good for is 5/5 armor/MR with no drake. That's a little ridiculous.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2016-11-25T12:53:04.552+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might still be early, but what's your thoughts on the assassin rework?

There's no reason to penalize Lux for being the same as them. Melee opponents will be stopped the same by anyone with a projectile CC attack- that's why you're supposed to bait it out.\n\n\n> Id like her E Lucent singularity to have its damage toned down but in its place its act as more of a scrying tool. \n\nHer E already is the lowest damaging, highest costing, and highest CD ability of the waveclear abilities of her class. In exchange it gets to be fairly reliable to land. \nAlso, Lux is a mage, not a support, her job is to CC an enemy then blow them up with her combo- just like any other burst mage, and to waveclear, like any other mage. This ability already is one of the most inferior waveclear abilities and you want to nerf it even further? \n\n\n> - Then sap like 5%-10% AP ratio from her other offensive skills Q,E and R and add it to Illuminations ratio.\n-Lux's auto attacks no longer activate illumination instead only her abilities (and the damaging abilities of Allies)do.\n-the Illumination mark now takes 1.5 second to arm\n-BUT once Illumination is proc'd the target cant be re-effected for X seconds. Sort of a wierd combination of Leona's and LeBlancs passive.\n\nSo let me get this straight\n-Lower the damage of all her abilities and put them into her innate \n-Remove her sole reason for getting into AA range by making her AA not trigger said innate \n-Make her innate have a delay \n-Make her innate not able to be proc'd again for a time\n^This sounds like a horrible idea, people already complain they don't interact with Lux (which honestly should apply to Vel'Koz, Xerath, Varus, Ziggs, and maybe Jacye just as much but no- Lux is the one who gets complaints) and your changes remove any reason for her to step anywhere near her lane opponent. (To AA and get the innate off).\n\nAnd you're outright destroying her ability to waveclear, which requires those autos to trigger the innate. Now she has to use both of her **only damaging spells** outside of her ult to clear the wave?\n\nFurthermore, this outright removes her existing (risky) combo of Q-AA-E-R-AA and replaces it with... Q-E-(apparently pointless 1.5 second wait)-R and then nothing... you realize her having to AA is a risk-reward system right? I know you do because you mentioned it. You're removing both the risk and the reward of that system and replacing it with nothing more than what you already stated you don't like now.\n\n\n> -Lux is more reliant on her team to get out damage.\n-brings some more utility to the table\n-proper backline support with no real reason to move to the front BUT has less-effective tools to protect herself in turn(point blank snares can finally be reacted to)\n\n\nUmm, why should Lux be reliant on her team to get out damage? No champion except Supports should \"rely\" on another champion to do anything.\nHer more utility is just \"more vision\" which frankly is not a good exchange for lowering her damage on her only waveclear tool. Especially when it already gives vision in the first place.\nAnd her snare can be reacted to just as much as any similar CC, Lux is not special in this regard, you have to dodge skillshots to defeat mages.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"playtestpenguin","date":"2016-11-28T08:05:54.007+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Balancing around skins doesn't happen in actuality","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cynical Rain","date":"2016-11-26T10:33:09.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Why are you changing Anivia?

She generally won or had a skill matchup into everything because she was a jack of all trades that was better than almost all. \n\n* Most mages have set-up to their 1shot combos. Obviously their are outliers to this (hello {{champion:134}}) but generally if you get 1shotted and there was nothing you can do about it other than \"stay outside of this champion's range of threat or get instagibbed\" it leaves the designer with very little wiggle room to adjust power\n\n* her itemization leads her to being much less vulnerable than other champions: on top of her passive she almost always builds Seraph+Archangel, so she was insane at itemizing for almost every scenario. Even when an LB or Syndra bursts you, they've generally used their ultimates and have itemized damage. Anivia wasn't gated by having to build full damage items nor was she committing any cooldowns. Laning against her post-6 turned into \"I get shoved out and die because of this undodgable combo\" or \"I win this all-in but she eggs\". \n\nIf she is very weak (which sentiment currently seems to be, but data-driven is always ideal) then she can be buffed in several different ways that I've discussed with the designer. The point of making changes of this magnitude is that they're sustainable changes, and I do believe these are sustainabble -- even if she released weak in the short term.","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2016-11-28T09:15:31.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess you mean she builds Seraph/RoA? :)","replies":[{"poster":"playtestpenguin","date":"2016-11-28T22:37:06.048+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, woops.

How Singed be after rylai changes? Kind of a big core item to singed.\n2. How Urgot been doing? Seem everyone forgot him. (Still want Star Guardian Urgot)\n3. Any possible changes to Syndra? Felt too punishing to not get hit by her q,e and yet lose 70-90% to the squishy's hp by a single ult. Any changes to reward Syndra for actually hitting her skill shot.\n4. Do you think Crits are overtune? I think crit chance and ie synchronize too well. I felt adc prefer crit over atk spd/ sustain build. An example, Vayne who known for tank shredder as on-hit effect, prefer crit build to kill their target.  \n5. Do you think there is too much damage in game? I felt that there's too much damage in the game. Getting two shot felt bad and most champion can do that when 2-4 items in. I remember in season 3-4 champion take 4-6 hits to actually kill someone after 3-5 items in. I would like to react to the damage i taken rather than dying in 2 seconds. Longer teamfight is funner than pressing faster to win.\n6. Support experiment. Do you have any analysis or hypothesis on the experiment? For me, I have couple of reason why players don't pick support.\n    1. The itemization does not feel very impactful. Tank support items does not tank as well as true tank items. Utility support only have very few option to pick on. Mostly on active item. Hard to see the amount of effectiveness on the item unless your a dedicated support main.\n    2. Really felt like a half a player and useless when behind. Players want visible control over the game. Losing as support felt awful because you had no control over it, totally reliant on the carries to not messed up. No impact beside vision and peeling. Reason why most people don't want to ranked as support because they can't control their team or map. Need objectives for support.\n    3. Too little damage and squishy. Late game, support get destroy quick and can't output noticeable damage as other squishy or tank. Support can't 1v1 and they can't ward in safely without escort.","replies":[]}]}
