Welcome to Patch Chat, a Dev Corner thread we make to talk about our new patches every two weeks: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-75-notes\n\nI&#039;m Aesah on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of Diamond+ players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to LoL in terms of both balance and fun. We&#039;ll be watching this thread to answer as many questions as we can.\n\nIn 7.5, Aatrox has a mini update aimed at increasing satisfaction playing as and against him. Fizz has had power shifted out of the reliability of the ultimate into the Q. Leblanc received a hefty nerf, hopefully taking her out of 100% pick/ban status in pro games while still keeping her viable for the playerbase. Miss Fortune has gained some incentive to itemize for crit. Rengar, Ryze, and Varus have received nerfs as well (Varus also receiving indirect nerfs through DFT/lethality, but he was finding too much success without using either of those as well). \n\nFor items, Blade of the Ruined King was changed to be more attractive to Marksman and also potentially as a first item, and Edge of Night has been nerfed to focus on &quot;I&#039;m using this to go in&quot; rather than &quot;I activate this at some point then run around with a shield&quot;. For keystones, Deathfire Touch was nerfed, Warlord&#039;s Bloodlust and Bond of Stone were completely replaced with new effects so it will be exciting to see how those play out. Finally, Exhaust was nerfed and hopefully we&#039;ll be seeing it less as a generalist summoner taken by midlaners and more of a focused, defensive summoner.\n\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\n\nAdam &quot;Afic&quot; Cohen\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\nNicolas &ldquo;Gleeb&rdquo; Haddad\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\nArnor &quot;TheLastAirbender&quot; Halldorsson","replies":[{"poster":"Aamano","date":"2017-03-08T21:44:31.050+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a long time fan of Aatrox, and im wiling to put in more time to feel out the changes\nthough they don't feel as well as I hoped\n\n\nthe one thing I wanted to try and bring attention to is how long it takes to build up Blood Well vs. how quickly it falls off\n\nI think that after Blood Well activates when full, and then begins to drain, subsequent uses of abilities should still add to it while not attacking champions.

That was Aatrox's identity, and it's been taken away because of his pitiful healing now, even when building full tank he'll never get the same amount of healing as before when below 50%. To me that was what made Aatrox Aatrox, he would fight until his last breath instead of turning and running. Now if you're low you'd better book it because you heal so much less (and even with tank items you're still squishy because of no defensive mechanics and terrible base stats).\n\nI understand that his old E had problems (I'm an Aatrox main and that skill for sure did too much, if you could consistently hit it then you could chunk enemies down very quickly) but nerfing his healing and damage in the rest of his kit to make up for that while buffing his E damage is a bit of backwards logic don't you think? \n\nMy speculation is that his E only exists in its current form because the designers who made Aatrox said \"he needs to have low base stats or he will run out of control. If he has low base stats, he will constantly get bullied out of lane and won't be able to farm. Let's give him a ranged poke skill to help him.\"\n\nSo, why not adjust his base stats and gut his E damage vs champions? I think at least in the short term it should still be a farming tool, but the pressure that it puts in lane in terms of damage is a bit too much. \n\nThe biggest problem IMO with this update is that it tried to make Aatrox into a tankier champion without adjusting how any of his abilities fundamentally work. His Q is still one of the worst initiation tools in the game, slow and interruptible, and his E is an unreliable skillshot that only slows. He has no other meaningful CC. Compared to other champions that sort of fit Aatrox's intended role with this update, it just doesn't compare. \nHe still at his core relies on autoattacks way more than abilities, but overall his windowed passive and nerfed damage and healing on W make it much more difficult to succeed here. \n\nMy fear is that Aatrox will just turn into another Titanic Black Cleaver into tank champion like Renekton or Kled. This is not why I began playing Aatrox, and most other Aatrox players will agree. I do acknowledge that he needs to have the option to build tankier, but I don't think hitting his damage output to gimp the risky builds is the right way to do this.\n\nThese are just my thoughts, courtesy of a scrub, but I do know Aatrox and I know that these changes have made him significantly weaker at being the duelist that was his fantasy.","replies":[{"poster":"playtestpenguin","date":"2017-03-09T17:59:07.560+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"you left out the main point of my comment - \n\n> that wins lane by pressing E repeatedly\n\nobviously it's fine if he's a draintank, but cutting out half of the sentence is silly and unproductive.","replies":[{"poster":"Failog","date":"2017-03-11T02:11:42.670+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That comment right there tells me that you never EVER tried to main him in rank to climb.
