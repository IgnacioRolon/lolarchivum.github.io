I&#039;m Aesah, and I&#039;ll be filling in for Gentleman Gustaf to bring you today&#039;s Patch Chat, which will be posted here on Dev Corner every two weeks along with the release of each [new patch](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-616-notes). \r\n\r\nI recently joined Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of Diamond+ players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to LoL in terms of both balance and fun. \r\n\r\nIn 6.16, we&#039;re excited to be releasing Kled, the Cantankerous Cavalier to bring some new dynamics with his dismounting/re-mounting mechanic to the Rift. Otherwise this patch is relatively minor- there are a few support changes with buffs to Lulu and Nautilus, while toning back Sona&#039;s newfound powers to a more reasonable level. Irelia and Viktor have also been performing just a bit too well, so we&#039;re cutting their power a bit too.\r\n\r\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players. Additionally, you guys can use this opportunity to ask us anything about what it&#039;s like to work at Riot as a playtester. While we can&#039;t answer specific questions about anything that would be considered a leak, the Playtest Team will be around for the next few hours to try to answer as many questions as we can.\r\n\r\nAdam &quot;Afic&quot; Cohen\r\nPreston &ldquo;Hinder&rdquo; Bunker\r\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\r\nShawn &ldquo;I Am The IRS&rdquo; Currie\r\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\r\nNicolas &ldquo;Gleeb&rdquo; Haddad\r\nDan &ldquo;Penguin&rdquo; Hardison\r\nMiles &ldquo;Daydreamin&rdquo; Hoard\r\nBao &ldquo;Bao&rdquo; Lam\r\nRobert &ldquo;RobertxLee&rdquo; Lee\r\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\r\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\r\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes","replies":[{"poster":"PINEAPPLE BRUSH","date":"2016-08-09T23:17:17.390+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"I demand Pool Party Brand And Dragon Slayer Shyvana.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ThEntropist","date":"2016-08-09T23:24:57.822+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":3,"body":"k","replies":[]},{"poster":"GliderSlayer","date":"2016-08-11T01:48:40.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldn't Dragon Slayer Shyvana be kind of messed up considering that Shyvana is a half dragon?

As long time Garen player in diamond+ elo (masters peak, d1 multiple season, d5+ in dynamic queue era) I believe he suffers from an overly weak early game. Not even relative to what he \"used\" to be, but relative to the strengths of other melee champions who completely lack any sort of ability to be a threat out of directly melee range - examples like tryndamere, darius, irelia, jax, who all scale equally as well or better and have the same core gameplay as garen. Bringing kill potential and little else to a team. \n\nI don't think he needs any changes mid-late game in any form, but facts like his Q is strictly the better ability for trading early game because it's damage is both upfront and higher per-skill-rank in terms of what you gain for ranking them in any scenario where the enemy champ isn't completely isolated for greater than 3/4ths of the duration. His Q should be his utility skill but its his best dueling skill cause you need to get out before the silence is off or lose all trades once the enemy can retaliate. His early game is overly frail and the sluggish nature of level 1-3 spin (5 ticks), along with his unrewarding skill paths is super unfulfilling as a long time garen player.\n\nHe can't even jungle because of his W not stacking quickly enough on jungle camps, so he's an easily counter picked niche hero, with low role flexibility and a poor early game. He has so many factors working against his ability to reach a point where he can perform consistently at a high level of play, and in my opinion, just needs a small boost to his early or a redistribution of his Q and E damage to make E THE damage skill and Q THE utility skill that makes it more rewarding to play him. \n\nAs a final gripe when he was made more kitable by reducing silence, move speed %, duration and base ms from his kit his channel times on his Q could have been compensated in some way but skilled players can often escape from you during the animation, at times the damage has been applied and people can still flash after the ability has 'landed' even though they shouldn't be able to, due to silence. \n\ntl;dr\n\nearly game overly weak\nq > e max for some reason for DAMAGE purposes, when it should be q < e\nq cast time makes for a frustratingly unreliable ability that makes him struggle significantly more vs skilled players","replies":[]},{"poster":"IMelchorI","date":"2016-08-12T20:31:35.796+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Aesah,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=relEr8rN,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2016-08-09T23:31:26.850+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t think we have any plans to buff Garen.

In a state of the game where almost every champ builds an offensive item with a slow (ice gaunt, rylai, frozen mallet) he gets kited to death, literally. He has a non scaling, single target form of CC in the form of a 1.5 second silence, and that is it. He is one of the slowest champions in the game (awful mobility), and his Q that gives him a move speed bonus for a short duration doesn't scale either (no increase in move speed amount or duration), but hey at least his Q breaks a slow, only to be vulnerable to any slow after Q is cast. So his Q only scales in dmg, his W is one of; if not the only, passive stacking abilities that has a CAP, and his E really only scales in dmg anyways in the form of \"ticks\". I mean c'mon people. The champ is literally just a meat shield, who can absolutely delete the enemy support for Killstealing that last kill (Cause he would be the villain).\n\nYet a few patches ago, Gnar; who is a ranged, tank, CC machine, with decent mobility, who, oh by the way! does % health damage too actually gets a buff???

We know Garen very well, an immobile tank that scales into a monster as the game progresses and destroys anyone that gets close, **AT LEAST** this is how you advertised him and the others when you reworked them in the Juggernaut update.\n\nI never saw it this way, yes his late-game did improve significantly, but it's not like he is a monster compared to other champs that **DO have mobility** and bring more to the team, and as the meta has changed it has gotten worse especially with these problematic items called Frozen Mallet and Rylai's crystal scepter, items that are really strong right now because of the power and utility it gives, and make Garen completely useless unless you have {{summoner:4}}  up, and even then, if they have flash themselves well you're done unless you have enough damage to burst them down in the duration of the silence or if it's a squishy target marked as a Villain.\n\nI do believe besides his early game weaknesses he needs something ELSE like, (just an idea), a 1.5 slow immunity on his Q when activated, or at least a slow reduction; a little more speed when running towards the Villain, something like this to compensate his speed nerfs.\n\nJust adding a little more to the topic, MarineRevenge speaks for most of us and I completely agree with his points.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-08-09T19:56:54.820+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"Are there any plans to address Caitlyn's oppressiveness?","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2016-08-09T20:55:18.717+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"As far as I know, Caitlyn's winrates in normals/ranked isn't particularly high, nor is she overplayed in competitive, so you'll have to be more specific on what you feel is oppressive (her range? traps? burst combo? late-game damage scaling with headshot?)","replies":[{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2016-08-09T21:30:39.196+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"General consensus seems to be her ability to pile traps underneath your towers feels pretty bad for her opponents, especially because even tanks can't safely trigger them.","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2016-08-09T23:30:12.723+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally feel the traps are pretty annoying as well but again, Caitlyn isn't particularly over-represented anywhere, if we nerfed the duration or amount of traps she could drop we'd probably have to look to buff her elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2016-08-10T08:36:14.909+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her ult currently feels very weak, so that wouldn't be an issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-08-09T23:33:40.887+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"that would work well. take power out of her traps, give it to her q or ult","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flyybug","date":"2016-08-11T17:52:05.178+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about making the traps similar to Azir soldiers?

At present it's unintuitive and really punishing that if you're zoned really far back from your tower enemy champions can stand under it and hit you without risk.\n\n   > Give towers some concept of champion aggression memory. Basically towers won't go back to shooting minions until there aren't any enemy champions in their range who've recently damaged one of their team's champions. Main impact of that is expected to be on champions that dive at low levels using untargetablity effects (Elise, Fizz etc). The ability to swap agro onto another champion's still there and still powerful, trying to defend a tower in those circumstances shouldn't be as lopsided though (risk just isn't there for the attacker at present). As with lane swaps we don't want to remove early tower diving, we don't think the risk being taken/price being paid's high enough though, leading to a situation where you just don't bother trying to defend at all (tower still goes down, you just go down with it).\n","replies":[{"poster":"Skias","date":"2016-08-10T03:30:12.067+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AstralVoid,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=relEr8rN,comment-id=0021,timestamp=2016-08-10T03:26:39.316+0000)\n>\n> I remember seeing this in the Dev Corner previously, noting it would be set for 6.16:\n> \n> [Link to tower changes.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/B2y4p4vE-pre-worlds-early-game-update?show=flat)\n> \n> Yet I don&#x27;t see any mention of the proposed tower AI changes in the patch.

No clue, just vanished. It would be nice if they are encouraging the 4 man gang bang constantly going on bot for the Tower to at least not derp around and actually shoot.","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2016-08-14T17:14:33.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes our engineers implement changes that seem simple enough and \"should work\", we test them in a bunch of games and everything works perfectly, then a week later we have a weird case where a Leblanc clone screws up the tower for the rest of the game so we need more time before we release it.\n\nThis may have been one of those times.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mi Bardo El Loco","date":"2016-08-09T22:08:59.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you please tell us when the patch is going to be live on game (not PBE)?
