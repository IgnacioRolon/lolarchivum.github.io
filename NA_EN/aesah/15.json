I&#039;m Don &quot;Aesah&quot; Ding on Riot&#039;s Playtest team, a group of Diamond+ players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, map updates, etc. before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the ideas that our developers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to LoL in terms of both balance and fun.\n\nI host the Playtest Stream along with another member of our team every Wednesday from 6 to 8 PM Pacific Time. The main focus of the stream is to answer any questions you guys have for us. We will also be playing games with viewers (in a custom game where the password is announced in the chat) and delivering a few high level gameplay tips.\n\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players. While we can&#039;t answer specific questions about anything that would be considered confidential or a leak, you guys can also use this opportunity to ask us anything about Riot. \n\nFeel free to use this thread to leave any questions, suggestions, or comments about the Playtest Stream, and see you guys at www.twitch.tv/leagueoflegends!\n\nEDIT: as of 9/28/16, this stream will be on hiatus. I'm not exactly sure how long but definitely AT LEAST a few months.

It's a common misconception though- in fact one of the most frequent complaints I've seen from players is that X champion isn't performing well in high levels of play, therefore he needs buffs. However we definitely care about other brackets, aka the majority of our playerbase.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-08-17T15:13:49.766+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Balancing is done with all brackets in mind, but a disproportionate (in the mathematical, neutral meaning of the word) attention is still given to high brackets, I hope. 'Cause if a champion is \"OP\" in low levels, the counter-play does exist already, it's just that people don't know it or how to execute on it. Whereas a champion that is \"OP\" in high levels, well, it's just actually OP, without quotes.\n\nSo of course, Riot has to take care of the situation if a champion is balanced for LCS but has a 70% winrate in Bronze, of course that's not a sustainable state for the game. But the game MUST be precisely balanced at high levels, whereas at lower levels, it just needs to not have too many too big outliers.","replies":[{"poster":"Akhmnra3","date":"2016-08-19T23:38:38.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":15,"body":"Lol ok 1v1 me pleb","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-08-20T11:35:29.904+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Care to elaborate?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"League SJW","date":"2016-10-07T23:44:48.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bring back the old guinzoos and devour","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Adauchi","date":"2016-08-16T21:20:51.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will you guys be talking about the assassin changes?

Some players have played the champions you are reworking for years. The champions you are reworkiing arent movies that can be spoiled by a leak. Its like a pet. Imagine your pet is in an opperation that lasts a week. Would you only like to know if your pet survived or not, or would you like to know if the opperation is going well? Plus from a marketing stand point. These champions are old, they are owned by alot of people, you dont need to sell them to them, you should actually get the comunity hyped. OFC there are some changes that are going to amaze the comunity. Like maybe a new mechanic that can wow the player base, like from what I heard stealth, so maybe not leak the whole champions kit. But atleast give more info to the player base. But again this going to be one of those things \"We know that it has been a mistake on our part to not get you guys updated on the class updates\".","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cardi","date":"2016-09-19T07:56:38.839+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In reference to this post from reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4en3fi/serious_playtesters_plz/) quite a few months ago, is Riot still hiring candidates for their playtest team?","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2016-09-20T19:53:23.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not entirely sure- the best thing to do is to check our careers page on the main website","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Liquid Poro ","date":"2016-08-16T21:45:19.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will you able to test the assassin rework on pbe?","replies":[{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-08-23T13:44:23.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but not for a long time it's still under development","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2016-08-16T21:40:43.037+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Which type of ability mechanics do you enjoy testing the most?","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2016-08-17T06:38:58.200+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Personally I like flashy stuff that is new/unique.

The update is fun for sure for some assassins for others not so much. \n\n{{champion:55}} Katarina i must say it is fun and looks okay. (and inc ad katarina xD)\n\n{{champion:91}} Talon, i feel like his potential for roam is amazing and to kill the jungler (which i think most high elo player will focus on that mostly because well he can get fast in lanes but he cant really do anything with out a blink....and no a dash is not a blink){{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} . so i am not sure about him being playable. \n\n{{champion:7}} Leblanc, well it looks like she will have easier farm mechanics {{champion:13}}  for the rest i cant tell. And for sure she wont b able to escape anymore almost at all with no double W. (she dies fast a slow effect will destroy her)\n\n{{champion:107}} Rengar, it looks like the ulty and the W are very good the Q tho i dont know... i mean okay the basic aspect riot dev focused was to give counter play and not die in 0.5 sec from rengo ulty but with the change on ulty you already nerfed the teamfight ability to assassinate why a change in Q. I cant tell if its good or not until i play. \n\n{{champion:35}} AND FINALLY SHACO WILL DO SOMETHING IN A FIGHT A CC!","replies":[]},{"poster":"artini1","date":"2016-10-18T16:41:42.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what is thiss??","replies":[]},{"poster":"HEdi01","date":"2016-10-14T23:06:36.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"end ban","replies":[]},{"poster":"xBatousai","date":"2016-10-12T16:20:22.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when is the lol record match history thing coming out?","replies":[]},{"poster":"mannyshb","date":"2016-10-09T01:54:09.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TSM","replies":[{"poster":"rengar vore","date":"2016-10-10T20:50:33.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rip tsm {{champion:32}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"imofchinaese","date":"2016-10-08T15:33:40.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to get PBE.....................{{champion:64}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"League SJW","date":"2016-10-07T23:43:39.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should Chang guinsoozs rageblade back to the way it was before it was reworked and bring back devour and fix the bugs on master yi","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximus Paine","date":"2016-09-26T11:40:53.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\nDid you guys broadcast last wed 9/21?
