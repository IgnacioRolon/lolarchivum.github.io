For that, head over to our PBE boards:http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nHey guys! Welcome to Patch Chat, a Dev Corner thread we make to talk about our new patches every two weeks: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-621-notes\n\nI&#039;m Aesah on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of Diamond+ players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to LoL in terms of both balance and fun. We&#039;ll be watching this thread to answer as many questions as we can.\n\nThis will be our last patch in Season 6, before we hit some MASSIVE changes in 6.22. So for now in 6.21, we&#039;re cleaning up some major bugs, and also adjusting some abilities on Nidalee, Graves, Nunu, Kog&#039;Maw, and Nasus. Nidalee is getting a pretty hefty nerf due to her high winrate amongst experienced players as well as her dominance in competitive play. On the other hand, we&#039;ve given Nasus defensive stat buffs in exchange for damage which we expect to be a fairly significant buff to him. Another thing worth mentioning is that Ivern players were struggling so we hotfixed a buff for him. Additionally, Zac&#039;s E has a more clear indicator which is actually pretty significant to his gameplay.\n\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\n\nAdam &quot;Afic&quot; Cohen\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\nNicolas &ldquo;Gleeb&rdquo; Haddad\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\nMiles &ldquo;Daydreamin&rdquo; Hoard\nBao &ldquo;Bao&rdquo; Lam\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes","replies":[{"poster":"ThatGingerAgain","date":"2016-10-19T21:15:44.096+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is yall's favorite part about this current patch?

He has so many weaknesses to engage, split push and early game comps. He even has huge mana costs so he can't poke for very long without again being very vulnerbale to engages since he'd run himself completely dry if he used the ult. then. How can a champion with no mobility and almost no CC really be problematic when going AP? The only way I see that being a risk is if Rylai's is OP.

You've removed everything he was for the entire season and forced him to move to a more safe/viable position. You know who else is unhealthy when strong? Teemo, Tryndamere, Yi.

Got some questions for you guys. \n\nwhere do you think Ivern ACTUALLY stands (aside from in the brush like always) in terms of power as a champ rn? his win rate is three trashy from what I've observed,  but im having a hard time knowing how much of that to account to peoples unfamiliarity with him in my various speculations.\n\nDo you think the hot fix will be enough to get him into a decent spot?  it focused alot on his base stats, which were for sure a little weak, but it seemed to me like a few changes to his skills (risky as they may be) would be what it takes to get him in a good place.\n\nThis might be a bit of a weird question but, how \"ready\" do you think league is for a champ like Ivern, as a game? i personally love instances of design which shake things up, but the game is to a certain extent rigid in what is determined as viable for an overall composition, given how defined specific roles are. whenever i looked at a composition i had with \"The Vern\"{{champion:427}} (that's what i call him) as a participating member, it for sure switched up the balance of tank to C.C. damage to utility and etc.  in this process i couldn't help but get the feeling that the current architecture of team roles (as well as the role of jungler at large) wasn't really quite as prepared to accommodate him, i realize that anything missing in a team can be compensated for by other roles as with literally any other pick in the game, but it really felt like it was more substantial with him than many other champions at the moment. \nHis clearing style, gank method, and the rather quirky style of input into team fights just seemed to shake up the lava lamp that is this games structure\nwhat are your thoughts on this? Am i just nuts? provided this is the case, what can we do to make his pick more \"ecosystem friendly\"? for lack of a better term\n\nThanks a ton!","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2016-10-19T23:17:38.929+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our team generally doesn't feel Ivern is weak. He also pushes the limits of how creative we can make a champion, which I think is pretty cool. Because he is so different to play than any other existing champion, we expect it to take more time before players learn to play him relative to our other releases, leading to his low win rate. \n\nIn general, if they're in a balanced state, newer champions tend to just have low winrates while people get acclimated to them. I think the most recent Ryze rework is a great example where he was extremely low winrate (sub40% I believe) but now he's being played at worlds without any major changes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"carlmoby","date":"2016-10-19T20:44:07.632+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought that the Harrowing update would be in the 6.21 patch (today).

His problems are outlined [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/obZhMjr4-ziggs-does-no-damage?show=flat&page=1) and [here although it's not really the exact subject of the thread.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/HRxjXodT-ziggz-q?show=flat&page=1)\n\nIt's not just a matter of winrate (although I expect this to go down a lot once assassins are popular again). He performs at a mediocre but acceptable level for someone without a lot of experience. It's that he simply FAILS TO CARRY FOR EXPERIENCED PLAYERS in higher ELO since his scalings aren't amazing and his whole kit is dodgeable. Take a look at champion.gg and notice that even Ziggs with 125+ games are just short of 49% winrate. Especially for a champion with a low pickrate, that's pretty pathetic. After 125+ games, Syndra's at 54%+, Ahri's at 54%+, Vel'Koz is at 55%+, Anivia's at 56%, Annie's at 57%, Morg's at 56%, Xerath's at 63%, Brand's at 54%, Akali's at 57%, Kennen's at 52%, Kayle's at 56% etc. I could list probably another half a dozen champions. Considering he's only picked 2% of the time, I'd expect huge winrates for people with 125+ games. Other champions with low pickrates certainly follow this trend. For example, Karthus is at 65% winrate and Zilean is at 60%.\n\nAs far as your video, that's 2014 and a lot of things have changed since then for both Ziggs and the game. His auto range was nerfed, his Q hitbox was nerfed, his MS was nerfed, his E was nerfed, his passive was nerfed early and the meta mids now are in a different class. Viktor isn't even considered strong early and Ziggs can't trade with him. He has no shield like Ryze or Viktor, no heal and ridiculous lane/kill pressure like Cass etc. Vel'Koz does pretty much what Ziggs can except for turrets but if you kill your laner, that's not an issue. Vel'Koz has good CC, can get rid of even Dr. Mundo or other hypertanks, has near 1 shot potential with E-R and has a stronger early game. ZIggs doesn't have kill pressure vs competent laners unless they chose to sit in lane after being poked down a lot (which is their fault for being too close to minions when Ziggs Qs). Compare Ziggs to a Cass early... she can pretty much solo you in a few seconds at level 3. Even if Ziggs were to hit everything, he just doesn't do damage that fast. That would be fine if his late game were better but as you can see from the stats, he's not performing well late game either and I don't think it's just from stalling out games. I've played Ziggs late and I felt completely outclassed by Viktor for example while being equally vulnerable. Viktor's extra CC, shields, higher base MS and way higher CC more than compensates for Ziggs' unreliable escape. Also, Viktor can waveclear EVEN BETTER than Ziggs. All he needs is one ability and the wave's gone. Ziggs can do it fairly well too with E and 2 Qs but it's more mana intensive.\n\n\nI don't want to ramble too much but if you talk to top players, you'll know that those who actually have played Ziggs 25+ games don't consider him good. Froggen actually said \"Ziggs sucks.\" on stream when people were asking him to play the champion. He eventually was forced to play Ziggs through a poll and got fed but couldn't carry. I don't think he played Ziggs after that even though it's a champion whose strengths fit his style. Froggen's used to carrying games from very far behind when he goes Anivia or Viktor. Ziggs is underplayed, particularly in high ELO, for a reason. It's not random when literally every region has played basically 0 Ziggs games this whole season and there's no one in high Masters+ maining him (there are plenty of TF, Viktor, Syndra and Ahri mains/one-tricks). It's not like Ziggs is a new champion and they don't know how his kit works.\n\nEDIT: Corrected site link and added more details.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LuxRainbows100","date":"2016-10-20T00:01:37.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey riot is it Ok if i ask some questions..if u don't want to look a t questions that is fine don't look at this \n1) Are you guys reworking all assassins???

He's performing poorly for experienced players and is pretty much never seen in competitive or Masters/Challenger. This has been true the whole season. Doesn't that suggest to you that the champion has some potential problems with scaling, itemization, reliability, etc. ? Unlike Ryze or Ivern, it's not as if people aren't aware of how his kit works. Is it just about not wanting a poke make style to work? I think strategic diversity is interesting and key to a game intended to have longevity. \n\nI'm not saying Ziggs needs a big buff and even 5 more MS again or a higher AP ratio on W could make him more worthwhile. Alternatively, maybe he can get more level dependent power late game on some ability (similar to how his passive scales).","replies":[]},{"poster":"legendarytiger","date":"2016-10-20T19:40:34.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is:\n\n[Click HERE to be AMAZED (and slightly depressed) by ASSASSINS!!!](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-2017/assassins)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"LuxRainbows100","date":"2016-12-04T00:46:58.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thank you but  also i asked How do you make doom bots possible?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"gyyyr","date":"2016-10-19T23:39:51.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how did you decide which factors make doombots harder or easier?\nOr asked differently, what changes between doombots lvl 100 and doombots lvl 1?\n\nDid anyone of you manage to beat doombots lvl 100?

But that's not what happened.  Her utility was also heavily decreased until she either gets level 9 and a bunch of CDR, or at least 50% crit.  The problem is that her critical slow is too uncommon (or the duration is too short) to be useful utility in the early game when it only comes from the previously-nerfed Volley or critical hits. Neither crits nor volley are up often enough for her to have useful utility early game.  Level 1-5, she just doesn't have the items or cooldown on Volley to anything except try to farm safely.

Nasus was already a hard enough counter, before getting stronger. :D\n\nI'm not looking for something ridiculous, but just a buff to deal with Tryndamere's worst weakness - his susceptibility to getting kited. Something as simple as +5 base movement speed, and maybe a 30% slow resistance (maybe even including attack speed slows) for the duration of his ultimate will go a long way towards making the champion feel better in the lategame.\n\nWith so many unfavorable matchups nowadays, anything from Nasus to Kennen to Jayce, Trynd players are forced to teamfight far more than any previous season. And while the champion will _never_ be a strong 5v5 champion, the proposed changes would go a long way towards making teamfights a little less painful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serpents Queen","date":"2016-10-20T00:58:01.588+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"are the legacy skins coming back this year?
