Welcome to Patch Chat, a Dev Corner thread we make to talk about our new patches every two weeks: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-624-notes\r\n\r\nI&#039;m Aesah on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of Diamond+ players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to LoL in terms of both balance and fun. We&#039;ll be watching this thread to answer as many questions as we can.\r\n\r\nIn 6.24, we&#039;re most looking forward to the release of Camille, a diver in the top lane. Other changes include buffs for Azir, Nidalee, Fiddlesticks, Kog&#039;Maw, and Garen, who were below the bar of appropriate strength (e.g., Fiddlesticks struggled with the jungle changes). On the other hand, we have nerfs for Vayne, Rengar, Leblanc, Twitch, and Ivern who were overperforming (Ivern as players learn to play him). Fervor recieved a buff to encourage ADCs to consider taking it over Warlord&#039;s again, while Courage of the Collosus was nerfed as it was providing way more impact than other keystones. Finally, Rylai&#039;s recieved a nerf so hopefully we won&#039;t be seeing it built as a stat-stick so frequently and rather only on mages who strongly appreciate the slow.\r\n\r\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\r\n\r\nAdam &quot;Afic&quot; Cohen\r\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\r\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\r\nNicolas &ldquo;Gleeb&rdquo; Haddad\r\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\r\nBao &ldquo;Bao&rdquo; Lam\r\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\r\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\r\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\r\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes","replies":[{"poster":"TiIian","date":"2016-12-07T20:41:31.973+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":69,"body":"no one cares","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-12-07T20:42:14.589+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":2,"body":"I care.

It does hurt Mordekaiser a lot though due to being overly reliant on Rylais.\nHis base stats in particular are what makes this even more noticeable.\nWith literally the worst base MS he can't really keep up and with less than stellar base hp and resistances he does not feel as tanky as he should.\n\n\n\nOn a related \"juggernaut\" note, thoughts on Quas Nasus' build and how people seem to have a problem with it?","replies":[{"poster":"playtestpenguin","date":"2016-12-08T00:19:05.316+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I brought up mordekaiser as a champion who will likely be heavily affected by Rylai's nerf to the live gameplay team -- they are aware.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skarnye West","date":"2016-12-08T01:26:57.533+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm no longer a playtester (I used to be), and I'm also a dirty Mordekaiser secondary (90 ranked games last season), and I share your concerns.\n\nRylai's was warping what Mordekaiser was supposed to do by giving him consistent ability to close from range.

It would also make him less swingy on balance adustments since other abilities could have power shaved to compensate.\n\nAlso will you be returning the 6.24 buffs you had in testing for Kalista?\n\nEDIT: And how could i forget about Trist? She's been in dust for a year. Atleast when she had the in-built CDR on her E-Q combos, she was somewhat smooth. For an ADC who's major point is her resets, she doesn't get much momentum going after the first since by then all of her damage tools and steroids are on CD.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"IAmNeverViable","date":"2016-12-07T21:24:29.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"couple of question\n1.

Yet the champs I'm playing against feel very much the same-old as last season with assassins again seeming to fall out of favor for control mages. I think it's agreed that assassins are fun to play yet have a lot of tools that can be used against them. Namely, the sheer strength newly given to supports to use Redemption, Locket shield (and for tank supports FofTM as well) in addition to Exhaust. Where's the trickery and outplay for assassins when all players have to do is spam actives and click the Exhaust-block button to stop them? Also the fact the Exhaust is now frequently run in offensively lanes top and mid (Yasuo being a very clear abuser of it). \n\nIs the balance team thinking that maybe anti-engage tools are too strong, and/or Exhaust is an overly strong summoner spell at this point? A spell that reduces Attack Speed, damage, and slows may be a bit too overpowering and just limits a lot of options without leaving room for outplay. Maybe look at QSS removing Exhaust so there's some semblance to outplay Exhaust? Nerf Exhaust? Obviously there's a clear difference between how these champions and spells are used in Bronze to Challenger but I don't find it fun to play assassins and be perma-exhausted or otherwise flashed away most of the time in the mid to late game. \n\nTLDR; Assassins were hyped but Exhaust/Redemption/Locket makes it brainless to counter against them.","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2016-12-08T07:24:56.265+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"We're looking into potentially buffing Ignite, also last patch we buffed an offensive Keystone and nerfed a defensive one.

So why is he dashing around all over the place? And it seems like to balance that out, his range was nerfed so that he barely outranges standard mid casters. He's sometimes even forced to be almost in the middle of the fight. It seems to me like he should be able to stand back, but if someone like Rengar pounces on the general he's in trouble.
