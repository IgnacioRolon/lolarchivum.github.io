Welcome to Patch Chat, a Dev Corner thread we make to talk about the new patch every two weeks.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m Aesah on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of Diamond+ players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to LoL in terms of both balance and fun. We&#039;ll be around for the next few hours to answer as many questions as we can.\r\n\r\nIn 6.17, we&#039;re nerfing a few champions that have had an overbearing presence (pick/ban rate) in professional play. Specifically, S-tier junglers Gragas and Rek&#039;sai who have been crowding out other options are both taking a hit. In the ADC role, Ashe/Sivir/Jhin are losing a bit of power while some other ADCs get minor buffs to bring them more in line with each other. Finally, Gangplank and Trundle are getting nerfs as well- Gangplank in particular taking a heavier hit due to how strong of a pick he has been for awhile. These powerhouses have been making teams uninterested in other choices when they&#039;ve been available, so we hope that taking them down a notch will allow teams to feel comfortable picking a wider variety of champions and bring some new dynamics on to the Rift.\r\n\r\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\r\n\r\nAdam &quot;Afic&quot; Cohen\r\nPreston &ldquo;Hinder&rdquo; Bunker\r\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\r\nShawn &ldquo;I Am The IRS&rdquo; Currie\r\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\r\nNicolas &ldquo;Gleeb&rdquo; Haddad\r\nDan &ldquo;Penguin&rdquo; Hardison\r\nMiles &ldquo;Daydreamin&rdquo; Hoard\r\nBao &ldquo;Bao&rdquo; Lam\r\nRobert &ldquo;RobertxLee&rdquo; Lee\r\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\r\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\r\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes","replies":[{"poster":"adidas","date":"2016-08-24T19:34:24.665+0000","up_votes":76,"down_votes":10,"body":"The shen nerfs are completely unjustified.

I would expect the Shen nerfs currently on PBE to drop his normal/ranked winrate by a couple percent so he'd still be completely playable for anyone (I would expect Shen players to lose 1 more game out of every 50 games on average, which is not particularly disastrous especially considering his normal/ranked winrate is reasonably close to 50% right now). \n\nI'd advise against using hyperbole because when someone thinks that a medium-sized nerf to 1 champion qualifies as \"fucking over our entire playerbase\", it's very hard to respond to that in any meaningful manner except \"no, it doesnt?\" but that just feels like stating the obvious to me.","replies":[{"poster":"World Ender","date":"2016-08-24T21:57:17.705+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":4,"body":"It's not a medium sized nerf though, it's a huge one. His Q is literally the only thing in his kit that he can use to deal damage (and even then the damage he deals falls off incredibly hard outside of lane phase). I can understand nerfing the percent health damage, but nerfing the damage to minions and monsters is incredibly ridiculous. Most Shens don't even buy a single damage item, so now you're cutting the damage on his Q to minions by over 25% at rank 5? If that's not huge, I don't know what is. \n\nAlso, if you want to disrupt his impact in pro play, why are you nerfing his damage, instead of the actual reason why he's picked? Shen is not picked to be a lane dominant champion or to carry out of top lane like someone such as Riven or Fiora, he's picked for his ultimate and his taunt. Nerfing his damage is akin to having a hole in a ship, and instead of fixing the hole, you make another one so that the first is no longer your focus. He will still be picked in pro play, he will still be pick/ban, and meanwhile the people outside of competitive will have to deal with atrocious waveclear and damage. It's hard enough as is to do well with Shen (especially in lower ELO where your teammates run away as soon as you ult them or don't stand in your W) and now the only part of his kit that allows him to actually do a little bit of damage and survive on his own is being nerfed? \n\nAlso, one more thing I'd like to discuss while you're here is the sheer difference between competitive play and normal play, and how so many champions (Rek'Sai, Gragas, Nidalee, Gangplank, Sivir, Azir, and now Shen, and the list goes on and on and on...) are nerfed because of their near constant use in the LCS. To me, this is something that is not only unfair to people outside of competitive, but also indirectly deceptive and malicious. The fact that many of these champions are only most effectively utilized in the highest tiers of play and are nerfed for the rest of the playerbase to compensate facilitates and emphasizes the discrepancy between what is seen by the average player in LCS and what the average player actually plays. This is unhealthy for the game, plain and simple. I shouldn't have to feel that a certain champion is not viable in my ELO simply because the pros abuse and min/max the champion in ways that I cannot. This will always be a problem unless either somehow professional League undergoes major changes, such as imposing limits in some way to what champions can or cannot be played or the entire balance system having a Plat+ balance and a Gold- balance. The fact that League is balanced around the top 5% of all players mean that, for the other 95%, the game has the potential to become unbalanced. Obvious, yes, but it seem like the balance team never addresses this, even though it's probably one of the most important issues in the game. \n\nIn summary: I should not have to suffer Shen nerfs that are aimed at professional play when I'm in a vastly different tier, playing what feels like a completely different game.","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2016-08-24T23:29:15.123+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":31,"body":"Another thing to keep in mind is that while you guys are free to ask questions about anything, this is Patch Chat 6.17 where we haven't touched Shen.

Ekkos been plaguing this game for how long now? Why are we focused on shen because he gets some nice picks on teams now? \n\nCLG vs TSM game, Where was shen? You claimed he was pick/ban state yet he was not picked Nor banned \n\nC9 vs IMT game, Where was shen? You claim hes in a pick/ban state yet he was not picked Nor banned.\n\nThese are Semi-final games, IF he was remotely close to being pick/ban he wouldve been.... Picked or banned but he wasent.\n\nIts honestly horrible that he was even looked at for that HP regen nerf which made no sense, \n\nChamps like {{champion:150}}  whom are 100% plaguing top lane, Has % health W % health E Energy Q poke that slows  and loses half the CD if grabbed again then his passive he gains about 700 health like 70 total free armor and MR then has a line up Stun on the W boulder slow toss on his Q that lowers the CD by far and his fucking amazing ult that allows him to 100-0 mostly any champ if landed on and an E jump and the a lot more shit he has including his OTHER passive at 100% rage that makes him into a mini hulk from the free attack speed he gets for a few seconds\n\nBut no.... {{champion:98}}  needs nerf because he has good global presence.\n\nok....? \n\nSince global presence is an issue, Lets see {{champion:16}}  nerfs\n\nher ult is a 150/250/350 that scales off i think 60% AP? Then its increased by half if someones below 40% to every teammate on the map.\n\n\nYou know why i like Shen? \n\nSo Olaf ( Which is a champ whoms only counterplay is ''kill him fast'' ) doesnt run to my fuckin adc and 100-0 them in 1 second\n\nOr you know? The fizz that completely whiffed his ult, used his playful trickster to GET to my adc without actually hitting them, then  used his Q to actually hit my adc and then pressed W and boom their dead, from only 2 hits. \n\nOr how about my personal favorite? When akali builds a sunfire cape  with like half a fuckin AP item and bursts my adc in 2 seconds\n\nOh that doesnt happen? Really? http://plays.tv/s/Kvs_p54FGeMY\n\n\nI love shen because im able to protect my adc because i know how much retarded damage is in the game now. I'd be fine with the shen nerfs if thunderlords + fervor was completely removed from this game that way Bard doesnt throw a Q at anything with less than 100 AP and proc thunderlords for about 25% of their health.\n\nI love playing shen, i love his design, i love protecting my teammates, But i aint ever touching him again. And no this aint a ''omg nerf olaf and akali rant'' at the end of my sentences but its more like ''this is bullshit to anyone who plays shen because even the people who mained shen for YEARS have already quit the dude after his horrible rework.","replies":[{"poster":"playtestpenguin","date":"2016-08-24T23:01:20.333+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":4,"body":"Ekko requires more changes than just simple numbers tweaks.\n\nThat's all I feel comfortable saying.","replies":[{"poster":"adidas","date":"2016-08-24T23:13:14.050+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=penguin,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=FTNhAQKr,comment-id=000a000300040000,timestamp=2016-08-24T23:01:20.333+0000)\n>\n> Ekko requires more changes than just simple numbers tweaks.\n> \n> That&#x27;s all I feel comfortable saying.\n\nYou are 100% right.

Nerfing his Q just shows that the people who vouch for it never actually played shen. His Q damage is horrible after the 10 minute mark.","replies":[{"poster":"Cezium","date":"2016-08-25T00:32:44.432+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":10,"body":"Because we're targeting his weakness, not nerfing his strengths. When we start nerfing champions strengths they begin to homogenize as they lose their strategic identities. If we nerfed Shen's ult, players wouldn't pick Shen for the global pressure he brings - they'd just pick him if his ball of stats was greater than someone else's.\n\nNow this of course ends up with the question of how do you nerf something who's niche is so powerful in competitive and leads to hitting his weaknesses. By nerfing his Q and in essence damaging his waveclear, there's now a tradeoff for having such a powerful global ultimate. You are no longer capable of splitpushing like a monster while simultaneously providing the best global pressure in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Comrad Black","date":"2016-08-25T01:33:36.906+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"While I appreciate the clarification regarding the thought process behind the nerf, personally, it doesn't seem like a terribly effective way to balance him. The vast majority of Shen's waveclear is purchased. Sunfire's the big one, but there's also Titanic Hydra, Zz'Rot, and even Banner of Command. Anything that lets him effectively splitpush is purchased, not tied to his Q.\n\n(There's also he semi-meta issue of \"Well, if he can't push waves, what's the point of him being on his own, and in turn, having a global ult?\" but that gets a bit complicated/speculative). \n\nIf him being able to CS early on is an issue, make it completely unable to damage minions, force my little low-elo Shen soul learn how to CS properly. I'd rather be able to do *any* damage to my opponent early on then have a csing/waveclear crutch. It would completely kill jungle Shen, but the nerfs as they are do that anyway.\n\nIt's just a mix of frustrating and concerning, reading what Riot's trying to actually achieve with these changes, and how they think it will impact him. Removing 15-20% of a Shen's single target damage against champions,  so he has worse waveclear, is an _extremely_ brute force solution that will hurt solo players far more then the pro niche it's targeted at.","replies":[{"poster":"Cezium","date":"2016-08-25T02:37:39.136+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":9,"body":"Well for one it has hurt his waveclear based on the playtests we've run. I didn't think it was going to make much of a difference, but I definitely felt the weaker waveclear. In addition, in competitive play he's not buying most of the other things beyond Sunfire until much later in the game. Part of the goal for these changes is to force more of his itemization purchases towards waveclear.\n\nBut it is possible we do need to focus more of the bonus damage to minions, although that likely disproportionately effects low elo than high elo (who are generally much better at cs'ing)","replies":[{"poster":"Comrad Black","date":"2016-08-25T03:24:55.452+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's... encouraging? Probably the wrong word. Lessens my feeling of Riot blindly stat-smashing.\n\nTo combine this with a response with one to another reply you made to me about him not being about the damage: Sure, he's never been about the damage. He's arguably not really about being a tank, given that his base stats are 1-2 rune pages worse then most other tanks. He's about those moments when your macro play is on point, you ult someone who's getting 3 vs 1 dove under a tower, and you turn a certain death into a triple kill for your team. You get the joy of like an entire match playing support for a good team condensed into your team mate going  \"SHEN GOD! FUCK YEAH!\".\n\nBut those are moments. Laning makes up a ton of actual gameplay by time spent, and Shen's got so many losing match ups in lane right now. So many people building Black Cleaver, or dealing true damage, or spamming 15 dashes when he's only got one (hi Yasuo), or they're just simply a ranged champion. One of the only ways you can deal with that is, bluntly, to outplay them - to score the pull through, to hold on to your dash for the perfect moment to taunt them into taking tower shots. etc. Nerfing the sword pull through in particular is really concerning to me, since it reduces the reward for outplaying your opponent, and in turn makes his laning phase even more of a slog. \n\n(Doesn't matter if Q can 1-shot minions if you have to eat a full skill rotation each time you try to do anything other than cs under tower, since you deal zero damage) \n\nI wouldn't mind it if any of his skills functionally scaled with stats, but they don't, so it's not like I've really got the recourse of \"Well, you can build aggressively! AP Shen mah brutha!\" if these nerfs go through. (Some) folks at /r/Shen have had some luck basically just slapping AD assassin/bruiser items on him, but that seems like such a depressing failure of design if I've got to build a BF sword to do more that 3% of someone's health in lane. At that point it seems like you're far better off just playing Tahm Kench to (functionally - I realize it's based on Kench's health) get Shen's Q damage as a passive, a methadone version of his ult, and far better base stats.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"playtestpenguin","date":"2016-08-25T00:56:56.001+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"> If shens whole ''broken too much presence and impact '' because his ult, why are we nerfing his Q..?

Still unsure if it is the best thing to do. I know some of the team also raised concerns but in the end the decision was to go forward with them. I have a huge bias versus Jinx, I just really really dislike the champion. So anytime we buff her I usually raise immediate concerns about the state of the game.

A performance based MMR system could discourage aggressive plays, funneling CS/Kills onto scaling teammates, niche strategies such as proxy singed and many more interesting options that often are the \"better\" way to win the game.
