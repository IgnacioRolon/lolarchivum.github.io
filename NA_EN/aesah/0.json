Welcome to Patch Chat, a Dev Corner thread we make to talk about our new patches every two weeks: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-74-notes\r\n\r\nI&#039;m Aesah on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of Diamond+ players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to LoL in terms of both balance and fun. We&#039;ll be watching this thread to answer as many questions as we can.\r\n\r\n7.4 comes with a variety of changes. On the armor penetration front, Black Cleaver has been too consistently powerful as an offensive first item, so some of the power is being shifted into defensive stats. Last Whisper will a lot more effective in it&#039;s tank-busting role as a base item without the upgrades. Lethality seems decent right now, so Ghostblade is getting a nerf (Lethality is likely to be looked at more in the near future). For masteries, damage is going down across the board. In the bot lane, we&#039;re making Fervor a more attractive option relative to Warlord&#039;s Bloodlust which should lead to more exciting high moments rather than farmfests. Champions with notable changes include a big change to Cho&#039;gath&#039;s ultimate to encourage tank builds, nerfs to overperforming champions (Maokai, Jhin, Ryze, and Corki), and a roaming buff for Bard. \r\n\r\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\r\n\r\nAdam &quot;Afic&quot; Cohen\r\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\r\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\r\nNicolas &ldquo;Gleeb&rdquo; Haddad\r\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\r\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\r\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\r\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\r\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\r\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\r\nArnor &quot;TheLastAirbender&quot; Halldorsson","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Fishey","date":"2017-02-23T20:43:37.433+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Liked and understood all the changes, so no questions.

The main reason for this change was to prevent Shaco from using boxes to turret dive. Which personally was a nerf I don't see being needed. He's already fairly low on the jungle tier list. Who cares if he could eat a single tower shot will a well timed box? Lee build bruiser, has a shield, does similar damage, and can soak tower shots with his face like a boss... and still has a reliable escape.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jesuisunParpaing","date":"2017-02-23T21:31:15.769+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, in the name of every single Yorick main when will u release a new Yorick skin?

If you really want to enjoy playing Taliyah, don't be discouraged by her difficulty. It doesn't matter what level you play at- you will get better at a champion by playing it more.

Thanks for your time, guys!\n\nHey OTK,\n\nI definitely agree with you that Jhin is very defined by his long range capabilties and it may feel like we are reducing some of his cool long range presence. Sure, this does not make him as powerful as he is now in terms of long range presence but this nerf felt needed due to the fact that if he hits his first shot he basically lines up the massively damaging shots afterwards without too much effort. This is extremely rough for squishies that get caught by the first shot and basically get 100-0'd in late game by Jhin's ultimate. So, giving people a slightly larger window (.25 seconds, .75 -> .5 seconds)  to move freely to try to perhaps dodge or juke Jhin's shots helps. \n\nThanks for your comment!
