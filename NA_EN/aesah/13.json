Welcome to Patch Chat, a Dev Corner thread we make to talk about our new patches every two weeks: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-619-notes\n\nI&#039;m Aesah on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of Diamond+ players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to LoL in terms of both balance and fun. We&#039;ll be watching this thread to answer as many questions as we can. \n\n6.19 is a relatively quiet patch, with the most notable change being the revert of Kog&#039;Maw&#039;s &quot;press W then AFK&quot; rework. While some players will miss turret-Maw, we&#039;re expecting most to enjoy his new (old) playstyle more. There&#039;s been quite a lot of changes (itemization and meta) since we&#039;ve seen this iteration, so we&#039;ll be watching his performance closely and make sure he&#039;s in a good spot. In other news, Mundo and Corki received some buffs while Soraka, Kled, Twitch, Anivia, and Cassiopeia were nerfed by varying degrees to bring their power levels closer to &quot;fair&quot;. Udyr got some damage shifted around which hopefully makes him more satisfying to play. Some stuff happened to Aurelion Sol too, I&#039;m going to refrain from commenting as I personally have no idea how it will affect him but I&#039;ll make sure our resident dragon expert Cezium shares his thoughts for you guys.\n\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\n\nAdam &quot;_Afic_&quot; Cohen\nPreston &ldquo;_Hinderaga_&rdquo; Bunker\nBen &ldquo;_Cezium_&rdquo; Burkhardt\nShawn &ldquo;_I Am The IRS_&rdquo; Currie\nDon &ldquo;_Aesah_&rdquo; Ding\nNicolas &ldquo;_Gleeb_&rdquo; Haddad\nDan &ldquo;_penguin_&rdquo; Hardison\nMiles &ldquo;_Daydreamin_&rdquo; Hoard\nBao &ldquo;Bao&rdquo; Lam\nRobert &ldquo;_ROBERTxLEE_&rdquo; Lee\nNicholas &ldquo;_Nickwu_&rdquo; Smith\nBlake &ldquo;_S0be_&rdquo; Soberanis\nTrevor &ldquo;_ThEntropist_&rdquo; Thernes","replies":[{"poster":"Kasjusz0","date":"2016-09-21T22:05:51.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi :)\nIs Kog Maw in jungle still a good thing?\nWhat are ideas about his future, will he be able to play succesfull in jungle?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ThEntropist","date":"2016-09-21T22:27:47.194+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty sure he will no longer be able to jungle anymore.\n\nUnless you really use your passive well.","replies":[{"poster":"Skarnye West","date":"2016-09-22T00:09:13.955+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can confirm ThEntropist is really good at using Kog'Maw's passive","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Jarvis","date":"2016-09-22T17:58:07.138+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"http://bensbargains.com/thecheckout/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Burn.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2016-09-23T12:21:37.327+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not sure why you got downvoted, that was a very well played meme. +1","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Best Kog NA","date":"2016-09-21T22:35:12.760+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Challenge accepted","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LeadedWolf","date":"2016-09-21T22:29:29.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Thank you for nerfing {{champion:29}} now just need to work on Satan {{champion:17}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ThEntropist","date":"2016-09-21T22:38:54.284+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":2,"body":"Some things need nerfs.... others?.... others need deletion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Very Cash Money","date":"2016-09-21T20:12:23.301+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"What is your opinion on Zac?\n\nHe got solid\n- Damage\n- CC\n- Sustain\n- Tankyness\n\nIt really seems that he is just overall strong in everything a tank wants to be strong in. \nUsually a tank needs to sacrifice at least one or two of these traits, but it seems Zac just has them all.\n\nI believe the problem simply lies in the fact that his Damage is so high that he barely needs to optimize for damage items, thereby allowing tankyness. Innate tankyness is the one thing Zac lacks, but it doesn't really matter if he is free to invest all his money in it with seemingly no consequences. \n\nChamps like Amumu and Naut also have quite a lot of damage and CC, however they need to buy an item or two to really feel their damage, and it often comes at the expense of tankyness.\n\nIdk, Maybe I am just getting tired of being oneshot by a full tank Zac whenever I play immobile carries, but i would like to hear your oppinions on him.

Also I think the CC from landing a max range E, into ult, and then having E back up with enough CDR is a problem. \n\nThese are just what I would do and does not mean these changes are going through, or that Zac is being looked at. That decision is up to Live Gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Very Cash Money","date":"2016-09-21T21:41:59.709+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see, valid points. A lot of the power is loaded to E indeed and dodging it can be quite easy on some champs, but I disagree that its all tied into landing it. Zacs E still serves great power even when missed, and the risk of using it is just about nothing after level 6.\n\nHowever as some have commented the indicator is sort of hard to see, this one is annoying since it basically mean a zac jumbing from FoW will leave you half a second reaction time or something like that. According to the wiki Zacs E is literally as big in radius as malphites ultimate (300 each) but the shadow really don't do a good job showing that. \n\n Additionally while many champs have easy tools to dodge it there are two whole classes of champions (75% of adcs and mages) that just get thoroughly fucked since they can only move out of the unclear radius with their 330-400 movementspeed meaning they need to react at least 0.75 seconds before zac lands. And even then moving for these mages is as good as being stunned in a ganking situation since their direction gets forced.\n\nAnd as easy as it is to dodge as easy is it for Zac to use in other ways.\nThe great size and Range of his E simply allows for zoning, placing it a bit behind the enemy leaves them with a luxurious choice of walking straight into the enemy or getting smacked by a malphite ultimate. \n\nSo while it is very true that it is easily dodgeable for champs like lucian and Vlademir I still think the risk/reward on that spell is insanely low and that it for a bunch of other champions like jinx and lux just seems very hard to play around.\n\nThat said, I like the idea of fixing instant cast of his E and lowering the uptime. \nI would like to see maybe a bit reduced radius on it or perhaps something to make missing it more punishing.

The zoning power/forcing someone to move somewhere is very powerful, I just don't see it as a problematic power because he loses a lot if they dodge it. \n\n> And even then moving for these mages is as good as being stunned in a ganking situation since their direction gets forced.\n\nI would very much disagree with this. If you dodge the E pre-6 zac does very little to continue the gank. It would almost all be up to the enemy laner at that point. \n\n> So while it is very true that it is easily dodgeable for champs like lucian and Vlademir I still think the risk/reward on that spell is insanely low and that it for a bunch of other champions like jinx and lux just seems very hard to play around.\n\nAlso wanna say that dodging isn't the only option, a lot of things also can interrupt him out of it and that can really hurt his engage. So there are definitely things you can pick into Zac that will feel good. \n\n\n\nOverall I don't think reducing the AOE would make sense for the champion, if that becomes extremely unreliable the champion will struggle to function in his intended pattern imo. The indicator might need to be a bit clearer, but I think once people get used to looking at the shadow instead of the Zac, it is fairly easy to respond to.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2016-09-21T21:34:27.245+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"You mentioned his winrate is OK, of course if Zac was an insane tanky/dps/CC-bot then he would stomp every game- so I'd encourage you to analyze his weaknesses. You compared him to Nautilus/Amumu- relative to them, his CC is unreliable/shorter duration. I know I definitely am scared to even get within auto attack range as an ADC against an Amumu/Nautilus in teamfights fearing a Flash+Ult combo- Zac doesn't hold that equal threat (even though his ganks from fog are scarier). \n\nIt's also important to avoid hyperbole, I mean I don't think you truly believe a full tank Zac can actually 1-shot anything.","replies":[{"poster":"CrimsonCobra3","date":"2016-09-21T22:14:16.312+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Right now ADC is the only class of champion that is squishy enough to be one-shot by tanks, but we happen to have one in almost every game, and we rely on them to take objectives for us.

He completely counters mages. You can't ward his ganks, you're not safe under turret, you have virtually no chance of killing him, and your only way of escaping is Zac disengaging.\n\nA good Amumu's ganks can do lots of damage. A good Naut feels like a brick wall. Zac is both and with less counterplay. The first two have initiation range that is realistically wardable and blockable by minions; that alone is a huge amount of counterplay compared to \"hopefully you notice the shadow and have flash.\"\n\nThe first two also have meaningfully longer cooldowns, mana limitations, less sustained damage, no healing, and have a much harder time sticking to a target that uses an ability to get out of their lockdown zone. They're also worse at disengaging and much easier to catch in the event that they pick a losing fight.\n\nIf you do manage to kill him as a mage (just in theory or if you're, like, 3 levels up). it's extremely difficult to kill all four blobs before he revives and slingshots away.\n\nOf course, if you're Tryndamere or Yasuo then basically none of these problems apply to you. You just run down the Zac and kill him while your Maw shield soaks his entire ult and you heal through the rest of his damage.

He's literally outshined in all of his possible roles now by, lets face it, better champions.  Better range? Tristana, more viable too with the mobility and the ability to siege.  Want health carving for tanks? Twitch or Vayne, Twitch is a better option for team fights too and Vayne has more mobility and scales pretty hard late game, especially if someone can use that mobility properly.  Mage carry? Corki, cause let's face it, ap Kog is pretty much useless, Corki at least has those heavy hits in between whatever it is he does (kinda in a weird place right now too).  Considering the heavy cost of his ult, the low damage coefficient's of any of his skills and his lack of mobility, Kayle would even be a better pick at this point.\n\nYou took all the uniqueness from Kog and made him into a stationary ADC with no unique qualities whatsoever.  The least you could've done was just remove the \"double attack speed cap\" part of his w, left it to double his overall attack speed (would've let people build more damage and not get punished for having to stand still). Now people are going to have to stutter step on one of the least mobile champions in the game and be punished for taking advantage of his W, one of the most defining parts of his kit...  \n\nHe won't make it anywhere near the top of the ad charts and will always be outshined by {{champion:29}} , {{champion:67}} , {{champion:51}} , {{champion:18}} , {{champion:21}} , {{champion:236}} , hell, even {{champion:429}} .  \n\nCongrats Riot, you've succeeded in taking an idea so original that it actually had to change a game mechanic to work and turned it into another copy/paste of other champions but just lower quality.   \n\nRIP Kog, you were high risk and high reward and uniquely tailored as your own, individual champion.

The only reason the 10s was reasonable during the rework was because his kit heavily revolved around the insane W and rendered everything else in his kit non-existent. The mana cost and additional mana costs need to be reverted as well if we're going to shift all the power away from his W.\n\nSecondly, I feel that this new \"execute\" version of his Ult is particularly weaker than the double damage on champions version. What made the old Kog'Maw shine was the fact that his ult was an effective harassment tool and it felt satisfying to land them. In the ultimate's current state, even a squishy target won't feel the effects of whatever shadow was landing on top of them until they were \"below xx% health.\" Now does that sound like an ultimate ability to you? Now I do realize that effectively the ult does more damage than before when an enemy is below 25% health, but that is a situation that a Kog'Maw without a harassment tool aside from W will ever find during laning phase. Outside of laning phase, there may be a few situations where a target will be under 25% health, _but_ rarely ever will that target be within ult range. \n\nClosing notes:\n\nSince the Riot team decided to revert the **major** W change in Kog'Maw's kit, the rest of his kit became unbalanced or a better way to put it may be _unrefined_. I understand that the passive attack speed was given back to Q, but the major problem at the moment is keeping the reworked Ultimate. The mana costs to use it to an effective extent are too overwhelming for what it actually offers in the long run. One way to make the current costs reasonable is if stacks offered additional damage in a similar sense to how Kassadin's ultimate works, but then again that would remove the uniqueness of that concept. \n\nI hope the Riot team can look at how to bring Kog'Maw's kit up-to-date with the current game.

As a champion, she can perma slow with her e. Therefore She can always escape any engagement, or chase down foes making escape impossible.\n\nShort patch notes, changes were fine...\n\nBut whats all your opinions on Ivern??","replies":[{"poster":"Aesah","date":"2016-09-21T21:17:52.056+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah Kog's skill order had some issues where many players found it optimal to not even level their Q at all until the midgame- that's super lame.\n\nCassio definitely gains a huge power spike from Rylai's- I wouldn't pinpoint that interation as her \"problem\" (before even discussing if she has a problem at all). Anyway, the fact is that Rylai's is there so she will build it. That being said, there's been a lot of discussion revolving around Rylai's at the office although nothing set in stone.\n\nRegarding Ivern, as much as I want to keep this thread focused on 6.19, I expected this question to pop up and there isn't any other good way to reach us about it until he releases, so I'll allow it. I think Ivern is a really risky champion design with game-warping implications when someone picks him- and that's a good thing! I'd expect his unique playstyle and theme to appeal to players who haven't found their main yet in the champion roster yet and would be happy to see new Ivern mains (as long as they aren't on the enemy team).\n\nAlso, Ivern has a really cool interaction with Blitzcrank.","replies":[{"poster":"majulito","date":"2016-09-21T22:30:25.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think rylais itself is a big problem. I think all the cdr added to mage items along with the decrease in ap makes rylais too appealing. Before the mage update mages had to choose between high ap or cdr or in other words burst vs dps. With more cdr and less ap mages are forced in the dps direction. Rylias works well when you have low cooldowns because you can proc it more. In addition rylias is one of the highest ap giving items while providing good health so theres no reason to not get it.\n\nHonestly for the preseason I hope you guys focus on items specifically cdr. I don't feel certain champs are properly tuned for having such high amounts of cdr being availalbe. For example Lucian and Jhin having high cdr while still having good damage or mages \"abusing rylias\" (quotes because i feel they are forced to go that way from the update).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"int is success","date":"2016-09-21T22:21:56.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The de-worked Kog'maw has made me find adc super fun, and the element of skill is super impactful of his gameplay.
