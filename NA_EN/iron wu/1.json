A team where the people holding the rope (let's call them rhythm keepers) keep a rhythm and the jumper keeping his own rhythm. But how is the jumper suppose to do anything if the others can't keep there rhythm? then you have high ello players, or in this example, good \"rhythm keepers\" come in here telling the jumper on the other team \"it's not your team members you just need to learn and git gud\"\nIn league of course you are a rhythm keeper and a jumper, work with your team as well as managing your own skill.

To actively improve requires not only the drive to improve but the ability to recognize ones mistakes and activley try and fix them the next game.  \n\nThings like remembering enemy summoner times, roughly judging where the enemy jungle is, wave control, zone control, rotations, champion matchups, good ward placements and locations, good cs etc.  All these things need to be researched out of the game through guides, videos and having someone explain it and then thought about in game.  Not everything at once, but one at a time until they are all mastered.\n\nIf after a game people are just thinking \"yeah yeah, I lost, I probably need to ward some more in lane so I die less to ganks\" but don't do it next game they can play 1000 games and still be stuck in bronze/silver","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Troy242621","date":"2017-02-27T05:03:48.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a reason some people consistently climb into silver/gold/plat/diamond/master/challenger and some don't, and it isn't because of champion balance or coin flips.\n-----\n**And since I can't resist:**\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmeou8BM7vU&list=PL7QidrpYXjfFJ0_aosDXmsftCeQWLCf7-&index=2","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-02-27T04:55:23.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please.
