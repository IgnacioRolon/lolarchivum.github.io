I sent my laptop to the repair shop and sure they did a good job but, I still had the dnsunlocker. I did everything I could with the information I found online but, even after all that it kept coming back. So, I blew up and in a rage induced haze I did a pc reset. It was gone and everything seemed fine. I downloaded/reinstalled my online games. I have no issues from everything I usually do on my laptop. This happened 3 weeks ago.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I decided I wanted to start playing League again after over 2 years of taking off from League. I downloaded/installed League, Adobe Air, Directx, and when that was done I opened the launcher to start downloading more. It closed the launcher and said PVP.net Patcher Kernel has stopped working. So, I dug around League posts to see if there was a solution to this. Yes, I have tried to run as administrator.\r\n\r\nI just don't know what to do since, I am not tech savvy. Did my pc reset remove something that is needed to play League? I have no issues with my other online games. A solution to my dilemma would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-16T17:11:47.493+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like your OS is blocking the patcher from scanning files and preventing the game from launching.
