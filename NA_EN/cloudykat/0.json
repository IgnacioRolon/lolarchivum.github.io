My friend, the Rakan, had 2/0/18 and got an S+, whereas I got 18/0/3 and an S-. I had 153 cs within a 25 minute game, which is roughly 6 cs/m. I broke 3 inhibs and 2 turrets... Please tell me what I'm doing wrong or what I have to do to get an S on Xayah, because I'm trying to get to mastery 7.

Keep in mind that each champion type has slightly different [**requirements for higher grades**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide), and you're also being compared to how well other players do with that champion.

I recommend going into custom games and practicing just pure cs mechanics so you can boost those numbers up a bit!","replies":[{"poster":"cloudykat","date":"2017-05-29T04:39:54.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the advice, I'll definitely keep that in mind for next time!","replies":[]}]}]}
