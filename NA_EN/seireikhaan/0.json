Yes, one of those terrible people that suck if we get put on something we're unfamiliar with.  My pony happens to, in fact, be a pony.  I've climbed from, at my bottom, Bronze IV(early season 3), to finally hitting Diamond V on the back of Hecarim.  I just want to offer a few words of encouragement to all the people climbing, to all the people who wonder if the champs they play aren't good enough.  \r\n\r\nWhen the struggle seems real, when you get seemingly braindead or toxic teammates, take a step back and realize the grander perspective.  Take a short break, pick up other hobbies, get some fresh air.  I started my series yesterday and got 0-2'd, forced into roles I'm less comfortable on and I took a beating.  I took my break, picked it back up today, and stormed the fields of justice(or whatever they are now) and rampaged through my first two games before finally taking a backseat in the last.  I did not hard carry, did not get the early kills, and we fell slightly behind early.  Do not let setbacks demoralize you, take them as the challenge they are, an obstacle to be overcome, after which you will have been the better for it.  \r\n\r\nAnd to the one trick ponies, if you really really love your champ, don't let nerfs or meta falter your faith.  Now that doesn't mean \"do silly things\" like AD Janna jungle, use some sense and try to help your team, but don't let bad matchups discourage you.  Learn those matchups.  Every matchup *can* be worked in solo queue, even if it's a lot of work.\r\n\r\nGod bless and good luck on the rift, y'all.","replies":[{"poster":"Blackwindy","date":"2015-01-31T13:46:41.559+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My first promos to plat started with an afk and ended up with a feeding botlane, now I'm in 2nd promos to plat.

Anyways, as for how?  Some patience and persistence, first off.  I had some dark days in season 4 to be honest where I played a bit of nocturne when I got stomped by some kha's when he still had the alistar ult, but I got over that when it really just boiled down to me having more fun on hecarim.  If you want some actual gameplay tips, that'd be a really broad question, but to boil it down to something really simple, use your mobility to either make plays around the map, or use it to camp the everloving heck out of a lane by abusing E(with ghost if available) and running straight into a lane and fearing someone into bad positions over and over again.\n\n\nBuild?  Movespeed quints, armor pen reds, armor yellows, MR/level glyphs or CDR/level glyphs if I don't need MR.   21-9-0 masteries, making sure to grab blade/spell weaving(hecarim's q is has fantastic interaction with these), dangerous game(great mastery, but even more ridiculous for tanky intiators because it scales with %HP), and executioner, of course.  I'll upgrade machete to stalkers, as the bork-type active is brutal and makes your early ganks really scary.  Usually juggernaut encant, but if I get two or more early kills or the game is looking particularly snowbally, I'll grab warrior.  I prefer juggernaut, generally, because the 500 hp lets me make more consistent plays, while warrior makes me squishier and limits my options to being more assassin-y.  2nd item is tri-force, pretty much always.  Occasionally I've put it off to a 3rd item because the enemy comp is very imbalanced towards magic or physical damage, but if you're not getting trinity force on hec, you're playing the wrong champion.  Gauntlet is not an acceptable substitution, the slow field does not compensate for the fact that you basically don't do damage. \n\n Aside from that, I generally go very tanky because teams will expect me to initiate fights and squishy full damage builds *will* get blown up almost instantly unless you've got other people to start fights for you.  Randuins and Frozen heart(frozen heart if juggernaut, randuins if warrior, then usually the other one later) are the armor items of choice for max attack speed slows.  Spirit Visage is the preferred MR item, but sometimes you just need banshees because the other team is super pick oriented(ahri/elise/blitz et).  Locket can be a good addition if the team lacks a tanky support and the aura and active won't go to waste.  The tank items just depend on what the enemy team presents as threats.\n\nOh and boots.  If you go juggernaut you can kinda get whatever boots you feel comfortable with.  I'll usually go tabi because ADC's are the biggest threat to your existence as tank-initiator hecarim, but swifties and mobis can be useful.  If ahead, alacrity enchantment can be really excellent for providing you extra stick when  you don't have randuins yet.  Otherwise early homeguards can allow you to zip to struggling lanes fast and relieve pressure or let you camp a lane without mercy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-01-31T22:00:48.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i' m not him/her, but if it does not reply back... http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA1/43446698","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lt Cuddles","date":"2015-01-31T04:17:15.012+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:107}} \"So far I am along the path, that I must strain to hear the clumsy clatter of their pursuit...know this, my brother, they may fowl the way with their charred and broken bones, but they will not stop the journey!\"","replies":[{"poster":"B1naryB0t","date":"2015-01-31T17:08:03.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Inspiring.","replies":[{"poster":"Lt Cuddles","date":"2015-01-31T18:09:20.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you~","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hizsoo","date":"2015-01-31T17:15:37.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, Hecarim with his optimal build deals damage (builds on of the OP items for it), gets tanky and moves fast.
