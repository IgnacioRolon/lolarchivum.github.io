I clicked enchant on hex-tech crafting star guardian jinx skin. But my game started lagging (somehow) and i guess i accidentally clicked rental and all the orange essence i've been saving up is gone. Is there anyway to get it back? I haven't played any games with it and i really want it i've invested so much time getting chests for it and now all i have is a sir kled skin (who i dont even play)  and around 1600 orange essence. So again can anyone please tell me or find me a way to contact someone who can get it back.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-28T21:40:57.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't make any guarantees because even with lag there are confirmations before proceeding with a hextech action.
