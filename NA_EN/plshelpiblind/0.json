It's not the worst thing but I have definitely lost a few exchanges because of it. My Laptop is fairly new, this only started AFTER I updated Windows 10. If someone could please shed some light on this issue and give a solution, I would be grateful.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-04T03:47:53.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you've recently updated Windows 10, a good first step would be to make sure that the Game DVR is still turned off.
