They also stated it was not an accidental ban, but was intentional and would not be lifted.\r\n\r\nI really need clarity on this, I do not understand how one account can be banned that four other account have used the same pcs.\r\nnone of us use 3rd party and have all shared the same pc.\r\n\r\nHow is no other account banned for the same reasons as the first one?\r\n\r\n Is there no way to get this pointed out and fixed? it is clearly a mistake yet they won't listen to anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-30T03:18:46.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and pulled up the chat you were having with Deme, and it looks like the agent did explain why he was unable to talk to you about this account being banned. You already mentioned you aren't the original creator of the account so sadly we can't go into detail on that suspension. \n\nThe reason that only one account was punished is most likely because that one account was the only one detected running third party programs. It's likely your friend might have had something running in the background which was detected. Again, our agents can't discuss this account with anyone except for the original creator, but we can absolutely go into more detail with them in a ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"Hydroxyphenyl","date":"2017-07-02T23:05:33.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"During my talk with Deme, my friend who was banned was talking to another mod about it.\n\nThey wouldn't tell them anything at all either.\n\nThey wouldn't explain anything or mention anything.\nIt was literally like talking to a brick wall.\nThere was no support or help or explanation to clarify what is happening.\n\nNone of us use third party programs and only one account being banned permanently makes no sense.\n\nIs there some sort of appeal process to this?\nIs it possible to send files in, or anything to have it cleared up?\nOr even actually explained to the owner of the account?\n\nThere is clearly some sort of mistake happening but nobody wants to own up to it.\n\nI don't mean to sound rude, but when someone tells you something was done and they have proof of it and it won't be reverted.\nWhen infact they are wrong and nobody did anything is a little frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-03T00:11:16.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't comment on anything pertaining to an account unless talking with the original account creator. I do have that chat log pulled up, and Deme was able to explain why we can't disclose info about someone elses account, as well as why we can't say specifically what programs were detected.\n\nI can't say much about what happened in your friends ticket because A) That was his ticket and it wouldn't be right to disclose that info and B) I don't have that ticket info to even pull it up. I can say for sure that if your friend still has questions about what happened, *they* can open up a ticket to open that discussion back up. However we won't be able to discuss their account without anyone except the creator.","replies":[{"poster":"Hydroxyphenyl","date":"2017-07-03T01:34:19.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know.
