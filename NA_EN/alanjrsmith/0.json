Im also playing on a macbook air and i thought I'm the only one that's experiencing this problem. I don't think it has something to do with the razer headset bullshit. This is clearly a problem that has something to do with this patch I'm not sure what it might be but i think it's not that compatible on mac. Sorry for bad english and for the saltiness of this post, I had too much lays yesterday{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2016-01-22T23:54:03.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Alan and Languishing,\n\nWe've noticed that a couple of players using the Razer Kraken headset have been experiencing similar issues (black screen when the loading screen should come up).

I had a hunch it was the razer kraken 7.1 headphones because I never really had problems with patches/updates. I had to uninstall razer synapse completely and re-install league of legends (even though razer synapse was gone) until it was completely fixed. I guess i'll have to try and return that pretty headphones :( waah oh well.  - languishing\n\nps: WANNA REFUND MY TWO PLACEMENT LOSSES CAUSED BY THIS DREADFUL BUG/GLITCH.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HadesBlades","date":"2016-01-23T02:36:25.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue too... and i am constantly having to re-load my game.
