Since we don't support custom modifications to League's files, I won't be able to assist with any other method of disabling this.\n\nSince you're not able to replace the mice, you may be able to configure the mouse wheel to a blank action or a key that doesn't do anything in League to prevent the zoom issues happening in a match. You'll have to do this through any sort of software your gaming mice would have shipped with. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
