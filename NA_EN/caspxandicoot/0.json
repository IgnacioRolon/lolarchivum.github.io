Pls help","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i was playing league sunday, just playing some solo queue trying to gain some elo and then i leave to go out to eat with my family because it was mothers day. I come home to log in and see i was permanently suspended? It said i was banned until  Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 UTC 2100. I see in the forums that 2100 is something with account security compromise? I have never gave anybody my account information. I got a notification like 3 days ago that it said somebody tried to log in to my account or somebody did log in to my account? Soon as i got that i changed my password.  Nobody has been on my account to my knowledge but ive spent way to much time and money on this game to be banned for no reason. Please help me i already opened a support ticket but it's been 24 hours and I havent gotten a reply.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-15T20:55:27.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've got your account and ticket pulled up now, and it looks like someone may have been able to get on your account without your permission.
