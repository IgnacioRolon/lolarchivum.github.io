I'm not trolling, I'm sincerely asking if you guys (Riot) will ever take the \"can't connect due to firewall\" issue seriously, so that the many people affected by this can play? \r\n\r\nI was fortunate enough to suddenly be able to join games thanks to WTFast, but suddenly two days ago even that quick on me, and ever since then I have been unable to join ranked and normal games. Bot games work fine, for some reason.\r\nI'm tired of searching for solutions.\r\nI'm tired of doing thousands of useless tests for you guys.\r\nI'm tired of reading about how everyone has this massive issue and you guys refuse to do anything about it.\r\nEither refund me for the money I have spent, or help us with this issue. Oh, and maybe pardon us from the Leave Buster. Perhaps you could change the prompt message to\r\n\r\n\"We are sorry that you can't play and that is why you afk'd\" msg, to which we can only answer \"You don't care\"\r\n\r\nEither help us out, or just flat out tell us to stop caring and go play another game. THIS IS an issue on your end.","replies":[{"poster":"mufasas1lion","date":"2015-02-26T17:48:19.970+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot you need to find out why every patch is screwing someone's computer over, you should try searching around in the patcher files or see how adding new information gets misplaced upon downloading.\ni think you guys really suck for making such a good game give the worst experiences the world can offer...\nlike never fixing the problems of FPS drops and how you never REALLY told the truth about the SR2 WOULDN'T make people with regular computers lag.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ODedonlife","date":"2015-03-05T07:24:53.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found a way to beat this issue!

It's never been \"solved.\" I've pretty much chalked it up to my router just being incompatible with Riot's method of connecting after champion select. I've gone through a couple computers since then, and a few different software and firewall configurations. I've completely disabled and uninstalled my firewall, as well as the Windows one (well, not uninstalled, but poked around in the registry and whatnot.) I've port-forwarded and messed with settings until the cows came home. There's clearly nothing I can do when any friend I have come over, experiences the same issue over my network. I've contacted my ISP several times and they never know what to do. \n\nOne key factor I've mentioned on my dozens and dozens of forum responses (I respond whenever I see this mentioned) is that I DON'T HAVE THE ISSUE THE FIRST GAME OF EVERY MAP TYPE AFTER A PATCH. It connects without fail. Second game on SR, HA, what have you, I'm pressing \"reconnect\" over and over. \n\nHowever, I no longer live with this issue. I've found a workaround that doesn't make sense considering it STILL doesn't connect properly without a firewall. BUT, I use my Firewall software to circumvent the issue. I use AVG. What I do is set it to \"interactive mode,\" which prompts me to give permission to each new program to allow or disallow it through the firewall. If I manually allow it each time, and don't prompt it to save the rule, I can connect immediately after the prompt. \n\nI really recommend you try a similar feature on your firewall and see if it works for you. Even though it makes no sense to me, you'd think some wise techie at Riot (is that an oxymoron?) would be able to at least gain some insight into what causes the issue, based on A. my solution, and B. the unique factor of it only connecting immediately after a patch.\n\nOn a basic, idiot level, it leads me to believe that something about the application being \"new\" is okay with my router. But after he's already seen it once, he doesn't want to let it through again. Why????\n\nPerhaps they've given up because there are so many unique situations under which this occurs, but I'm using the old Westell A90-7500 whatever-whatever that has cropped up numerous times in discussion of this issue. I'm willing to bet that if you have the same router, this is happening for the same reasons and my \"solution\" will work for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Geistrum","date":"2015-02-27T00:37:20.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Re-installing the thing fixed it.....for now. (Only tried in custom) Firewall still enabled.  Only thing about patching was at 83% the kbps went to 0, but it patched to 85% then kbps went to back up.  Then after being at 96% for a while, it went straight to launch.  For some reason now, I get the server is busy at log in.  My friend said they had it since 2 patches ago.
