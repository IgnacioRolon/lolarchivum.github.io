Out of all Champions, that need visual changes, she is without question one of the healthiest at all, so don't expert her to be changed in the next 3-4 years, unless the ChampUp team magically gets much more resources and maybe comes up with a clean up masterplan on top of it.\n\nDragonslayer has so much potential in general and could be brought more in line with the modern ones of Pantheon & Braum. Heartseeker, also starting of a whole theme of skins, looks totally horrible as ingame model, while having a very good splash art. All of her skins (not counting SKT, Arclight & Soulstealer) could definitly be brought to the next level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2017-02-02T21:41:47.586+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actual question; recently Riot used the Aurelion tech on Cass to give her tail a well-deserved animation do-over. Would the same be possible for characters with capes, coat-tails or other prominent clothing element to make them flow more naturally? Fiora's a really good example where her cape flows naturally and moves with her if she turns, stops, etc. Could this tech be applied to Vayne, Jayce and Lucian (who currently have rigid clothing)?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot PizzaNinja","date":"2017-02-02T19:05:24.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne was my first main.
