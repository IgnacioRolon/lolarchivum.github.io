MACOS 'Trying to reconnect'!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey all,\r\nI'm using the MACOS client, it goes to the 'trying to reconnect' screen every time I log in. Once I log in, the mission bars are empty so I'm not able to see what missions I have to do and my progress on it, and also I can't swap my icons because the icon bar is also empty when I click on it. Is anyone facing the same issue? \r\n\r\nNOTE: I tried reinstalling the program yesterday and everything was working fine, and now, it's back to the same old problem that has been occurring for days. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-23T16:48:36.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there's a network issue that's struggling to download assets.
