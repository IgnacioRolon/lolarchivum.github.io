Not that I saw a difference, but I just hate when windows changes my configs.\n\nWhat I did:\n1/ Search for 'xbox' in ur windows-start bar. A xbox app green icon should be shown. Launch it.\n2/ Log in with your windows infos, create an account if you don't have one.\n3/ Once you're in it, open the \"hamburger\" menu on the left.\n4/ Settings\n5/ Clic on the \"DVR Games\" tab\n6/ Turn the recording thing OFF.\n\nIt helped me, hope it will help you too.\n\nPeople on cs, wow, dark souls and all got the problem.\n\nPS: try to do a quick search before posting a request : http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/search?query=windows+10&application_id=PEr1qIcT&created_from=now-1d&content_type=discussion","replies":[{"poster":"Darkshinei1","date":"2016-10-02T13:21:46.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh i tried this before and now i tried other things and still didn't work :< fps its like 100 and randomly goes down","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-02T20:52:32.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since disabling the Game Bar didn't resolve your issue, I suspect there may be issues with your display drivers or windows power settings.
