I suggest you approach this as a broader challenge about changing your behavior rather than just being about LoL bans. That means, in a word, therapy. But that doesn't necessarily involve lying on a psychiatrist's couch at $300 an hour - it just means actively working to change your behavior or outlook in a directed way.
