As such her range sits between the lowest ranged champion, and the highest melee champion at 310. She fights by choosing a target, and focusing them down. When focusing melee champions she can effectively re-position her enemies to ensure victory. Due to the need to manage her positioning and the positioning of enemies, Dysel is resourceless.\r\n\r\n####**Abilities:**\r\n\r\n#####Passive - There can be only one:\r\nWhen Dysel takes lethal damage she instead becomes downed. While downed Dysel cannot be damaged, but may be healed. If the enemy that Dysel last dealt damage to dies while Dysel is downed she rises back to her feet with 20%/40%/60% of her maximum health plus any healing that she received while downed. If the enemy does not die, then Dysel dies regardless of healing she may have received.\r\n\r\n#####Q - Know Your Place:\r\nDysel selects one enemy within 400/450/500/550/600 range and moves them instead to 310 range. While being moved enemies are stunned. _5.5s CD_\r\n\r\n#####W - Sweeping Strike:\r\nDysel sweeps her weapon in an arc in front of her, knocking up enemies in the area and dealing 90/130/170/210/250 (+ 100% bonus AD), _8s CD._\r\n\r\n#####E - Vaulting Split:\r\nOn first activation Dysel starts running, gaining 15% bonus movement speed, upon second activation Dysel pole vaults high into the air becoming untargetable for a brief moment, before  bringing her bardiche down in a deadly strike. The distance traveled during the vault is proportional to the distance traveled while running. 110/140/170/200/230 (+ 100% total AD), _15s CD._\r\n\r\n#####R - Battle Focus:\r\nDysel chooses an enemy within 1200 range, and marks them for 10s. While the mark is active Dysel takes 20%/40%/60% less damage from all unmarked targets, and deals 120/135/150% damage to marked targets. Additionally while moving towards marked targets Dysel gains 10%/20%/30% movement speed, and 20% tenacity. If Dysel kills a marked target the ability's CD is reset, however if someone else kills the target the CD is doubled. _45s CD._\r\n\r\n##Lore:\r\nBorn the the Rakkor tribe, Dysel found herself subject to the brutal training of her people, and the Rite of Kor, a ceremony in which two Rakkor teens fight to the death for the right to bear a relic-weapon. When Dysel's trial came she was denounced by a fellow Rakkor who refused to fight. If not fighting your hardest was considered a slight on the strength of your opponent then the refusal to fight at all was the greatest shame that a Rakkor could place upon another.\r\n\r\nInstead of getting to fight, Dysel was forced to walk away with the knowledge that her opponent would be executed for refusing to participate in the rite. \r\n\r\nWhen Dysel returned to her home she locked herself inside to brooded for days. When she emerged she was presented with her relic weapon. She had dreamed of that moment all of her life, and now it was just being given to her. Her struggles, the countless hours of training, every moment of hardship she had endured had been invalidated and her moment of victory had been stolen from her. The ceremony felt empty and meaningless.\r\n\r\nWeeks passed, and Dysel continued brooding. The contempt she felt for the one that had done this to her grew to where she could stand it no longer. She went to her tribe leader and demanded to know the burial site of the offender only to find out that instead her opponent had been absolved and even taken to the peak with the Solari.\r\n\r\nDysel spent months watching the path from the peak, waiting for Leona to descend so that she could have her battle, and finally feel like she had earned the Relic weapon in her hands. However, the coward decided to sneak away in the middle of the night to join the league. So naturally Dysel followed.\r\n\r\n> _\"Leona, you can run all you like, but we will have our battle, and I will show everyone that I have earned this.\"_ - Dysel","replies":[{"poster":"Dvolt","date":"2014-05-20T04:51:03.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Polearms FTW.\n\nBack to less serious business. So, How long is her passive in effect for? Is it like a 3 second duration, or based on range of corpse to target? The only reason I recommend a duration is because it would probably have some bad interactions with late game respawn timers. \n\nFor her Q, how is she causing them to come closer? Is she physically grabbing them, using some kind of Magnetism? How would a player understand that they've been grabbed by Dysel? I'm cool with the gameplay design as it keeps them within melee range, just wondering about the thematic justification.\n\nI find myself questioning wether resources champions get to have such powerful CC on so low a Cooldown. AOE knock ups are mean, after all. (Yes, I know Alistar exists...) I'm sorta iffy about the ratio, but if she's designed as a tanky dos champion, the bonus ad ratio is legit. Around what size is the cone? Closer to Pantheon's E, or crazy long like Aatrox's? \n\nNearly forgot about her troll-pole! It's cool, but given the badassery of the Rakkorian people, I don't think she should be invulnerable. After all, Pantheon's Man-drop (lite) is interruptible, so shouldn't her jump function similarly? Unlike Leona or Diana, we don't hear that much about her weapon being elemental or what not. Also, she already has tons of damage mitigation with her ultimate and passive. \n\n\nLike the ult, conceptually. However, I feel as though it's a bit too loaded. Damage reduction and tenacity, while getting a major damage increase roughly equal to an Infinity Edge crit? Given it's power, I feel it should only get a partial reset on kills, similar to Master Yi's Highlander. \n\nMy only question is if the cool downs scale per level, because right now, they all feel super low with tons of power. If Dysel misses an ability, she doesn't seem punished for it. Mind you, we have a lot of champions who it would make thematic sense to be manaless ({{champion:80}}) but just aren't. \n\nAnyways, keep it up!","replies":[{"poster":"NoxiousIce","date":"2014-05-22T22:02:00.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry it took me so long to reply to this, I greatly appreciate the feedback!\n\nSo as far as the duration on the passive goes, I wasn't sure how long I was comfortable with, but three to four seconds should probably be the absolute maximum. I'd like there to be time for her team to realize that she has gone down, and react to it, but also reward the reaction, without rewarding unintentional action on their part.\n\nFor her Q interaction, I imagined that she would either push them away by extending her pole arm out, forcing them to back up a bit to avoid being stabbed, and when pulling them closer it would be hooking it behind them much like Darius' ability. The whole thing was inspired by the concept that pole fighters generally have a range of effectiveness and that if the enemy is too close, they have to back them up before they can effectively continue to fight them.\n\nThe resources thing was to balance the idea that she has to manage the positions of her enemies and her relation to them fairly closely. I didn't feel that anything she did was innately magical either so Mana didn't really make sense. Additionally many mana champions aren't actually gated very well anyway, and perhaps with the exception of manamune and frozen heart there aren't any items she would be able to build even if she did have mana. I'd be ok with putting a gating mechanic on her, but mana wouldn't fit very well.\n\nThe cone's size I imagined to be roughly the size of Cassiopeia's ultimate's visual telegraph (the blue cone that is shown while casting, not its actual range) so very wide, but not very long. I never figured that the knock up duration would be particularly long though, just something short (like they're having to jump over her sweep).\n\nPerhaps the invulnerability doesn't fit with her thematically. I only put it on there because the idea was that she was pole vaulting OVER things, and she is interrupt-able during the potentially long wind up. She also doesn't get to stay up there like fizz does. I didn't want the 2d skill shots like Lux's light binding to interrupt her movement once she is in the air. Due to the wind up on it, it isn't intended to be used for damage mitigation, but inevitably it will because people would learn to use her eventually. Perhaps it should function more like Hecarim's ultimate, where it cant be interrupted from moving (only during the jump phase), but is still target-able.\n\nYou're probably right about the ultimate, maybe it could be unloaded a bit by changing the CD mechanic. The point was that I didn't want her to waste her ultimate to get to a target, and then never get there because one support decided that they were going to use one of their 4 CC based abilities. Combine that with a less tanky version of Poppy's ult and that's what I was trying to make. With the current CD mechanic it does mean that she has to deal the final blow for maximum effectiveness, which also kinda clashes with the rest of her tank based design. Do you have any suggestions that would allow the ult to continue during a fight, but not clash thematically or have too much power?\n\nAs far as her CDs in general go I intended the CDs listed to be her final lvl 18CDs before CDR, so perhaps they should scale per lvl and end there.  \n\nThanks so much for providing feedback, and I look forward to hearing from you again.","replies":[{"poster":"Dvolt","date":"2014-05-24T01:27:15.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gosh, sorry about the delay. Lots of things going on, so I had to take a bit more time than usual. Anyway... here goes!\n\nSo, I feel there's only one thing about the passive I dislike, and it's a pretty significant note. While Dysel is downed, she cannot be damaged, but can be targeted by allies for heals. This is a pretty major readability issue, mostly for your team. Pretending I'm a Soraka, and I see an ally who's low on HP, I'd end up using \"Wish...\" Only to find that your Hit points are still super low. This is super confusing already, right? But then, after someone kills your rival... Dysel comes back. What use is there in being able to heal someone if she dies when you fail to avenge her? It  causes teams to feel like they've wasted their efforts trying to help. Mind you, I like the concept for the passive. It's the ultimate revenge, proving her superiority over her rivals... But what happens when a Turret gets the kill, or a Jungle creep, or even a Minion? Would your team be able to kill the minion to get her back? I feel doubtful about this, but it's funny to think of.\n\nCool! I missed that part for the Q, so I have an idea about it. Right now, the only benefit you have for ranking up the skill is range, as it's currently damageless. Because I think that abilities with cc need *some* amount of damage to go with it (Unless it's Nasus, but that ability is a slow which almost becomes a stun it feels like...) I'll propose a trade off. If Dysel pushes the enemy away, she'll deal more damage, whereas pulling them toward her will deal significantly less damage. While either way it leads into an auto-attack, I feel that Dysel would have probably cause more pain by pushing an enemy away with the pole arm than if she pushed them, you know?\n\nI hear you about the resourceless thing. The only reason I'm iffy about a champion being resourceless is that most concepts in this sub-area seem to use alternative resources for no reason whatsoever besides being cool. It makes sense in this case, because she's a warrior fueled by revenge and what not, such as Renekton. Just remember that Mana costs don't need to be scary! And I'll admit, unless I'm actually spamming, mana doesn't hurt me when I play J4 and Malphite. The thing about managing your position is sorta how I think of Riven, where she's a very mobility/dps based caster who needs to weave in and out.\n\nGiven my brief experience with Cassiopea (Still need to buy her... after Fizz), I feel that's a fair range for it. Just don't add too long of a knock up that it becomes absurd. I know that statement is obvious (4 second knock up /=/ Balanced), but it's still important nonetheless. I'm sorta thinking it's around the duration of Riven's 3rd cast of Broken wings, if that's fair. Also, what's the AOE for her jump like, as I noticed that's not super clear.\n\nFor all I appreciate the logic for her being invulnerable, we also have to take a look at precedent here. Even when Riven, Kha'zix, Tristana, and Rengar do their leap of badassery, they still get to be stopped mid-flight. For all we joke about Fizz's Playful/Trickster, there's a thematic reason for his ability to doge everything. Fizz is an adorable joker who is small enough to avoid things on his pole (Even things he shouldn't...). Dysel is probably not as small as a Yordle, unless she's a very short Rakkorian. I'm not opposed to it, but given that she's supposed to be a tanky-dps like champion, it doesn't make sense for her to have points where the enemy team must hit her team, ya know?\n\nSee, the other thing is that her Passive punishes her for using her ultimate, ya know? If she does her whole shtick and dies as a tanky champion after unloading her kit on to the enemy team, allowing her team to get kills... her ultimate refreshes at twice the normal cool down, something I think you identified in your response. Given the less active nature of her current passive, I think Dysel needs something a bit more than just \"Damage Steroid against One person!\" as it doesn't really promote being a Tanky Gal like Poppy's ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Dvolt","date":"2014-05-24T02:23:48.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"However, if you're super set upon the Ultimate's core, I think there's a solution for you. The whole basis of her idea being vengeful, I'll suppose a crazy and possibly stupid idea. As we've seen with Yasuo, Ultimate abilities do not always have to be available. I would propose that instead, Dysel is only able to cast her ultimate upon Targets who have dealt a large amount of damage to her, with a snazzy indicator to show that a target could have this ability used upon them, similar to Cho'Gath's ult which has a red ring around targets who will die...\n\nAs Yasuo has proven ,if an Ultimate ability is limited in its availability, it can be statistically stronger. Now, how much damage is enough? I'd like it to be a scaling percentage, going from maybe 25% -> 20% -> 15% of Max health, with the \"Revenge!\" or what not lasting so that it would be a bit longer than her passive's duration, allowing her to get revenge on those pesky enemies. A funny fact that people forget is that if you give damage reduction to a champion, players will invariably build them more like a glass cannon because they don't need many resistances. On that note, I'd limit the amount of free reduction she gets for those ten seconds, probably more to ending at 40% rather than 60%. The tenacity is very strong, so I'd recommend it just stay at being the same as purchasing Mercury Treads, ya know? Mind you, I don't think that Dysel should be limited to the Tenacity while moving towards her marked target, but that's debatable. \n\nLast thing is that I agree with your stated Cooldowns for Max rank in skills. Personally,if you take off the refresh mechanic from her ultimate, then I think it's not too loaded. Anyway, this is all I got before my computer crashes...","replies":[{"poster":"NoxiousIce","date":"2014-05-24T19:58:43.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hadn't really thought about how low readability the healing situation was, I knew it could potentially waste resources, but I didn't want her getting back up just to be insta-gibbed because she doesn't start with enough hp. That said, you're right and it needs to be changed.\n\nAs far as the \"if a tower or minion\" only if it is an execution would she not go into the downed state, otherwise it'd act as if the champion that got the kill had killed her.\n\nI'm a little concerned about the proposed Q changes, while they're definitely cool, the reason I didn't give her many damaging abilities was because I wanted to keep her potential damage generally low, this way the building glass canon thing you mentioned wouldn't work. The more damage she can pull off in a short period of time, the more successful attempts to avoid building defenses and hp becomes. So while this suggestion would be really cool, without significant changes to the ultimate it would only exacerbate the problem.\n\nI agree with the untargettable thing at this point, instead I'll just make sure that she finishes her movement, and any cc effects take place with their remaining duration at the end of the movement (as is the usual for such abilities). She doesn't need the damage mitigation on that ability.\n\nGiven all of your feed back on the ultimate I think I've come up with something that might work better than what is currently up there:\n\n**OLD:**\n\nDysel chooses an enemy within 1200 range, and marks them for 10s. \nWhile the mark is active Dysel takes 20%/40%/60% less damage from all unmarked targets, and deals 120/135/150% damage to marked targets. Additionally while moving towards marked targets Dysel gains 10%/20%/30% movement speed, and 20% tenacity. If Dysel kills a marked target the ability's CD is reset, however if someone else kills the target the CD is doubled. 45s CD.\n\n**New:**\n\nWhenever Dysel takes more than 15% of her hp in damage from a single opponent (over 3s) she may activate Battle Focus to mark that target (she may only have one mark active at a time). Dysel takes 20%/35%/50% less damage from all unmarked targets, gains 10%/20%/30% movement speed, 35% Tenacity (mercury treads amount), and deals 20%/30%/50% more damage to marked targets. If Dysel no longer has a marked target this ability ramps down over the remainder of its duration. _Duration: 10s CD: 45s\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nYou mentioned previously that the damage was a bit high, so I toned that down a bit despite putting limited availability on her ultimate. I felt that it was appropriate to do so because switching her to have tenacity boots amount of tenacity is actually a buff, as was taking away the directional requirements. To make sure that she still got some of her fighting ability during a team fight though, I made it to where if she kills the target quickly, she still retains the DR, tenacity, and movement speed (but to a lesser degree) for the remainder of the ability.\n\nI think at this point it might be safe to give her some damage on her Q as long as the scaling was off of her total HP so that she'd be encouraged to build more HP, and further mitigate the desire to build her like a glass cannon.\n\nSome thoughts: Previously her ultimate would have allowed her to come out of the jungle and gank, but now her ultimate seems more geared towards top lane, and means that she would be a nightmare to gank against because she might just be able to take down one of you before retreating.
