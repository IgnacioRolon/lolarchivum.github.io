This needs fixed before anything else.","subforum":"Boards Feedback","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"Part of the reason people aren't fond of this community beta is that the nested comments are hard to read. Seriously, its no wonder why.\r\n\r\n[Click for Reference Image](http://i.imgur.com/S4J9yni.png) (The last bit of white on the right edge is my scroll bar, its very light, and fairly thin).\r\n\r\nMy monitor is 1280 pixels wide. This is a screen shot of the webpage for me. Since pixels are a little different for everyone, I'm going to talk about that screen shot in percentages.\r\n\r\nAreas \"D\" and \"E\" are completely worthless. Nothing is stored in this space. Its where the pretty website's CSS ran out of pretty pictures to display. I understand it looks pretty, but the chat area is so small that these tiny areas are too much. Get rid of them, they take up 16% of the width of the screen.\r\n\r\nArea \"A\" is atrocious. If the screen shot wasn't scrolled down so far you'd see the \"sub-communities\" section there. But the text in the sub-communities takes up way less than even its own box, and its box takes up less than Area \"A\" as a whole. Area \"A\" takes up 24% of the page.\r\n\r\nSo far we haven't even entered the conversation area and 40% of the page is gone. 40%!\r\n\r\nArea \"C\" and \"B\" both serve the same purpose. They are to help visually represent the comment nesting so that it is somewhat easier to follow, but they're too big. While this is mostly conversation area up above, down here it becomes clear that it is WAY too thick. Both sides of the comment nesting could be cut in half in their width per nesting level and people would still understand. I wont bother saying the percentage that they take up because it will inevitably be different depending on how many nests down we are, but it is clearly a problem.\r\n\r\nThen you have the area between area \"B\" and \"C\", this area is meant for conversation, and admittedly the text cant be touching the walls (that would look terrible) but because we're a few nests in the width that the text itself takes up amounts to only 35% of the page. 35%? That's ridiculous. It makes it impossible to read and that's not even the worst comment nest I've seen.\r\n\r\nYou need to adjust your proportions riot, the text area needs to be more prominent, and all of this decorative space needs to be thinned out. It may not fit with the rest of your site, but dear god we need some functionality here.","replies":[{"poster":"Pendragon","date":"2014-02-19T20:42:58.895+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"We have an idea for space a that we're working on developing right now.
