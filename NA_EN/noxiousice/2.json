This will be unarguably the truth as best can be interpreted from the facts available to me at this time. \n\nFurthermore this is not a personal attack. This is to clear up misconceptions that people have. Later in the post you'll find that things take a much more narrative turn, this is for effect and a small bit for humor. And lastly: You can downvote the truth if you don't like it, but that wont make it change.\n\nNow, the discussion topic: The “Majority” hatred of the CB. \n\nThere seems to be a misconception going around that if you prefer GD to CB then you are in the majority. What people fail to realize is that there is such thing as a Vocal Minority (VM), and that that is exactly what these people are.\n\n**Warning, Incoming Numbers**\n\nAs of this moment the top rated post on CB is titled “It’s Time -You- Listen Riot:” and it sits with a positive score of 333. What this means is that no matter how many up-votes or down votes this has, this thread has a majority of support from CB by 333 points. We don’t have up and down vote totals, only the end result, which shows that there are 333 more people who generally agree with the post than people who don’t. However, it is fairly safe to assume (based upon the average score of posts, and the general activity of the site) that it is a low vote total.\n\nAccording to Worthofweb.com the LeagueOfLegends website gtes 3,743,000 page views every day. That is leagueoflegends.com gets that many views. Alexa.com tracks sub-domain traffic (by pageview, not by user,) and keeps track of the top 18 subdomains for league of legends and openly offers that information. The lowest scoring subdomain is joj.leagueoflegends.com, sitting at 0.1%. forums.leagueoflegends.com isn’t even on that list. That means that forums.leagueoflegends.com doesn’t even account for one tenth of one percent of the the total pageviews that the website gets. That means that forums.leagueoflegends.com gets less than 3743 daily page views. However, we’re going to be generous in our assumptions and say that instead of less than that, forums.leagueoflegends.com gets exactly that. Now, before you go dismissing these numbers, realize that we are only talking about NA here for the forum count (the total pageviews includes other servers because they are subdomains, however forums.leagueoflegends.com is actually forums.na.leagueoflegends.com). \n\nAccording to Alexa.com the average daily pageview per unique user hovers between 3 and 4. Understand that for there to be more users on the forums in our estimates it is better to have less pageviews per user, because we have a finite number of pageviews. If you browse more than 3 or 4 pages when you browse the forums you are still contributing to the page view count, and thus reducing the number of people that could actually be on there. We’re once again going to be generous and assume that each user of the forum browses 3 pages per day. They quickly post, and get off, browsing only three pages. This means that there are daily only 1247 NA Forum browsers on average.\n\nIn 2011 Riot boasted with an infographic that they had 32,000,000 accounts active on a monthly basis. According to Forbes.com in 2012 Riot games broke the world record for concurrent users (people online on the game at the same time) at 1,300,000 users completely obliterating the previous world record of 280,000 users on steam playing Skyrim. \n\nIf you browse the General Discussion forum (GD) you are a tiny, tiny minority. That’s just if you browse. That is not if you comment or post, or hold the opinion that CB sucks, this is just if you browse GD.\n\nEven making the most generous of reasonable assumptions, at a positive score of 333 you could not possibly be the majority of anything. You are the VM. A terribly small Vocal Minority.\n\nWhy does all this matter though? Why does it matter how small you are if Riot is designing the CB for *you*, the people who browse GD, not everyone who plays the game provides feedback clearly, so why do those people matter? Basically because Riot *wants* them to provide feedback. In the ideal situation Riot would create the perfect community forum where all of their users would actively provide feedback. They cannot design the forums for just you, they have to design it for everyone.\n\nWho does everyone include though? In a more reasonable situation Riot would be seeking to get the majority of people who already provide feedback to use *their* forums. The biggest community like that is reddit users who browse /r/leagueoflegends. What is 51% of the people on /r/leagueoflegends? 222,470. Just over half of those who are actively subscribed to /r/leagueoflegends is 178 times more people than the number of people who browse GD daily.\n\nYou might claim its unfair to compare daily GD views to subscribers of /r/leagueoflegends but truthfully it is a perfectly legitimate thing to compare because at this very moment there are 14,718 of those people on reddit. /r/leagueoflegends actively sees its posts reach people’s personal front pages even when those people are subscribed to much more popular default subreddits because the numbers of upvotes on league of legends posts are so high.\n\nGD’s daily pageviews do not even scratch the surface of what /r/leagueoflegends has seen in the last four hours. Its no wonder that a large number of Rioters actively participate there. It reaches far more people.\n\nSo to assume that the majority hates the reddit style formatting, and nested comments, is not only grossly misinformed, it is flat out wrong. You are the Vocal Minority. Given the number of active accounts monthly, everyone who browsed CB in the last 24 hours could quit the game permanently, and never buy another thing and Riot wouldn’t even notice. \n\nDo not assume that you are important, or special. Riot is not some mom ‘n pops shop that depends on every customer. Riot is the Mcdonalds of video games in terms of size. You are that one asshole customer who is self important. Your business only matters to Riot, your opinions only matter to Riot because they want to improve. Not because they need to. Riot could survive just fine without their forums at all. It is a privilege that you get to communicate with Riot, not a right. Stop being little douche canoes, and realize that you’re trying to impose the tyranny of the minority.\n\nRiot **will** eventually change their forum for interacting with the community because the old one is technologically limited, and impractical for what they want to accomplish. You are getting a community beta because Riot is hoping to create the best system possible. It probably won’t look so much like reddit when everything is done, and that is probably a good thing. Reddit isn’t perfect by any means, but a whole hell of a lot more people prefer it than people who prefer GD. If you don’t want “leddit” then you need to not only express your concerns, you need to do them in a constructive manner, where you are polite, and you not only say what you don’t like, but why you don’t like it - ‘cause it’s dumb’ is not an answer - and how you think it could be improved.\n\nThat is the ONLY way you’re going to get what you want. Otherwise Riot will keep doing things their way until they are happy, and you are moderately less upset, in the end if you don’t start improving your feedback, you’ll have only yourself to blame when the end product turns out to be nothing like what you want.\n\nCB is not “Let’s redesign GD” CB is “Let’s redesign how the community **as a whole** interacts with Riot.”\n\nThanks for taking the time to read through my wall of text. Enjoy your time in CB, and lets make it a better place for *everyone*.","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2014-02-19T17:58:35.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know why I'm even back on this beta... I hate the layout so much, but your post title caught my eye while I was looking for a link to post on the other forums...\n\nI completely agree that we need to improve of the old forums. The technical limitations are huge, and they are a problem. I disagree with your assessment that just because we complain, we are assholes however. That was largely unnecessary and kind of out of place given the overall quality of the rest of the post.\n\nI just disagree with the new style they've chosen, and sadly, they show no interest at all in reassessing the style they've chosen, merely adding new features to it. Reddit is a success NOT because of it's format, but because of it's community. Many places have tried to adopt the reddit style, and usually it's a death knell for them because the style itself is massively flawed in ways that are very difficult to correct within the reddit style. \n\nApproximately 5 months ago, I provided my feedback about the key problems with this style, the problems that made it completely unusable for me in a very logical and concise way. There have been no changes made to try to address any of those problems, despite many people agreeing with the general description of the problems I laid out. They have not even discussed any potential improvements that they might make to address these.\n\nBased off of this information, or rather lack thereof, I can only assume that feedback is not how to drive them to make improvements.\n\nEdit: One other minor thing to point is that your numbers don't match up with the numbers I've seen Riot post. I recall a Riot post stating they have more new threads started per day than you claim they have pageviews, which is impossible. So I believe there may be something wrong with your numbers...","replies":[{"poster":"NoxiousIce","date":"2014-02-19T18:25:14.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't mean to imply that simply because you are complaining that you are an asshole. I was actually more directly responding to the vitriol included in the post that I mentioned. It had a very poor attitude towards Riot and was very assuming about how important the people who held that opinion were. I should have made that more clear. Thank you.\n\nI just went back and read your posts from 5 months ago (one of the advantages of the new system is that I can click on your name and do that. Fortunately the bug got fixed (I'd cry myself to sleep if it hadn't) but your other thread only went halfway where I feel that feedback needs to be. You explained what the problem was very well, but there wasn't any discussion about a potential solution.\n\nChronologically ordered conversations are good for reading if everyone is there when every post is made and has a chance to respond to it, but when someone makes a point, the discussion rapidly becomes about that point, a related point is made, and the conversation becomes off topic through completely legitimate conversation that was never intended to detract from the original topic. If someone comes in in the middle of this they either have to read the entire thread, or they have to talk about the original post and hope that someone wants to talk about that with them, while their conversation becomes hard to find because now other conversations are all going on in the same thread, and the chronological order becomes a hindrance instead of a good thing. This is just the way that conversations naturally evolve.\n\nThat is the one strength of comment nesting. It allows you to have many conversations which all started at the same point, and anyone can join into any conversation that has evolve from that point because through nesting you can see each conversation ordered out and choose which ones you think have the highest values to you, and participate without having to put forth the incredible amount of effort required to do the same in a vboard format.\n\nAll of that said, Riot has done a terrible job with comment nesting because there is a very low nesting limit, forcing conversations to stop prematurely. Their website format is terrible and forces the text into very thin columns. Reddit is not perfect either, but the nesting of comments is important, it just needs to be displayed in a more intuitive manner.\n\nAlso, if feedback isn't how to influence them, then we don't have any way at all to influence things so indirectly connected with their wallets which would be sad and unfortunate.","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2014-02-19T18:37:33.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree that nested comments are easier to come into late, but I believe we'll have to agree to disagree on that. I agree, partially, that it is easier to have multiple conversations going with nested comments, except that it becomes EXCEEDINGLY difficult to follow multiple conversations because you don't have a logical point to start reading upon RETURNING to a conversation. I did address this somewhat within my post, in some of the later comments, but the reality is that if you follow a comment thread, you can't just jump to the last post of the thread that you read in a nested situation and hope to continue from there because there will be numerous layers of nesting that you'll miss and it just becomes a garbled mess.\n\nI didn't offer any suggestions because, quite frankly, I don't see any solution while maintaining the style. I really wish I did, I'd love to offer a solution, but I just simply do not see one. The only solution I can see would be building a traditional forum and allowing it to have a 'nested' option where you would see comments based off of who they replied to. Not sure if even that would work, or if it's even possible.\n\nAnd I agree with your very last comment that it's sad and unfortunate, but it feels like it's the case.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
