The middle click is *SUPPOSED* to open any link I click with it in a new tab, and then wait for me to go and click on that tab, to switch tabs. \n\nUnfortunately Riot has made this weird little pop up box when you click on an external link that makes you press \"I know what I'm doin' biatch\" before you're allowed to go to the webpage. This is presumably to potentially protect people from scams, and make sure that they know what where they are going is indeed NOT from a Riot sponsored site.\n\nThis is wonderful for all of the \"noobs\" of the internet, and people born in countries where they are just now discovering the floppy drive, but for the rest of us please place an option in the \"my profile\" settings or something so that I can disable this permanently (or maybe even a checkbox on the prompt itself).\n\nWorse yet is the real crux of this post: I can't middle click external links on the CB because unlike GD where it takes you to a separate page where you can click through to an external site, the prompt can only be opened via standard click, and middle click just takes you to the same page you're already on. It's annoying, and the inconsistency (middle clicking works just fine on GD, and on internal links) is jarring.\n\nPlease fix this. It is literally Hitler.","replies":[{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2014-02-19T18:33:59.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, not literally Hitler. Not even close.\n\nSecondly, If FEK can do this, then I see no reason this can't be a standard feature. +1 OP, I hope your voice gets heard.","replies":[{"poster":"NoxiousIce","date":"2014-02-19T18:40:06.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well no, its not literally Hitler, its obviously figurative and hyperbole, less obviously it was done for comedic effect.
