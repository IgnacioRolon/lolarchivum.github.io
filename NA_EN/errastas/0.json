The disable just makes him feel like half his kit is missing and there's nothing you can do about it. The disable on the Control Wards puts control of Teemo's power level into his opponent's hands when the Teemo player should be the one determining how strong he is, not his enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"Errastas","date":"2016-12-24T02:43:00.314+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Positioning your shrooms perfectly defensively only to have them disabled when you need them most ‚òπÔ∏è","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GarthBrooksXD","date":"2016-12-24T02:03:39.854+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"give them true damage lol","replies":[{"poster":"LightSword","date":"2016-12-24T12:36:02.484+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would actually do very little to solve the issue at hand :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-12-24T02:00:28.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"nothing poor about satan","replies":[{"poster":"Errastas","date":"2016-12-24T02:26:49.571+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Satan needs more firepower","replies":[{"poster":"Quort","date":"2016-12-24T14:56:55.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How can he be expected to damn his enemies if he can't even put them in the ground first?

With his shrooms being so easily disabled, it makes quite an impact on the champion as so much of his power is stored within those shrooms. With his laning phase also being really strong - I think Teemo would benefit more from better utility in his kit as opposed to buffing his shrooms or base damage really.\n\nTeemo is meant to be a lane bully; however, his mobility is laughable and he's quite simple to gank in the earlier levels (and even later levels if the Teemo player doesn't position shrooms accordingly to protect themselves). Right now, he's lost a lot of his map control niche ever since his shroom timers went down to 5 minutes and the extra vision tools just make his shrooms even less reliable. Do they need counters? Definitely. However, at the same time - Teemo provides very little else to his team as his range is low even as a marksman.\n\nPerhaps the idea with the tracks could help Teemo get a new niche to help out his team as seen by another highly rated topic on the gameplay board this week. I feel his W really could be better as Teemo barely represents much as a scout and is hardly swift to boot either considering his weak form of escape. Regardless - Teemo really doesn't need more damage at all...but he needs more utility to bring to his team as right now, the shrooms are pretty much his main form of defense and damage after laning phase for AP Teemo players.\n\nIndeed Riot sees Teemo's kit as iconic; however, perhaps an Alistar-level rework for little Teemo can help him out to bring some fresh new mechanics to his kit. Ryze received plenty of reworks...would be nice to have Teemo get a proper rework to give him more reliable utility to his team as right now, Quinn can do his job, but better in the top lane and even as a scout as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Levik","date":"2016-12-24T14:19:16.219+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am glad to see the W idea is still in people's minds.
