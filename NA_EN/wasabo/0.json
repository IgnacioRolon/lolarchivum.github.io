When you run out of mana after your blue runs out (and you will, trust me), having the mana potion can give you an extra gank or clear before needing to back (which can be important for getting cool stuff like zhonyas earlier than usual)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2014-07-10T08:30:27.180+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amp Tome is still fine.  I sometimes go Doran's Ring. It's like how a number of junglers who could get away with it used to start Doran's Blade.  \n\nFiddle's flexibility is real nice.

SInce I didnt need the sustain it was a free pink that I could either use as a sweeper or provide great vision on a buff.\n\nthe point im making here is if you dont need the sustain then get something else useful, but having the machete is still very valueble to all junglers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"eKatSS","date":"2014-07-09T05:06:13.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THe only reason to start with amp tome is that you get more dmg from your drain + abilities. Problem is that when you get to 2nd blue, your mana drops like a truck + if you do bad, no extra gold from spectral wraith.","replies":[]}]}
