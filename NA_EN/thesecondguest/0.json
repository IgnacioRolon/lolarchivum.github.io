I want this issue fixed up as much as anyone else, but you've been spending the better half of the day slamming threads where players are asking for help.  This section of the boards is managed by Player Support, not developers or coders.  I'm trying to help ease some of the pain and find workarounds until we have a more permanent solution, and you're only hurting your peers by spamming threads with nonconstructive comments.  \n\nIf you have any constructive feedback feel free to share it with the community through the [correct venues](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) or your other sites, and let me help out these players here.   \n\nIf you want to help players out constructively with accurate information, that would be even better.  I only ask that if you want to shit on us you do so outside of an area where players are asking for help.

There's currently an issue where some players are experiencing screen issues and the current workaround has been to press Alt+Enter to toggle fulle screen.  As suggested above, you can use the config file to manually change how the game loads.
