Zed is suffering not that bad, but he can kill 1 person and get away, but let us remind you that on the pbe its usually a 5 man adc team so if you kill 1 you have 4 others going for you. Rengar is being nerfed really bad if its a 5/4 man adc team, since adc is a key part , and there are 4/5 of them, killing 1 will barely do anything but get you killed.\r\n\r\nI dont think certainlyT is retarded enough to fuck something up this bad, who would think a game where its about who can 2 shot the other person first would be a healthy game environment. Seriously retarded.","replies":[{"poster":"AllahbamaBlckSnk","date":"2015-10-31T08:27:40.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nice Ive already been downvoted for speaking the truth.

Zed gets to use better CDR items, Rengar gets to go Critgar and still have the CDR he wants, and while Veigar has to spend more gold at the shop, he gets 200-300 AP just from Q farming and getting kills and assists. If you have a Nomicon+CDR boots, you're pretty much set as Veigar since you'll be at 40% CDR and 400 AP without any effort at aaaaallll. Just get a Rabs and a Void after that and you'll be back to one shotting people through that boosted MR. His enemy mid laners aren't exactly going to be picking up those items though, so he won't even have to worry about that until team fighting, in which case he'll have a Void by then and not giving a crap.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shosuko","date":"2015-10-31T09:12:45.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Downvote - the reason the pbe is 5 marksman right now is because everyone wants to try the changes, not because it is competitively viable. \n\nWhile marksman did get more self reliance, it doesn't make them tanks, or assassins.","replies":[]}]}
