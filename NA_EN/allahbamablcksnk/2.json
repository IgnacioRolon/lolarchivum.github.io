It's just easier for someone who needs to back out for a bit to do something and they can't just straight up click \"lock in.\" Or what they could do is at least keep it the same for Ranked, and just removed it from Normal Draft.

You fail to see how it inconveniences many people more then it does to people having to wait an extra 10-40 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-01-16T00:55:08.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I see how it inconveniences all these other people.
