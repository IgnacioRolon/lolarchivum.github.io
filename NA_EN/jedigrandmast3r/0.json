Teemo as a jungler at low levels has to farm until six where he uses shrooms to help stabilize his clearing. This is not health, so his poison damage against monsters should be increased. Teemo's Q against monsters could blind longer, blind the whole camp, or have no changes. Riot could also go back to there reworked version that they had almost a year ago.\r\nAnother suggestion is to add a stun, slow, and root removing effect on Teemo's (W) activation.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-02-17T01:29:48.599+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nobody wants this.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2020-02-17T09:25:17.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would actually enjoy this. Teemo becoming a jungler would also fit very well thematically and would give his passive some nice uses, like ambushing the enemy jungler when they want to go for the scuttle crab.","replies":[]}]}]}
