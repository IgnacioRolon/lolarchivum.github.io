Raymond was in the Demacian army as a high ranking officer until he was betrayed by a friend. Raymond was then stripped of his rank and outlawed. Forced to flee from is home Raymond become corrupted by resentment and revenge. Raymond swore to himself that he will have his \"Justice.\"\r\n\r\nRaymond is a melee attacking bruiser with high soft cc capabilities and low attack damage scaling. Raymond is a natural counter to movement speed and attack speed champions. I had an idea for a keystone stealing ultimate, but changed it. Most of the numbers are undetermined.\r\n\r\n* Passive -- **_Punish the Wicked_** :\r\nRaymond converts 10% of incoming true damage into bonus attack damage on Raymond's next auto attack.

Punishment reduces target's bonus attack speed and bonus movement speed by 5% for 1.5 seconds stacking up to a 100% bonus attack speed and movement speed reduction for 1.5 seconds.\n\nWhat? \n\nA bruiser with a 100% attack speed reduction?.\nOP, please nerf.\nSeriously. This makes it seem as if he has a permanent Frozen Heart from level 1, which simply isn't fair to enemy champions. They will effectively get no chance to punish him. Also, \n\nAlso, is this supposed to be an attack damage modifier or an attack speed slow? The passive isn't very clear, nor does it mesh well with his theme of being a chivalrous crusader of Demacia.\n\n>Q -- Smash the Wicked : Costs Mana / Range 250\nRaymond slams his weapon down in an area dealing damage, applying hit on effects to champions / large monsters, and stuning champions / large monsters for 1 second to enemies hit.\n\nAt 250 range it's going to be tricky to land unless he gets up close. I hope he has a gap closer. Other than that it seems like an OK ability, I'm guessing he uses some sort of hammer since this is a 'smash' ability.\nIs he able to move while aiming, or is he in 'cast time'?\n\n>W -- Charge the Wicked : Costs Mana / Range 350\nRaymond dashes in a direction dealing damage, applying punishment, and slowing movement speed by 20% to enemies hit.\n\nIf he already applies Punishment, why does he also need to slow their movement speed? It makes it even easier for him to stack up to that 100% atk speed reduction. Maybe instead of that, have him knock-up or knock-aside enemy champions for x amount of seconds based on charge distance? Alternatively, he could dash in a direction, gaining bonus range on his next attack?\n\nEither Punishment or movement speed slow, not both.\n\n>E -- Suppress the Wicked: Costs Mana\nRaymond removes cc, becomes immune to cc for 1.5 seconds, and gains 50% decaying to 20&amp; over 2 seconds for 2 seconds. Raymond's next auto attack within 3 seconds will deal bonus damage and ground the target for 3 seconds.\n\nGains 50%...what?\n\nA 3 second ground is also too much for the immunity to CC that he has. Try 1.5-2 seconds, given that he's meant to be more of a bruiser as opposed to a CC bot support. Also, how much bonus damage?\n\n>R -- \"JUSTICE!\" : Costs Mana / Range 500\nRaymond gains armor, magic resist, a shield, and movement speed for 5 seconds. Nearby enemies with shields will have X amount of there shield per second taken by Raymond to use. After JUSTICE!'s duration Raymond's remaining shield will explode healing nearby allies for half of its amount.\n\nWhat if enemy champions have no shield?\n\nHow about this:\n\nRaymond calls upon the Light of Demacia to strengthen his resolve for 5 seconds, gaining armour, magic resist, a shield, and bonus movement speed for the duration. If allied champions are within a radius of X, they gain 50% of the bonus stats and 75% of his movement speed. When the duration ends, his shield will explode, dealing damage to nearby enemies and healing allies for half of the damage dealt.\n\nOverall you have potential, but it's not particularly well-utilised. I suggest taking some time to fully settle on a theme before updating this champion.\n\n~Rektagon","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-24T19:51:30.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IN JUSTICE WE TRUST!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y84bEAz05fI","replies":[]}]}
