I told these guys wait don&#039;t remake he is coming back we are in Skype ...They did remake I vote no but since you only need a 30 % the remake was accept and in the last second my friend join but the nexus was destroying....I think if you gonna make remake all the 4 player should agree cause that game was a free win ?! What do you guys think . Sorry if my English is not the best working on it .","replies":[{"poster":"Reznovskii","date":"2016-08-26T17:07:10.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah this is true. this needs to happen its anoyin, it happened to my friend to","replies":[]}]}
