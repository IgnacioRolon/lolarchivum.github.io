I stopped playing ranked alot and would only play it here and there. I then started playing ranked 3v3s with friends to try and get them to gold however we were unsuccesful and were only able to achieve silver 1. Today when i logged in it appears that i i have the new silver border and no victorious skin. So could i get an explanation on why i don't get the gold end of the season rewards?","replies":[{"poster":"Hollymonster","date":"2015-11-11T21:29:04.173+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Click here for info about this: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/206222596-11-11-2015-Loading-screen-borders-have-been-redesigned-Rewards-are-still-being-distributed-so-you-may-see-last-season-s-border-","replies":[]}]}
