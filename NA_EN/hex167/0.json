I&#039;m sitting here Mr.level 14 trying to learn the game and nothing but death happens. There is no team fights its just fizz and vayne constant killing. No fun what so ever. I would have fully accepted this if it was people in my level. But I got put up against someone so over my knowledge and so over skilled that this was completely unfair. I&#039;m really upset to know riot allows these kind of games to happen. Its nothing to learn from at all you just lose.

If they played at a bronze level in normals, then go play ranked until they get to a gold level, then come back to normals, they will be matched up with bronze. At least until their normal MMR moves to match their ranked MMR.\n- I see a level 11 Garen and 20 Nami on the enemy team, maybe they were bad enough and you were good enough that they were 'balanced out' by the gold players when compared to your team.\n- You were a premade, they were not. The system assumes that by premaking a team you will all be super friends with skype and regular training sessions. If it can't find any suitable premades to match against yours, it will start to look for higher rated solo players. Balances MMR by having a 'ok' premade team against a bunch of random but individually better players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Strabane","date":"2016-04-02T06:46:21.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":21,"body":"If it's not ranked, who cares; its a learning experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Ligerzz","date":"2016-04-02T07:30:02.715+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"It isn't a great learning experience when you're level 14 facing players already in ranked.

But it's in there for a good reason like I noted. New players don't want to see high elo players in every match because they aren't going to learn anything and just get frustrated with the game. But what exactly triggers smurf detection is a mystery (presumably so it doesn't get abused).\n\nDuo'ing and larger pre-made groups have always been unreliable with MMR IMHO. I know high golds that play with low silvers in cheesy and safe team comps (malph + yasuo, very safe mids and supports, etc.) to get the silver to gold easily. Accurately determining the MMR when one side has increased teamwork is hard but it still seems off IMHO.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"gragaaaaaaas","date":"2016-04-02T13:30:17.634+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=geowrian,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VOgja0E7,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-04-02T08:08:13.207+0000)\n>\n> * Ranked MMR is different than normals MMR.
