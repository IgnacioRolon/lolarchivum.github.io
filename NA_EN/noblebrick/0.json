While losely based upon Spartans it's hard to say whether they make shield walls or any other such stuff.  And I'm betting that sometime in the future when they flesh out the Rakkor more they will be even more divergent from Sparta. I totally wouldn't put it past Pantheon to be ambidexterity as well.\n\nAlso Runeterra doesn't necessarily have the same conventions as Earth.
