When I checked my loot to see if anything was added there was nothing. No skins or champion shards and my box and keys were gone. I checked my shop history and nothing shows up there as well. There's no way it could have ALL been blue essence in those boxes (mind you there were like 4-5 blue dots before queue popped). Any help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-31T01:29:58.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you did open a good amount of chests, you even got more chests from some of them.
