They might have a hard time balancing melee top laners, though, but that doesn't mean they hate em.\n \n>  Exactly. We are trying to formalize (for want of a better word) what strengths melee should have to help them offset the huge advantages that ranged champions have. The traditional solutions have been that melee are hard to kill, or they really mess you up if you fail to kite them. Both of those cause a lot of balance problems though. The first means melee slap fights are boring. The second means that melee vs. ranged encounters can be binary -- either the melee zeroes the mage, or the latter escapes.\n\nI thought it would be a good idea to create a thread where people can post their ideas for new and interesting melee interactions. This can be anything from items, abilities, kits, interactions, etc.\n\n**My idea:**\nTo start off the thread my idea is to give melee dps champions something to do when they are cc'ed. It seems that one of the biggest issues with melee is how easily they are kited or locked down. I was thinking it would be cool if melee champs had abilities that changed based on the status of whatever cc they are under. This would give them an inherent strength that ranged dps don't have. \n\nFor example say a melee dps closed the gap but got instantly stunned, they would gain a new set of abilities for a short time during the cc that would allow them to contribute meaningfully to the fight. Perhaps a buff to their nearby allies or some sort of reactionary offensive ability. These new abilities would not have the raw power of their non cc'ed abilities but would allow them to DO something to meaningfully contribute. \n\nThis idea is not completely fleshed out, but hopefully others will be able to expand on it or provide some feedback and criticism.\n\n**Edit:** Also for clarification, this would not be a cc removal. The target would still be fully cc'ed (can't move, auto attack, or use their normal abilities, while stunned for instance) but would have a completely new set of abilities (probably not high damage, I'm thinking more utility) they could use to contribute to the team.","replies":[{"poster":"Morello","date":"2014-07-23T19:22:46.825+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ghostcrawler is right-on with melee; they're hard to deal with because they both have limited gameplay (especially when dealing with other melee- why top lane fights are so formulaic) and too much raw power when they're good. \n\nCool to see this thread.

Damage would be exactly equal to your AA damage, with harshly reduced damage to champions. Possibly, reduced CD when successfully killing something with it. Casting time equal to auto-attack time, but doesn't cancel auto-attacks. Casting animation for melee: The initiation of the Dominion point capture channel. Almost to totally non existant stats else.\n\nBasically, a tool that would allow a melee champion to get at least some last-hits when facing a ranged champion, but not a veritable champion-to-champion combat tool (and especially with a decent disadvantage for ranged, in having the cast replace an auto-attack, which would be equally as damaging to minions and moreso to champions).","replies":[{"poster":"MinEpiphany","date":"2014-07-23T21:36:42.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is interesting, it could be like a dorans type starting item (or perhaps actually build into something) that would allow for safer last hitting in a difficult lane matchup. \n\nI'm curious what you mean by single-target skill shot though, would it work similarly to lucians Q ability?","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2014-07-24T06:40:36.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, more akin to Nida's/Ezreal's Q.

I think it could be cool for a stance that switches between melee bruiser and melee caster. However the purposes of each form would have to differ.

Then can have a stance with low sword for defense, sword lifted above their head for offense, then similarly with both swords drawn (niten ichi ryu? way of two heavens?) if they face multiple opponents. But samurai stances are for melee vs melee, whereas shield soldiers can attack ranged units. \n\nSpear soldiers would plant the butt of their spear into the ground to impale onrushing cavalry, or they would throw their spear like a projectile weapon, but then they could also pull out a sword and switch to melee fighting when the opponent was too close for spear-range. In champion design, this could be made interesting by having a stance where you can ONLY attack far away (say, 300-500 range) and then you would have to switch stance to attack in melee range.","replies":[{"poster":"MinEpiphany","date":"2014-07-23T21:59:04.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh ok, I have a better idea of what you're saying now.\n\nI think that could make duels top a lot of fun to watch.

Are you trying to do the same thing with adcs (or freaking ryze)? Are their dps races ok because they shoot a skillshot at each other first (well not ryze obviously)? I mean it's always nice to have outplay potential during the actual fighting but top lane is all about analyzing when and how you should fight/disengage. During the laning phase you're not simply dps racing each other. I find top lane more conceptual and interesting than supposedly \"high skill\" laning like mid lane ziggs playing games of '#LCSBIGPLAYS dodge the skillshot'.\n\nThe only time I think you have a point about limited play is after the laning phase when minions are no longer relevant and you can just all-in each other whenever you want. And again having outplay potential here is nice but the results are determined by your play earlier in lane so it's not some stupid 0 interaction inherent stat measuring contest.\n\nAt least stop leaving melee in the garbage while you work on your solutions to fix them because there *are* interesting laning interactions which you're straight up removing from your game and which no, ranged champions *don't* actually replicate.

Very few melee champs have their own identity, they tend to be balls of stats, so of course they aren't particularly interesting to fight, especially against each other. I'd focus on giving each melee champ their own identity, first, and revolving gameplay around that. Irelia, for example, might be the 'comeback fighter' so she's never as disadvantaged as she might seem, while Olaf could be the 'berserker' who is at his best when he's almost dead.\n\nI think saying 'melee are difficult to balance' is a bit disingenuous when they're difficult to balance because they have nothing to do but 'throw all buttons at enemy and hope they die.' Of course the Shyvana/Mundo slapfight is going to be boring when all you give them to do is 'one skillshot, maybe autoattack reset, press all buttons.'

Maybe if Champions had their attributes broken down into 4 things:\n\n* **Offenses** {{champion:23}}  *(This includes all forms of damage output and related things, such as Physical/Magic/True Damage output and frequency, cooldowns for offensive spells, etc etc. This may **also** include CC, as CC can enable you and/or your team to go on the offensive, score kills, objectives, and win the game as a result.)*\n\n* **Defenses** {{champion:201}}  *(This includes all defensive stats and defense-related things, such as Armor and Magic Resist both base and per level, Health Regen, base Health and HP5, stats on defensive spells, etc etc. This may **also** include CC, as CC can be integral in keeping you and/or your team alive.)*\n\n* **Range** {{champion:51}}  *(General range at which they prefer to and specialize in playing at in comparison to other Champions, in terms of both auto attacks and abilities, and for how long/often they play at that range.)*\n\n* **Mobility** {{champion:38}}  *(This includes anything that allows the Champion to move outside of their basic movement and movement speed. MS increases, dashes, blinks, gap closers and escapes, etc. As the game evolves, 'mobility creep' becomes a very real thing, and it's beginning to outshine a lot of older \"traditional mage\"-like Champions. Mobility is a very necessary attribute to have nowadays, and the lack of it calls for an excess of something else to compensate.)*\n\nI chose these four categories because, to me, these seem to be the core defining aspects of any one Champion.\n\nYou can start to think of it like Pokemon EV's. You have 4 categories, and a limited amount of points to allocate. Let's say by default, a very middle of the pack Champ has 50 or close to 50 points per category, for a total of 200 points.\n\nIf you want a champion with a particularly long range AND high damage, then their mobility and their defenses should be low. Lets say...\n**Offenses: 70 points**\nDefenses: 26 points\n**Range: 75 points**\nMobility: 29\n\nThis would allow a champion to ONLY be able to excel at most at two things, as excelling in more would start to go into OP territory ({{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} ). This would also allow for a clear design pathway for champion design I think. Does the game need more higher range carries? Or maybe another mobile glass cannon? How would a tank with high range play out? What about a highly mobile tank?\n\nAs for the kits of these champions, thats where the creativity comes in. This \"stat allocation\" is simply meant as a sort of general direction, and the kit is supposed to represent that in a unique way.\n\n**BASICALLY,** I think if a Champion is going to lack range, they need to be better at something else to compensate, whether that means having a higher damage output, higher mobility, or higher defenses. This might seem very obvious, but the way to go about deciding what a Champion REALLY needs is very tough I would think, especially if not all of the Champions he/she/it interacts with were designed with the same philosophies in mind.\n\nidk, just my thoughts.

I think perhaps it's okay for a champ to be good at more than two attributes but if they are and become popular in a healthy way it should be a wake up call that its ok to give older champions a little something as well to compete. \n\nI feel like little changes/buffs to older champions would go a long way to making people happy.

Their design can be really simple or complex, but the idea on making the abilities and kit would be that there's an emphasis on outplay for both parties, which a lot of current champions lack. While gold is a threshold for good picks or play being rewarded, that gold threshold can still be there with more emphasis on mechanical outplay, because with too many champions it comes down to \"I have more gold\" or \"I reached X point in the game\" then they press a few buttons and kill you, or don't even need to, and auto kill you to death or press 1-2 buttons, there isn't much outplay to it.

This isn't a problem exclusive to melee champions, but they're one of the most egregious cases. Consider the following scenarios:\n\nMelee vs Melee in lane\nMelee vs Range in lane\nTeamfights\n\nAnd let's take a great example of a champion whose inconsistency has gotten them in the pending rework dumpster: Gangplank.\n\nMelee vs Melee: Gangplank has ranged poke, giving him an advantage over melee's which don't. He can harass them without retaliation in a similar manner to a ranged champion basic attack. He also has CC removal and extra movement speed, so he's hard to lock down. In short he is very safe vs a melee champion, being very hard to trade with and can survive if behind.\n\nMelee vs Range: Gangplank has ranged poke, but other than that he is hopeless. Q's CD is too long for him to consistently damage his opponent, leaving him in an easily harassable position. He has no gap closer, so he has to run up to his opponent to deal proper damage, leaving him open to being hit by skillshots and the like. He does have a cleanse and extra movement speed, which gives him an advantage compared to other melees without gap closers, but he will likely take a fair amount of damage engaging. On top of this, he has no damage in melee range beyond basic attacks and his passive, meaning he doesn't really deal that much damage in melee range anyway, and additionally he has no disengage other than running away. On the plus side, he at least has a slow on his autoattacks to help him stick to his opponent once he's there (although mobility ruins him).\n\nTo sum up against ranged all he can really do vs ranged is poke with Q, which is not enough to keep them from zoning GP out of CS, meaning he has to use Q for last hitting purposes. Gangplank is a very passive laner without much interaction against ranged.\n\nTeamfights: Gangplank's movement speed is not enough to engage properly, he can only cleanse CC once, and unless he builds tanky he will probably die before doing anything, and even if he gets close enough he will not do much besides basic attacks. Q does not have enough range for him to poke safely. In teamfights he has to play passively, and he has no team utility beyond his ultimate's slow and a small amount of AD/MS for the team, both of which have downtime. In other words, he sucks.\n\n\nNow the problems have been identified, solutions must be come up with. However, the issue is that trying to fix one of the scenarios will not make the other scenarios any better.\n\nMelee vs Melee: Higher mana costs stop him from dominating the lane forever, and his power at close range must be less than other melee champions to prevent him winning when he is engaged upon. Q was given a mana cost refund on kill mechanic and his passive was weakened, solving this problem. However, his ranged matchups got much worse and weakened his teamfighting even more so.\n\nMelee vs Range: Lower mana costs and CD on Q so GP can interact more often. His movement speed and melee power need to be increased so he can do something other than poke his opponent. These things will make him dominate melee champions, but without them he can't do anything to ranged other than play passive and farm.\n\nTeamfights: Survivability. Either through defensive boosts or offensive ones (so he can afford to build defense and still be useful). Now melee champions can't kill him and ranged champions either kite him (hard to do with his Oranges) or get killed.\n\nWrapping up Gangplank himself needs a new kit to give him interaction with both melee and ranged so that he doesn't dominate nor get dominated. Hence the Fighter Rework stuff. However that doesn't fix the teamfight problem. Melee champions need a way to survive in 5v5s that doesn't make them unkillable in 1v1. Hypermobility has been an effective way of doing so, but we can't just go giving every melee champion that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MalikCaesar777","date":"2014-07-24T05:34:23.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While not a buff for melee, creating sweet spots for ranged attacks could help.\n\nFor example an attack at max range would do 90%, and at close range range it would be about 95%\n\nbut somewhere in the middle it would got to around 105%\n\nThat way if the ranged user wants to stay back and play safe from  melee they lose damage, and they would have to move closer to melee range while being at a disadvantage up close.\n\nObviously melee attacks would not be subjected to this (probably would make gap closers take the damage change though)\n\nFor melee duels this obviously wouldn't apply.\n\nso for those I guess I would want to add a charge system.

Yes I know he's a jungler and I use him quite often in the jungle, but to come out attack and get your face handed to you with him when he reaches level 6 is kinda ridiculous. Everyone knows Garen too is broken since some of his main items got either removed or changed, I have tried and tried to find a working build for Garen and have pretty much given up on this quest. Don't get me wrong, I have looked up the mobafire builds as well as the lolking builds for Garen and Nocturne after the changes and the suggested builds are just dismal at best. An item that would help only melee such as the ravenous hydra to build both attack speed, health, health regen and a unique passive which allows for cc cooldowns would be awsome, that way it is something worth buying if going against ranged characters who can just snipe you before you get to them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LilStacey87","date":"2014-07-23T20:46:36.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly think Riot is doing a great job with what they're doing with the melee champs. While it's true that CC is their biggest set back, it what makes League, League. Champions like Master Yi, Jax, Irelia, Yasuo, Fiora and Xin Zhao all are fun melee champions to play and do lots of damage when closing the gap on opponents. I feel only a few melee champs (specifically fighter types) need reworks. Darius being one of the main ones in my opinion. And with the league community growing by the day it's really the supports who need work. Most of the time you only have ONE on the battlefield and I feel they should be just as much of a threat as their ADC partners in Team Fights.

I think tenacity or QSS are the only defenses against CC (aside from certain abilities) but to me it sometimes doesn't seem like enough.\n\n\nI'm thinking items that give primarily CC reduction, along with an additional low to moderate increase to standard stats.  These additional stats should be low enough to make these items a significant trade off if used by a straight tank or carry, but high enough to allow an off-tank the power/defense needed to hang.   We have dedicated items for mages, tanks, and carries; these would Dedicated Off-tank items.  \n\nAgain to be worthwhile, it/they would have to be a decent reduction/block against CC.  Specifically, something like a flat 50 percent reduction time for stuns and snares, or a 50% reduced slow effectiveness.  Or maybe an active similar to Morg's shield.  Have them build out of multiple basic or cheap mid level items like amp tomes, cloaks, daggers, etc. (like aegis.) but have only the initial stat increases from these basic items carry over to the new items, adding only the CC reduction passives.\n\nThis would allow a bit more customization options for melee fighters and would make them more fun and strategic to play.  Secondly it could add another level of strategy to other character types should they decide to diversify their build to use an item like this in response to a CC heavy team.\n\nThis might easily throw the game out of whack though, if not handled delicately. I picture a Yi or kat that cant be snared and shudder a little.  The sacrifice in overall stats (especially dmg) needs to be strong enough, and the cost high enough to make a carry think twice about sacrificing an item slot for it.","replies":[{"poster":"MinEpiphany","date":"2014-07-23T21:53:47.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had an idea of an item that delays cc rather than mitigate or remove it, I think that it could bring some interesting play patterns to the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"cshakes","date":"2014-07-23T21:40:18.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suggest adding more skillshots.

I'm loathe to give any credit to him, but Yasuo is probably the best approach to this to date - he has a lot of offensive and defensive options that let him interact in interesting ways with lane opponents, despite being melee. His QWER becomes a crucial tool that enables the player to apply autoattacks to their target, without entirely replacing autoattacks.\n\nYou can say a similar thing about Riven (another champ I hate, but that's irrelevant): she uses her kit to navigate a fight, and the ability to right-click an enemy is her reward for doing that successfully. This design point is actually made obvious with her passive, granting her autoattacks spendable charges for every ability spent. **TLDR: Utilizing QWER to navigate a fight gives these melee damage-heavy champions gameplay, and being able to autoattack is their reward.**\n\nIf nothing else, don't make another Yi.
