Check him out! League unrelated.) would say.\n\nAssassin is a less than explicit term referring to any champion with hyper mobility who possesses burst damage. \nHyper mobility is defined as the ability to get _in and out_ of a fight on the same or multiple abilities.\n\"Assassin builds\" are builds which divers are capable of that allow champions in the diver pool (example; Camille, Aatrox, Vi, gragas, nocturne) to perform the _burst_ aspect of an assassin despite their lack of hyper mobility. \n\nWith riots overlapping champion designs and the general vague-ness of their terminology, lets return to Ahri to prove a point. \nAhri is a hyper mobile champion. Her ultimate is one of the best mobility tools in the game, on a low CD.\nAhri is a burst champion. Her Q, E, W combo is fairly strong and has a low CD.\nAhri is a caster.

What you are saying in response to me is akin to saying \"a square is not a rectangle because it is a square\".\n\nI proved, using logic and reasoning, that Ahri is an assassin by utilizing definitions of terms which describe the assassin archetype. Namely, Assassins are burst casters who are hyper mobile. Ahri is a hyper mobile burst caster, ergo she is an assassin. \n\n> Mages have better teamfights, therefore better late games. Assassins have better early games because of better base damages, but have crappy scalings so they don&#x27;t teamfight well and fall off.\n\nNot all mages have better team fights, but many casters have good team fights because of their AoE potential. Assassins, despite the common thought that they dont have good team fights, usually _actually do have really decent team fights because of their AoE their ability to extract themselves from combat unless focused_. \n\nAssassins have good early games because they are casters and have high base damage with good scaling. They are good in the late game because they can pick and choose priority targets before removing themselves from the fight to wait for their cooldowns. \nOdd assassins like fizz take more positioning, but are generally just as effective as their peers at all stages of the game. \n \n> Everyone knows that.\n\nKnows what? \nIf this were pre-lethality  youd actually have a point, because at that time assassins did fall off due to a lack of external damage sources and a lack of AD on their itemization.\n As weve gained more external damage sources and AD itemization has increased to be comparable to flat AP (way back when AP was generally 1.5 times higher than AD, now its only 1.20 times higher as shown by riots adaptive scaling) assassins have stopped falling off because they do so much damage. \nHeck, even pantheon the poster child for \"falling off\" _doesnt fall off anymore_.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MiracleMorg94","date":"2019-02-01T19:31:47.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Paroe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BkTcghBw,comment-id=00030002000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-01T19:16:15.683+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, i changed the quoted section since moderators deleted your original post.

You haven't used any sound arguments.\n> \n> I proved, using logic and reasoning, that Ahri is an assassin by utilizing definitions of terms which describe the assassin archetype. Namely, Assassins are burst casters who are hyper mobile. Ahri is a hyper mobile burst caster, ergo she is an assassin. \n\nNope. She's a burst mage because of her mid to long range poke, her hard CC and her damage outburst. I would say because of her mobility to more so put her in a hybrid type sort kind of like how Nidalee is a hybrid artillary of her class. But Ahri is not full assassin.\n> \n> Not all mages have better team fights, but many casters have good team fights because of their AoE potential. Assassins, despite the common thought that they dont have good team fights, usually _actually do have really decent team fights because of their AoE their ability to extract themselves from combat unless focused_. \n\nMost mages have better team fights. Assassins don't have good teamfight potential because they only do one thing well, is to find the carry, kill, and get out. They don't have much AOE or utility to keep fighting and they get locked down real quick as well. Their ability to escape is not a team fighting tool in the slightest. \n> \n> Assassins have good early games because they are casters and have high base damage with good scaling. They are good in the late game because they can pick and choose priority targets before removing themselves from the fight to wait for their cooldowns. \n\nUh no. They are good early game because they have high base but BAD scaling. They aren't good in the late game for peeling and killing multiple people. \n\n> Odd assassins like fizz take more positioning, but are generally just as effective as their peers at all stages of the game. \n> \n> Knows what? \n\nWhat I just said...-.- That assassins have better early games and mages have better late.\n\n> If this were pre-lethality  youd actually have a point, because at that time assassins did fall off due to a lack of external damage sources and a lack of AD on their itemization.\n>  As weve gained more external damage sources and AD itemization has increased to be comparable to flat AP (way back when AP was generally 1.5 times higher than AD, now its only 1.20 times higher as shown by riots adaptive scaling) assassins have stopped falling off because they do so much damage. \n> Heck, even pantheon the poster child for &quot;falling off&quot; _doesnt fall off anymore_.\n\nWrong.
