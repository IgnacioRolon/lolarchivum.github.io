The advent of Kalista has slowly turned support role into \"the other carry,\" and all sorts of bad jungle picks that aren't really viable (like Zed, Yasuo, or Akali jg) are being picked - at least in low elo like mine. I don't know, I'm just tired of being trolled by people in champ select and getting face rolled by League of Tanks in-game in the name of some supposed \"diversity\" that really just means MOAR TANKS.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iainB85","date":"2015-05-12T16:42:03.369+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not enjoying this meta because I enjoy playing AP mages, and it feels like they are at an all time low right now. Brand is still semi-viable because he has some % hp damage, but I'm finding spamming champs like Vlad with late game consistent damage over burst AP mage is waaaaaay easier to win now, and I hate it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nidalee SO NYAAA","date":"2015-05-11T19:03:51.365+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I only reason I  don't like this meta is the jungle. Only a handful of champions really work in there anymore. It was cool seeing Vi played again but when cinderhulk come out shes was pushed out along with Nid and Lee sin. Even rek is tougher to play this season because fucking  Gragas,Sej, Nautilus do so much damage and have 4k health. The jungle is not that healthy as people like to think","replies":[]},{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2015-05-11T19:37:11.634+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of edge cases of people being too tank with too much damage but overall I agree.\n\nIt's fun watching Irelias and Zeds mindlessly bum rush the ADC past Gragas and Naut the moment a fight starts, get peeled and busted down, then whine that tanks are op.","replies":[]}]}
