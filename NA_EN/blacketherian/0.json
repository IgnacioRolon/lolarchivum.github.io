On the topic of his AP ratio being useless, his most frequent builds include exclusively AP items, and while Sylas can't utilize a Vayne ult to its full potential, he can use Yasuo's, whether it be with his own single target knock up or his teammates. In your third statement, you said \" It being so limited in range and on a long cooldown just entirely dumpsters him,\" are you implying he should have a long-range, 40% health threshold execute that heals for 55% of Sylas' AP, that AGAIN doubles if the target is below the said threshold?

Although his shield is a \"Short range dash\" ( that he seems to have every 3 seconds ) it is still a significant part of his overall kit, damage reduction, and survivability, considering it has a 90% *in all caps* ability scaling, which is ridiculous for someone that already has a heal.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"F03","date":"2019-01-27T00:17:00.182+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hotarµ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5XGLrOm1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-01-25T23:14:27.898+0000)\n>\n> It doesn't heal all of his health and it's easily countered by grevious wounds.\n> \n>  It's similar to Warwick's healing or Vladimir's, if you don't build against it, you're going to get punished.\n\nhe said nearly all of his health not all of it\n\nsylas is broken and thats that","replies":[{"poster":"BlackEtherian","date":"2019-01-27T00:24:56.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=F03,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5XGLrOm1,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2019-01-27T00:17:00.182+0000)\n>\n> he said nearly all of his health not all of it\n> \n> sylas is broken and thats that\n\nHe doesn't read, it's a useless battle, he still doesn't understand Sylas' E...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BlackEtherian","date":"2019-01-27T00:21:49.140+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hotarµ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5XGLrOm1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-01-25T23:14:27.898+0000)\n>\n> It doesn't heal all of his health and it's easily countered by grevious wounds.\n> \n>  It's similar to Warwick's healing or Vladimir's, if you don't build against it, you're going to get punished.\n\nIts a heal with a 55% AP ratio, that doubles if the target is below a 40% health threshold, I'm sorry, but that surpass that detriment of grievous wounds by miles.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2019-01-25T23:13:11.509+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"It can't be as bad as Pyke, right?","replies":[{"poster":"BlackEtherian","date":"2019-01-25T23:16:53.090+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5XGLrOm1,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-01-25T23:13:11.509+0000)\n>\n> It can't be as bad as Pyke, right?\n\nYes, yes he is","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shmeeve","date":"2019-01-26T00:06:10.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dealing with pyke's healing is like dealing with the weeping angels in doctor who, don't let him out of your sight if you don't want him to heal.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackEtherian","date":"2019-01-26T00:39:19.578+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Apex,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5XGLrOm1,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2019-01-26T00:06:10.463+0000)\n>\n> Dealing with pyke's healing is like dealing with the weeping angels in doctor who, don't let him out of your sight if you don't want him to heal.\n\nI have played with, against, and as him, so yes I still think he is OP","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2019-01-26T00:11:47.776+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Apex,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5XGLrOm1,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2019-01-26T00:06:10.463+0000)\n>\n> Dealing with pyke&#x27;s healing is like dealing with the weeping angels in doctor who, don&#x27;t let him out of your sight if you don&#x27;t want him to heal.\n\nThe problem is that his heal comes with stealth AND extra MS and he's gone as soon as you're out of the circle, he also has a dash which can be used before the stealth-heal-speedbuff thing to add even more distances, and most importantly, Pyke is not a high priority target for the vast majority of a fight.\n\nYer it's problematic alright.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zPity","date":"2019-01-26T22:24:39.161+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"the healing is a minor issue, the new champs and reworked champs mobility is always a class above the \"other\" champs\nis everyone going to have a 3 sec dash and abilities that have two or three effects or casts?\nbecause a lot of champs don't","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2019-01-26T00:39:47.522+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Totally agree, even since his PBE annoncement it's even been nerfed but it's still too much, heal minimum of 380 when below 40% hp at level 9 when your HP is only 1150.

I have a nerf suggestion for his ult, his ult should be able to copy only ults that WERE just used for the past let's say minute or 30 seconds. It's so stupid how he can 1v1 tryndamere by just stealing his ult while trynd is low which prompts trynd to pop ult first before sylas ult.. This also applies to Nasus ult, stupid how he can just 1v1 a freaking 500 stacks Q monster and heal off to full hp..    {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}\n\nHis whole kit is just dumb","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The entire team","date":"2019-01-25T23:38:14.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":19,"body":"Other champs have better heals, and that's that.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackEtherian","date":"2019-01-26T23:56:25.772+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The entire team,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5XGLrOm1,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-01-25T23:38:14.940+0000)\n>\n> Other champs have better heals, and that's that.\n\nRight but other champs have side effects to said heal or they have to sacrifice something to get such a heal and thats that","replies":[]}]}]}
