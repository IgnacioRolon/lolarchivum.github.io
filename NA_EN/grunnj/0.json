The workaround we've found for Steam is to install to the Desktop instead. But when I launch LoL from the desktop I almost immediately get \"Unspecified error occurred. Please check the logs for more information.\" I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times. Also deleted and redownloaded the installer. Also tried installing to other folders. All yielding the same result. Also deleted the solutions folder in LoL>RADS within the app as was suggested elsewhere on the boards. That didn't work either. And I see the folder is now back. And still empty. \n\nMacBook Pro 15\" mid 2012\n2.6 GHz Intel Core i7\n8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1024 MB\nOS 10.11.6\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-27T04:34:38.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes. Due to the way that League patches, a specific set of administrative privileges and installation locale must be maintained in order to function properly.\n\nYou may want to reach out to your system administrator so they can install League for you.
