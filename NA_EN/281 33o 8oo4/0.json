I haven't received an email and I've also never received a warning, punishment, or ban on my account. I'm not toxic, don't troll, or use cheating software. Just banned out of nowhere. I've submitted a support ticket but in the past Riot has taken 2 weeks to respond to both of my tickets. I just want to know why I am banned and has this happened to anyone else?","replies":[{"poster":"281 33O 8OO4","date":"2017-10-09T20:55:30.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks...

I have submitted tickets in the past and it took about 2 weeks to get a response. Unless Riot has gotten better at responding to ticket submissions then I expect to basically be banned for 2 weeks until I even get a response.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-10T01:05:34.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can sympathize with that for sure bro.
