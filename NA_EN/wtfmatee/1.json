(Now you can accuse me of rank shaming, but it's a fact, some characters are easier to climb with than others at different rank levels)\n\nSecond, Win rate has NOTHING to do with if it is a strong pick or not. As I said, Bronze TF vs Diamond TF. A higher win rate in solo queue only signifies that this champion has a good impact in **solo queue games**. The **exact same** applies to **competitive** play.\n\nThird, opinion is also a thing. You have a different point of view on the situation than others. You have seen different games than others. It's not because **YOU** saw a strong Rumble that Rumble is a strong pick.\n\nFourth, other region might just have good rumble players / different team composition / different meta that allows to include Rumble more often. You can't judge competitive play between region, the \"meta\" differs largely from a place to another. Maybe NA is behind in the meta, maybe it's ahead. You don't know, I don't know no one knows, until there's an internationnal event.\n\nAnd finally, if you really want an example, go see Hearthstone pro players. currently there are absolutely no \"Meta\" applied.

Take a look at MTG Legacy meta, it has been there for such a long time, the relative card power is well known and you can accurately judge most strategies according to the meta, there are archetypes, counters to those archetypes, sideboard options and so on.

Agreed that league has place to developp a solid metagame, but it is not by blindly nerfing champs because \"they are strong in Korea\" that you'll acheive it.

Urgot overall has low counterplay, and when he's at equal strength to other champions in his role he is absurdly frustrating to play against.  He's still frustrating when he's numerically weaker, but it's less mind-numbingly terrible to face him.  \n\nYorick is another good example.  He has almost zero counterplay outside of \"soak up his poke and win the duel\", and when he's strong/viable it *sucks* to be against him.  This doesn't necessarily mean he's overpowered, but he is completely anti-fun and could probably use a nerf so he doesn't continually ruin games.\n\nOne final example, Evelynn.  Evelynn used to be (and somewhat still is) total bullshit.  She wasn't necessarily overpowered, but the amount of frustration and playstyle altering she forced was so overwhelming that Riot decided to smash her into nonexistence until they could get around to working on her.  Again, they didn't do this because she was too strong; they did this because she was too frustrating.\n\n>It's probably never going to stop too because instead of waiting for people to find a counter they want instant nerf and instant gratification..\n\nMany of the older champions just straight up don't have counterplay, or it's unreasonably imbalanced.  Blitzcrank is a pretty good example of this, because Rocket Grab's potential benefit is so far above its cost that it might as well be undodgeable.  If he lands a single good hook lategame, despite missing 400 of them previously, it could singlehandedly (c wut i did thar) win the game for his team.  Is he overpowered as a champion?  Probably not, but he has some pain points.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2015-02-18T20:19:28.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awhile ago or do you mean 3 seasons when he got nerfed like 5 patched in a row?","replies":[]},{"poster":"tainteddaze","date":"2015-02-18T18:43:48.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is a lot of strong pick currently in this game that are not overpowered. Why do you think people play so many champions. The problem here though is that the jungle is in ruins. Most champions can't do it while others that can, the very little amounts of them, control it so powerfully that there is no balance in it. The lane picks honestly aren't that imbalance zed needs to be toned down but that is cause the way they nerfed mana regen so hard core and there is ways to do this without hitting his damage in his kit. But zed isn't overpowered it just how the game shifted when riot did the huge rehaul. Lee sin on the other had is brokenly overpowered and he needs a gutting, but riot doesn't want to gut the most played champion in the game cause then they fear they will lose player base for doing it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kazaashi","date":"2015-02-18T16:06:07.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think one thing no one on the boards thinks about is a concept called \"Perfect Imbalance\". \n\nI'd try to sum it up, but this video does it better:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=e31OSVZF77w","replies":[{"poster":"Orangesilk","date":"2015-02-18T17:50:26.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's DOTA's design philosophy, not LoL's.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dingding123","date":"2015-02-18T17:11:10.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot made sure of that","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-02-18T15:35:21.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty much","replies":[]},{"poster":"thehalfrican23","date":"2015-02-18T04:55:52.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WTFMatee,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=XlXEy1Jy,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-18T03:36:05.074+0000)\n>\n> I've seen this shit for almost a year now.\n> When a champion comes even close to the spotlight people want them nerfed.\n> \n> Think about urgot. \n> Awhile ago he was a strong adc pick.\n> \n> Then people complained he \"had no counterplay\" and NEEDed a nerf.\n> \n> Now people complain riot shows no love to urgot.\n> \n> Serioulsy it's and endless cycle \n> \n> It's probably never going to stop too because instead of waiting for people to find a counter they want instant nerf and instant gratification..\n> \n> Let the vicious cycle continue\n\nThat's how it is with most games and with that whole urgot thing his true opness lies in him being in top lane... whos fiora oh that fencer chick that has to run from these acid hunters lol {{champion:6}} is the man","replies":[]},{"poster":"CoxamusPrime","date":"2015-02-18T23:24:56.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I believe your missing out on something a bit more important.
