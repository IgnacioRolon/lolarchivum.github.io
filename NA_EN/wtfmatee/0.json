The problem is when there are people who constantly take stuff like raptors and/or wolves, especially if it's not communicated and with the laners thinking of their jungler. Especially when there are people who lose their lane hard it often becomes alot harder to pull off ganks due to more roaming, enemies you can't kill with the laner alone etc.\nI've had it way too often that 2 people lose their lanes and suddenly start farming jungle camps on a regaular basis, while denying the best jungle monster buffs for their jungler. As long as there is a laning phase and people are more or less low level it can hurt your jungler quite bad. If bot takes krugs and mid raptors my jungle clear is way more ineffective. \nLaners get \"free exp\" with each minion wave coming to their lane, while the jungler needs his camps to get exp and he takes a risk by trying to gank a lane. If it doesn't work out or you realize that it's all warded the jungler loses exp and has no other way to make up for it than by clearing jungle camps.\nEspecially if you lose your lane it generally isn't a good idea to concentrate on ganking thise lane or giving lots of gold/exp to this laner by letting him take your jungle camps, it's better to push those who do good or who are even with their opponents so those guys (and possibly even the jungler) can carry and boost their powerspikes. A completely mediocre team will most likely lose against a team with 1-2 people fed and 1-2 people behind.\n\nIn mid-game things are changing, but randomly taking away important smite buffs and camps from your jungler in the earlier stages, will most likely hurt you and your team more than it may benefit you.","replies":[{"poster":"AdminAnonymous","date":"2016-02-13T18:28:34.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for making the point about ganks.
