Every time I attempt to edit my masteries in champ select and outside of champ select it will just break and be unresponsive/frozen.  The first champion select after every relaunch or repair of client works with masteries but breaks for every subsequent champion select (super annoying when trying to climb). I have updated my Mac to its most recent software and it's from 2015, My Mouse (Razer Naga and its synapse) may have something to do with it? It isn't lag or slow as it doesn't resolve but the masteries I wanted to take will appear and be stuck for the following champ select.  I think ive worked out a system whereby i press esc and it allows me to change masteries after theyve frozen if this helps at all :(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-17T02:36:56.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh snap that's pretty weird. I'm thinking this might be happening due to some odd network issue. Let's make sure to check out your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) really quick just in case we can make some updates for a smoother connection in champ select.","replies":[{"poster":"Degrium","date":"2017-06-17T10:18:51.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, Still using ethernet and completed other relevant checks and still having the same problem :(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-17T20:21:13.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm that's not good. We could try running a repair through the client options since it seems like some game files may actually be damaged, but let's get you in touch with the experts first. Hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they'll be able to do a lot more troubleshooting than I can here on the boards!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Degrium","date":"2017-06-17T03:54:26.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So previously I was using a faster connection that was wireless and I was having said problems^. I just swapped to my home internet using ethernet cables and it appears to be fixed? Not sure will test later today and get back to you on whether your solution fixed it :D (Normally takes 1 champ select to get the problem back after resetting client.)","replies":[]}]}]}
