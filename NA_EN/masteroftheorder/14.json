Vastly. Riot officially said they would bring SoloQ back a month and a half after Dynamic Q was released, then delayed it and now it's never coming back. They lied, plain and simple. They've removed game modes, forcing us to play ranked games that we otherwise wouldn't have played, and then used that data to say \"more people are playing ranked than ever, so clearly it's working as intended\". Also, complete bull.\r\n\r\nIf you play with friends, you may very well prefer Dynamic Q. If so, good for you. However, if you're a solo player like me, then you most likely agree that ranked is simply unfun now. \r\nBefore anyone points this out, since someone always does, I don't play ranked on this account. It's my preference, and I'm entitled to it. Which brings me to my next point....\r\nNonranked sucks. There is no casual playlist that isn't a double edged sword. Team Builder was it, and Riot removed it to force people to play ******* Dynamic Q.\r\n\r\nWhen I first started playing league, it was a strategy game that required practice and a bit of skill. Now, it's a skill based game that requires teamwork and a little strategy. It's not the same game. It's not meant for the same people. There is absolutely no loyalty from Riot directed towards older, faithful players. Limited skins? They open the vault. Traditional skins? Hey you can buy that in a bundle, I.E. Trundle. *ha, that rhymed* Special ANYTHING? A few icons, that can't be gotten again. But hey, there may be a sale for that too.\r\n\r\nAs a previously dedicated player, I'm done. I'm a solo player, and Riot has made a point to put players like myself at a disadvantage. For all my fellow angered solo players, I suggest you move on to other games. Fortunately, there are PLENTY of great things coming out this year. As for MOBAs, try out Smite, or switch to DoTA. You'll find being a solo player far less punishing.\r\n\r\nNow, for Riot. Frankly, you've isolated me as a solo player, and as a somewhat veteran player, I feel like I've wasted my time and money. You've forsaken me, and my opinions. You've changed the game. You've removed the aspects that were fun. You've lied to me. You've lost my respect as a company, you've lost my interest as a gamer, and you've lost my loyalty and money as a veteran. Based on every action your company has taken over the past two years, it's quite clear that you think no mistake you make will ultimately cost you. That, unfortunately, may be right. Hordes of casual gamers may flock to league until the end of time.\r\n\r\nHowever, maybe not. I for one, think the series of decisions you're making, and isolating solo players, will lead to the end of your game. I'm not spiteful, however I hope it does. I hope it serves as a reminder to the next huge game that insulting your players and veterans alike is NEVER a decision to even be considered. I don't have anything else to say. You can read the anger posted by so many others. You know exactly what you've done to push us away. If you don't, you're not intelligent enough to bother with.\r\n\r\nEven if you fix this game, I won't be coming back. I don't like lied to. You've permanently lost my trust, based on lies and based on your punishing decisions towards solo players. I have no faith that you'll remedy that, so I've uninstalled and won't be coming back. I won't be checking the progress of the game. I'll miss the good times I've had on this game, but I've given up waiting for them to return. I haven't had fun since the Tank Meta and Team Builder. This isn't a pleasant free game, it's a free way to ind the most rage inducing games and people, and be forced to spend at least 20 minutes with them.\r\n\r\nTL;DR Solo players should stop wasting their time/money on this game and go somewhere else, and Riot needs to take a good long look at the long term effects of what they're doing to solo players and veterans.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-06-03T04:49:47.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, enough everybody. (General rant incoming)\n\nStop saying Riot lied about solo queue. The only one lying here is yourself with your post saying that. If you want to ignore information given to you, fine by me, but don't go spreading that ignorance around.\n\nRiot genuinely believed that they could reimplement solo queue into the game, and that everything would still work. Yes Lyte did make that post as damage control to calm people down -- that doesn't change the fact that the intention at the time was still to bring back solo queue.\n\nHowever, during the course of their testing, it started to become evident that it may not work. So they updated the stance on it. What did the boards do? They downvoted it to hell, and the rest was never aware of its existence.\n\nLooking back with hindsight, it might seem like a lie, but this kind of scenario doesn't work that way. Did FDR lie when he said that the US wouldn't get involved with WW2? No, because then Pearl Harbor was attacked. So when Riot discovered from testing that it wasn't going to work, they had to change what they said.\n\nRant over, I'm out\n\n-_-\nAvantelWings","replies":[]}]}
