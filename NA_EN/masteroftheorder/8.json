EUW has been unplayable with constant bugsplats, reconnect to server issues and giant ping for almost the entire season 3. Not to mention the 1 week+ downtimes every now and then\n\nNA has had issues consistently since the end of season 2. High ping affects half the continent 24/7/365. Pings spikes frequently affect everyone. We have had endless outages and DDoS attacks that make the server inaccessible, games crash, 3 or 4 v 5's, etc. After several server migrations, the latest of which promised all-new stable infrastructure, the problems are continuing to occur. And their proposed plans for season 5 will not fix many of these problems.\n\nAnd unlike EUW, we don't have an alternative server.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2014-12-22T17:35:38.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really because i played NA for the entire Season 2 and 3. Aside from 3-4 DDOS attacks at different times of the year (that took quite a while to fix and were really frustrating) i didn't really notice anything and played with 300 ping (because i'm on the opposite side of the world lol). Meanwhile EUW everytime you tried to play you constantly had \"Trying to reconnect\" appear while seeing everything that is going on, if you didn't have \"Trying to reconnect\" you had at minimum 1k ping. The server went down every other day too. Almost for an entire month once actually.\n\nIt was so bad we actually got FREE TRANSFERS TO EUNE.\n\nBut EUNE community is really toxic and i really wish we got a free transfer back now that it is mostly okay.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MasterOfTheOrder","date":"2014-12-22T01:54:46.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, they updates the status.
