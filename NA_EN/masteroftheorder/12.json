Other carries need buffs. She hasn&#039;t been touched in ages, and only recently is outperforming everyone. This is due to item changes, and stat changes ON OTHER CHAMPIONS. She has the exact same strengths and weaknesses she&#039;s always had.\nStop crying for nerfs, and starts crying for buffs. I know all of the boards just love to cry for people to get nerfed, but in reality that won&#039;t fix this situation. Vayne has power because of her kit. She is VERY item reliant, because other than her 3rd hit with w, that&#039;s where all the damage comes from. Both of her AD scaling abilities are not spammable, and have long cool downs without doing much damage. One of which pushes them away, or into a wall. OTHER CARRIES have scaling abilities that have been progressively nerfed.\n\nThe fact that all of this has been ignored is why RIOT goes to reedit, and mostly ignores the boards. (except RiotRepertoire) The correct way to \"nerf\" Vayne is by buffing other carries.","replies":[{"poster":"Mal the Red","date":"2015-08-17T18:20:34.802+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's easier to nerf one champ than to buff several.\n\nThat's why most of the cries are for nerfs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MasterOfTheOrder","date":"2015-08-17T18:18:52.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Other carries being buffed will result in them being played again, so you won't see everyone picking her anymore. \n\nYes, it's easier to nerf one champion than buffing many specific champions, but in this case it's still the correct thing to do.
