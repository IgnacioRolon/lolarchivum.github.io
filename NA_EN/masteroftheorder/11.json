This is a thread from a gamer to an attentive game developer company, in the hopes of continuing to play your game and spend my money on it.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been playing since Nami came out. Despite my approvals and heavy disapprovals of some nerfs/buff, and other changes, I&#039;ve kept playing League despite telling myself I&#039;d quit. Why? Because it&#039;s fun most of the time. It really is. The toxic side of the community is enraging, but still not quite enough to make me quit. Some champions kits are so aggravating that I&#039;ll stop playing the game for the day because they make me tilt, but I still come back in a day or so.\r\n\r\nUntil recently.\r\n\r\nThe old champ select was flawed. This is not news. After quite a long time, we now have new champ select! It&#039;s amazing. It&#039;s better than the old draft champ select in practically every way (except chroma skins hue hue). It makes draft much less rage inducing.\r\n\r\nHowever, it does not replace Team Builder.\r\n\r\nTeam Builder was a blind pick game mode. It was the PERFECT blind pick mode. You pick the champion and role you want to play, and wait until you find a team that thinks it will work well with them (or host a game yourself and find some people with decent synergy). That allowed players to play with complete strangers and have a decent team comp, practically every time. It was amazing.\r\n\r\nWith new champ select, you cannot do that. Sure, you WILL get one of the two roles you pick, but that&#039;s unfortunately not enough for a lot of casual gamers.\r\n\r\nMost of us have a life. I, myself, am a multi-platform gamer. My free time is spent either with friends, or playing games. After you guys removed team builder, I gave the new champ select a good testing (until you had to remove it to fix bugs, good call) and then COMPLETELY STOPPED PLAYING LEAGUE OF LEGENDS.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because I don&#039;t enjoy playing champions I don&#039;t want to play. I have almost all the champions in the game, and I&#039;ve played them all enough to understand how they work. I have a few champions I&#039;m confident enough with that I can reliably pick them. THAT DOESN&#039;T MEAN I WANT TO.\r\n\r\nWhen Jhin comes out, I&#039;ll try playing again. His kit looks fun, and I like the idea of having 700+ ad. Not sure if it&#039;s good, but it seems fun on paper. However, I know for a fact I won&#039;t be able to play him much.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because everyone will be trying to play him as well. Or he&#039;ll get banned. Honestly, Riot employees, I don&#039;t want to play champions I&#039;ve played a lot of already. When a new guy comes out, I want to play them.\r\n\r\nTeam Builder allowed this, and kept me playing. It&#039;s all I played since it released, and it was perfect for a casual gamer such as myself. This isn&#039;t coming from someone that isn&#039;t diverse. I&#039;m not a one trick pony. I just don&#039;t like having to flip a coin.\r\n\r\nNow when I think of playing League, I decide no because _I DONT WANT TO BE STUCK WITH A DIFFERENT CHAMPION._ \r\n\r\nPlease Riot, bring Team Builder back, and leave it in Blind Pick. Anyone that agrees with me, please up vote or comment. If you don&#039;t agree, go ahead and down vote. I&#039;d like this thread to express the communities opinion just as much as my own.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterOfTheOrder","date":"2016-01-31T22:42:16.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a single up vote?
