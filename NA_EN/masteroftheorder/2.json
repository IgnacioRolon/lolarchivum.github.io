However, before you make it a live change…\r\n\r\nPLEASE COMPENSATE THE JUNGLE CHAMPS THAT NEED IT. As it stands, when you put this patch out, many junglers that aren't #biglcsplays will have to clear another camp (and possibly recall first) in order to afford this. The problem with that is the champs that are affected are the same ones you guys are saying you want to be viable again. This makes that VERY hard.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, compensate champs during the same patch, or before. Otherwise you're just showing the world how very little you care about non-LCS champions…. again.","replies":[]}
