Somehow. Some way. I&#039;m not a designer, I&#039;m just a player... but I want to quit the game after being hit by a single e and then losing lane because of it. The moment Illaoi kills your spirit, unless that player is VERY bad, you just lost lane. Period. You have to go and heal (because that hurt a lot), fight tentacles on your way back to lane (which costs you time and lets illaoi farm) and play so passively that you might have to mis out on minion exp.\r\n\r\nI understand that you can dodge it. I really do. But being able to dodge an ability doesn&#039;t make it fair or fun.

I wold love a rioter response simply so that I can be informed if any changes are currently planned, or if for some god forsaken reason the balance team deems illaoi&#039;s e balanced.

If you are melee her aoe Q will hit you and the clone, dealing +30% damage (in low levels). In a skill that is 180 + 200% AD, that hurts pretty bad. (if there are more tentacles, good luck, because W will hit hutr even more).\n\nIf you run she gets free jabs at you and you can't B at all. Every tentacle get two hits to be killed. If you plan to destroy it remove the vessel you'll need 1,5 sec or more if you are playing something tanky since you can't throw skills at it, leaving you a tight gap of 0,5 second for B (8 second for a B). Each tentacle spawns at 10 sec. For a full minute. Why kill 3? Why do players have to be punished so hard dedicating 40~60s of game play just to dodge and kill tentacles? Feels like playing WOW. Farming tentacles. Sure it gives you gold but will ruin your farming if you concentrate on that.\n\nA while ago a red said that dota blood seeker rupture was failed in design.
