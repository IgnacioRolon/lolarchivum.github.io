Team builder is the one game mode where you get to play the champ you want, in the role you want, every time. While the new champ select is nice, it does NOT do this. I only play team builder because I don't like to get stuck doing things I don't want, and frankly I'm single minded. If I want to top, I WANT TO TOP. I don't have the urge to go top lane Vlad, with the possibility of going Jungle Trundle. One or the other.\r\nLeave it, and if games become impossible to find, THEN remove it. If the only reason Riot is removing it is because they believe it will be obsolete, then prove it by letting it stayâ€¦ at least at first.","replies":[]}
