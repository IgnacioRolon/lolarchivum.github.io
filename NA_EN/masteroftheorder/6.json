I very much prefer a coherent setup, not reddit.\r\n\r\nI know I'm not the only person that feels this way. I know it won't make an impact on your elisions whatsoever, but I don't think I'll be signing onto the forums anymore. Maybe if you get rid of the clutter and make it easier to navigate I'll come back.\r\n\r\nI wasn't really a GD person per-say, but the feel and look of the old boards was much cleaner (for the user, not counting the search engine) and easier to grasp.\r\n\r\nI'll check later to see if any Riot person has responded on the likelihood of those changes. If they aren't likely, then I think I'll just play the game and stop visiting the website.","replies":[{"poster":"w1shing 0n stars","date":"2014-10-06T21:54:42.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude they've been working on this change for over a year, they aren't going to up and change the format.
