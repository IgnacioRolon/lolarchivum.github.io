I'm not Challenger skilled, but my personal skill cap isn't limited (as far as I know) and I'm not bad.\r\nSo if you're a team that is looking for a backup, or just need that last person, send me an invite. I'd like to get better, and I can learn how to improve based on what your ranked team needs.\r\nHopefully this board helps me find the people I'm looking for, since in-game most people are just permatoxic.","replies":[]}
