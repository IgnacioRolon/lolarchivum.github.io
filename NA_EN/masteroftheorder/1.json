Nobody dodges without a reason, and it prevents toxic games.\nYou literally have to choose whether you don't mind dropping a rank, or you want to deal with people that are already toxic before the game starts. Ranked would be so much better, really. I get that some people would abuse it and that it's partially necessary, but if we could all have like 2 free dodges that would be amazing. It wouldn't be abusable that way, and it would make ranked less infuriating.\n\n*Edited for correct clarity","replies":[{"poster":"MasterOfTheOrder","date":"2014-12-13T17:43:37.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, it's still annoying that you get punished for dodging lobbies like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Oasis","date":"2014-12-13T11:32:26.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's only LP, as long as it doesn't tank your MMR I don't see a problem.
