Not a rage thread.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":116,"down_votes":21,"body":"While I haven't been playing the game since release, I have been playing it for a while. I hopped in right as Nami was released. My experience has been such:\n\nI started playing, and noticed immediately that the game was quite engaging, and very in depth. I was impressed, especially considering how it's free to play. I played a few games against people, got my butt kicked, but HAD FUN. I knew I was a noob, so I didn't get mad about how thoroughly my butt was handed to me. So, I just kept playing and slowly learned what to do.\n\nThen, about a month later, the Christmas Fiddlesticks skin came out, and I saw the new login screen. I was like \"oh hey, they even update these how cool\" and still kept enjoying the game. Sure, people were toxic, but not everyone. I play many more games than just LoL, so this didn't bother me too much. I was noticing subtle hints that pointed out how much Riot cared about the game, and its players.\n\nNow lets fast forward about 6 months later. I was no longer a noob, and could carry games. I finally understood how nerfs/buffs truly affected champions… cough cough Irelia. I still hadn't really found my main, so the nerfs didn't bother me too much. Still was enjoying the game. If played correctly, any champion could be awesome. So, who cared about nerfs?\n\nThen LCS became a thing that Riot was focused on. I'm going to be blunt about this: LCS is ruining League of Legends. Period. The following will explain why I believe this.\n\nBefore the focus on LCS, from Riots perspective, the average player was their main source of income. The made a sexy skin, and said average player bought it. They made and awesome looking champ, some average players bought them. Every now and then, they'd make a Legendary skin for the sake of awesomeness, and the price would also show support of the game/company. That was the financial focus, and was pretty straightforward. Gameplay balance was focused on the enjoyment of everyone, with the occasional pro-player exception.\n\nThen, Riot began focusing on the LCS and pro play. The reasons were obvious, and fair. The LCS makes a Gragas Keg full of money. Holy Jesus, all that money.\n\nWith that shifted focus, came shifted priorities. Riot had to decide which was more important: average players, or pro players. Why did they have to decide this? Because at high levels of play, 10 damage can be the difference between victory and defeat. That's not the case in Bronze.\n\nSince Riot decided to prioritize LCS when it came to balancing decisions, LoL has become considerably less fun to play. Champions no longer feel powerful, they feel gold-hungry. Champions that don't rely on items get nerfed, most of the time into unplayability. Riot started flat out lying to the player base when it came to explanations (I.E. Veigars \"buff\" and their idea of Diversity ™) because they are contrary to what helps LCS focused players. Champions are now nerfed because of how they affect LCS games, not the average games. Look at Lee Sin as an example. While I don't mind playing against him, a HUGE percentage of the community does. In this current meta, that isn't the case quite as much, but tanks will be nerfed again. We all know it. Can't have flashy LCS plays when they don't end with a kill.\n\nThe gameplay is no longer the same as the LoL that I enjoyed playing so much. LoL used to be 50% strategy, 50% teamwork/skill. Now it's 80% Teamwork/Reflexes, 20% Strategy. Strategy is hardly a thing anymore. Champions that had certain strengths no longer have them, because they were situationally \"OP\". That was perfectly acceptable, and WAS THE POINT, until LCS.\n\nI'm not saying that pro-players are a bad thing. Not at all. But League of Legends is very rapidly becoming very unfriendly towards non pro players, and as a long time gamer, that sickens me. I also find it incredibly un-fun, and I only play games FOR FUN.\n\nFor those of you that still enjoy League of Legends, I wish you all the best. I, however, will be playing other things for a while, and spending my money elsewhere. I'll check in occasionally to see if the gameplay I once loved ever comes back, because I REALLY did enjoy League.\n\nMay you all stay positive, and test negative.\n\n*Immediate edit.

Stop right there and listen.\n\nLCS DOES make profit - not for the event, but for Riot as a whole.   Riot focuses so heavily on the spectator event that they have become detached from us as players, and I don't blame you for being optimistic for your reasoning.  The profit comes from the flashy over-the-top outrageous kits that are put in the spotlight during these spectated games.  What champions do you know have them?  The standard LB, Lee, CertainlyT's monstrosities, etc, and any newly released champion.\n\nWhen people see them making these \"#LCSBigPlays,\" they run to the store and snatch them up immediately.  That's the profit.  And the more they're seen, the more money Riot makes through them.  When the sales start to taper off is when they come out and say \"Ya know, we're not really happy with how dominant (Instert Champion) has been  recently so we feel he/she needs a few touch ups.  Those changes are minimal to crushing depending on how drastically the sales dropped.  Go ahead and feign ignorance if you know about this, and if not, I apologize - it's just painfully obvious to us what's going on.\n\n>Ask anyone who works on the esports team and they will tell you that they do it for players - people love watching Pro LoL so we do what we can to support it. \n\nOkay, that's all fine and dandy on paper, but Riot is attracting spectators that aren't players, and using them as a resource when they want to make changes to the game.  I'm talking about Reddit - where no one can prove they have played a single game of League in their lives.  That doesn't matter to Riot when they're speaking to mindless, bootlicking, white knight, esports fanatics.  That's who Riot wants to appeal to now because that's the audience who won't question Riot's motives when changes are announced, and the moderators do a fine job of repressing the supposed \"anti-Rioters\" who would dare speak out against the benevolent rulers. \n\nLook, by now you can probably guess that I'm not happy with Riot, and haven't been for a quite some time, but don't think that I hate you guys.  I want to see Riot grow, they could just stand to make some time to talk with the community that can prove they're players for a change rather than hide on third party platforms is all.  \n\nThey probably wouldn't come off as detached faceless entities behind a red name anymore, and Boards most likely wouldn't be as hostile of a place as you make it out to be.  As childish and weird as it sounds, we just want some attention, some honesty, and apologies from certain departments (cough balance cough) when we're angry about something.  The wall of silence when something goes wrong makes things worse the longer it goes on.\n\n>The focus of Riot has always been on players of every kind/level, and the reason we can continue to improve it is still players like yourself rather than the Pros.\n\n>Secondly, Scarizard made a post a couple of months ago explaining current balancing philosophy.

These totally mean the same thing.

That's very clear as well.\n\n\n>If it's no longer fun for you then I'm sorry - we let you down, but I hope you realise it's never because we turned our backs.\n\nThat's exactly what's happening, and I'm sorry that you can't / aren't allowed to admit you see it.  Abandon Reddit.  No, don't be alright with going there less, leave all trace of Reddit and come back to the Boards you all dumped on us when we didn't want them. Talk to us when something goes wrong.  Even when the hornet's nest is at it's most riled state, it would do everyone well if there was a two-way communication.\n\nWho knows?

It's not so much about LCS vs Ranked but how players aren't at there skill division in ranked. I can give my best example through this and hopefully you get what i mean.\n\nWhen i started LoL i made this account and i had fun with it. I saw what i was learning and it was very noticeable that I was improving. This was probably the best part of the game but afterwords, once i learned a large amount of what i needed, i got bored. I didn't really move divisions (stayed in S2) and that's pretty bad considering that i know for a fact that i have improved as a player a lot more than i should. Reason why i have is because i made an alternate account. This alternate account climbed from gold 5 (where i started) to master in a lot less time then it took me to get from silver 2 to gold 5 on my main. \n\nNow i definitely got lucky with teams cause i rarely had players that fed 10 kills in lane but its not like we just dominated every game without problem. We still had to try and outplay along with with just knowing our roles in the game. Now that my alt is diamond because of S5 placements and my current account is still silver, it just goes to show how, I've either learned nothing in the past 6 months or the ranked system is not where it should be. Just thinking about the fact that a master player cant get out of silver on his main is just stupid.\n\nA really good way to look at bronze-silver-gold-platinum-diamond-master is by seeing bronze at the bottom for sure cause even i can climb out of bronze without a problem. silver through plat is just hard carrying which isn't a way to rank people. That's like saying, to rank up, you have to outplay every single game by yourself because your adc cant position or you supp doesn't peel or your initiator is to afraid to go in. This game is supposed to be a team game and even though it is solo que, there should be more team play features in middle elos. Also I'm not saying that teamwork doesn't play a part in plat or gold because with teamwork you win but what i am saying is that finding a team that you can actually rely on to have good teamwork and know there part is next to impossible. Also to get out of plat, you need teamwork which has a pretty good mentality behind it but still, your requiring random teammates to play there part when chances are, they don't know how to and we cant just right a paragraph in-game describing each role so that we win team fights together because it shouldn't be other players jobs to make there teammates better. We can give tips but not explain the entirety of the role.\n\nNow diamond 2 to master is full teamwork. You at this point can handle yourself and know what to do in certain situations. This is where the actual game gets learned and not just how to carry. That's probably the worst thing I've ever heard. The top 2 (not counting challenger) ranks are where you learn the game and the rest is just carrying. Like there isn't any improvement in the game. You can get good but you still have to get lucky enough to rely on teammates which in diamond and master you can do but in everything else you cant.\n\nThis isn't just a rant about myself. I have friends that play like they are in diamond. They pick champions to fit teamcomps, they win lane every game they help other teammates when they are capable of it but they are in plat. Reason why is because they don't have the luck of coming across teammates that they don't have to carry every game they play. My master account, never had this problem. Again i did get lucky but i played the game well, knowing my lane match up, knowing what to do if i lose lane or when but that doesn't seem to matter nowadays considering me winning lane is followed up by if my teammates won lane.\n\nIt's obvious that I'm kinda mad about this lol but i don't like how, me getting to master on my alt account didn't change the fact that i cant climb out of silver because i never needed to worry about carrying in a team game. I learned how to play the game with a team and now i have to figure out how to carry which in my eyes is the worst experience I've had with any game I've ever played.","replies":[{"poster":"LaceUp23","date":"2015-07-06T00:20:03.283+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm glad that someone of a higher ELO actually realizes this is a problem.

LoL is a team game, playing solo with 4 strangers... you never know what is going to happen.\n> \n> You mentioned 'team play features in middle elo' I'd be interested to hear what you mean by that.\n\nAlready typed a lot so ill keep this one kind of short. When i say team play features in middle elo i purely mean that this game is divided into 2 different settings. There is the setting where someone carries, and there is the setting where your team along with you carries. Now this division happens in plat 2 - diamond 4. So from bronze 5 to plat 2, it's carry and from diamond 4 to challenger its team. Now the problem with this is that LoL is meant to be a team game but having the majority of the ranks being soloed, that's a really bad way to improve yourself. Now this goes all the way up to plat 2 when things starts to change and this is the reason why the majority of players (at least that i know) that have been playing for years are stuck in plat because this change in game play is a lot bigger than it looks. Having to learn a completely new play style because the game doesn't help players learn it, the players have to learn it themselves, is a reason why people are stuck in such a low elo.\n\nNow I'm not going to be that guy and say that if you try and focus on what you are doing wrong each game you will go up because that simply isn't true. People that go up are people whoa re lucky enough to rely on there teammates for teamwork rather than for them to catch up when they are behind. This jump form plat 2 to diamond 4 is when people learn the team play aspect of the game. In my eyes, it's just stupid. We learn how to work as a team in a team game at one of the last divisions rather than somewhere in the middle. bronze is where you learn how to fend for yourself. Silver is mastering yourself and improving others because of it. Gold is mastering yourself and mastering others. Platinum is Full on teamwork. Lastly, diamond is where you put your skills to the test with other players that know teamwork and know the knowledge of the game. \n\nThat's how it should be, but is it? No. Its solo from bronze to plat and then from diamond up is team. Reason why? It's because you cant rely on your teammates at any of these elos because of how people are placed. It took me 4 months to get to master (granted I play many games professionally and when i play a game i tend to go all out). In these 4 months, there is NO WAY I've learned as much as someone who's been playing LoL for 2 years yet I beat half of my friends who have been playing the game that long by 2-3 ranks (they are gold and plat). I can honestly say that they can beat me in a 1v1, they can probably outplay me do to my lack of knowledge in skill damage and so on but i made it farther. Reason why is because i got lucky enough to skip the solo, carry for yourself game and i went straight to teamwork which is what really mattered. It's kinda the reason I'm leaving now because The ranking system makes my game play on this account completely pointless because i know i learned a lot of things but its not helping me in the overall game, only in very specific situations.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2015-07-06T00:19:45.877+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks for the long and detailed response.\n\nOne thing that I (and probably a lot of others) find a little hard to swallow is the statement that the balance team's focus is to make the best experience for every player.  Oh, I'm sure that the statement is true and that is their goal, but it often doesn't feel like that given the current state of the game.\n\nFor me, the biggest issue I have with the game is that the game seems to be heading more towards an emphasis on counterpicks rather than counterplay - a lot of champions (especially newer ones) have kits that effectively hard-counter a large subset of champions, meaning that anyone who plays against them with a champion that isn't good against them is going to have no fun for most of that game, simply because there's not much that they can do.\nAdded to that, a lot of the newer champions are focused on mechanical skill and \"outplay potential\", often in a form that allows them to negate the enemy's abilities.  What that ends up meaning is that the matchup becomes based almost exclusively on one player's ability to negate the other player's skill, rather than a proper battle between the two player's skills.\n\nFor me, the most fun games are the ones where these kinds of champions are not played on either side.

At the time the game was relatively new and exciting, it was always fun to discover a new champ. Times were good.\n\nThen, I'd say somewhere right around the release of Darius, things... changed. I no longer played most of the new champions because I simply did not agree with the design direction most of them were taking. It was pretty clear to me that most new champions were strictly outclassing my old favorites. Draven and Lucian were cool enough to warrant an exception. I would definitely say that Zed, Thresh, Yasuo, and more recently Kalista were all major sore points with me. \n\nI think part of my problem here is that I always compared newer champions to my favorite character: Gangplank. See, sometime in Season 3, pretty much every one of my friends quit the game for some reason or another, and the game was starting to get stale for me. I decided, hell with it, I'm gonna main Gangplank because **he's a pirate, so obviously I should main him**. I like his character, his kit, the way he plays, everything about him. Other characters had simply stopped interesting me by that time. I did enjoy played ranged carries, but a lot of the times they all felt similar, and they also felt a little \"cheap\" to me. So I settled on maining Gangplank and playing him pretty much exclusively.\n\nBut it was clear to me at the time I decided it (since I'd been playing him since 2011, and even if I hadn't it wouldn't have taken long to become clear anyway) that Gangplank was simply... outclassed. In so many ways. There are so many problems with the guy I could write a short novel on it. But I kept it up, determined to make him work.\n\nBut every time a new champion came out, I had to ask myself, \"If I were playing the role this new champion is designed for, is there any reason to pick Gangplank over them?\" The answer was always no. A resounding no at that. Yasuo in particular infuriated me. \"Double crit? Gangplank would give his left leg for that!\" I remember telling myself.\n\nFinally, after a crushing loss with Gangplank where I went something like 8/6/something, I snapped. I had had enough. I quit on the spot (well, I finished the night with my associates first, another crushing loss with J4 as my friends... let's just say they don't mesh well with my overly aggressive J4 play) and I never looked back. I think the last time I played a matchmade game was in Summer 2014.\n\nMy brother still plays League now and then, and I enjoy watching him play. But the thing is, he too enjoys playing Gangplank, and I jokingly chastise him every time he does so. \"You're hurting your team when you pick GP,\" I tell him, \"but most of all, you're hurting _yourself._\" But as much as I'm joking around with him, **it's also true**.\n\nGangplank is seen by many as the ultimate troll pick. Nobody wants him on their team.\n\nI quit for one simple reason:\n\n**My favorite character is a joke, and he has been for the past 4 years.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Uiru","date":"2015-07-06T01:53:46.501+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"I need Riot to know that if I knew now what I knew three years ago, you never would have gotten a dime out of me. I ask myself -every day- why I am still here. I am running out of answers.\n\nYour game is unrecommendable. I want to play it with friends, because people are awful, but I like my friends. Why would I subject them to this? Trying to get a new player on board with this game is akin to trying to \"gift\" them a full time job. Look at all these things you can have, if you put literally weeks of effort in for every single one. Sure there are some viable \"cheap\" champions, but the runepages you'll need are still a colossal time investment. And I used to not mind supporting Riot, but that was before LCS showed up and made it clear what Riot's priorities were.\n\nMobility creep is responded to with -more mobility-. Champs without resource bars pay nothing for them. Energy is a God damn joke. New champs with mana have laughable costs. Riot says so much about their design philosophies, and then do nothing when direct contradictions are presented to them. Your balance team has a list of champs that will never receive more than joke nerfs (Zed's attack speed- people got paid to think that would solve the problem?) and another list of champs that will stay in the dumpster until people forget about them (how much more nonsensical can Evelynn get?).\n\nSidebar: Evelynn is an assassin mage whose only viable build is bruiser tank. Which she sucks at, because building tank on a squishy does not make them a tank. In a game where assassins are celebrated for deleting squishies with their ults hers doesn't even have a minimum damage. All this because permastealth is allegedly too strong, but when you deal no damage with effectively no cc and die in three hits, what's the problem again? Evelynn is kept weak because if she's strong, people will have to adjust their playstyle... which is exactly what Katarina does (forcing copious amounts of hard cc or it's gg at champ select). Two contradictions right there. Oh, but don't worry, anything someone might currently like about the character is in line to be destroyed in a rework. Yay.\n\nSo there are champs you want us to play, and there are champs you don't want us to play. Of my four favorites, Eve has been discussed. Lux got her movespeed nerfed when the resourceless hypermobile ad assassins moved into mid lane, so she's obviously out. Sejuani was good for like one patch before she got devastated and I'm pretty sure you're not done with her yet. Sej's damage and cc have both been decimated since her rework that was supposed to get her playrate up in the first place, so thanks for that! Also, you now have TWO shirtless men from the freljord, so even her visual rework did nothing but prove that Riot thinks that only women are too weak to run around the arctic improperly dressed. A+. That leaves Janna, whom I KNOW your balance team hates but their inability to stop her from being incredible leads me to believe she's the best designed champion in the game. You invented a new mechanic just to nerf her q further, her passive has been completely destroyed OVER AND OVER AGAIN, her shield is the only one in the game whose secondary effect goes away when it breaks, her w has been shredded, and her ult used to be bigger AND slow enemies who reentered it (not that that would do much good against the dashes and blinks that are choking this game to death but it was something). And she's still fantastic! One day you'll break her like you did with Sona but that day isn't today. I believe in you! Make me switch to Thresh!\n\nBut maybe you already play Zed or Thresh or Lee Sin or Leblanc or one of the approved LCS champs. You still get to deal with Riot's player behaviour initiatives making ranked unplayable. Riot will not even ATTEMPT to address the issue of 4v5's in ranked because they are TERRIFIED that their already wretched playerbase will use it as an excuse to be even worse. I CAN MUTE A SHITBIRD. I CAN'T REPLACE A GUY THE CLIENT KICKED OUT BECAUSE THE CLIENT IS STILL A COMPLETE JOKE.\n\nBasically the only thing your company has done since I've been here that I can say was awesome was the removal of (most of) the limited skins. That took balls. I'm going to be sad when my Championship Riven gets that hideous overlay glued onto it, but the chance to give you money for goods I desired WAS VERY APPRECIATED god it sounds ridiculous even typing it. The formalization of the champion IP reduction schedule was great but it needs to go further. It took YEARS of begging to get Sorceress Lux's shitty splash replaced with the obviously superior version we FINALLY got a few months ago- great? What the hell was the holdup?\n\nSycophants don't like posts that are 100% bitching so I present to you now, A List of Things I Would Like To See, in no order whatsoever regarding importance or scope. Except for the first one. \n\n 1. I want to see Riot TRYING to implement a system that will invalidate 4v5's in ranked. I have proposed several. Fear of abuse is not a valid reason to handicap your mode that purports to be about skill but is in fact more akin to a slot machine. A player in ranked is there to be ranked, not to be wrapped in a warm blanket and told it's going to be okay. The mute function exists; if that's not enough a player is free to be coddled in normals.\n\n 2. I want somebody from the balance team to tell me WHY they nerfed Lux's movespeed, and what they thought it would achieve. And then, when they can offer no logical explanation for it, to give it back to her. Lux is EXTREME risk, mediocre reward right now, IF she plays pitch perfectly against resourceless assassins who have safety nets for days, and something needs to be done.\n\n 3. I want a bone to be thrown to new players. You won't do anything about the ridiculous cost of runes and champions out of fear of backlash from players who have already suffered through it. Man up and get it done. You need new players because the simple fact is that your existing players are getting fed up with your bullshit. There are so many champions now that cutting the prices by 1500 IP across the board would do little other than show that you can recognize that your game today is different from your game five years ago. 450 IP should be free and move everything else down a tier. Or offer some kind of $60 bundle that gives a (selectable?) batch of champs and enough runes to get started; enough to keep a new player busy while they grind out the rest. It's not like you won't be making a killing on skins anyway.\n\n 4. Skin faces in place of default faces. Such a simple, stupid little thing. Make it a toggle if you think new players will be confused (as if new players won't be confused enough by how expensive everything is and how long it'll take for them to stop getting murdered by people who have it all already).\n\n 5. MMR. Show it to me. Rank me by it. This league stuff is complete horseshit and everything you fret about regarding ladder anxiety is TEN TIMES WORSE when you're sitting at 0 LP after your fifth attempt at a promotion only to get one troll throwing you back six or seven games minimum. Promotion games ARE AWFUL and YOUR PLAYERS HATE THEM. Please stop patting yourselves on the back for a job well done on this when it is the exact opposite. MMR.\n\n 6. I'd -love- to see the code the matchmaker runs on. Because oh my God the games this thing thinks are fair is unreal. If there was one brutal stomp one way or another every now and then it'd be okay, but it's like 7 or 8 out of ten where the matchmaker already knows who's going to win and your only chance is a client disconnection. It's so hard to judge your personal skill and growth when you either win so hard you didn't need to be there or lose so hard that there is nothing you could have done.\n\n 7. Champion select sorting. I have all the champs now (didn't spend as much RP on them as you'd think!) and I still only play like ten of them. Why not throw them at the top of the list? \n\n 8. Ping display. Speaking of the slot machine, which player do you think is going to suddenly have lag issues? Is it...  YOUR ally? Surprise! The client should be pinging Riot's servers every few minutes and keeping a log, and if your connection is shit you don't get to play ranked. Because all you're going to do is ruin it for everyone else. A little number up by the play button to let you know your connection is crap would do wonders.\n\n 9. Replays. Still waiting on those.\n\n 10. Make slows slow dash animations. Make slows not a complete joke. Here comes an assassin! Let me throw down a slow field to impede their oh no wait they dashed straight over it. That enemy is getting away! Let me use a slow to oh there they go, safe and sound. League of Mobility needs to stop. Use the tools already in the game to do something about it. Related; movement impairing cc should stop a champion at point of impact. If Fizz dives at me and I do the right thing and snare him just as he starts to move, there's no reason for him to be rooted right next to me, with his little bitch spear sticking out of my now dead body. Yes this would mean that bullshit champs like Fizz would have to bait the binding first, just like Mystery Example Champion needs to burn half her mana bar baiting the trollpole, backing off, then reengaging in the like five second window until it's up again. \n\nNOW TO WAIT FOR EVERYTHING TO GET BETTER","replies":[{"poster":"DomainSpecific","date":"2015-07-06T06:02:05.409+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's funny because abuot 80% of the stuff you said is plain wrong. \n\nYou talk like if Zed is LCS plays and good, when he is extremely trashy atm and seldom picked (he was picked today, did awful).

I want to reply because it seems like a good opportunity to point out a couple of common misconceptions I see a lot of players expressing. I've included some recent articles with the information:\n> \n> First off, the LCS doesn't actually make any profit. It was true when it started and it is still true today. Ask anyone who works on the esports team and they will tell you that they do it for players - people love watching Pro LoL so we do what we can to support it. The focus of Riot has always been on players of every kind/level, and the reason we can continue to improve it is still players like yourself rather than the Pros.\n> \n> http://fortune.com/2015/06/09/riot-games-esports/\n> \n> Secondly, Scarizard made a post a couple of months ago explaining current balancing philosophy. In it he explains that balance is focused around \"platinum and above\" although \"This doesn’t mean we devalue the feedback from players below platinum - only that we’re acknowledging that a high amount of variance occurs in those tiers.\" He goes on to say that \"Extreme outliers, be they pubstompers or pro-level pains will always be addressed, but more often than not our patch-to-patch changes are centered around this skill bracket.\"\n> \n> http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/xwOObpq2-live-gameplay-qa-issue-1-feat-feralpony-smashgizmo?sort_type=recent\n> \n> So balance isn't focused around the LCS, although given the fact that LCS players are above gold and play a lot of games with high visibility it does seem this way at times. Sometimes I see a nerf coming in and immediately think 'But ____ isn't even being played in the Pro scene' and it confuses me too, but Challenger is only a tiny fraction of the data used.\n> \n> Now I don't necessarily agree with the balance team all the time either. I was okay with point-and-click abilities and more focus on big picture strategy than outplays that seem to favour mobility. But I have the privileged of seeing from the inside that the focus of the teams is always to make the best experiences for every player. My jungle fiddlesticks is suddenly feeling the pain of a useless jungle upgrade, while my jungle Nautilus seems to have shifted to Top/Support, but despite this I am seeing more champion variation, impactful itemisation and exciting gameplay in my matches than any previous season.\n> \n> If it's no longer fun for you then I'm sorry - we let you down, but I hope you realise it's never because we turned our backs.\n\nIf you address so called \"pub-stompers\" doesn't that just make them unviable for higher tier play (and thus objectively LESS balanced since balance is supposed to be a concept assuming perfect play by both sides)? If so, wouldn't that mean you're actually making the game MORE unbalanced and limiting diversity whenever you \"fix\" a champion that gives trouble to lower tiers?","replies":[{"poster":"Gavran","date":"2015-07-06T06:32:08.663+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">balance is supposed to be a concept assuming perfect play by both sides\n\nHow do you figure?

The white knight could never hope to match the love and effort it takes to actually critique a game for its flaws and have the strength to say:  \"Hey, I love this game but X really needs some work.\"  The saddest part is, it seems that Riot has alienated themselves from those that actually care about the games and instead wishes to embrace the \"white knight\" who really isn't a true fan of the game at all, and while they may also enjoy the game they will never truly care for the game because they have not yet come to realize that nothing in this world is perfect and that everything can be improved.\n\nIt is when you truly achieve that understanding of things and realize that, then you can actually understand that all those times you were attempting to stamp out any form of criticism that you realize that you aren't actually helping the game grow, but are instead preventing its growth and in essence causing it to stagnate and even possibly die.\n\nPerhaps the saddest part about all of this is, Riot has been steadily on the track of alienating themselves from any form of criticism, and in essence are actually alienating themselves from those that actually _care_ about the game.  They are actually turning their backs on those that want to help the game grow and wish to see it evolve and prosper as the world moves forward.  However, it seems that their voices are not being heard as Riot has grown from its once player driven, community oriented and pretty hefty amounts of community aid in the development of the game into a large corporation that has grown beyond the need of seeking aid from a \"mere player.\"\n\nThese players, players such as the OP for this thread are being shunted, ignored, and ultimately are eventually driven away as they discover that their ideas and their good will isn't actually being acknowledged.  Instead they simply turn to the position of:  Was everything they said positive and good?  Then there will be a response.  Was there some negative criticism in their?  Ignored and thrown into the growing pile.\n\nI am sure that Riot has a list that they have formed in order to process through the information, however I personally feel that the lists order is as follows:\n\nItems at the top are looked at first:\n\n-Praise to League of Legends / Riot (not as commonly posted as the below, but almost always commented on by a red, in fact it is almost unusual not seeing a red post on one of these)\n-Funny stuff (seems a lot of effort goes into this one, more so than any other type of post)\n-Fan-Art\n-Skin Ideas (note, not including skin critiquing)\n-Bugs\n-Skin Criticism\n-Gameplay Criticism\n\nThat pretty much seems to be the trend for how riot responds to various posts on the boards and as to which stuff gets priority over the others.  Now, following my idea that they view these things in a form of list, they will generally always get to the skin ideas, and might even be able to touch some of the bugs but generally they will never actually get to the bottom of the list because realistically it is nearly impossible to sift through ALL of that information and still have time to actually get down to the critiquing of the game.  Thus the issues will simply grow and grow and continue to be ignored (a real life example of this would be the U.S. Congress during the years before the civil war, they would move any topic of slavery to the very bottom of their list for topics to be discussed during their meetings, and thus they would never get to it).\n\nWill this trend ever change?  I honestly don't know.  But I do know that if this trend does keep going that eventually, not today, and probably not tomorrow, but eventually,  Riot's own hubris will destroy themselves.\n\nIt is the hubris of man that damns us all.\n\nI know pretty much no one will read this, and I sadly doubt that Riot would glance at it, but thank you to those that did.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karn Bishop","date":"2015-07-05T09:22:24.442+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"I also gave up on it, though for me the reason was different.
