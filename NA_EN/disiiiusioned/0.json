Nothing else is disconnecting, I'm having no trouble with surfing the internet, but randomly my client will just give me the error message that It's trying to reconnect, and then never does. Then when I close the client, and re-open, it will give me more error messages before it finally lets me log back in. I haven't tried playing a game because I'm a little nervous of being DC'd and getting reported/banned. \r\n\r\nAny ideas here?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-09T02:22:55.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might be more of a settings related issue rather than your connection speed.
