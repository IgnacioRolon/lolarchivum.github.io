The first thing is that when you&#039;re ahead or you simply have tons of AP your Q kills all the minions exept canon. \nIt might look a good thing but there is a huge drawback: you can&#039;t dash on minions to chase someone or to escape without losing your reset whereas it&#039;s an important mechanic on Diana. It&#039;s even worse when  jungling because you&#039;re forced to buy luden which makes earlier the moment when you kill minions with Q.\n\nSo what I&#039;m asking Riot is to make her R reset even if her target died before her R ends if her Q hit her target because you can&#039;t remove an important champion mechanic just because you are doing well in a game or bc you have purchased AP on an AP champion (the usual core build is spellbinder+rabadon atm, you kill minions when you have rabadon). Having your R on CD makes your very vulnerable on Diana and useless for a long time (25/20/15s which is usually untill the end of the fight) so I believe it's a good change making her less frustrating to play without making her OP. \n\nPS: sorry about my English","replies":[{"poster":"Stray Kat","date":"2019-01-08T07:33:26.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I'm okay with the way it currently is - Any real power shift for Diana(such as this) is particularly dangerous.  She's right on the edge of being just plain nonsense to deal with, or useless.  She's kept in check purely based on the fact that she can be kept down the entire game if she's put behind early, and her range isn't that far(You can stay out of her reach - This change negates that more often).  Coming into her range is suicide for a lot of champions, and I'll often use Cannons/melee minions(Your Q isn't 1-shotting Melee minions without a Ludens Proc and ridiculous amounts of AP) to close that gap and get on a squishy.  Allowing me to do the same plays with Mage minions that I'm 1-shotting would just be over bearing for a lot of matchups against her.\n\n\nThis coming from a dedicated Diana Main/1-trick.  There's way better Diana players out there than me, they'd abuse it way harder than I ever could - Yet I'd be over bearing with this change..\n\n\nEdit: Side Note - If your build allows you to R a minion without killing it with JUST the R damage, you can actually Q+R a minion, and land before your Q does - Causing your R to reset when it DOES hit the target(That you already smacked into.) - This can be dangerous though, as your R killing the target will cause you to not get the reset.  As long as you're not building Ludens(Or Runic Echo), and you don't hit your W in midair, it should be possible to do in a lot of situations.  Just have to be careful to not instantly AA the minion when your R lands, before your Q lands.  I make this play quite often, where I'll Q+R a minion and be 1-2 steps past the minion(Having already landed and kept running) before my Q hits to reset my R.   Won't work real late game when you 1-Shot them either way, or if you've built a Ludens... But at level 6-10 you can quite easily pull this off(As long as you're not mega fed with a ton of AP already.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quil Evrything","date":"2019-01-08T04:38:27.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh stop whining. diana is OP enough as it is.
