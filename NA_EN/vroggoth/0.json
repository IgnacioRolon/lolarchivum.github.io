Maybe you could elucidate what part of Veigars \"4 buttons\" make him so \"easy\" to play? While his pattern did not have many branching paths, and was quite strait forward, I think \"uncomplicated\" might be the word you were searching for, as he was never considered \"easy\".. \n\nThe point Salzigorimando brings up about telegraphed intentions is also quite sound.

Veigar was specifically cited as a pro player as being a \"stun bot\". Annie occupies a similar space, where she's used pretty much entirely for Tibbers stun and the rest of her kit is kind of irrelevant. But at least Annie needs to cast the rest of her abilities to get her stun up. Veigar, as far as the LCS is concerned, basically only has his E. It says a lot about him if he has only one useful ability to professional players but is picked by them anyways.\n\nHowever, every single one of Ahri's abilities are important to why she's strong. You brought up her least important ability, sure, but Ahri's foxfire is more crucial to her LCS play than Veigar's Q or W was to his. Her passive combined with her good mana costs give her near indefinite laning compared to other mages - remove it, and she would fall off in play. Her Q is the brunt of her upfront burst, forms most of her poke, and gives her good kiting - remove it, she would fall off in play. Her W gives her reliable multi-target damage, but I will concede it is her least important ability and doesn't contribute much to her overall strength. Her E gives her absurd pick potential - remove it, she falls off from play. Her ult gives her absurd kiting, absurd chasing, strong repositioning, and decent damage. Her ult is extremely important to her, whereas LCS stunbot support Veigar doesn't care about his ult nearly as much as he cares about his E. \n\nOrianna's kit as a whole is insanely useful. Unlike Veigar, her power budget is pretty evenly spread among her abilities, whereas 90 percent of Veigar's is contained in his E. \n\nOnce again, Xerath's power budget is spread around much better. His passive, Q, W, E, and R are all extremely important to how he's played. His Q forms the brunt of his poke and comprises half of his waveclear patterns - without it, he's useless. His W gives him another good long range damage/waveclear ability, as well as giving him some nice utility. His E is extremely important because it's his only defense mechanism as well as a decent ability for getting picks. His R is good for finishing stragglers as well as just plinking people who are too busy in teamfights to dodge the damage. Once again, compare to LCS stunbot Veigar, who only needs his E to do what he needs to do.\n\nLissandra is much the same way. Her passive, like Xeraths, contributes to near endless in-lane harass. Her Q comprises the brunt of her waveclear and poke and gives her good utility. Her W is good both offensively and defensively. Her E is her initiate and escape. Her ult is self explantory. Without any of those abilities she would be trash. \n\nYou could almost literally have taken Veigars Q or W away and he would still have been played in the LCS. That is not true for any of those champions, even Annie, because she at least needs to charge her stun with spellcasts.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yoella","date":"2015-03-14T01:59:13.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Veigar lost 20% on his R ratio, but he gained a different version of Q that can (potentially) gain him more AP and quicker too.

It's an AoE with a 100% ratio. Now, as an avid Veigar player (well maybe not since 5.4) I know all too well how long the delay is, and how difficult it is to land without the stun landing first. But if they lowered the delay they'd probably have to nerf either the damage or AoE to compensate, because it truly is an immensely powerful ability.\n\nI think they're trying to make the stun more reliable while still giving it counterplay (albeit it had counterplay before all this). The issue is that I don't think they can do this without changing the fundamental part of the stun being that it only stuns on the edges and everywhere else is completely safe.
