I honestly don't think I said anything toxic. And just for context, my entire team was flaming and bullying me because I was playing poorly. The only thing I can think of that could have triggered the system was me saying the word \"cock,\" but that wasn't said in the context of negativity. The Darius was dumpstering me in lane, and I was just teasing him. I honestly thought it was funny, and the Darius had a funny response to it. That's why I wanted to have the ban appealed; I felt like the system just saw the word \"cock\" and decided to punish me. \n\nLog: \n\nPre Game Lobby:\n    DEGAtv: well this is awkward\n    DEGAtv: ðŸ˜ž\n    DEGAtv: but I'm a yasuo one trick ðŸ˜ž\n    DEGAtv: yeah\n    DEGAtv: we need some shreeding\n    DEGAtv: shredding*\n    DEGAtv: bork\n\n\nIn Game:\n    DEGAtv: me and darius gonna have some fun\n    [All]DEGAtv: rude\n    [All]DEGAtv: darius if yall didnt cheese me in the beginning, this would be a different story. just fyi\n    DEGAtv: im so behind. will need more help\n    DEGAtv: just to voli\n    DEGAtv: and i didnt give it\n    DEGAtv: he had to work for it\n    DEGAtv: this is the worst thing ever\n    DEGAtv: i cant farm\n    DEGAtv: you should probably focus on bot lane, jax\n    DEGAtv: im too behind to help now\n    DEGAtv: just get kog fed. that's our win condition\n    DEGAtv: ??\n    DEGAtv: why you being mean?\n    DEGAtv: get over yourself\n    DEGAtv: not true\n    DEGAtv: stop being toxic\n    [All]DEGAtv: you have a nice big cock, darius\n    [All]DEGAtv: ur making me so hard, darius\n    [All]DEGAtv: 1v1 me after this\n    [All]DEGAtv: without cheese\n    [All]DEGAtv: you lose\n    [All]DEGAtv: reportable, veigar\n    DEGAtv: yas, respect him dude\n    DEGAtv: he's fed\n    [All]DEGAtv: darius\n    [All]DEGAtv: isnt it time to go to another lane?\n    [All]DEGAtv: lol i knew youd be there\n    DEGAtv: stop being toxic\n    DEGAtv: while you were typing mid you coulda gotten 1000g shut down on darius.

Ignoring the vulgar comments to Darius (I'll get to that here in a moment), the other negative parts of your chat log include detrimental arguing, accusations of toxicity, report rallying/threatening, and one instance of elo-shaming.\n\nIt's more-or-less an average log (from the perspective of someone who reviews chat logs), and would certainly net a punishment, but there are a few elements that, to me, are missing.\n\nFor starters, going back to the comments to Darius, is Riot's policies regarding sexually explicit/vulgar chat. I've seen quite a lot of chat logs, with a small handful of vulgar chats included amongst them, but I'm having a hard time recalling any of the details in regards to punishments.\n\nSo, I'm not sure if they'd be escalation-worthy, but, that leads me into the other missing piece of the equation; your punishment history.\n\nDo you have a history of punishments? Or, would this be your first? Because if you had recently (within 2-3~ months) come off of a 25-game Chat Restriction, then this log would reasonably push you up to a 14-day ban, but, if you otherwise had a clean slate, then the only explanation would be that Riot treats sexually explicit/vulgar chat with zero tolerance.\n\nIt's worth it at least to send in another Support Ticket to ask about their policies regarding vulgar chat, but, if this is your first punishment, then I'd also suggest asking at least for a lighter penalty.\n\nOtherwise, if you have any further questions, do feel free to ask.","replies":[{"poster":"Boatwhistle","date":"2018-12-31T07:59:56.462+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":13,"body":"LOL WHAT???

I apply this broadly because I've received the same (implied but not explicitly outlined) policy in multiple tickets by multiple player support staff.

But when you're being bullied by your entire team, asking for help (i.e \"pls report\") is only natural. But if you are correct in that it doesn't matter, then so be it. Guess I won't ask for reports anymore. \n\nWeird, though, since Riot's automated email showed me my \"most heavily reported\" games, insinuating that the number of reports _does_ matter. Maybe just poor wording on their part.
