Can you please fix this. Its been weeks, and I&#039;ve reported before, as I&#039;m sure many also have.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not sure if its because I also own DJ Sona, but it&#039;s getting really frustrating. I spent alot of money on a skin that doesn&#039;t even work to its full advertised working status. If you could fix this, I would much appreciate it.
