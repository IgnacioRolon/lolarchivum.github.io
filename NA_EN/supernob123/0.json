Since then I&#039;ve seen him underperforming in lane and in the jungle. With a .5 nerf to his stun and the slow on his ult going from 60/70/80 decaying over 4 seconds to 40/50/60 lasting 2 seconds, he&#039;s missing some vital components to his kit. While experienced players may find a way to have him work, other newer players will no longer put time into learning him. According to champion.gg His win rates have dropped nearly 4% within the first week of his nerf. I think this may be because the stun is much slower, denying several stars from his W to land, and since his ult does not slow nearly as much and as for long, he&#039;s missing a drastic part of his escape (since he cant do much inside his orbit). His stun is also good for escape, but it takes a short delay before detonating it early so if someone is right on top of you, your only hope is your ult (which isn&#039;t that good anymore). If your ult is down then you&#039;re basically dead. Maybe its not players getting used how to play with him with the nerf, or did he really not deserve the nerf? I was just wondering if he needs/deserves a rebuff because lately he&#039;s been under peforming in lane, and not that good of a champion anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-04-14T22:43:42.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Experienced\" Aurelion Sol player here.\n\nTo start, I will say that I personally believe he is doing alright. The nerfs were definitely noticeable, but it hit his extraneous power more than anything. The duration on q and ult were particularly oppressive when he was ahead, though they were useful tools for when he was behind. Now, he has to rely even more on his ability to secure kills through either favorable match ups or roaming.\n\nI'd be the first to say that I sucked with him when I first started, like most everyone probably. Out of any champion that I have played, he has the most apparent set of strengths and weaknesses (his strengths being his ability to roam, contest objectives, and provide impressive sustained damage and his weaknesses being less reliable damage and facing anyone with a gap closer). I think it is the weaknesses that offer the most difficulty to newer players, as the punishment for messing up usually means death for the Sol (and possibly his team). \n\nDo I think he needs buffs? Probably not. Realistically, the balance of champions are set towards people who can play them effectively rather than newer players. A better direction would be to think of a change that makes him more accessible to new players while still keeping his power potential relatively the same. How that could be done specifically I am not so sure.\n\nOverall, I love Aurelion Sol and I encourage everyone to pick him up and experiment with him. I'll have you know that I didn't start getting good with him until I used my own build rather than the recommended items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2016-04-14T22:57:02.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My issue is that all the enemy team needs to do is pick 2 melee champs and gank him over and over.\n\nHe literally has NO def vs Melee.  Almost ALL melee champs can get back on him if he lands his stun and still win any trade.\n\nASols \"Zone\" is not enough of a threat to make melee have to think if they should engage him.\n\nCurrently at all points in the game if a melee runs into ASol 1v1 100% melee will attack and win by just sticking on him.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-04-14T23:39:41.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sol has some tricks up his sleeve to combat this. His q and w make farming under turret pretty easy, so don't be afraid to stay on the defensive in certain match ups. His main strength is roaming, so really after level 4 you shouldn't be in lane enough to make junglers even want to gank you. \n\nRunning away from his q will make it reach the edge and explode more quickly, which will stun anyone that isn't directly on top of you. If your flash is up, you can also use q then immediately flash in order to instantly pop your q, which can be a real life saver. Of course there is also his ult (tip, use q before you ult to give it a little extra air time, knocking them into the AoE and giving a guarenteed stun). If you are still having trouble, consider taking exhaust or barrier. If you are STILL having trouble, you need to ward or roam more, because you are getting camped.","replies":[{"poster":"Profirix","date":"2016-04-14T23:41:46.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just looked up your account. How do you manage to keep enough mana to do anything without buying RoA? Doran's rings can't possibly be enough sustain for the early-mid game.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-04-14T23:47:26.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only use w when I have to, which is usually to hit the enemy with a single star after stunning them with q (which I max first). Afterwards I use an auto to proc Thunderlord then continue to focus on farming. \n\nUsing this tactic, two Doran's rings are plenty for mana regen, as long as you farm well. I try and save pokes for when thunderlord is off cool down in order to make the most of my mana. Late game, mana becomes a little less of an issue, but you still need to be careful to try and save enough for teamfights.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AttackOnTeemos","date":"2016-04-14T22:46:06.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He isn't one of those typical nuke you into the ground AP.  ^ Like he said he is all about objective controlling and roaming.","replies":[]}]}
