After that... you see a lot of what you saw in the first 20 games, even though there's what, over 100 hundred champs? There are a few champs I've been waiting for probably 15-20 games to play, and still can't get enough people interested. I know there are people out there who would actually like to play wukong/vi/etc. I'm just not matched with enough of them in any one game. Solution? ADD TEAMBUILD. I'm probably gonna keep spamming this in threads until it catches on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2015-10-18T17:58:22.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With only one friend i managed to play 14 games of OFA with only 3 repeats (blitz, malz, and kayle).
