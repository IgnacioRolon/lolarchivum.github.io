Yes.","replies":[{"poster":"VoIdymort","date":"2017-10-16T13:17:41.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://imgur.com/a/FHXLj\n\n13 losses in a row. 8 of them from yesterday and the others from two weeks ago when i assume the 2 week ban kicked in\n\n{{sticker:sg-ezreal}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2017-10-15T23:23:01.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the things that contributed to your punishment is asking for people to report.

Your teammates are playing to win and you just gave up.\n\nThose are all reasons for getting a punishment.  Thing is, this kind of behavior would have gone through 2 chat restrictions and a 2-week ban.  That tells me it's a consistant pattern of behavior.  You didn't learn anything from your previous restrictions.","replies":[]}]}
