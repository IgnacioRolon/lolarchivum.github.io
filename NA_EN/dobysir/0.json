While my team has two silvers and three golds.Now I would like to know how in the world that is fair every enemy player was higher ranked than their lane counter parts how am I suppose to win this kind of game please can someone explain to me why this happens it this hopefully their is just a problem with match making and that this is not intentional.

If someone is playing like a plat but is currently in silver, they should be able to easily get out of silver as that is not the elo they belong in, but if their MMR makes it so that they're matched against other plats, while still in silver, then how are they supposed to get out of silver? Why should you be held back from getting where you belong? It just makes the climb unnecessarily grindy.","replies":[{"poster":"Teriyaki Bukkake","date":"2018-05-19T03:10:39.095+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayzev, this is the LoL boards: we don't use logic here! :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Veigàr","date":"2018-05-18T10:03:11.242+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I looked at the game he is referring to.  \n\nTeam 1: Silver / Gold / Gold / Silver / Gold\nTeam 2: Gold / Gold / Plat / Gold / Plat.\n\nMy question is ...
