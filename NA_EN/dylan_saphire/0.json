I mean, he's going to stomp either way.\n\nThe person is the problem, not the game. There's really nothing Riot can do to prevent smurfing or prevent high ranked players from beating up on low ranked players / new players. I guarantee you there are people out there with gold-level skills who purposely throw games so they can stay in Bronze 5 and hard carry whenever they want. These players only have fun when they get 15+ kills and an insurmountable lead. They've never faced adversity in life and need to always win (unless they choose to lose). It explains intentional feeding, etc... The hextech system and champion mastery make it worse frankly (a lot easier to get S ranks against weaker players). These are the same guys that will kill steal every kill in that game (literally just had a guy do that, I only got an S- instead of an S because he as AD top took every blue and stole every kill I set up as an AP mid). \n\nSome people just think the world of themselves. That's basically all there is to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Dylan Saphire","date":"2016-10-10T00:43:53.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they make a new account skill wise they might not be equal to everyone else(which is the case in any game no matter what), but runes, masteries, and champions wise they'll be even, which can make a big difference.","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2016-10-10T00:58:27.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dylan Saphire,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wf8akHIw,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-10-10T00:43:53.784+0000)\n>\n> If they make a new account skill wise they might not be equal to everyone else(which is the case in any game no matter what), but runes, masteries, and champions wise they&#x27;ll be even, which can make a big difference.\n\nThat's an entirely fair point.\n\nAlthough I believe I was only level 19 when I started getting queued with and against all level 30 players. And that was with the old masteries (where you needed 21 in a tree to reach the end, not 18). And prior to T2 runes being made dirt cheap (so my rune pages were empty). \n\nMatchmaking in normals REALLY needs a rework though. The problem is so obvious (separate MMR from ranked means someone who plays very little normals can improve a LOT in ranked and rank way up, then come to normals occasionally and stomp hard). The solution is so simple (put a cap on how much your normal MMR can differ downwards from your ranked MMR [avoid upwards because some people don't play ranked, and you should never gain free rank for playing normals]). Riot doesn't seem interested in it though. And boards doesn't either - every time someone complains about normal matchmaking boards just says that normal matchmaking isn't meant to be that balanced. I'm sorry, if ranked is for tryharding then normals should be for fun, and no one has fun when they're getting stomped by the diamond player when they're a bunch of silvers and low golds.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-10-10T00:36:52.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normal MMR is weird.","replies":[{"poster":"Dylan Saphire","date":"2016-10-10T00:40:49.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that but it doesn't excuse why a team with only 1 lvl 30 player gets matched against a DIAMOND 3 player, How has this not been addressed by riot?
