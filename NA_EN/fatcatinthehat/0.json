I got mastery level 5 on him and one mastery shard (wich I can still see) but when I click on the shaded display picture of him, it pop-ups **like I never owned him before** and I can buy him for cca 4800 ip... Please help me, I don't have much time to spend on Leauge of Legends because of school and such so it's not easy for me to get that amount of IP, otherwise I couldn't have this problem.\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-03T16:47:46.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking into this for you, it looks like Talon was refunded through a refund token.
