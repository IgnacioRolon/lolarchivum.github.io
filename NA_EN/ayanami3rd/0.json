The overall damage is far too high\r\n2. The base stats, which cannot be tweaked by runes anymore, are quite low on some aspects (MR!!!!)\r\n3. Towers are fragile as paper (they were weak before)\r\n4. Blue essence system does not provide as much income as the old system, numerous people have proven this already\r\n\r\n...and I thought: Okay, no sweat. Riot has balanced out their game pretty well for the last season (yeah, there was always a &quot;meta&quot;, but if you were especially fond with a non-meta pick, you could easily play something else). They will address the issues, and over the course of time, fix them.\r\n\r\nNow, several hotfixes and a whole patch iteration later, the game is still broken.\r\n\r\n1. The damage has not been downtoned despite some &quot;nerfs&quot; (Sona, Aery - at least the first one is really minor).\r\n2. Base stats have not changed yet, you still get bent over by basically every AP champ (different opinion? Let me know).\r\n3. They &quot;buffed&quot; towers - err, no they didn&#039;t. They added &lt; 10% to their life, but made them more prone to minion damage.\r\n4. They introduced a tiny BE reward for FWotD - and nerfed XP gain on the other end. I did not make a calculation, but that could very well turn out to be a decrease in BE income instead of an increase.\r\n\r\nI know it&#039;s still preseason and I hope that Riot will address these things before next year. Otherwise, League will turn into non-strategic three-lane ARAM-style speed game, where one side can basically surrender after 10 minutes and if not, the game is over at 25 minutes average anyways. Slightly exaggerated maybe, but you get the idea.\r\n\r\nRelated to this, I&#039;d like to have your opinion on the changed playstyle of the game. I am low elo, and yes, feel free to be preoccupied, but recently no one cares too much about non-tower objectives anymore. It&#039;s more about gathering as a team, wiping the enemy and instantly get two towers. Turn the gold into an item lead aaaaand repeat - gg.

Maybe at the beginning but we've gotten to the point where Ezreal is a flawed design. He breaks something once-a-season and holds back other \"on-next-hit\" items because there's a chance he could break it. Tweaking numbers doesn't fix a design like this.

Even if Klepto did not exist Ezreal would still be doing fantastic with Aeri or w/e right now. Threshold to kill is so low.\n\nI feel like my own play benefits from this season. Maybe I play pretty conservatively making sure I get 90+% cs and keep my lane in controlled safe places until I slowly whittle my opponent down that they become a non threat and become a tipping point themselves when ganks coming. And in this season even playing safely it is SO EASY to blow people up. And I dig it. And Ezreal in a similar vein being a \"safe\"\"pokey\" wussy champion benefits hugely from this new state of things... Aeri on Ezreal's Q? *shudders*\n\nThey also buffed his Q cd and ratio to such levels he became a jungle in the preseason in a feeble attempt to have him compete bot against dps adc.

Klepto means very little when your opponent can push waves harder and does more damage while staying hidden behind minions.\n\nAlso, if you look at builds outside of Klepto, his winrate drops precipitously. I think his highest winrate without Klepto is ~51%? I’m not saying Ez + Klepto isn’t broken. It is. The amount of gold efficiency and utility you get from the mastery is insane and needs to be brought in line. But considering that Ez was not a problem before this massive shift in game mechanics, it frankly makes more sense to look at said mechanic he’s breaking rather than the champ himself.\n\nAlso, yes, I ultimately do think Ezreal needs some sort of rework.

So basically, Talon 100-0 you at level 2 if he hits his combo, and Zed oneshots you hitting half his abilities if you don't build armor.\n\nHowever AP champs botlane deal massive damage now. They get the same adaptive stats as mages, and spell thiefs got buffed. This means their damage is the same or higher than midlaners early. When they don't need to spend any mana farming, that is truly a lot of pressure. \n\nI agree with the other problems. In my opinion there should not be so much targeted damage in a squishy meta. Duskblade and Statikk+rapidfire combo are mistakes by riot in my opinion. Assassins should rely a bit on hitting skillshots so there is actual counterplay when they are fed. You can dodge(flash) or zhonia skillshots. However you cannot do that vs duskblade+electrocute procs that is now a large part of their damage. ADCs also have way too much burst compared to dps- with a good amount of items they should shred tanks and squishies, but they should not outburst mages and some assassins.\n\nI wish Riot didn't try to create a fast-paced, snowbally meta. This only makes games into clownfiestas where the most fed members of teams run around and oneshot everyone with no counterplay. Turrets are basically useless. Their value is larger for the enemy team since they give a lot of gold and deny cs, while only giving minor protection to your team.","replies":[]}]}
