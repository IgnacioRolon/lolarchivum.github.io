Each time, it's been caused by some attempted manual modifications to game files going wrong, though I don't know if this is the same case with your situation. In any event, I'd like you to try resetting the files that stores the settings you're trying to change.\n\n>**Log into the game** then navigate to your config folder, which should be in your install directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\n>Delete these two files:\n**- input.ini**\n**- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nAfter deleting those files, hop into a custom match to confirm everything has been reset, then test your ability to access the shop. Let me know if this worked!","replies":[]}]}
