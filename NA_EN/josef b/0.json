While it isn&#039;t the most popular pick it does have potential and I feel that starting the game with a long sword down (basically) on your lane opponent isn&#039;t very fair. Perhaps it would make more sense to include an &quot;adaptive&quot; bonus to TF&#039;s AD, or something similar. I went into customs just to get a look at base stats and could confirm TF has a much lower base AD with no option to change it (starting with 12 less AD than a Caitlyn or 15 less than a Lucian really screws you over). Even with the exact same rune page and starting items. ADC TF has always been a niche pick, and we have seen some players in the LCS take ADC Kennen last year during the BORK meta. This champ does heavy magic damage, even when combined with an on hit build. This allows him to shred through tanks similar to Kog, but instead of having extended range and % health magic he has a stun. I feel something could (and should) be done to make picks like this slightly more viable (or even playable) in the current runes system.","replies":[]}
