Specifically, Assassins and many light fighters had been using LW as a powerful multiplier on their damage, regardless of who they were fighting, and LW&rsquo;s updated form just doesn&rsquo;t help kill their primary targets (squishies).\r\n\r\nJust wanted to share where that work is going. We&rsquo;re producing a new to-be-named item for AD Assassins with the intent of providing them with a noticeable damage boost to replace the old Last Whisper in their builds. \r\n\r\n**Caveat:** This item probably won&rsquo;t be on the PBE until next year, but I wanted to get some early feelers out there with this post. We&rsquo;re currently in internal playtests on it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe item:\r\n**New Assassin Dagger**\r\n\r\n* Recipe: Serrated Dirk + B.F. Sword + ??? gold (over 3000 gold total, still fine tuning)\r\n* +75 Attack Damage\r\n* +5% Movement Speed\r\n* UNIQUE Passive: +10 Armor Penetration\r\n* UNIQUE Passive: Basic attacks on an enemy champion apply Nightfall (60 second cooldown).\r\n\r\n* **Nightfall:** After 2 seconds, deal 25% of the target&rsquo;s missing health as physical damage. If the target dies before Nightfall ends, the cooldown is refunded.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe main goal here is provide an assassin item that those champions will actually care about, ensuring they have the right hooks in the item system to feel good and scale appropriately with as few non-assassin abuse cases as possible. Secondary goals are providing a multiplier that is more powerful if you aren&rsquo;t snowballed (a super fed Talon will 100-0 his primary target before Nightfall triggers, so he&rsquo;ll be using the trigger on a lower priority opponent often without the support of his full combo). Additionally, this provides provides a fallback pattern where a failing assassin can still be useful to their team, e.g. by cooperatively killing targets they otherwise might ignore, or using this item as a multiplier on teammate damage.\r\n\r\n-- Riot Axes","replies":[{"poster":"Dylanhero","date":"2015-12-19T00:11:20.454+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":4,"body":"First thing that comes to mind is, what's \"What's stopping adc's from getting this item?\" Most adc's can do enough burst to make use of the nightfall passive and the rest of the stats work great on them.

The mechanism would be only available to assassins and become the way their damage is calculated against champions instead of straight damage.

Some champions will use that item better than others (for instance, Zed might use it better than Talon which will use it better than Kha'Zix), and from there you directly create a hierarchy within that small class.\n\n2. You artificially inflate the powerspike they get in the case of a mirror-y matchup. So if you have Zed vs Talon, the first of the 2 that gets the new item will have a massive lead (since the item is built around optimizing AD assassins). Basically, AD Assassins become reliant on the item and get in a simili-feast or famine case which is exacerbated by the mirror match.

If two mages that both rush Luden's Echo as their first item are mid and one of them beats the other to finishing the item, they have a massive lead in terms of trading. That's just how the system works.\n\nNow, you could argue that since (by your assumption) Zed would use the item better than Talon, in that given matchup it gives an even larger powerspike for Zed than it would Talon. In that scenario, it's less an issue with the item itself and more with how those two champions reach powerspikes. Sort of like the difference between a Luden's Echo on two poke mages. Truth be told, this is an easy fix, and champions can be nerfed/buffed depending upon what is necessary.\n\nI'm very interested in this item, if only because it will give some longevity to AD assassins... now we just need more AD assassins for it to be usable on.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2015-12-19T01:18:54.912+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":6,"body":"In addition to what Axes said, in general as an ADC you just don't have room for an item that gives AD and nothing else.

Seems more fair to me that way.\n\nIf it's an active, you have perfect control over it, so anyone who likes the stats can use it effectively (Yasuo just makes sure he applies it when he has you down to ~20% health), and it's very difficult or impossible for your opponent to make you waste it.\n\nE.g. in playtest we've had quite a few cases where you run into someone unexpectedly in the jungle and end up applying the mark by accident - which, from the opponent's standpoint, has tended to feel like \"I got him to waste a cooldown\". \n\nOr more commonly, we've seen situations where an assassin will go in and their target flashes/dashes/knockbacks them after the mark is applied, causing most of the damage from the mark to be wasted. If they didn't need the damage from the mark to kill you, that doesn't help all that much, but if they did, it can be the difference between living and dying.\n\ntl;dr: if it was an active, it'd be hideously unfair to the opponents and good on virtually any damage dealer; as a passive, it's something both the user and their target can optimize around, and which requires your champion to have specific properties in order to use well.\n\n> Also, did you consider that this may be a must buy for assasins, no matter the occassion? Im all for the item but i dislike cookie and cutter builds and the AD assasin class already has 2-3 must buy items\n\nThe item system serves a couple of very important functions. One of them is definitely choice - the Marksman item update targeted this goal - where the system should feel like something you can explore, customize, experiment with, and also have to react on a game by game basis.\n\nA second goal is to ensure that champions feel supported - they should feel that success in game earns them stuff they care about. This is e.g. one reason why Jayce feels so bad right now, above and beyond pure power concerns - he has effective item builds but none of them really feel right. \n\nThis item is definitely much more targeted to that second goal - Assassins don't have a solid baseline of items that they can rely on, and this item helps them get there. It's possible that it's going to be mandatory on them for now, but that's still a better situation than they're in currently with the itemization system.

I really appreciate riot's design team posting some early discussion like this.  You guys do the work I want to do for a living and getting a good chance to armchair analyze actual live game tuning does a lot for me and is quite fun.  I am just going to share some of my thoughts here and if they add to the discussion, great.\n\nI think my first thought is that if we are going forward with the nightfall passive is to make sure the visual indicator is clear and visible.  This strikes me as especially important in this case (clarity is always important) because peeling off an assassin is often a team effort and we should make sure supports  can notice and identify this passive to perhaps save their squishy with the clutch shield or heal.\n\nSo let's frame the problem.  (sorry if I am repeating things already in the OP here, I just want the assumptions and context clearly stated so that any mistakes in my understanding of the context can be separated from my thoughts).\n\nAD assassins are currently lacking strong core item choices.\n\nThe Current items that work very well with AD assassins right now are basically:\n\n* Yoomuu's Ghostblade (probably the best item for the class right now, really the only item that is specifically great for them).\n\n* Maw of Malmortius (I think this is kind of an awkward choice because some of the power of the item is in its magic resistance and interaction with additional MR which makes it better as a single damage item on a heavier class of champions trying to fight a very AP heavy team.  Side note, the lifesteal out of combat on lifeline trigger strikes me as on odd mechanic if this item is for assassins since they often build lifesteal anyway.)\n\n* <insert raw attack damage and lifesteal items such as Bloodthirster and Mercurial Scimitar based on the game here> (these items are nice to have one of but still overlap with adc itemization and have the notable problem that stacking a bunch of them together doesn't give any kind of multiplicative scaling and so the damage just falls off.)\n\n\nI will mention death's dance here because I think it could be an interesting next place to look but is currently struggling to distance itself from the other lifesteal options above.\n\nSo the missing pieces from last season seem to be:\n\n* Brutalizer was removed and was probably the best early game power spike item on the class.\n\n* ADC itemization (which assassin's had an overlap with) was shifted towards crit chance and attack speed as multiplying effects and the raw AD stat on the items was reduced.\n\nNow we get to the big hole.  AD assassin's previously built Last Whisper as a core item because of how well their kits interacted with armor penetration.  This had a few problems:\n\n* It gave the assassins a lot more target agnosticism than what was intended for the class since LW was a tank counter item to start with so they just killed everyone.\n\n* LW was rather cheap and very gold efficient.\n\n* Assassins buying LW made itemizing resistances against them significantly less valuable than it should be and often not a real option for some classes.\n\n* LW as a core damage item on assassins to deal more damage to squishy targets is not intuitive and the math behind the armor mechanics was a small burden of knowledge on the assassin player  (this isn't a huge deal but I think that it is important to note that without knowing the math; LW would not be a natural purchase given the description).\n\nBrutalizer being replaced by Caufield's Warhammer and Serrated Dirk seems pretty intentional.  The early power spike was probably as issue and the 1337 club was taking up some design space.\nOverlapping with ADC itemization was already a problem and you guys fixed it in some key places.\n\nSo the problem seems to really be with the loss of last whisper as a main damage amplifier.\n\nLet's see what Midknife (nightfall, midnight, mid lane assassins, get it?) does in this context.\n\nFirst, this is another place to purchase more armor penetration.  This is a key point for me because I think part of the problem is that flat armor penetration is basically the only multiplicative scaling stat for AD assassin damage.  (Note: CDR is kit dependent but unlike for mages it usually does not increase burst potential or damage output in a given interaction since most burst is all in one combo of spells.  Instead it increases uptime and attempt rate which are more macro level scaling concepts).\n\nSecond.  The item's passive adds a damage multiplier that functions specifically within their burst windows.\n\nThird.  75 AD is a lot of raw attack damage and does a decent job of setting the item apart from just buying something like an infinity edge for the AD and just shrugging about the crit that you don't perfectly utilize.\n\nSo far so good.  This item addresses a few core problem with assassin items:\n\n* It adds another strong first core item purchase next to ghostblade that shares a build path from Serrated Dirk\n\n* It adds another damage multiplier that functions within their burst window\n\n* It most likely won't seriously overlap with ADC items since the passive is not controllable and ADCs usually have to start a fight hitting a tank, often have to switch targets, don't really want flat armor pen, and don't want to spend this much gold on an item that does not fit in the AD/Attack Speed/Crit Chance interaction triangle.\n\n\nNow we get to my feedback and suggestions.\n\nMy first thought on the item is that the reset on the passive seems to function more for giving the assassin a lot more power to help him clean up a tank at the end of a messy fight that he was successful in than it does to improve general use.  Other posters have a good point too that the reset seems to reward an assassin that is already snowballing well enough with an additional fallback damage source for if a future fight goes a little less well than the first one.  Fighting off an assassin is often a team activity and this extra mechanic that helps out the examples that need the least help seems unnecessary.\n\nIt strikes me that the core theme of my glance at this whole situation is that AD assassins benefit from flat armor penetration far more than anyone else does and it is a very rare stat.  I think adding this item in to the game without really doing anything with their current option (ghostblade) just makes them build the best of the two items first and then build the other unless the game state demands they build a different item for a specific purpose like maw or mercurial or lifesteal.  The fact that many assassins will simply build both items is a good thing if we plan for that ahead of time.  This leads me nicely into my suggestion which is to take the example from the adc item rework, specifically the attack speed/crit chance items, and balance the options against each other directly.\n\nSo instead of simply dropping in another armor pen item for them to build lets create a set of them with nearly identical build paths, similar stats and costs, and goal based minor differences based on which active/passive the player wants first.\n\nSo the three items I suggest are:\n\n* Yoomuu's Ghostblade.\n\n* Death's Dance\n\n* Midknife\n\nGive all three items ~75 AD, 10% CDR and ~15-20 Armor Pen and have them build out of either Serrated Dirk or Caufield's Warhammer, perhaps both.\n(may need to side on the lower end of armor pen per item if more of them exist in the game.)  \n\nThe reason I think that a set of sister items is the best way to go here is that AD assassins are likely to simply build all of the items that give them the AD, CDR, Armor Pen combo that they want anyway and would just build them in order of stat value.  Specifically designing for this with items that are differentiated by their role in the game solves the static build order issue and gives the assassin player meaningful item choices at the same time.  Additionally with 2-3 of these items all in the game the assassin class has strong items to be buying for most of the game that all increase their value as assassins through adding additional tools built specifically around that role in a game and balanced specifically for them.  It also gives better competitors for simply borrowing the AD+lifesteal items or buying ADC items just for the AD and makes the choice to build lifesteal or the mercurial active have a role specific opportunity cost.\n\nSo the roles I think they should represent are the three of the ways an assassination attempt fails:\n\n* Play up the active on Yoomuu's Ghostblade as a gapcloser and chasing tool to help the assassin get to his target.  First thought for how to do this is slow resistance.\n\n* Death's Dance should be a stronger item at helping the assassin avoid getting counter-bursted.  I have a few different ideas about how to create a burst prevention item for assassins such as an active that can't be activated if you have taken damage recently and causes your next auto attack to mark your target, reducing damage you take from that target or from everyone else. The former is really good in duels and the latter is probably too strong on reset champions.  A lot of my other ideas at an anti burst item need it to lose its role as a caster based lifesteal item to fit in the paradigm and avoid abuse cases like olaf and other lifesteal tanks and overlap with sterak's gage.\n\n* Midknife fits the role of an items that helps assassins get those last few points of damage in and solves cases where they  just don't quite have enough burst.  It already has the right passive to fit this role.  I don't think that it should have %movement speed as part of the item in my system or in general as I think that it would be better served by putting something like that on ghostblade in my system or putting that power budget into armor pen in either case.\n\n\nClosing note.

Biggest thing I'd suggest however if you're looking to hone design skills is to focus on trimming your writing down.
