Sword + 850 gold (3250 total gold)\r\n* +75 Attack Damage\r\n* +5% Movement Speed\r\n* UNIQUE Passive: +10 Armor Penetration\r\n* UNIQUE Passive: Basic attacks on an enemy champion apply Nightfall (120 second cooldown).\r\n* Nightfall: After 2 seconds, deal physical damage equal to 90 plus 25% of the target&#039;s missing health. If you get a kill or assist on the target before Nightfall ends, the cooldown is refunded.\r\n\r\nI put a preliminary post on this up in December here when we were a bit earlier in iteration: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/GhWdm3R6-new-ad-assassin-item-in-internal-testing\r\n\r\nFirst, the obvious. AD assassins aren&rsquo;t, as a group, weak at this point. A few aren&rsquo;t performing well, and a few are performing a bit too well. That said, the challenge we&rsquo;re trying to solve with Duskblade isn&rsquo;t one of strength, even though this item will definitely impact character strength.\r\n\r\nThis will make more sense in a chain of events as they currently happen in League (I&rsquo;ll explain the points in a sec):\r\n\r\n* There is poor itemization support for AD assassins (2-4 core items + random AD items)\r\n* An AD assassin champion is made and doesn&rsquo;t succeed because of the above\r\n* We build additional power into the AD assassin&rsquo;s kit\r\n* AD Assassins that succeed are the ones with more levels *or* synergize well with the current hodgepodge of AD items\r\n\r\n&hellip; all of the above leads us to our current approach, which is:\r\n\r\n* By building real AD assassin items, we can actually gauge an AD assassin&rsquo;s performance along the same item progression as other champions\r\n\r\n&hellip; which means that we can balance for those champions who are too weak or strong. \r\n\r\nBreaking it down:\r\n\r\n**AD Assassins don&rsquo;t feel well-supported by the item system...**\r\n\r\nOnce again, not champion strength. I&rsquo;m talking about *the feeling* of support. We&rsquo;ve talked a lot about choice in the item system lately (e.g. the Marksman item rework), but that&rsquo;s only one of the critical values provided by our item system. Another is adequately rewarding successes - something that our item system does pretty poorly for AD assassin champions.\r\n\r\nAD assassin builds typically are made of 2-4 items that suit them very well (exactly which items depends on the champion) and then a grab bag of whatever else they can find. The net result is that they&rsquo;re rewarded a LOT for early success, but aren&rsquo;t rewarded nearly as much while they&rsquo;re slogging through their last couple items.\r\n\r\n**... As a result we overcompensate on their kits.**\r\n\r\nThe other side of the above problem is that we have to balance these champions&rsquo; power levels around items that actually exist. \r\n\r\nChampions get meaningfully less power from items that are not optimized for them - an ADC gets less value out of Dead Man&rsquo;s Plate than Tanks and Fighters do, and less out of Zhonya&rsquo;s Hourglass than Mages. Because ADCs are fully supported with their own items, this is never a problem for them. If there are a few fringe cases where Dead Man&rsquo;s Plate or Zhonya&rsquo;s Hourglass is actually a good idea, it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re the optimal tool for very specific task, but the tradeoff needs to be significant (ie: loss of a 6th item slot for essentially cross-role &lsquo;splash&rsquo; utility).\r\n\r\nAD Assassins aren&rsquo;t similarly supported. They have too few items that are optimized for them, which means that they effectively just get less power - in many cases, **much** less power - out of the gold they spend later in a game. In order to balance them, that difference in power has to be compensated somewhere. \r\n\r\nWe have a few main ways of doing that. Some AD assassins have fairly strong (or safe) lane phases that let them maintain a gold lead. So they might be getting less value out of gold (due to poor itemization), but this is offset by the fact that they have more gold to spend. This means, in turn, we get a lot of snowball champions. This isn&rsquo;t inherently bad for the game, but not something we should be forced to do for all champions of a given class. \r\n\r\nFinal point: if a champion&rsquo;s kit can scale better later in the game than usual, we need to be aware of the tradeoff we&rsquo;re making because it&rsquo;s much more difficult to deny an opponent experience than gold. As a result, their power spike later in the game becomes extremely reliable (compared to a champion who relies on items).\r\n\r\nBy fully supporting AD assassins in the item system, we no longer have to balance them around the assumption that their kits will be making up a sizable power deficit from items, which means that their kits can have either less guaranteed early games or less guaranteed late games, depending on the champion. \r\n\r\n**And there&rsquo;s collateral damage for item changes**\r\n\r\nBecause AD Assassins are cobbling together items from other classes, they&rsquo;re very sensitive to changes done for other classes. For example, the Last Whisper changes at preseason hurt them quite badly even though they were generally successful for other classes of users - an Assassin&rsquo;s best targets have very little bonus armor. \r\n\r\nBy supporting AD assassins with distinct itemization, we both minimize cases where we accidentally damage their state (due to work on other parts of the game) and increase our ability to tune them when they&rsquo;re strong or weak as a group.\r\n\r\nWe can be up front about this, however: Duskblade is intended to be a core item for a lot of assassins (a first, second, or third buy, depending) and we will be balancing around it. That said, **we do this anyway** based on other items, it&rsquo;s just a lot more random which items we balance which AD assassins around.\r\n\r\n**... But AD assassins are frustrating.**\r\n\r\nWe understand that AD assassins offer low counterplay and significant frustration playing against and, by working on them, we risk exacerbating that in the short term. We feel this work is important because it puts us in a better position to address those pain points as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Blupor","date":"2016-02-02T21:56:39.632+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that AD assassins' item choices complicate individual tuning, but this item really needs to be accompanied by some sort of armor option for mages. As of right now, we have a very expensive Zhonyas and Guardian Angel as our options. Most AP mid mains would agree that rushing armguard is never particularly fun or interactive, and the Zhonyas active ends up feeling overvalued on AP mid champions that excel at keeping enemies away. \n\nWith this new item having armor pen and the delayed damage built in, I feel like I'll be forced further toward Zhonya's, yet it'll be even more unsatisfying knowing I'm building it into armor pen. Many of the AD assassins aren't heavily gated by mana, or lack mana at all. Mages do need to solve mana issues in their build, but the arms race has been a stalemate so far since assassins haven't had optimal items themselves. I think a potential solution is to add a new AP/armor option that has some element of intelligent use, but lacks a binary active effect like Zhonya's has.\n\ntl;dr: lots of good, valid points about assassins, but most hold true for Mage counter-itemization as well. I think they will need to be looked at in response to the current state of AD items.","replies":[{"poster":"LrgBeard","date":"2016-02-02T23:38:28.772+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"^This!\n\nNow I know that Zhonya's is very good item with a very strong situational active, but I feel like mages could benefit from more early armor options. \nThere are 3 or 4 MR options ({{item:3155}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3140}} {{item:3137}} {{item:3139}} ) that AD mid laners can take to help them lane against AP mid laners. However, AP mid laners can only really take Seeker's, then either sit on it to build other more important items or rush Zhonyas and hold off those important early game items.\n\nFor me, this is what's frustrating trying to play an AP mid lane against an AD assassin. It means that my early game options are limited at best. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that there needs to be another Zhonyas level AP armor item, just one or two more early game AP armor items that give some build options.\n\nTL;DR: Give AP mid laners a few more early game armor options so that it's not Seeker's into Zhonyas rush every time.

If you come back with an armguard and he comes back with a Hexdrinker, that's about the biggest victory you can hope for in lane, assuming equal skill. The difference is, Zed doesn't have to build up the MR, AD, or active on his Hexdrinker, whereas you have to farm up to get the full effect of Seeker's Armguard. And you have to farm up presumably with spells that cost mana, which you're short on due to no mana item, and Zed lacks completely.\n\nSo I totally agree with you - I'm not asking for dominance or even equality in matchups vs. AD assassins, just for something I can do to get through lane and make more meaningful itemization choices.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2016-02-03T00:05:59.912+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Especially true given how much AR Pen has been added to other items","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pyro","date":"2016-02-02T23:46:46.143+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say Seeker's Armguard needs a second AP upgrade, but the problem here is that while it might be a lifesaver on fragile mages, it will definitely need to be balanced for AP bruisers as well.\n\nPerhaps the best way to balance it would be making it a cheap slot-inefficient item.

He also usually wants to keep pn cleaning a fight and not only assasinate 1 target, same with pant.\n\nThe 4 assasins that actuall profti from the item all work well with current items as they actuall scale well with crit.\n\nThe class that imo feels least supported are ad-casters, thouse who aren't a 100-0 one-trick-pony like talon or zed, but rather want to have sustained imoact on a fight. Champs like pant, wukong, riven, jayce, sivir...\nEspecially those who need mana have poor options right now, as manamune just feels bad, no matter if the powerlevel is high enough or not. The mana consumeing toggle that looses power the longer you fight goes exactly in the opposite direction from what you want from the item + it's only really usable on AA-focused champs or those with spamable singletarget skills. Haveing to stack the tear in the more fast paced meta and often on champs that rely on a good early is another problem.\nBefor preseason, ER really worked well, it didn't offer sustain in lane soi it wasn't problematic on the likes of pant, but it solved mana problems later on and did offer reasonable stats, beeing the cheapest big ticket ad item.\n\nAside from that, i fear The new item will just be unhealthy. It mostly supports 100-0 patterns, the exact reason why DFG was removed. And just how DFG allowed more uutillity based mages like lissandra to assasinate targets, i can totally see J4 or Heca rushing deathblade and oneshotting squishys with little counterplay.\nThe fact that you can't use AAs to trade normaly with it also is really annoying, either you go all-in or you only use skills...just doesn't feel good.\n\nSo overall, i think deathblade is a bad single item fix for assasins, it should rather come with a full assasin overhaul, as it only supports a small niche of champs that already have decent itemization and leaves those that actually struggle in the dust. And even then, it probably still is unhealthy to support 100-0 patterns and the 'don't AA unless you mean it' part would still be very annoying -- maybe switch it around with stormraiders, stromraiders triggers after a set time uppon dealing damage or AA, and nightfall is applyed after dealing x% of the targets helath in y sec.\n\n\nI think it would be way more immportant to fix muramana, or atleast ad back old ER. And after that, an item that offers something for ad-casters in generall, not only assasins, would be better.\n\nLike a new 'trinity' **without crit**. Seriously, most ad-casters, especially assasins, really would want alot that trinity offers, ad, ms, the rage passive, the strong spellblade, cdr, some as to speedup their combo and make stuff more fluid, mana and hp are helpfull aswell - just crit sucks as it is to unreliable and assasins prefer reliable damage.\n{{item:2015}} +{{item:3044}} +{{item:3057}} could be a potential buildpath.\n\nAnd for lategame scaleing, why not exploring the dot on damage that you had on Warriors for some time?\n\nlike {{item:1038}} +{{item:3134}} +{{item:1042}} +800g(3500 total)\n-75AD\n-10 arpen\n-20%AS\n-5%ms\n-Unique Passive(same name as IE to prevent absue from marksmen): Damageing oppnents (with physical damage?) causes them to bleed for 15% of the recived damage as physical damage over 3sec.\n\nThe dagger+as is there cause later in the game, as is a good multiplyer on ad-heavy builts, but mostly so it isn't as great as a rush item.\nThe dot would help all physical damage dealrs that don't go for IE, and since it's physical damage armor will be double effective(like vs nightfall) so the item will help more vs squishys than tanks\n_As allways, numbers are just there to give an impression and certainly would need some testing_\n\n\nOr an option to make deathblade more usable on multiple champs and without enchanceing 100-0 paterns:\nChange nightfall to turn you ivisible and give ~10%ms+ghostwalk for ~1sec (still procing 2sec after your AA), with ~30sec cd, and maybe instantly apply that upon kill/assist regardless of cd.\nThis would make it easier for Assasins to stay around for a second round if the first atempt isn't enough(most have an abillity that gets less than 3sec cd) while also helping to secape after a succesfull assasination.\nThis could allow to balance the around needing a second round rather than 100-0 burst in the future.\n\nTL;DR: I don't think Deathblade will be a healthy item, and even if, it mostly supports the champs that already have good items later on, while it works bad for those that lack itemisation. It's also not Ad-assasins that really have poor itemisation, but more the no-assasin casters, especially those who use some more mana, so the target group feels a bit off for such a change...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Das Kappatal","date":"2016-02-03T04:49:51.668+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has there been any consideration regarding tier 2 boots for AD assassins?\n\nOne of the reasons AP assassins' itemisation works is that they can get 15 magic penetration for a relatively low cost, so they can spend their other gold on ability power, cooldown reduction, etc. It raises their gold efficiency, basically. They also have CDR boots as a reasonable alternative, if they're trying to cap CDR quickly.\n\nAD assassins only have CDR boots - and a lot of AD assassins don't need CDR, so they'll build defensive boots instead.\n\nI think one of the issues is that tier 2 boots that gave either AD or armor penetration would immediately be preferred by most ADCs, since 25% attack speed for 800 gold is an absolutely awful purchase if you could get 10 armor pen or 15-20 AD instead (just spitballing numbers that AD assassins would be satisfied with).\n\nI don't know what the solution is, if any, but I'd love to know if the designers have been discussing this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2016-02-02T23:47:38.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Evelyn is an assassin who can build AD.

Are there any plans to add core items for all main and sub champion roles, or is it ok for AP assassins to share items with Mages?\n\nThe AP space is much different from AD - the stat is quite a bit more flexible. For example, Rabadon's Deathcap provides very different types of power for Janna, Malzahar, Xerath, and Diana - buffing/healing, area damage over time, poke power, and burst kill, respectively. \n\nWe're still sorting out exactly how we want to approach the AP item space.

Is it intended to help them?\n\nIt's not intended to help them, but it might. In particular, champions who are very close to being assassins (Pantheon or Jarvan IV, maybe?) might tip over into being assassins again - Riven might be one of those, not 100% sure. \n\nIt hasn't performed particularly well for champions who still have stuff to do 2 seconds into a fight - one big difference between Riven and e.g. Talon is that all of Talon's stuff goes on cooldown after he executes his combo, so Duskblade actually amplifies his whole pattern against one target, where Riven is typically looking for the next target to kill and so often gets more out of more general damage amps (e.g. The Black Cleaver, Lord Dominik's Regards).\n\nIt's possible she'll use this anyway, of course.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nidalee SO NYAAA","date":"2016-02-02T21:34:13.979+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I only hear you guys talking AD assassins.

The only thing that this item lacks for juggers is HP, but it doesn't matter too much during laning phase since you'll be building a Black Cleaver/Sterak's Gage later (or if you build this, you could even go for tank items faster). I agree that buying this as a jugger would make you commit to a high damage build and at the same time, it wouldn't give you the resistance needed. But isn't it worth ?\n\nWe often see collateral damage/uses for new items : for example, at the moment, Sterak's Gage can be built on ADCs if they need to survive to high burst (and what do you think of this, btw ?

The AD assassins that are weak right now consist of Kha'zix and that isn't because of poor itemization its because his kit is reliant on enemies being alone and resets and reset mechanics are always either really good or really bad (just think Akali).\n\nIn my opinion this item will actually make assassins more unhealthy and potentially make champions like Quinn, Draven, and Corki impossible to deal with w/o \"Melee Only\" tag. This item doesn't help assassins do their job it does their job for them which is essentially the same problem DFG you can't throw damage dealing effects on items that scale from the damage that you deal. What you will likely end up seeing in higher level play is tank comps to combat this shift and no one fighting until Rengar, Talon, Shaco, or Zed has \"Night Fall\" up which is essentially a free kill.\n\nMake an item that helps assassins not one that does the work for them. Like after getting a kill/assist give the champ a 1.5 sec stealth or immune to cc for 1.5 sec. Perhaps something like the Hextech Gunblade active to mark those champions so you can't proc the effect multiple times. Maybe an Active effect that if you kill a champion X amount of seconds do an AoE slow based on how much time left you had to kill the champion marked. These are effects that simply help out allowing a safer escape/chase after kill.\n\nI whole heartily believe that this item will be bad for the game and will result in a lot of champion nerfs instead of healthy assassins gameplay. The worst part is Riot is going to end up shoving this item down my throat even though I really don't want to build it they are going to nerf all the champions that use it instead of making the changes to the item. Riot said that they want to give us more \"Options\" if that is true why not design more than 1 item for us to test you are giving us 1. The community thinks that this will have a negative impact in the game as a whole. The majority of the community find fed assassins oppressive and not fun to face. This item takes almost no real thought to use correctly and on paper seems oppressive as all hell. Assassin mains DO NOT want this item it takes away from playing assassins it the items that does my job for me. It will honestly take away most of the fun of playing assassins and you will end up making my buy it because you will ignore the community and nerf that champions that it ends up being broken on instead of admitting that you made an unbalanced item.
