I wanted to give some context on those changes, since they&rsquo;ve hit PBE today.\r\n \r\nAll changes are currently tentative and there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll see further tuning before they go live in the Midseason patch.\r\n \r\n**Armor Penetration**\r\nThere&rsquo;s more armor penetration/shred in the system than really ought to exist - 52% armor pen is a pretty common stopping point these days, and many champions add a Black Cleaver and/or some Lethality to that. With so much armor penetration in the system, defensive items have to be tuned to be pretty crazy before they&rsquo;re worth buying at all.\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;ll be reducing the overall amount of armor that can be ignored through item purchases, and putting that power into other sources like Critical Strike itemization, the Giant Slayer effect, and big AD purchases.\r\n \r\n**Life Steal Items**\r\nLooking to balance out the Life Steal items against each other. Our assessment is that Blade of the Ruined King is a bit more powerful than an item should really be, so we&rsquo;ll be trimming that a bit. At the same time, we don&rsquo;t want to just balance it down to be equal with the other Life Steal items, which are likely weaker than they ought to be given the way the game is shifting. We&rsquo;re looking to land all the items somewhere in the middle ground.\r\n \r\nLook for a small nerf to Blade of the Ruined King and small buffs to Bloodthirster, Death&rsquo;s Dance, and Ravenous Hydra (which has sadly fallen a bit behind its Titanic cousin :/ ).\r\n \r\n**Early Marksman Build Path**\r\nWe&rsquo;re testing buffs to Zeal and Infinity Edge aimed at smoothing out the first two purchases for critical strike users. We&rsquo;re targeting a reasonable 1-and-a-half item spike into a fairly strong 2 item spike. This will likely just be cost adjustments to Zeal itself and to Infinity Edge, making it easier to get to IE + Zeal as a power spike than before.\r\n \r\n**Zeal Upgrade Tuning**\r\nWe&rsquo;re taking this opportunity to tune the four Zeal items &ndash; Runaan&rsquo;s Hurricane, Phantom Dancer, Statikk Shiv, and Rapid Firecannon. The goal here will be both balancing them against each other and making their unique identities more clear and better differentiated.\r\n \r\nOn live, Runaan&rsquo;s Hurricane is the best AOE damage option, has the best build path, and is often the best single target sustained damage option of the four thanks to its on hit damage. Look for a new build path more in line with the other items, plus the loss of on-hit damage in favor of a higher AD ratio on the secondary bolts - Hurricane will still be a powerful sustained AOE damage tool.\r\n \r\nWe&rsquo;re currently exploring some changes to Rapid Firecannon and Statikk Shiv to sharpen their identities and to make the combination of the two more compelling &ndash; Rapid Firecannon charges Energized effects  (itself, Shiv, and Warlord&rsquo;s Bloodlust) faster but deals less burst damage, increasing its usefulness in long range engagements, while Statikk Shiv deals considerably increased burst damage to champions.\r\n \r\nPhantom Dancer&rsquo;s already meeting its goals pretty well, so no changes planned (except making it cost the same amount of gold as the other three.)\r\n \r\n**Executioner&rsquo;s Calling**\r\nCurrent assessment is that Executioner&rsquo;s is too powerful as a lane counter to certain champions, but the passive is an important release valve against sustain-based champions later in the game. We&rsquo;re exploring ways of making it more costly to access that power early in the game, either with a direct cost increase or by making it less reliable.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-04-11T02:33:32.653+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was under the impression that it was generally more efficient for most adcs to build BF sword->zeal->completed zeal item, rather than IE->zeal.

AD&#x27;s have struggled to find agency for a decent amount of time now, and I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;re changing it. But please... stop saying that Riot isn&#x27;t doing anything, when you (seemingly) don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about.\n\n1) The same can be said about tanks, adc, and ad champions that have just as much damage, utility, if not more mobility and healing than AP champions will ever have. Your argument is entirely invalid, Positive. You can sit here and tell me that ap champions all have unique kits and it's too hard to do anything them, but why did they do that for tanks, adc, and ad champions? They have the same utility, damage, and other functionality that another champion might have or more.\n\n2) It is going to be a major problem. Look at all of the new items they are adding to the game and even adding a new armor/ad item. They are drastically increasing MR, lowering health on a ton of items, increasing health regen, blocking CC effects, mitigating the damage done to tanks by ap champions the second time around, and much more. You sit here and explain to me how Void Staff is going to be useful when almost a third of the ap champion roster is going to have a hard time doing damage and being able to stick damage on a tank when it is being blocked my cc disabling, MR stacking, and health regen items? You sit here and tell me how an ap champion is going to be able to apply the grievous wound proc on a tank at 30% health or lose. You tell me Liandrys is going to function now that health is being taken away from items and tanks and it's going to be hard to proc the burn?\n\n3) No. The problem is they don't care enough to actually take the time to think about how other champions and roles are going to be effected by all of these changes. A perfect example is last year when it took them almost the entire season to nerf ADC champions and the items they reworked that was being abused by all AD and ADC champions. They don't care and these Developers like the game being one sided.\n\n=================\n\nDon't sit here and tell me I am overreacting. I am not. If players didn't think about these things that Developers can care less about, then what would happen with the game? You don't seem to know what you are talking about.","replies":[{"poster":"Häxel","date":"2017-04-11T14:19:05.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You say that ap gets to much damaged by that but i want to say one thing: Current game is heavy amge focused. Like the alst 2 years you had mostly mages on mid, sometimes top, jgl, supp and with ziggs now even bot carry too. Assassins got not played since season 4. They got some screen time preseason 7 but vansihed nearly again. And i talk about competive/high elo cause low elo everything is a fiesta, assassins are ok but mages are neither weak.\nJust look on the buffs and compare it to the nerfs of the last 2 years: \n1. {{item:3105}} lost his aura, yea {{item:3190}} got a bigger shield still you just had 1 year less mr since lol exists. Adding now mr/lv for is even not that a bg deal. Now everyone has it, but like melees who had before aegis aura don't get mr buffs, jsut the range champs (surprize, all mages are range so even on mid you are more effizient against each other and melee assassins like akali while before you only had aegis aura only alte teamfight on your support, not lv 1 mid).\n2. abysal was and still is a busted op item and i like that they change it with banshees. It is still a defensive item, but abysal gave you just to much offensive while the main item path was buildign negatron.  You still have morellos which give you like the strognest 1 item powerspike with maybe trinity as execption. There are nearly no sczenarios you don't want morellos unless you jsut don't have mana like kennen/vlad/rumbel/akali/kata or paly in the jungel/as support. Ads 1 item powerspike is mostly trinity, botrk or lethalaty, crit just needs 2 items.\n3. yea ap numbers went down, many peopel cry they not get anymore 600-800 ap but tell you what: penetration went for this higher and mr lower. you currently deal true dmg with masteries, runes, {{item:3020}} {{item:3136}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3135}}. you can add either strong utility like {{item:3116}} {{item:3157}} or just damage mutlipliers, movementspeed increases (which you had 2 years ago not like that, was only a zeal thing) and even autoattack multipliers like {{item:3285}} {{item:1402}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3145}} . A {{champion:105}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:63}} etc can still kill you easy with 300 ap or less. if they have lategame maybe jsut 500 ap but deal true dmg to carrys or reduce them to like 25 mr do you thing this is a good ap balance?\n\nSumup: Mages are already rly strong, last years marksman and mageupdate just increased their value to their rivals on mid (assassins and poke ads) and they just got hit lightly by the assasinupdate and exhaust nerfs. Giving Mr per lv to range champs, switching abysal with banshees and giving mr items more mr/introducing more mr items is just fair to what happened over the last 2 years and while ga even looses his mr there is no need to add/buff unnecesary ap items. Like hell even if ads and aps have their own strenghts (zhonyas/banshees/rylais/roa ap; ga,/maw/qss/edge of night ad) adcs would love to have an tiem like protobelt, even if it is the sandblade from blackmarket brawlers. Ads have problems too like tabbis. The fact that tabbis are so strong and many buy it more as mercurys is just good for mages too.","replies":[{"poster":"Jâshîn","date":"2017-04-11T15:44:55.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:161}}  ult and {{champion:134}}  w are also true damage, and new {{champion:32}} passive","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2017-04-11T04:02:51.474+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Axes,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=Ejyoz66h,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-04-11T02:04:25.098+0000)\n>  \n> **Executioner&amp;rsquo;s Calling**\n> Current assessment is that Executioner&amp;rsquo;s is too powerful as a lane counter to certain champions, but the passive is an important release valve against sustain-based champions later in the game.
