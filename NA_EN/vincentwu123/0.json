Don't take the lack of a comment or a hard answer as evidence they're ignoring your point.\n\nThe community is ENORMOUS, and not everyone can get a personal response.\n\n> I mean, isn't it pretty big that those two champs can disable most of Ashe's kit for 6's+ just by ulting? And also deny her basic AA damage when it's already among the lowest ones of marksmen.\n\nIt's big, yes, but both of those characters are designed specifically to prey on character like Ashe, so it's still reasonable. She also has a defense against Master Yi in the form of her ultimate. But it's also a price Ashe pays for her vision control and utility the rest of the time -- she's incredibly strong against some compositions, and weak against certain characters. This is true of most of the champions in League, many of whom have characters they can't really do much about.\n\nOff the top of my head, Nasus has a similar problem against both, Rammus messes up any fast attacking champion with just his W, Morgana can hard-counter any telegraphed ultimate, Alistar eats burst for lunch, Yasuo counters all projectiles, Braum intercepts targeted abilities, Azir stops gapclosers, Bard can stop ANYTHING, Fizz can dodge anything, Kindred can stop executes dead, etc. There are a lot of frustrating counters in the game, but that's part of the price that's paid for a diverse champion pool.\n\nI'll admit I personally would be fine if Ashe's slow and mark applied differently so that she'd still trigger it vs. at least Yi, but I also don't think that one glaring weakness is legitimately that large a balance issue for either Ashe or the game as a whole.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-12-31T20:26:03.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"You do make several good points, but isn´t it like kicking someone that's already down by letting Ashe, who really does have among the lowest damage of marksmen, be so unable to do much except run from Olaf and Yi?\n\nIs there really any other marksman that suffers from a similar issue?\n\n\nAnd Rammus isn't actually that bad, you just go for a bit of lifesteal+last whisper rather than a third crit item and he becomes perfectly manageable, even on Ashe.\n\n\nBut Olaf and Yi kinda make you lose the game in champ select which feels awful .(\n\n\nI always get reported for trolling whenever i fail to stop olaf and yi in some game, just because i picked Ashe >.<\n\nLike, she is already pretty bad against tanks, needing 4-5 items to do much against them, but a champ that just makes her useless anytime post 6 is really tough to handle.\n\n\nLower than average damage, needs items to work, no mobility or speed, decent range and her other virtue is CC.\n\nIt's like she has all her weaknesses but none of the strengths in a game against Yi or olaf.\n\nI really want her passive to apply even if it doesnt slow just so she does deal some damage at least, even if it's a bit less than everyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-12-31T20:35:34.068+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thefrostyviking,realm=EUW,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=AITwp8pt,comment-id=0003000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-31T20:26:03.731+0000)You do make several good points, but isn´t it like kicking someone that's already down by letting Ashe, who really does have among the lowest damage of marksmen, be so unable to do much except run from Olaf and Yi?\n\nNo, because 90% of other Marksmen do the same from those two.\n\n> Is there really any other marksman that suffers from a similar issue?\n\nJhin/Caitlyn, who can lose their super powerful shot easily to blinds and invulnerabilities, and with it lose a lot of their damage.\n\n> But Olaf and Yi kinda make you lose the game in champ select which feels awful.\n\nThere are other hard counters like this.

To me I didn't feel like old runes lacked customisation options, sure there was an optimal setup but at least that setup varied from game to game and there were also options like HP/lv yellows VS armour yellows which almost always existed. The new system to me completely lacks that variation, especially prevalent in the Resolve tree.\n\nTo me the big problem in the specific case of tank junglers is that the resolve tree seems tailor made for lane. Out of the 6 rune choices which aren't just a stat choice only one is actually good on junglers and it requires you to have innate sustain to be worth running. \n\nThe top row is just horrible, straight up it's abysmal. The choices here all do next to nothing for a jungler, you can technically flex this rune choice, it's just that you don't get anything no matter what you run. Your choices are useless tenacity, damage on a tower you're probably never going to hit or healing for allies that you're rarely around. You generally take the tenacity simply because it's the least bad but that's a horrible state for runes to be in. To me this entire tier (possibly the whole tree TBH) is just in dire need of an overhaul, it fails to provide any interesting options and Demolish is actively destructive to the game.\n\nThe third row is better than this admittedly, but it still has huge issues in the jungle, although I'd say it's generally OK for lane. The problem is that the only mastery which isn't innately worse in jungle is Revitalise which is a conditional mastery, it's great if you're Zac, but garbage if you're Amumu. So for any jungler without sustain that leaves a choice between two very subpar options, you either run Overgrowth or Second Wind, Second Wind doesn't work on junglers due to the lack of poke based early trades in the jungle so you kind of get railroaded into Overgrowth, which is still significantly worse for junglers than laners since for some reason there aren't bonuses against jungle camps despite the fact that there's simply less to kill in the jungle than in a lane. To me this is a more salvageable than the first and second tier, I just think Overgrowth needs to be a better option for tank junglers and a new rune that's also a decent option needs to be added.\n\nThe second tier is arse, Mirror Shield is the second worst rune in the game after only Celestial body, a rune that literally makes you weaker if you take it and Iron Skin honestly isn't that much better. Conditioning is the clear best, but even at that it's pretty dull. This tier needs to be torn down and done again because it simply doesn't work, there's just not an interesting choice here at all.\n\nFinally I question trying to force every champ who wants any defence, which probably works out to be about half of League's roster into a singular defensive tree. There's so many options for offence, 3 whole trees worth but almost none for defence. The absolute best option would be a split in Resolve, creating one tree which offered some more aggressive defensive bonuses (things like Aftershock and Unflinching) more appealing to Bruisers, Juggernauts and offensive Vanguards and the other being more centred around general defence for Wardens and other classes who just want to spec into more pure defence and defensive utility.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2018-01-16T00:44:22.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to build on this here, though I know you're probably the wrong person to answer the question but at least I hope you can pass it on to the right people:\n\nWith the changes to Resolve, which were aimed at helping top lane, tank junglers lose 65 health and gain...10 AP.

I guess that Sanjuro thing had some ripple effect, but it's been only limited against tough questions. Sure, Rioters are humans, enjoy/meme all you want, but while doing so please try not to ignore the other portion of the boards which is genuinely looking for answers. Yesterday, I replied to you through my alt account linking you a genuine productive [thread](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/tTsUAEX8-an-in-depth-look-at-what-the-community-wants-changed-and-why).\n\n___________________________________\n\n Asking 1 main question why is Riot pushing the games to be shorter(24-28 mins games) compared to season 5 where it was (31-35 mins games)?\nI want a clear lanning(early), mid and late game phases, which is currently not happening. If I wanted to play shorter games I would have opted for ARAM or twisted treeline but I don't, so can I and others like me get a response? If you don't know the answer, link me a Rioter who does know them. \n> _Not every Rioter works with every part of the company. The right Rioter might not see the post.\n> _\n\nIs not a reply, I mean you could at-least forward them the issues, no? Or have a chat with them over coffee/tea/lunch etc.\n\n____________________________________\n\nBut that would require a Rioter to care about that portion of the concerned community. Sure, some people love snowball, massive damage, button mashing. But a quite large portion of the community wants to have clean early, mid and late game phases. It is kind of frustrating when you want the answers, but since no one want's to be liable, you get none.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nI have played lol for quite a while now, though I hated the dynamic queue(season 6) and managed to get one of my accounts banned for toxicity during that time. I never thought of leaving the game, because I wanted to be loyal towards this game which I loved. But now I am genuinely searching for other games to play since I am not getting any response anywhere.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nI am not complaining about X champion being OP, not complaining about Y champion being broken, not asking about one class doing ton's of damage, and not even complaining about any item(ardent). All I am asking is why Riot is pushing the games to be shorter(24-28 mins), and if it really is the case and lol's future then tell me about it so I can leave this game with peace of mind, that the game I loved is no longer there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DBS Ronovon","date":"2018-01-16T03:21:30.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sucks... \n\nI guess that is the consequence of players talking to developers, they can hold feet to fire, and vise versa. \nI hope this works itself out so we can have more fun with league, and I do mean for the players, not the developers.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2017-12-31T11:44:39.489+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"Because they know they would bring the mother of all shitstorms down upon them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hi ìm groot","date":"2018-01-03T05:45:01.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"People dramatically overestimate how much of game changes are based off boards... 90% of posts about \"balance\" are nothing but silver players refusing to accept they played a lane wrong and learn from it so they just go to boards to find people who will agree with them that x champion is busted so they can validate themselves.
