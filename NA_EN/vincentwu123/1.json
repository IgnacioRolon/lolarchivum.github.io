Xerath's gameplay has nothing to do with electricity. Blitzcrank's doesn't either. Neither does kennen. Tbh, Kennen's ultimate is just Zilean's old ulimate. All this electricity is supposed to be told in the particles, not the actual champions' kit. Now I am not one who is good at making kits, but hear me out on this: Making a kit unique and interesting is not easy. \n\nDoes Leona's gameplay have anything to do with the sun? It's pretty much told in the particles. Her ultimate if anything should be an AOE blind instead of a generic stun. Even then, do you feel like you are playing with the sun when you are playing Leona? I sure don't feel like Diana's gameplay has anything to do with the moon either. \n\nHow about Veigar? His gameplay has nothing to do with space. His w has no special effects. His E is just an aoe conditional stun. I don't feel like I'm ammassing tons of power when I'm playing Veigar. Syndra fits this \"infinite power' theme better. Her abilities flow better and make sense. \n\nWukong is just a generic bruiser. Like he's supposed to be the master escape artist. He's supposed to have transformations, not some clone that sits still and does nothing. Jukes get old and boring. It's time for Riot to rework him and give him a more interesting kit that is versatile and fun to play. \n\nI know this post isn't cohesive, its all over the place. I'm just saying that instead of making new champions, they need make older champions' kits more interesting. I don't have any ideas for a champions' potential reworks, but it doesn't take a high class chef to know if a dish tastes like shit or not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darius Strada","date":"2018-01-06T20:10:00.487+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:85}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:74}} \nYou also have a lot of skins like Shockblade{{champion:238}} and Thunderlord{{champion:516}}","replies":[{"poster":"PhantomPrankster","date":"2018-01-06T20:41:07.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PTZekrom69,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ks71H2mx,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-01-06T20:10:00.487+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:85}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:74}} \n> You also have a lot of skins like Shockblade{{champion:238}} and Thunderlord{{champion:516}}\n\n@ the op kennen uses lightning in every attack except for his autos","replies":[{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2018-01-07T08:22:31.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even some of those have lightning in em.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2018-01-06T23:03:47.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ryze's magic is just blue","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2018-01-06T23:21:41.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It used to be much more obviously electric themed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xelaker","date":"2018-01-06T20:05:33.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:85}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chimprat","date":"2018-01-07T08:15:25.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sheev","replies":[]},{"poster":"Invidie","date":"2018-01-06T20:33:24.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"sure, just don't let Bradford 'CertainlyT' Wenban make it","replies":[{"poster":"lil koda","date":"2018-01-07T01:17:37.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you got downvoted, but its the truth lol","replies":[{"poster":"Invidie","date":"2018-01-07T01:57:14.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, downvote me all they want, you think igaf?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"koshkyra","date":"2018-01-06T23:27:27.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:126}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:53}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"lolipopevelynn","date":"2018-01-06T23:25:58.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=vincentwu123,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ks71H2mx,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-01-06T19:25:05.718+0000)\n>\n> https://heymannowyourereallyliving.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/force-lighning.jpg\n> \n> I always love playing electricity champs in games, escpecially games like Star Wars and Skyrim.
