What can I do? Top laner uses &quot;your mother&quot; insults but those don&#039;t seem to be effective. Mid laner blames the jungler but that&#039;s not doing any damage either. Jungler smites red at 100 hp with a full health bar and dies to raptors because he doesn&#039;t have smite, and uses pantheon ult to ult behind the enemy bot lane tower to gank.... is it hopeless? How do you support mains step up your game in these scenarios? Yes I ward. Yes I buy support items.","replies":[{"poster":"KazaJhodo","date":"2017-01-10T04:05:34.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With 5 on 2 they can dive you no matter what. You have to leave tower. Likely the enemies are fed as well.\n\nIn that situation it just sounds like you have to try to stall out the game. The question isn't what to do at this point, its what could've been done earlier.\n\nI know thats not very useful, but thats unfortunately the answer.\n\n\nAnalyze what you could have done before the point of no return. For instance, maybe 4 man invading the enemies buff level 1 since you are braum. Forcing some flashes.\n\nUltimately you need your team to stop feeding once they've died say twice, so you can stall the game.\n\nThe best advice I have is to either play jungle, top, or mid instead. I know, thats sucks, I've had to change myself from being a support main. Its just not reliable in low elo. OR play carry supports, like brand or annie, and get good at it.\n\nDon't worry about your adc, if hes good, he won't flame you for going carry. If hes bad, you're getting flamed no matter what more than likely. Just don't worry about it, mute him if you have to and do your best to carry. Any adc that is flaming his support is bad, I'm guilty of it myself, many times. I'm often right as well, but flaming someone is beyond retarded. It will only make them play worse and learn/focus less.\n\nJust don't take cs, don't push lane unless you know what you're doing. However if the lane is pushing in uncontrolled help him control it, lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-01-10T03:33:36.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If need be, you let them kill your ADC while you escape.

There was no getting out of that. My other laners weren't even pushing lanes they were walking around the jungle hitting plants.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-01-10T03:37:49.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's one of those you have to accept it moments tbh.\n\n\noh also, tanky supports aren't really in that good of a spot atm, you'd prob be better playing a carry support.","replies":[{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-01-10T03:44:25.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Bloo Banana,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dREPzk30,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2017-01-10T03:37:49.591+0000)\n>\n> That&#x27;s one of those you have to accept it moments tbh.\n> \n> \n> oh also, tanky supports aren&#x27;t really in that good of a spot atm, you&#x27;d prob be better playing a carry support.\n\nMaybe riot should give a little more for us tanks...
