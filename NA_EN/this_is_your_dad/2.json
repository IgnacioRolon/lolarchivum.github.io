Maybe everything was OP cheese, but it was fun as shit to be viable with champs on my terms, before LCS sucked the fucking soul out of this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Tha Light","date":"2018-11-13T11:32:18.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, that was less of a problem than what we have now. Everyone used to hate Morgana`s stun since it was death penalty. Now, that`s any stun. Everybody hated Eve because long invisibility that was hard to deal with even with unlimited pinks. Now it is even worse. Zed was banned all the time because it was not fun to play against him. League is full of Zeds today. There is more cheesing now that ever and it works because the game is so snowbally.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-11-13T08:07:52.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=Y3Tltfn9,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-11-13T07:59:57.964+0000)\n>\n> So, old League was an endless series of counters and spammed OP cheese? :P\n\nThat is exactly what it was, but nostaglia glasses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2018-11-13T08:01:07.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=Y3Tltfn9,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-11-13T07:59:57.964+0000)\n>\n> So, old League was an endless series of counters and spammed OP cheese? :P\n> \n> P.S.: Remove the parentheses from around the URLs; Boards is having trouble determining where they end.\n\nI'm having um.... technical difficulties.
