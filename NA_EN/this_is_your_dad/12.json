I'd report it, particularly if it led to a loss. With that kind of odd report I would write some text in the box explaining what happened.\n\n{{champion:51}}","replies":[{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-05-26T00:22:38.708+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ironically he was mad that we lost the game because he was goofing off during the last teamfight that resulted in our loss.

In your example he's _maybe_ guilty of aiding the enemy team, but even that is a stretch. That Kha'zix will either learn to seize objectives while the iron is hot, or else continue to hemorrhage LP. A chat restriction or 14-day ban for being cocky seems hard to justify.","replies":[{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-05-26T00:15:31.376+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He had 35 kills and we were one half hp tower away from winning after an ace, where he recalled at full hp after the ace that would have won us the game.\nHe also stated in chat \"I could end anytime but I want to get 6 items and am enjoying this easy match.\" He was pretty skilled.

For better or for worse, in this case worse, the team's fate is intertwined with the Kha's. The game was in full swing and rather than being a positive force for the team, the Kha contributed to the team's demise. Kha was solely enjoying him or herself at everyone else's expenses (SC4) by refusing to end the game and essentially leaving the game by backing until the enemy team was back up again (SC7). Because of this short term afk/leaving, they've started to destroy their relationship with their team (SC5) and openly admitted to intentionally doing it by stating they want to toy with the enemy. This is almost akin to not being humble in victory (SC6). They're trying to gloat and show bad form with this behavior. It's selfish and is destructive in a cooperative team game.","replies":[{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-05-26T00:18:14.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it were a normals match I would have allowed him to experiment with different stages of the game. The point of ranked is to win, not to stall until you have 6 items, lose the game and then blame other people when you stated in chat multiple times that you were refusing to end for the sole purpose of seeing how powerful you could get. I'm not anti-fun and I do believe it is sometimes okay to stall out a game if winning doesn't matter and the rest of the team is enjoying the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Psyrix","date":"2017-05-25T18:21:03.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"technically u could file it under unsportsmanlike conduct :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zelorxon","date":"2017-05-25T09:31:28.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kids today never got told the story of the quick lazy hare and the slow smart turtle (not THAT turtle, this one doesn't flashes 1v5 to try and lasthit the enemy adc).","replies":[]},{"poster":"S0LST0RMER","date":"2017-05-25T09:09:41.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the worst is when u ace them and everyone just wonders off to do wolves or some shit instead of taking a turret or inhib. or worse still when u ace them and only one of your team mates is left alive, and your pinging the turret but they dont know whether to back or not, they end up dancing back and forth until they finally decide to take the turret by which time its too late and they end up dying for no reason","replies":[{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-05-25T09:20:34.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the worst part is the guy said in chat he was toying with the enemy and that he knew we could have won.
