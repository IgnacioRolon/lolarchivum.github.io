Push with his spaceaids. Ult anyone that gets close enough with the Aids and W on them (then Q if they were still alive).

If not, its not going to change the fact that I'm still going to ult that Yasuo as soon as he jumps in - I'm not going to think about whether or not my voidlings were being used to their maximum potential before ulting if i had the chance to ult a carry. It was a fairly one-dimensional playstyle that many thought was boring. \n\nProblem is that his rework didnt really do much to address his problems (one dimmensional playstyle). All it did was make his one dimensional playstyle more obnoxious.","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2017-02-08T09:33:41.675+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"what was his playstyle before:\nanti assassin on mid lane, an alternative to picking Lulu or Lissandra\neasy to farm with (lv3 e, just like morgana's lv3 w, would've killed the caster minions alone over time)\nlane bully in good match-ups by maxing Q, if you were confident enough\ngood lane priority due to being able to push most of the time\ndespite all this, he had no mobility skills, no defenses, making him unsafe and easy to gank, requiring the player to think about his (or her) positioning and aggression during the laning phase more than a syndra or cassio or azir, etc\nvery high kill pressure post lv6 due to ultimate allowing easy set-ups for ganks\nyour voildling passive helped you win trades in mid, or push the wave hard.\n\nmy favorite thing was his wave push ability with his passive voildling and E for laning phase.\n\nPost laning phase, he transitioned into a tanky control mage. As the general build involved the RoA and Rylays. His W creating a dangerous slow field on the ground (not as strong as viktor's gravity field). Dangerous especially for tanks as if they dared to pass over and might have gotten randomly cced by anyone in malzahar's the team. They would've lost a large chuck of their hp, as it was %max hp dot damage.\nHe was also controlling the battle field with well placed silence fields which, pre rework, didn't just silence but actually did damage. An ADC would lose 50% of their hp if they wouldn't respect malza's zone. Allowing him to have a degree of control over fights, slowing the entry of adcs and mages after their front line engaged (assuming they didn't engage on malza).\n\nHis other role post lane phase was, similar to Lulu. Protecting the ADC. Even if the enemy had a feed darius, yi, fiora, phanteon, etc. If they didn't work together with their team, malzahar would have punished that. By instantly locking down that enemy and him together with the adc would burst that target down in his suppress time frame. If they had QSS you would've used E for initial slow and kiting before trying to suppress them.\n\nThe difference to this post rework malzahar is that most of his damage comes from his W, his E and Q and even R do very little damage to the point its not even worth building AP for them, but you want to spam em. That's why the build switched from RoA first item to Morello first item. His non W spells became utility only ... which prior to rework, it was only the case for jungle malza. But jungle malza's voidlings were actually stronger and you couldn't do anything without em.\nAnd that gave him an alternative position and buildpath. There was even a dia jungle malza main making videos to prove it works at high elo too.\n\nAs for one dimensional. Every.......single...........character...........in ........... this game is \"one or two dimension playstyle only\". Due to the fact that only 1 type of playstyle is more efficient than the other.\nThat's why, despite the fact that Ahri can be played ADC, you will only see her as a Kite Mage or Assassinish. Almost never building adc unless the players are randomly having fun.\n\n\nWhat the rework actually did is:\nmake all his spells except W utility.\nput all power in W, meaning he has less needs for levels than other roles. Usually mid and top are first to 18 due to being solo laners,  rework malza has no need for that\ngive him a very very very strong passive (which i said from the start). He receives banshee's passive from minute zero. It was WAY STRONGER post rework before it hit very hard with the nerf bat. The reason this is a problem is that for both summoners/invokers (which is the post rework playstyle) or control mages (pre rework playstyle), their weakness is if someone gets inside their \"zone\". When they get up close and personal.\nAnd his passive negates the possible CC to allow you to get close to him, and bring him close to you.\n\nClassic Anime for proving point:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiocmKn9nQM\nstrong when the enemy is in control zone, weak when the enemy gets in\n\nCalling him as a \"only one dimensional\" just proves how little time you've spend with pre rework malzahar.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2017-02-08T10:11:37.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I know what Malz did prior to his rework. I played quite a bit of him. You can try and argue against it, but his playstyle was one-dimensional. \n\nNow, I'm not talking about builds - I'm talking about in-game play. Ahri, as you mentioned, can play as a kite mage or assassin. She can choose to use her R aggressively to engage, she can choose to use it to kite back. She can use her charm to CC the backline or peel the divers. She can use her Q for burst against squishies or to deal true damage to tanks. All these tools allow her to play in multiple ways, regardless of your build. \n\nFor the others you mentioned, lets go through them too:\n\nSyndra - she can use her single target damage for bursting down carries, or she can ult the frontline and E for the teamwide AoE stun. She can pick up orbs or she can pick up monsters. She needs to make a choice sometimes - do you want to ult someone in range with only 4 orbs, or do you save it until youre juggling 7? Do you want to Ult-Stun, or do you think you can get a long range stun off and ult after? \n\nAzir - do you attempt a shuffle or play as an AP Marksman at max range? Do you use your E for the shield or to put space between you and the enemy? Do you Q to get your soldiers to your enemy, or do you try to place a W in range so you can save your Q for when they try to escape (or if you need to escape?) Edit - do you play him \"bursty\" or do you play him DPS? \n\nCassio - I'll give you this one. She is pretty one-dimmensional, even though the rework tried to change her reliance on her poison. Although you have the option of not poisoning before using your E, you always will if you can. \n\nBut what choices did pre-rework Malzahar make? In lane, he pushed with his E and Q (with a little help with autos before your first back). His W was only useful in very specific situations, so I didnt even take it until level 5. There was no real choice to make - if the enemy was stupid enough to walk up for me to E them, I would. If not, I just pushed with zero interaction with the enemy laner (since I played Malz as a safe laner into assassins). \n\n____________________\nNow he still has very high kill pressure at 6, since his ult is still pretty great at setting up ganks. He is still able to ult the Darius/Fiora/Yi/Pantheon thats diving your carries. If he did 50% of an ADCs health beforehand with a Q, he does 40% now. But now there is an element you have to account for, since his voidlings do so much damage, you have to choose - do you want to wait until a few more voidings spawn to do more damage, or do you need the instant supression? \n\nI'm not saying that his rework was a success. He still has the same basic problems. But it was a step in making him more interactive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-02-08T20:37:56.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Problem is that his rework didnt really do much to address his problems (one dimmensional playstyle).

Rework successful.\nMaster Yi - % missing health scaling on Meditate made it infinitely more useful on AD Yi. Only 70% reset on kills instead of 100 took away press Q to Penta. No more AP Yi, no more random chance on Q to kill minions. Rework was phenomenal. \nKarma - Her old kit was incredibly confusing and no one played her. After her rework she built up enough of a following that people actually got angry and loud when Riot removed her shieldbomb. Rework is probably the best one done so far. \nSion - His old kit was either AD or AP, but you felt like you were missing half the kit, and his infinite health scaling made you want him to be a tank but he had no tanking abilities. His new rework is super fun to play with a lot of skill expression. Rework successful. \nTristana - She can attach her E to turrets now. How fucking awesome is that? Rework successful. \nDraven - Draven's old passive was toxic as hell. This one is pretty minor but I still count it as a rework because he got a completely brand new ability that changes the way people play Draven forever. Rework is good. \nEvelyn - Evelyn used to be stupidly ungodly the best champion in the entire game period. Then they removed her stun and her winrate fell through the floor until invisible pink wards were removed. Rework failure.\nKassadin - Ninety fucking percent ban rate. Ninety percent. You think Ruot can't rework shit? People can play Kassadin now. That's a huge step up. Rework successful. \nOlaf - Absolutely dumpstered because of his successs in competitive play, took Riot two years to get him back to any sort of viability. Rework failure.\n\nSo yeah, you don't know what you're talking about.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wyrmblade","date":"2017-02-08T07:41:16.432+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I was unfortunately one of these people.\n\nDon't worry though now the tank update is going to take vicious revenge on me.","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2017-02-08T08:30:49.084+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"its not really your fault guys, riot is known to not give a shit about champion mains and their perspective\nalmost every single champion rework (if not all of them) was/is hated by mains of the pre-rework version.

Before she was toxic stat-check with no counterplay if countering and no options when countered. They made it so now she actually has an outplay potential from both sides and addad really interesting (Vitals and Parry are now very interactive) mechanics, while keeping the feel - by that I refer to the ultimate, she still dashes around her opponent and looks really badass while doing so. I feel like she must be hated just because she now requires a mechanical skill.\n\nAnd no, I don't even play her, she counters all my toplane mains.","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2017-02-08T10:30:53.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"question, did you play main fiora pre rework?\ni believe the answer is no\n\nshe was as much of a stat check as garen is. Or any other champions without skill shots. I'm sry, but that argument holds nothing for me. Everyone and everything is a stat check. Fiora pre rework had plenty of counterplay, such as use shields and negate her ult entirely. Her ult even if it stacked on 5 target with hydra proc on all 5 targets would do LESS DAMAGE than a fizz E on all targets.\nYou had full control of where she would land after ult. Building ninja tabi would've reduced her entire damage by 10%\nand many more.\n\nIts the current fiora as a champion itself good? not really, to much true damage. Once they remove the true damage from her kit, she's going to be fine. But I'll never EVER like her. She's hard to play, she's gimmicky, once her numbers are a bit out of the water she's overpowered as fuck and nobody can face her.\n\nAnd its VERY VERY VERY different from what she used to be, aside from the true damage and harder to play (for the new version). Before I could't parry CC, I didn't have escape in lanes, most top laners were soft counters (pre rework fiora only countered teemo, jayce, gnar and top lane adcs), the others where skill match-ups. And then where phanteon, malphite, maokai, jax and shen which you couldn't touch tbh.\nIts totally different.\nlil edit: did I win my lane with pre rework fiora vs jax, phanteon and so on? yes, I did. But I had to outplay the living hell out of them, I had to win every trade, I had to be better in every aspect than them in lane to win it. It was still fun. Current fiora is not fun for me to play (yes, i tried a lot).\n\nYou can love the new fiora. Nothing wrong with it. She's however an entirely different champion, everything except her name changed. EVERYTHING.\nLike, I love the post rework MF. But I seen plenty of pre rework MF that hate the rework. It changed their hero in a way that no longer pleases them. Reworks always do that. Because riot takes feedback from everyone else and ignore champion mains who actually understand that hero properly.","replies":[{"poster":"An Undead brat","date":"2017-02-08T14:14:04.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If stat-checking kit holds nothing for you, then you have no idea about game health. Yes, I did not play pre-rework Fiora and I had a reason - let me quote myself: \"I would never touch that toxic bullshit ever.\" The skill you are talking about entirely revoles around tracking enemies cooldowns and knowing when to go in and if you have enough damage to kill them and to know how to kite, which are the basics of every champion, otherways her kit was \"click on them with all your spells and kill them or die\". As you said, there were some things you could do against her, like standing grouped and let the damage soak, but that's another toxic design, because it removed Fiora player's agency from the game. Not talking about her unbearable snowball-depending playstyle, which means if she's been fed, she destroyed the whole team with that ult so the counterplay went away again (except for having Zhonya's) (your sheild argument is countering/countered issue again, not every champion has a shield), but if she was behind, she was so useless she could AFK aswell. \n\nThe Vital mechanic is not gimmicky at all, it is perfectly explained in her lore and pushes the swordsman theme to it's limit, couldn't be better. The true damage and heal is a reward for hitting it, which is reasonable. There's only one thing that diverges her theme and that's the ult heal, but I was not able to come up with any better reward for hitting all Vitals which wouldn't be toxic, except the heal effecting only Fiora, but this way it gives her a teamfight presence and team utility I guess.\n\nOverpowered as fuck when her numbers are high? Easy treatment, lower them - which wouldn't be possible with the old Fiora, that'S the flaw of the stat-checking kit, if the numbers are high, champion's broken, if the numbers are low, champion's useless. \n\nYou enjoy her less than pre-rework because now she needs skill? Yeah, that's basically what I said in the first comment. The problem is Riot may understand that you enjoy her, but I'm sure every Kassadin main enjoyed Kassadin with his silence. Or LeBlanc. Or release Xin and Zyra. It's nice you enjoy something, but if it's toxic it can't stay because noone else has fun in the game. \n\nFiora is still the same champion: AA based skirmisher with a dash that rewards agressive usage, parrying ability, AA enhancer and an ultimate which let's her jumping around her target to deal high amount damage and making her survive in a fight. She was just modernized, rework gave her options and interactive gameplay (which \"having a shield\" isn't) and removed toxic stat-checking (thus unbalancable) and counterpick-revolving elements.","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2017-02-08T14:38:51.813+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"every melee champion is a stat check\n\nfiora is not the same, never will be the same\nnow she has lane safety\nnow she has true damage\nnow she can dash anywhere she wants\nnow she has chase potential\nnow she had more than auto attacks for damage (hello a passive that's not worthless)\nnow she has weave push without items (W)\nnow she has cc\nnow she has guaranteed crit\n\nshe changed' in vast ways, she got deleted and replaced.

Just showing how little knowledge they had on fiora.\n\nShe required more skills than other champions precisely because she had no CC or utility. She required more skill than most champions because most top lane match-ups were counters. Or the way you put it, their stat stick was larger than yours.\n\nAnd yes, I like easy to play champions. But I don't play Yi for example. Nor do I play Darius or Renekton. Or trynda.\nFiora was my dear, and she's gone.\nYou can hate her all you want. The new one is totally different from every point of view except the name.

I couldn't bring myself to like her again either. \n\nI wouldn't say that simple champs are necessarily easy just because they lack mechanics. I prefer champs like old Fiora because I prefer relying on game knowledge and decisionmaking; strategy and tactics. Those things are greatly diminished with the new Fiora, replaced by mechanics I can't be bothered with, like you said; just look at the new q, it isn't as restricted in its use anymore and thus you need less knowledge or planning to get it to do what you wanted.\n\nFor a long time, a lot of people have been thinking that skill is all about mechanically outplaying your opponent, and not about analyzing a situation and planning ahead (like that Ezreal); how many times to you hear/see \"outplayed\" compared to the amount of times you see \"outsmarted\" (except for a post a bit below lol, although thats mostly sarcastic)? Partly because it's much harder to notice I suppose.\n\nI'm not arguing whether a newly reworked champion is better or worse, not even if they are more or less healthy. What bothers me is that a champion will get reworked, without retaining the base playstyle, without retaining the same role or niche, sometimes (even though not always gameplay related) not even retain the same theme, and become an impostor.

Still, she’s one of them tricksy melee marksmen/fighter types who was supposed to be a fleet-footed fencing duelist, but who, once she had a few items, could just lunge up to the other team’s squishies and smack ‘em for a quick and easy - and unstoppable - kill. **That was her single gear, really, and because Fiora was only good at killing, when she didn't have the damage to do her single job, she couldn’t do much of anything.**\n\nTaken from Fiora rework release, bolded is what screams stat check.\n\nFiora was literally the textbook definition of stat check,and it was the very reason why she was reworked. \n\nEither she outstatted you and wrecked your entire team or she didn't and was completely useless.
