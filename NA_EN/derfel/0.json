You got it boss.\n\nExpecting {{item:3814}} (one of the main problems) to be directly nerfed is an amateur mistake if you&#039;ve ever studied riot design 110.  Riot, at minimum, is going to beat around the bush for at least one patch or ten so expect to see that stupid ass bubble on all enemy champs for the rest of February.  If we're lucky we'll see them take 1 lethality off of it in March to \"test the waters\" while compensating {{champion:64}}  with some true damage on his windwall. \n\nBtw {{champion:55}} is still about as fun to play against as it is fun to poor bleach down your anus in case you've actually forgotten about her.

Cassiopeas ulti does 150 / 250 / 350 (+ 50% AP) I see no reason why it should be nerfed.  Illaois main use of ulti is to summon tentacles to do damage after she hits it so if you compensated the reduction of damage with increased healing per tentacle hit it would almost certainly be a buff.\n\nAlso lets make it clear that if you get your spirit pulled by illoai and then get ulted and don't leave then you deserve to die.  Every single champion in this game deserves to die to that.  All illaoi has is dmg, the only modicum of utility she has is her slow and her w shouldn't be counted as mobility.  If she hits her damage (specifically e and then ulti) you should die, if she doesn't then she is a sitting duck waiting to be killed.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MaybeFiftyOtters","date":"2017-02-13T17:52:51.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget about \"Night's Vow\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"morris1","date":"2017-02-13T17:36:56.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Denarius,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Mn43AxZy,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-02-13T12:53:33.515+0000)\n>\n> while compensating {{champion:64}}  with some true damage on his windwall. \n\n\nHillarious troll post, such a shame I had to read all the way up to this to be able to tell.","replies":[]}]}
