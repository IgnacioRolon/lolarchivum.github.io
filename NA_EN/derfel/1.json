He just out-stats her and moves too fast for her to use her maneuverability to outplay him. \n\nTryndamere is similar. She can win the lane early on, but if she doesn't Tryndamere will get to the point where, even if Fiora hits all parts of her ult, he will kill her through the healing.

He will also be able to drain-tank her, while making her own drain-tanking less effective. Though I would probably go an on-hit build against Fiora as Yi.\n\n> and with her ult procced and full build with 45% life steal she can easily outheal his dmg.\n\nNo she can't, lol. Yi's DPS is the highest in the game. There isn't a champion in the game that can outheal Yi, especially if he also builds a bunch of lifesteal. Do you think Yi is barred from building it? \n\n> Also don&#x27;t forget the 50% AS debuff from her W\n\nAre you aware of what Yi's ult even does? He's immune to all slows, including attack speed slows. \n\n> and Yi&#x27;s W not working against Fiora&#x27;s true dmg.\n\nHe won't need his W.\n\n> When it comes to Trynda, the point is again to proc your ult as fast as you can, then you just kite him around with Fiora&#x27;s insane mobility (Q on 2 sec cooldown, Phage passive and +50% MS from her passive).

Kite Tryndamere around? Please, his E with CDR is practically on a 1 second cooldown late game since she won't be able to Q away before taking two auto attacks.\n\n> She can easily 4 shot both Yi and Trynda if they go standard, full AD builds.\n\nOnly morons go full AD on Master Yi. That's not even standard build on him. Also, no she can't, because Yi will be drain-tanking her friend. \n\n> I personally think that, while some champions scale equally good as her (Jax, Yi, Trynda, maybe Xin) noone outscales her\n\nQuite a few champions do. Twitch for example scales better. He can't duel her, but he is more useful to his team late game.\n\n> and with her kit being made purely for 1v1, Fiora can always win late game duels when played correctly.\n\nShe frankly can't. Have you ever watched a high diamond to challenger Tryndamere or Yi player play against a Fiora? They aren't even slightly afraid of her late game.\n\n> With full build I heal for 600+ by one Q with passive proc (45% life steal+Death&#x27;s Dance healing for 15% of the true dmg dealt+passive proc healing) and ult heals for almost 2k damage in 5 seconds, I doubt any duelist can outdamage that enough to kill her since she is not that squishy.\n\nMaster Yi does over two thousand damage per second friend, and Tryndamere can easily get a mortal reminder to shit on your healing. \n\n> I keep saying if you play her correctly for some reason you know. Fiora&#x27;s skill cap is so high that she can easily outplay her enemies every time.\n\nShe can potentially outplay Tryndamere or Yi (not really Yi to be honest because there isn't really any potential to kite him and his damage is so much higher) if they make a mistake, but played without making one? Not really no. Fiora is a very overrated duelist. Even with your silly yolo full damage build, Tryndamere himself has a yolo all damage build combined with steroids and builds that scale better with lifesteal (crit means his autos hit much harder so he heals for more, he has raw AD and crit built into his kite, etc.). Yi can build them as well, or he could just build standard on-hit:\n\n{{item:1419}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3156}} / {{item:3053}} \n\nAnd out-DPS you while drain-tanking you, while making your own drain-tanking less effective because he is tankier than you are lad.

Proccing her ult takes around 2 seconds late game, if you can play Fiora good.

Fiora can deal 20% of Yi's health instantly, with one hit, with PASSIVE DMG ALONE.\n8. Not killing them on 5-6 auto-attacks? Late game I deal 15-20% of enemies' max HP in true dmg depending on whether I have Fervor stacked or not.

Fiora however can outplay literally everyone. No matter how Trynd/Yi builds it is literally IMPOSSIBLE for them to deal 1/4 of Fiora's hp with one auto attack and they both don't have AA resets. Watch some vids where Fiora almost insta-procs all vitals from her ult, dude that is almost enough to kill them with just that (60-80% of their max hp with TRUE DMG ALONE IN 2 SECONDS! Dude, let's be real, noone can do that to her, and even if they deal a lot, she has her W that can block 2-3 of Yi's/Trynda's auto attacks.

That means I heal for 1200 every second, and after that, I heal for 600 every second auto attack and 300-400 every second from my ult for 5 seconds.\n\nWhere exactly are your numbers coming from? \n\nYou have 115 healing from your passive. An auto attack would have to do 1,077.8 damage to heal you for 485 on top of that. Fiora doesn't build IE, so even her second E proc won't deal that much.\n\nIt also occurred to me that you erroneously believe that Death's Dance gives you healing based off of your true damage. This isn't even close to the case. The item heals you based off the _physical_ damage dealt, your true damage doesn't factor into it at all.\n\nThe amount you're healing wouldn't even come close to 600 health per auto attack. Your healing would actually be relatively shitty since the physical portion of your damage would be baby small compared to Master Yi or Tryndamere due to your utter lack of pen and attack speed, as well as crit in Tryndamere's case.\n\nAlso, what is actually stopping Tryndamere or Yi from depriving Fiora ult stacks? Tryndamere can use his own far greater range mobility to keep her from getting the vitals furthest from her, making it a pure auto attack war, which he easily wins, for example.\n\n> 4. I agree Yi has the highest DPS in the game. Fiora however has the right tools to sustain through that DPS and burst him down easily with her insane % max health true dmg.\n\nNo, this simply isn't the case. I've already proven that you grossly overestimate the amount your auto attacks heal you, and in terms of burst they can't even be compared. Yi with even an on-hit build bursts harder and wins the auto attack war.\n\n> 5. I checked it especially for you - with full build, depending on what I build for the last 2 items, I have 2800-3200 health.\n\nPost the build then, because this appears to be your main build:\n\n{{item:3074}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3026}} \n\nWhich doesn't provide nearly that much HP.\n\nNo build I see in your match history gives you 3,200 health. Not even the one with triforce and randuin's.\n\nYou'd have to stack three HP items to get that, and if you did that you'd have much lower AD, so your passive wouldn't actually be as strong as you've been making it out to be.\n\n> 6. You forgot something. If Yi goes for that burst build, he actually does die in 4 autoattacks, while Fiora, having Death&#x27;s Dance and 30% more life steal than him, can easily survive through that.\n\nShe frankly can't because, despite having lower lifesteal than her, his auto attacks do over twice as much damage. That's what you don't seem to understand lad. All that lifesteal is nice and all, but it amounts to less when the actual physical damage you're doing isn't all that high, at least compared to a crit builder like Yi or Tryndamere.\n\n> 7. Dude I think you are missing something. Yi can deal 20% of Fiora&#x27;s max health in 3-4 auto attacks. Even while having 2,5 AS it takes 1,5 second. Fiora can deal 20% of Yi&#x27;s health instantly, with one hit, with PASSIVE DMG ALONE.\n\nI honestly almost stopped reading when you said Yi can only deal 20% of Fiora's max health in 3-4 auto attacks.\n\nLate game Yi's E lets his autos hit for a flat 150 true damage. This would be 450 damage to Fiora's health late game. That's over half of 20% of Fiora's health in true damage alone. If he autos one more time, he double strikes, for an extra 300 true damage plus the physical damage.\n\nThis isn't even counting the physical damage from the auto, the physical damage from the bloodrazor, the physical damage from the blade of the ruined king, or the burn from skirmisher's sabre, or the magic damage from the guinsoo's (and if he had this stacked when the duel began there would frankly be no contest, he'd eat her alive).\n\nYet you believe that Yi can only do 20% of Fiora's max health in 3-4 auto attacks? Please.\n\nAlso, now you expect me to buy that you have 400 bonus AD?\n\nEven with this build:\n\n{{item:3074}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3026}} \n\nWhich is very damage heavy you would only have 250 bonus AD. Plus sixty with fervor (also stop assuming that your fervor starts off fully stacked, it is not a point in Fiora's favor when Master Yi and Tryndamere stack it faster), plus thirty with elixir of wrath. Where is the other sixty bonus AD coming from? \n\n> 8. Not killing them on 5-6 auto-attacks? Late game I deal 15-20% of enemies&#x27; max HP in true dmg depending on whether I have Fervor stacked or not.\n\nSo this is just not true, as I've illustrated. You're just wrong, lol. \n\n> With 4 ult procs and 1 vital proc after, that is 60-80% of enemies&#x27; max hp in true dmg alone, not counting her AA damage, which is FAR above the remaining 20%.\n\nYou appear to believe five multiplied by twenty is eighty. I'm beginning to see where your gross misconceptions about Fiora are coming from.\n\n> 9. Trynd killing Fiora in 3 auto attacks? xD Dude, he can deal 400-600 dmg to her with one AA at max.\n\nAfraid not friendo. A single auto attack from Tryndamere easily breaks over 1,000 damage late game. Fiora doesn't even have 50% damage reduction from armour against Tryndamere, considering his pen. That, plus the damage multipliers from masteries (which do not apply to true damage btw), plus stattik shiv's upfront burst, make it very doubtful that she's only taking 400-600 damage from Tryndamere's auto.\n\n> She CAN kite him around. Trynd&#x27;s E can&#x27;t be on 1 sec cooldown, 2-3 sec at max.\n\nNot true, late game with 40% CDR it's on a five second cooldown. A single auto from him brings this down to 3 seconds, another auto brings it down to 1. It's basically always up.\n\n> That is around the same as Fiora&#x27;s Q cooldown. Not only she can kite him around with Q but also proc a vital every time and maintaining perma 700+ ms.\n\nNot when he slows her actually, between W and blade of the ruined king.\n\n> 10. Have I ever watched a Diamond/Challenger Yi or Trynd? Watch En Garde&#x27;s Fiora dude :)\n\nI will gladly watch him run away from a Yi or Tryndamere late game.\n\n> Mortal Reminder is actually hard to play against tho.\n\nIt's almost like your build depends entirely on lifesteal lmao.\n\n> I would rather say Trynd and Yi are both overrated, both can get hard countered (Yi vs. Jax/Trynd and Trynd vs. Jax)\n\nYi isn't hard countered by Jax and maybe not by Tryndamere, Tryndamere isn't hard countered by Jax (rather, he's hard countered by Nasus).\n\n> and they cannot do anything about it because they have ZERO 1v1 outplay potential (yeah Yi may have some, but his outplay potential is more teamfight oriented and almost useless in 1v1).\n\nMaster Yi uses W to absorb Jax's burst and barrage of auto attacks, Qs the E stun, and proceeds to kill Jax because no one who can't be unkillable for five seconds beats Yi in an auto attack war.\n\nI really have to wonder at your knowledge of the champions if you honestly believe that Yi in particularly has literally zero outplay potential in a 1v1. That's such a laughably ignorant statement it warrants no response to be perfectly honest lad.\n\n> Fiora however can outplay literally everyone. No matter how Trynd/Yi builds it is literally IMPOSSIBLE for them to deal 1/4 of Fiora&#x27;s hp with one auto attack\n\nFor Tryndamere? It is very possible lad.\n\n> and they both don&#x27;t have AA resets.\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!\n\nIt's funny because for the longest time Yi's W was literally used only as an auto attack reset.

If you're not taking damage it doesn't amount to much tbh.\n\nAnyway, I'm sorry lad, but considering how blatantly wrong some of your statements about Fiora are I can't say you've convinced me at all.","replies":[{"poster":"GangcAte","date":"2017-04-13T14:58:04.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually agree with some of your points. But I can heal for 600 with one AA in rare occasions (with minions nearby+3 infernals). Same with the % true dmg - my record with 3 infernals was 76% with ult. One of your statements however made me seriously laugh.\n> Yi isn't hard countered by Jax and maybe not by Tryndamere, Tryndamere isn't hard countered by Jax (rather, he's hard countered by Nasus).\n\nYeah well, you must be joking. I have to say Jax in the late game is the strongest duelist in the game (when it comes to fighting against Fiora - it depends on who stuns who) focusing on pure auto attacks. He has retardely massive single target damage. Stacking his passive takes literally 1,5 seconds and with the full duelist build (Trinity>BOTRK>Titanic>full tank) he has around the same attack speed as Yi (Yi has 2.50, Jax has around 2,30-2,40 but he has a 1,5 second cooldown AA reset). Also his W+R+Sheen damage+tons of armor/mr from 2-3 tank items and his ult he easily outdamages Trynda. I have played a lot of Jax and from my experience:\nvs. Yi - this fight is a joke, he is 2x less tanky than you and you deal around the same amount of DPS. Even if he dodges your E with his Q, he cannot outtdamage you. And his W? Jax melts through it easily. \nvs. Trynd - all it takes to 100-0 him is AA>W+sheen dmg>Hydra+R+AA dmg, eventually one or 2 more AA's (this full combo can be performed in 1,5-2 seconds). He deals ridiculously less damage than Jax when you go Randuins+tabis. You then use E to survive 2 seconds of his ult and stun him for the next second. It gives you plenty of time to move back significanlty enough that he can land max 1-2 auto attacks before his ult ends. Its not even close to bringing Jax down.\nLike, sorry, I know I may have exagerrated some things about Fiora because of my love for this champion but, cmon, let's be real. Nor Yi nor Trynda stand a chance vs. a late game Jax.\nI agree both Trynda and Yi are immensly strong late game duelists, but they have too much counterplay with too little outplay potential (dude, I know, they have outplay potential, but the counterplay on some champions is simply too much and overweights their ability to outplay the enemy) to be considered the definite best duelists. \nHere you can see an example video (the builds are a bit different than the ones built today, but you get the idea what happens): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUR3JougfZE\nAnd Jax, while having less teamfight presence and pentakill potential, is definitely superior to them both when it comes to 1v1.\nBut back to Fiora - you need to agree with me that Fiora can 5 shot late game Yi and Trynda. With my standard full build i deal 65% of enemies' max hp as true damage. I have Trinity. Proccing 4 vitals takes around 2 seconds so it's one Sheen proc. That means that: \nYi with standard build has 2,7k hp: 65% off of that is 1750. That means he has 950 health. 4 auto attacks with sheen procs are: 440x3 + 650 = 1970. Yi has some armor of course, let's say its migitated by 60%. That is 780. He has 170 hp left, but he healed some of that because of BOTRK, right? However, 1,5 seconds have already passed, Sheen is ready again, Fiora uses E, deals 650 damage. Fiora kills Yi in 3-4 seconds if she does everything perfectly. I have played some Yi lately (look up my match history), and sorry but it is IMPOSSIBLE for Yi to kill Fiora in 4 seconds (if they are equal, full build). He has tons of DPS, but dude, Fiora has 4 times more life steal AND WHATS MORE IMPORTANT - SHE IS NOWHERE AS SQUISHY AS YOU MAKE HER TO BE. I have NEVER seen any Trynda deal more than 600-700 damage to me with my build. 1000 damage in one AA to her is impossible. I have over 150k points on Fiora at the moment. Of course I've both died against and killed Yi and Trynda late game, and I agree, they have the advantage. But you are saying Fiora can't duel them - WRONG! She ALWAYS can if she plays perfectly. This is what I've been trying to say - Fiora doesn't always win 1v1's late game. Fiora wins them only if she plays that duel GOOD. I am not trying to say you are wrong about Yi and Trynda being one of the strongest. I am trying to say that Fiora has the right tools to outplay them in the late game. Of course both sides do, but my point is Fiora can always win if SHE plays the fight perfectly. Here is another example, this time of how fast you can proc her ult if you play correctly (you can do it even faster): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXccg-4TTO4 Let's say the chance to play perfectly and win duels against them is around 20% for an average player, and that's the fun part - Fiora has insanely high skill cap and you can make those 20% waaaay bigger.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GangcAte","date":"2017-04-11T21:41:26.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, I build Fiora mostly AD, with 1-2 tank items yet I still have around 3k hp and 150+ resistances with full build, 45% life steal, 400+ AD with fervor stacked and 15-20% of enemies' max hp dealt with one passive proc.

I like counter picks that are fair and balanced. For example let's say I picked Nasus whom used to be late game, but is now mid game cause tanky melee. The enemy picks a Pantheon and starts stomping me. That's fair however since he drops late game and I'll get stronger as the game goes on. So my job is turtle, survival, and take advantage of the lane if he ganks other lanes with his ultimate. I must warn my allies, etc. If I succeed then chances are I win. That's close to a skill match up in that.\n\nNow ever since season 4 I believe? Toilet bowel Ryze and Lulu went top lane and just win the game when vs melee. Bullies are not dropping off hard and as fast. Though I don't like champions being god mode at any point of the game, just need to trim the power curve down is all. Top lane mainly and somewhat mid lane are entirely based around counter picking. It's the only reason Pantheon is a god pick from no where all of a sudden. He hard counters Fiora, Darius, Kled, and even Riven.
