I believe you're smart enough to know what's offensive.\n\nOn to the real discussion...\n\nI think we have very different definitions of balance. First of all, to me, game balance doesn't mean anything concrete. It just means, in general, there are many strategies/tactics/classes/characters/choices and they are all decent options. Competitive options. So yes, I think balance and competition go hand in hand.\n\nMe and my best friend have arguments like this all the time, where the disagreement just stems from the words we're using, which we think mean different things. In the end we usual have the same opinion, but have different ways of expressing it.\n\nI think that's what's happening here too. I don't think all the champions should be the same. Rather, every champion should be good at something different, and some of them will be better in general, because they have generally applicable strengths. And some will only be good in a small niche. But all of them need to be competitive picks in at least some situations, and none of them should be without competition (that is, none should be always the best pick).","replies":[{"poster":"Damion Wolf","date":"2017-02-16T14:05:13.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, damn it.

The issue is the idea that it is somehow wrong/stupid/immoral to have a paid professional designer or team work on the fine-tuning of a champion that they created.  If this is something that you are seriously complaining about then, my random acquaintance, you have run out of things to bitch about.\n\nI might end up squishing together replies from a few different dumbass topics I've seen here in this next paragraph.  They might not all pertain to what you've said but I can't be bothered to scroll back up and the conversation again.\n\nAspects of the game do not go straight from the design team to implementation.  They are _approved _before they make it in to the God damn game.  Design team members do not approve their own designs.  Somebody else does.  This isn't the design team slipping a fastball past everybody just to get their super cool new chimpokemon in to the game unmolested and over-powered.  This is shit.  Shit happens.  It's part of the ongoing process of making, maintaining and expanding upon a living piece of software.  All of the idiots who talk about how big of a disaster this is clearly weren't around for the good old days of Dodge stacking, Legacy Yi and Upon-Release Xin Zao (that was a fun five days).\n\nAnd, again, Riot are happy with releasing a champion on the slightly powerful side at first to build interest in them.  Sometimes the champion is too powerful.  Then somebody will look at it, assess it then decide to tell the design team responsible what changes THEY WANT DONE to the champion.  The changes will be made and then the champion will be tested then somebody will APPROVE the final product before it goes in to the game.\n\nThis is how a business works, kids.  Riot aren't new at this.\n\nThe arguments for and against have already been made.  The fact is that the person/people who make something are going to be the ones who know the most about that thing and its fine details and inner workings.  Whatever freedoms of design and correction they have are specifically given to them by the people who pay their salaries.  Therefor, Riot is okay with them doing what the fuck they are paid for.

Even now, when she's weak, she is an annoying champion to deal with.\nIt's going to be difficult to balance Camille, because her core gameplay is not healthy.\nWhen she's ahead, she's incredibly hard to get away from, even more so than a fed Frozen Fist Ekko, and it's practically your funeral when she ults. And Camille was almost always ahead on release.\nWhen all her numbers are nerfed like they are now, she is still hard to get away from, but she doesn't do jack shit, instead letting her team mates get you.","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2017-02-11T23:27:11.796+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its his first champion IIRC.

PBE is not good for testing balance, because it is not a competitive environment. It never has been. Rioters have said this in response to questions like yours. Sorry I don't have links though.\n2. Camille is not the easiest of champions to learn. It takes more than a few games to git gud at her. People usually don't play new champs on the PBE more than a few times. By the time someone understands a new champ on the PBE, they give their feedback and move on. So there is never a large stable of \"Camille mains\" that you can follow to see how good she will be once people start grinding her in ranked.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2017-02-11T16:00:32.357+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":9,"body":"Yeah, I'm so upset that she got huge 7.3 nerfs from her creator rather than huge 7.3 nerfs from someone else.","replies":[{"poster":"MFTORANK1","date":"2017-02-11T17:03:45.282+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"Her nerf are irrelevant, it reminds me of this kid of was arguing with me on the board saying Camille wasn't gonna get picked in the LCS/LCK and that she was weak loolll","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2017-02-11T17:18:27.148+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"The 7.3 patch hasn't gone through yet on any professional level, to my knowledge.
