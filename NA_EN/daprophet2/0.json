I did get a new laptop that runs on chrome, but was having trouble installing league on it.  I know you have to run crouton and linux and stuff like that, but I never seem to get the steps right, no matter what guide I read.  I was wondering if there was anyone else out there who plays League on a Chromebook, and if they could point me to a guide or video that helped them out.  A video tutorial of someone actually doing it would be fantastic.

While they're great for apps and web surfing, I don't know of any really made for gaming.
