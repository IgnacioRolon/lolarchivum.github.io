What i found was kinda ridiculous in that Darius has a 91.8% ban ratio. The next highest is Garen at 80%. This isn&#039;t a thread about me complaining about how op Darius is , but I&#039;m curious. Has there ever been a champion that has had a higher ban ratio that Darius? I mean hes pretty much banned 9/10 games.","replies":[{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-09-25T14:15:14.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In Season 3 I don't recall many games where Kassadin and LeBlanc weren't both banned - and the games they weren't banned, losses followed.  Season 4 at the start Elise was pick or ban as she could lay down level 2-3 kills consistently and the game would snowball beyond control.  Earlier this season everyone was banning Nidalee before they toned her down.  The largest problem with Darius and Garen right now is Garen counters Darius the best in my opinion and if one gets banned, the other needs to be banned.  \n\nVery happy Skarner and MDK ban rates are lowering, hopefully people start finding their groove and Darius and Garen will see the light of day again soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Haeyi","date":"2015-09-25T14:24:57.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I remember Kassadin always being banned lol","replies":[{"poster":"frigginmurlocs","date":"2015-09-25T18:20:44.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speaking of Kass, when was the last time you say him picked?","replies":[{"poster":"Haeyi","date":"2015-09-27T01:19:41.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saw kassadin top yesterday actually lol","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"One Bind Morgana","date":"2015-09-25T19:44:55.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kassadin was like 97% ban rate in s3\n\nbeing 1 shot with teleport > 10 stack ritwalk was dumb as fuk","replies":[]},{"poster":"Agidyne","date":"2015-09-25T16:58:03.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kassadin reached 96% ban rate in Season III.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lao Fu the Tiger","date":"2015-09-25T14:26:12.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I recall correctly, at one point 4.20 Weedwick had 102% pick/play rate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keitron","date":"2015-09-25T14:35:36.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"99% on kassadin around S3 or S4 with 1% being troll bans","replies":[]}]}
