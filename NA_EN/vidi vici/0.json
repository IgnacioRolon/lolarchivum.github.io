I don&#039;t agree with what you have to say though. its in my right to stand up for myself. you shouldn&#039;t let others bully you and you shouldn&#039;t have to go report someone everytime they do something. that&#039;s pathetic in my eyes and not necessary, I have higher expectations for the human race. I think if one has a problem with another they should discuss it. if it ends up being an argument or disagreement all you can do is bite your tongue and explain your point of view in a manner that is fitting for the others around them or falls on a medium for generalized moral portfolio for todays beliefs, and if you are not aware of those markers or lack moral compass then yes you can punish. \r\n\r\nbut I have found that more results strive from people who actually want to be good. I did not say anything that would mentally abuse the other person or people around me. it was not abusive in the slightest. if you cant let people who enter into a game built on your companies architecture and let them talk amongst themselves in agreement or disagreement then that is wrong. not only within your company but you as an individual. because what your doing is enabling your fellow man truly. I would really like this to be escalated because I feel that it is not ethically sound and your doing more dmg than good by having a system in place where you cant even let another human being debate with another to defend himself and staying in the confides of rationality and not being abusive. if you where to object you would be no different than an organization who punishes and frowns upon a different way of thinking. like cults or religious organizations, Im not going to drink your koolaid though. \r\n\r\nyour system and ethical format comes off completely hypocritical and let me explain why. 5 people go into a game and how they do or act is a result of tons of different variations of possibilities. lets say 4 people do good and one does bad. the whole team suffers. ok now lets say someone is afk well then the people suffer for that, some will report others shrug it off. and there are several other variations but you get the point. so you have 5 people connected through a game that all are intertwined. fate is dealt and they are all stuck together for 30 minutes. do they all depend on each other in that 30 minutes? Yes. do they all have to communicate to some degree to be more successful? No, but it helps towards a greater goal. winning. you have an honor system that is built in place for people who do good at the game, who are kind and show resilience and fervor. BUT - as long as they stay in a bubble that coexists with riots beliefs. to not be able to share my point of view with another party while expressing my self and not doing anything wrong on a mass moral medium that this is normal. its not only normal, its inherent as a more evolved human being tend to do this. its my right to challenge someones actions against me and I did so in a collective ethical manner. \r\n\r\nyour faculty is to strive for peace and to get results. I get that. and to do so over the internet must be a hard task. but if you where to tell me what I said was wrong than I have lost tons of respect for your company.\r\n\r\nfeel free to add me in game if the same thing has happened to you or you just want to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-05-27T03:39:52.103+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"You continually argued instead of playing the game.\n\nDefinitely punishable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-05-27T04:31:46.973+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have the right to stand up for yourself in the sense that you can mute them and report them.\n\nYou do not have the right to stand up for yourself in the sense that you can retaliate to flame with flame.\n\nYou can discuss strategy in chat as long as you don't let it become toxic.

I think that is enabling and flawed. now lets go back to the idea that it was taking away from the game with time and what not. that is the only argument that is relative unless you are in denial of course. and even that argument is walking a line so thin its micro.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-05-27T05:17:16.576+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"In game chat is only for things that are strictly positive (ex: glhf, nice play, good job) or useful (ex: lets do drag, going to base then gank, do you want blue?). I focused on the strategy aspect in my post because I thought that was the primary point you were arguing.\n\nA huge issue with your argument that you should be able to stick up for yourself in a respected manner is twofold.\n\nFirst, you didn't do that. What you did was flame the other person. There is nothing respected or respectful about that. It has a strictly negative impact on the game you are in and no place in the game as a whole.\n\nSecond, there is no need for it. You can mute them so that you don't have to put up with it and then report them. Then they will most likely realize that people don't like what they are saying when they are punished. This method ensures the least negative impact on your current game and is more likely to improve future ones.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vidi Vici","date":"2018-05-27T04:10:39.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"how do you define arguing? how do you define debating? how do you find defending yourself?
