The thread itself is meant to say well done to the voice actors and Riot. The voices feel believable IMO, more so on God-Kind Garen, his judgement for example has a line where he yells &#039;UnBelievers&#039;, you can feel the hate in the voice. Thats my opinion anyway but again, amazing job on the skins Design team.m{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2018-07-24T17:59:17.377+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
