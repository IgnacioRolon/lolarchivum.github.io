That being said, I feel like the \"Rules\" are very vague.  Its your general run of the mill \"Don't be a jerk\" truth be told, I am ok with that but, What falls under \"Don't be a jerk?\"\r\n\r\nI mean, it almost sounds like if it can be taken into negative context its report-able.\r\n\r\nWhat about \"Stupid\" or \"Idiot\".. can some one get reported for these?\r\n\r\nWhat about \"ggez\" or \"are you guys bots\"\r\n\r\nWhat about \"Just surrender all ready\" said the enemy team over all chat.\r\n\r\nI am unsure if these can be counted as abusive chat. they are all quite rude with out a doubt.  I personally think they are antagonistic and are done to create a verbal conflict where none was present before but, that is why I am asking now.  I guess I could just block all forms of communication in game but, communication in a team game is important so, I don't want to do that if I can help it.  The game won't get better if every one did that.  (The \"Danger\" ping doesn't tell me what I am in danger of.. If I know maybe I could win.. but, How do I know they are not just spamming danger because , lets be honest, the pings in this game are obnoxious.. I guess they are that way to grab your attention but, you had my attention after the first one.. after the fifth, I really want to report you but, you really have not done anything wrong so I can't.\r\n\r\n(I am some one who is easily annoyed. I am sure you noticed.)\r\n\r\nWhat about abusive actions?\r\n\r\nlike spam pinging the Question mark when you're all ready dead.. not trying to warn you an enemy is missing just, being condescending.\r\n\r\nor when an enemy throws up a solo thumbs up in view through the fog of war.  Not thanking a team mate for doing anything, Not thanking the jungle for taking an objective, of a long ranger sniper like ash for a stun, just being a jerk through their actions?\r\n\r\nAnother thing I would like to ask about is Why people think there is so much \"inting\" going on.. Look, I am new ok, Yes.. I die a lot.. yes, its my fault I die a lot but, I am not intentionally dying.. Im getting grabbed 1v3.. Rooted, slowed, stunned.. Ect..  I mean, It seems like in some cases its impossible for some one to tell what really happened.  For example, in cases where you're solo with a group of 4 friends.. If you make a mistake, they could simply force you into dying.. I know its not the most reliable thing ever but, some characters can create walls that potentially could be used to block a player in and make it seem like they are \"Inting\" When in reality their team mates could be trolling/ grieving them.  I guess chat logs might help with that.. \r\n\r\nFor me, having dealt with a lot of players saying I am \"Inting\"  Again, Yes I have died a lot. It never was my intention to die like, some one running into the tower 40 times..  Some times you get out skilled, you get trapped/ CC'd and the enemy is so strong the tower won't act as a deturrent.  Some characters have a lot of mobility and damage.. to the point where they will catch you no matter where you try to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about greiving/giving up.. is it report-able to initiate a surrender?  is it report-able to decline a surrender?  I don't quite remember the context but, I was accused of \"Holding the game hostage\" because, I wouldn't surrender.. I mean, maybe it should be my choice if I want to continue playing or not?  If you don't want to play any more then leave and accept your leaver buster.\r\n\r\nHow much time is acceptable to be not in motion.  I was in game and the enemy team was really powerful.. I was looking through the item shop, not moving for maybe 1 minute trying to figure out what I should buy.. a team mate got mad and said I was \"AFK\" .. again, I am New I don't really know what I am doing.. I honestly was looking into the item shop trying to find an item that might help us survive the slaughter.\r\n\r\nWell, I wouldn't even know how to identify a cheater.. I mean, I am to new to know what the characters are capable of on their own, there is so many items I have not seen or heard of.. I heard cheaters are really rare in this game.. I was also told that \"If you don't have the basic knowledge then, the program is useless\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI all ready know things like racism, sexism, homophobia, as well as other bad stuff, Riot has a 0 tolerance for.","replies":[{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2020-02-01T00:26:53.417+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"basically riot isnt going to put it black and white of what you can and cant do. \n\ncuz then people will try to skate the rules while being toxic still. \n\nbasically its like the old golden rule:\n\nif you cant say anything nice dont say anything at all.\n\ndont use hate speech or zero tolerance phrases such as \"kys\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Relaxed Art","date":"2020-02-01T00:27:58.269+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just ask yourself, \"is this a productive statement I'm saying (eg. 4 man baron 1 split)\" or \"am I just calling out a teammates mistakes (eg.

In a recent game, my team reported a player who was being extremely homophobic, including making remarks about how lucky we were that the Nazis went after the Jews instead of the Gays, and using the F slur. No one of the people that reported him got feedback reports that he had been punished, and that’s probably because he isn’t consistently being reported for it or because the phrasing of things slipped through the bots filters. If the report system were run by people instead of algorithms, this kind of behavior could be caught instead of slipping through and going unpunished. Poor behavior that isn’t punished recurs.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2020-02-04T12:11:20.149+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some say that the ZT system punishes upon using ZT phrases 2 or 3 times. \n\nPlus you don't always get the punishment notification.\n\nWhile I agree that there should be no consistency part to ZT phrases, there needs to be a consistency part for the mild toxicity.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"5 Dollar Holler","date":"2020-02-01T16:30:50.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People who play this game are made of the most fragile glass ever.

I'm not gonna say how, because I don't want to give people any ideas, but everything is automated based on certain phrases and quantity of typing. Soft inting is very easy to get away with too, as long as you are using your abilities and don't die too often (while building tear and mobis). I would welcome back something like the tribunal, and maybe with advances in AI we can get some better algos for giving minor punishments for certain infractions. If someone has a REALLY bad game where they go out of control feeding, maybe give them like a 1 hour ranked cooldown or just something to say, hey this isn't really acceptable. Right now the punishment system is shit tho","replies":[]},{"poster":"JohnJeana","date":"2020-02-01T19:30:22.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's very simple bro. Just duo queue. You can not change your attitude at all but if you are duo queued the likelihood of you getting reported enough for punishment drops significantly.

This is what is.\" Because there is soooo many people who try to skate by the rules as it is (their name is an example, but tbh it is quite minor so it isnt really anything to worry about.)\n\nThat said.... let me address your other comments.\n\nYes, anything that is said that seems like it could be a bit negative or rude, is REPORTABLE but it is not exactly PUNISHABLE. There is a major difference between these two words. It could be many games of reportable behavior before it is punishable due to the amount. Pretty much if you spend all game flaming someone else, expect a chat restriction after only a couple games if not just 1. If someone is just going \"f you bott lane\" it is reportable, but would take many games stacked up to actually result in a punishment.... if that makes sense.\n\nThe ggez and etc is more under banter which could be reportable, but chances are, it will not lead to punishment in and of itself unless done in an excessive amount.\n\nPinging excessively is considered harrassment and is reportable.... but just 3 or 4 pings of careful ping generally means \"back up, someone is missing most likely in your area\". If they do it completely randomly (some use it to question skill shots, not exactly harrassment unless excessive) then it is harrassment and can be reported.\n\nEmotes are a very grey area. They are a funny way of tilt attempts pretty much that isnt really tilting for most people or just cute little emotes that are very expressive of how someone is feeling. For example.... angry bee when someone is being aggressive in lane, sad bee if they caught you, the soraka drinking coffee in fire when you live with 1 hp going \"this is fine. Everything is fine.\" Etc. Not really punishable, just for some can be tilting and so just turn them off.\n____\n\nNow we are into the more fun stuff. The stuff revolving around inting vs new players etc.\n\nHonestly, people overuse the word so much that peoplr have muddied and lost the meaning of \"int.\" Int is short for intentional, which is not always the case. Sometimes the people actually are just bad/new. Hell, personally i do not view ANYONE who has not been playing for at least 6 months roughly a few games a day every couple of days a week.... anywheres close to good. The reason why? There is SOOOOOOOOO much stuff to learn, that it is like cramming a years worth of schooling into 1 week otherwise..... it just isnt going to work. I could rattle off the various minigames between champions (like if khazix and rengar are on enemy teams... Senna and Thresh on enemy teams... etc) i could rattle off different mechanics with pretty much every champion in the game etc etc etc etc etc etc etc until i am blue in the face but that does not mean it will be understood, or retained by anyone. Experience is key in this game, and experience comes from doing and seeing primarily.\n\nThe problem is, there is two types of people who flame in lower ranks.\n\nA) The smurfs. Smurfs are generally people who are playing on a lower leveled or newer account. They can be anywhere from challenger smurfs (unlikely) to iron smurfs (also fairly unlikely).... most of them will be between silver to diamond range. They are used to holding people to higher standards, so when someone is not playing near flawlessly they will often very aggressively try to point out every mistake someone makes (or that they think they made). That, or their main account got banned and they are just wanting to flame and rage. There are some nicer smurfs who play not to ruin peoples day or to \"let off steam on a throw away account\" but some that just want to learn a different role or champion in a less stressful environment generally and with people who might not already know how to completely and totally destroy the champion. These people also often are a good resource for newer players to ask questions to. Some of the people you need to take their advice with a grain of salt.... but most of the time if they seem nice and helpful, usually they have a clue what they are talking about.\n\nB) the people who watched a streamer so they know all there is to know about everything. These people will often flame and rage with little to no reason at all every single time they died and will not often have much actual logic. Once you get into league a bit more you will be able to recognize which champions have more Physical damage (reduced by armor, usually scales with Attack damage or AD)... and which ones do mostly Magic Damage (usually scales with ability power or AP)... which Physical damage is reduced by Armor, and Magic damage is reduced by Magic Resist. Why did i go into this? To make sure that we are all on the same page when I say these people will generally be the ones who exclaim very loudly that Malphite (mostly an armor based champion who also can go an AP build as well) should ALWAYS build armor only even when the enemy team is full magic damage. Reason why? Because this site or this person said so. These people you should not listen to as much.\n\nAs for the cheating, it often can be hard to tell, and requires quite a bit of game knowledge to realize what is going on. So honestly, i wouldnt worry much about this. Just keep playing and learning the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nea104","date":"2020-02-01T02:24:56.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my experience, they only punish words and insults that  potentially could bring to legal issues (death threats, racism, and so on).\nThey don't do anything about lack of sportmanship whatsoever, spam pinging included.\n\n\"Inting\" is frequent because the matchmaking is rigged or broken, and in Normals it barely has a meaning, since it matches Diamonds with Irons (because for some reason it doesn't take into account the actual average skill of the players). So, stomps are not the exception, but the standard.\nThis means that sometimes you can end up in the stomping team, of course. Some people find it fun.\nAnd no, they aren't gonna fix this: if you ask, they answer that \"everything is fine, you just can't understand it's perfectly fine\" (Riot's support).\n\nSo... it's up to you to go on or not, knowing how things are. You can check by yourself if they actually are this way, of course ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-01T01:27:56.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, the examples of \"negative context\" chat are indeed reportable. They don't serve any purpose other than annoying people.\n\nI think ping spam is reportable, but I've never heard of it prompting a punishment on its own.\n\nThe word \"inting\" is an example of language dilution. In the old days, if you got caught out or made a bad play or whatever and you died, that was called dying. Simple. If you died on purpose to help the enemy win, that was labeled \"feeding,\" like giving someone food to make them strong. Over time, though, merely dying a lot began to get called \"feeding.\" Doing it on purpose to help the enemy team started to be called \"intentionally feeding.\" Like, giving someone food with the goal of making them strong, _intentionally_. Redundant, but it happened. And now \"inting\" has, in turn, started to be applied to any deaths. Some people split it into \"soft inting,\" which is just kind of not trying very hard, and doing things that you know will probably get you killed; and \"hard inting,\" which is running down the enemy lane without even giving the appearance of correct play. Yet another term that attempts to recapture the original \"feeding\" is \"inting on purpose\" or variations of such. There's also \"literally inting,\" which, as you might have feared, means that your teammate died once under their own tower to a three-man gank. One day, we will find ourselves unable to express the idea that someone is dying in order to help the enemy win.\n\nVoting on surrender calls in either direction is not reportable itself. However, if someone is trying to lose and specifically voting against surrender to keep other players in that hopeless match, that's reportable, although it's mostly the \"trying to lose\" part. I don't even know if a record of individual surrender votes is preserved in any log.\n\nA minute is a bit much to be studying the shop. 10-20 seconds is understandable, especially if you ping that you need more gold to complete an item. If you actually need to learn what items do, I recommend doing that offline (meaning, do it independently rather than while you're with other people who are waiting for your participation). Unfortunately, I can no longer find Riot's official web page on items (it might have been removed with the recent redesign), but the [wiki page](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Item) is good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2020-02-01T01:27:45.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That got really long so I do apologize for not reading it all.
