To be honest If I was to be banned because of the things i said when i got my 14-day ban i would accept it. I try to improve my self every day. The things I said back when i got the 14-day ban where really bad and regret every single day for the things I said. However, the situation with my perma ban is a little diferent. To begin, YES I WAS TOXIC, but not as much as i used to be, i believe my toxicity was in the \"gamer trash talking\" range. The bot lane in my game tilted me when they started sayin \"noob\" this and \"noob\" that because my friend forgot the \"smite\" relic, so i started \"hitting\" back (ik that was a mistake). I realised my mistake though in-game and i stoped, I actually told them to \"chill\" as well, trying to improve the situation. Unfortunately, the bot laners were premade so they both reported me, plus they the enemy jgl reported me because i was \"feeding\", which is not a reason to report someone in my opinion. I know that you probaly wont change your mind but i want to let you know this, i try my best every sinlge day to spread at least some positivity to my team, but some times i slip. I recenlty started playing this game and im actualy in love with it. I wont probably continue playing though (maybe thats the best i guess) because im very sentimental with this acoount, ive invested a lot in this ( idont mean money :P) plus i was going to by my first skin (i was waiting for project pyke cuz i main him). Anyways, thank you for the experience. I just feel that i deserve a second chance, even though i wont get it. To be honest this game is the only thing that gives me joy at this moment of my life in which i had a lot of bad things to cope with, the worse of them being the hero of my life, my father passing away. League of Legends was something refershing, a chance to drift away from all the anxiety that brought my new responsibilities as the new \"head of the family\". It wont be the same starting a second account, to be honest im probably going to abbandon the game cause i was too invested with my initial account. Anyways I am going to insert my in chat game logs:\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nPre-Game\r\n7Shad0w7: mid\r\nIn-Game\r\n7Shad0w7: gj team?\r\n7Shad0w7: are you r%%%%%ed?\r\n7Shad0w7: why gj team?\r\n7Shad0w7: ...\r\n7Shad0w7: cant stand you\r\n7Shad0w7: muted\r\n7Shad0w7: you got rekt\r\n7Shad0w7: k\r\n7Shad0w7: im wining my lane\r\n7Shad0w7: surrender\r\n7Shad0w7: ffs\r\n7Shad0w7: ...\r\n7Shad0w7: bruh\r\n7Shad0w7: youre not tyler 1 ffs\r\n7Shad0w7: wake up\r\n7Shad0w7: sona talking shit\r\n7Shad0w7: THE ENEMY SUPPORT PLAYS BETTER THAN BOTH PF YOU R%%%%%S\r\n7Shad0w7: \"feed\"\r\n7Shad0w7: since when thats a reason fucker\r\n7Shad0w7: nice engrish\r\n7Shad0w7: outplayed\r\n7Shad0w7: now stfu\r\n7Shad0w7: @rengar woosh\r\n7Shad0w7: you missed the joke r%%%%%\r\n7Shad0w7: bo\r\n7Shad0w7: no\r\n7Shad0w7: draven kys\r\n7Shad0w7: sure\r\n7Shad0w7: your mom sucks me dry every fucking day while i play fortnite\r\n7Shad0w7: still\r\n7Shad0w7: that makes your mom a ped\r\n7Shad0w7: %%%%*\r\n7Shad0w7: gj bot\r\n7Shad0w7: oof you called me kid boo hoo\r\n7Shad0w7: im not the toxic here sona\r\n7Shad0w7: tell your friend to chill\r\n7Shad0w7: ...\r\n7Shad0w7: grow up\r\n7Shad0w7: boo hoo\r\n7Shad0w7: welcome to cry.com\r\n7Shad0w7: nah\r\n7Shad0w7: im good\r\n7Shad0w7: nice items btw\r\n7Shad0w7: first time draven?\r\n7Shad0w7: ?\r\n7Shad0w7: doesnt make sense\r\n7Shad0w7: ANSER ME KID\r\n7Shad0w7: first time draven\r\n7Shad0w7: ?\r\n7Shad0w7: you suck then\r\n7Shad0w7: ok\r\n7Shad0w7: ill be the mature one\r\n7Shad0w7: too bad\r\n7Shad0w7: ?\r\n7Shad0w7: L\r\n7Shad0w7: ?\r\n7Shad0w7: dude\r\n7Shad0w7: grow up man\r\n7Shad0w7: im not toxic\r\n7Shad0w7: i just want to play the game\r\n7Shad0w7: why report me\r\n7Shad0w7: draven i tried, sorry man :)\r\n7Shad0w7: gg\r\nPost-Game\r\n7Shad0w7: ggs\r\n\r\n\r\nI know the things I said are still bad and toxic but getting the two biggest in terms of time-length bans is kinda harsh, especialy when i get reported from premade teams (both of my bans came from teammates that were friends/queued together, that means that got 3 reports each game, in the second game only the bot lane reported me).

That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it. If this misbehavior happened in chat (including emotes or ping) and they don't respond positively to a _single, courteous, constructive request to focus on the game_, your best option is to mute that player. Submit a report after the match. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by asking them to keep it down and then notifying library staff and moving to another area.\n\n_Do not respond with misbehavior of your own!_ If you do that, your teammates may mute and report _you_, and those reports would be valid. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it. I'm sure you're familiar with the \"s/he started it\" trope, where two children get into an argument or fight and then try to claim innocence of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didn't instigate it. As any parent, teacher, or other supervisor of children will tell you, that excuse doesn't fly. When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem. Making faces at him or shouting at him has never been a good way to get him to stop, and it makes you just as guilty of that as he.\n\nRiot doesn't care who started it. Someone else's misbehavior does not justify your own.\n\nYour opinion of the rules is of zero relevance. When a cop stops you for going 40 in a 25 zone, you can claim \"I think the limit should be 45 here\" all you want. You're still getting a ticket. If a librarian asks you to keep your voice down while you use the facilities, shouting that libraries should be loud will simply get you escorted out. If you go to a friend's house who insists that you remove your shoes while you're in their home, \"that's a stupid rule and I do what I want\" will lose you a friend. If you are using someone else's services, facilities, equipment, etc., you abide by their rules or you deal with the consequences. If you think the rules should change, that is a completely different conversation (and I wouldn't give a plugged nickel for your chances at convincing Riot to change their rules to allow behavior like yours).\n\nYou got a second chance after your first punishment. You broke the rules, but Riot let you keep playing. It is extremely rare - almost unheard of - for an account with no prior punishments to be instantly permabanned. In every other case, there is at least a second chance, and often a third and fourth chance before an account is permanently banned. Accounts that drop punishment tiers get even more chances than this. Once an account has been permabanned, the time for additional chances is over.","replies":[{"poster":"7Shad0w7","date":"2019-07-26T08:32:48.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your comment was actualy very nice to read, thank you.

For those that do it is their choice on whether or not they spend money on the game again and Riot doesn't force them to do so. That said it seems very counter-intuitive for a permabanned player who already spent money on the game to make a new account and spend even more money on the game.

All have been wrong so far and I don't see that changing anytime soon since the game is still played and enjoyed by loads of people, myself included. I don't agree with everything Riot has done (the removal of Dominion after years of false promises to improve it being a big thing to me) but there are still aspects of the game that I still enjoy, though I understand that not everyone feels that way.\n3) If people truly wanted to play a \"super competitive game\" that's not LoL then they would just find those games to play rather than spend their time constantly complaining about it on LoL related forums.\n4) If you're not open to ever having your mind changed and insist on being closed-minded then why bother having conversations on a public forum with those who try to present arguments and/or facts that go against your belief? Conversations are a two-way street, but if one side refuses to listen to non Yesman answers then there's no point in having the conversation in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-07-25T21:35:40.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> (the removal of Dominion after years of false promises to improve it being a big thing to me)\n\nAllowing TT to survive while Dominion get killed pisses me off even more.  #RankedDomionMode","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-07-25T22:30:03.381+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zPOOPz,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=rgRL8nWk,comment-id=00020000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-07-25T21:35:40.890+0000)\n>\n> Allowing TT to survive while Dominion get killed pisses me off even more.  #RankedDomionMode\n\nI played TT on the side back when Dominion was still in the game.

Hide and Seek is something I also played along with a game of Protect the Queen (each player had a Soraka Bot and whichever teams bot died less won) as Renekton if memory serves and they were pretty fun. As for ranked Dominion queue if memory serves there were allot of requests for one and I think Riot did promise to implement one at some point, but of course they never did.

However, they found that players who got more than a few punishments would never stop misbehaving and receiving punishments. As the goal of the punishment system is to eliminate rule-breaking and Riot has absolutely no interest in coddling toxic players, the system was changed to eliminate this long tail of irredeemable players. Compared to the hundreds or even thousands of typical players who are bothered over dozens or hundreds of matches ruined by a toxic player, that one player's ability to annoy people merits no sympathy or concern. The preferred outcome of punishing a misbehaving player is reform: according to Riot's figures, most players who get one punishment never get another. However, when a player refuses to stop breaking the rules after a few warnings (punishments), they are removed from the game with a permaban because Riot no longer believes them capable of reform.\n\nThe money Riot gains from duplicate purchases on serial permabanned players' accounts pales in comparison to the many typical players driven away by toxic customers.

Unfortunately, it turns out that such players used their few chat opportunities to be toxic, and, when they couldn't be as toxic as they wanted to, they resorted to committing non-chat offenses such as griefing (following someone around and taking their farm, using wall abilities to interfere with their play, etc.) or inting. The purpose of the punishment system is to eliminate rule-breaking, not make it worse. Thus, if a couple chat restrictions don't make any difference in a player's misbehavior, the system ramps up the punishments until the player is permabanned and thus unable to use that account to break any more rules ever again.\n\nRiot used to give toxic players a long series of gradually-increasing suspensions.
