But recently, within the past week, a WHOLE new crop of bots have poured into every game. Kind of disheartening. I&#039;m currently under a 15 min leaver buster penalty for dodging games with bots. Just thought I&#039;d post incase anyone from Riot sees and is able to help in starting another wave of bot bans.\r\n\r\nThanks guys!!","replies":[{"poster":"FDru","date":"2015-10-06T18:45:27.471+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol.. bot bans.\n\nFirst of all, the mode has never been \"relatively bot free\". If anything you're seeing the market being saturated temporarily because of low demand for accounts. But your elo mostly determines how many bots you see. Try starting a new account anytime in the last year or two and you will not play a single game without bots on your team. On _any_ map.","replies":[]},{"poster":"poodoo","date":"2015-10-07T23:24:55.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually the OP is totally right. It's not just elo, the TT had recently been taken over by bots and it is really ruining that map. I really wish there were better systems in place for this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"itsCHANCEyo","date":"2015-10-08T18:16:39.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah! InfinitR- I agree! its definitely not just an elo problem.  I've been playing on TT for almost 2 years, and it seems like it comes in waves. Will be fine for a few months and then all of a sudden, bots in a every game. I know a lot of my friends have jumped ship on 3v3's once the bots enter. Makes me kind of sad! Hopefully riot will be able to figure something out to deal with the IP farming bots. Such a bad player experience for all teams involved! \n\nThanks for the reply!","replies":[]}]}
