Honestly I preferred lucians old play style and not the dash like crazy cd. If Lucian is gonna stay 500 att range atleast allow the guy to break slows with his e again. I mean riot has been saying all of lucians needs a weakness, which is his range but, if your gonna gut his damage too then whats the point. Almost all of my fellow league players just tell others to just play graves. At least his e gives att speed and he has overall better burst.","replies":[{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2015-11-03T18:34:58.279+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you mean all the new ADC items?

Ghostblade especially. I went Infinity Edge > Ghostblade like normal on him and the damage was pretty intense. Essence Reaver works way too well on him and gives you nearly max CDR by itself and another 20% crit. those 3 items alone are so good and with the Last Whisper being a cheaper component item you can afford to just get LasT whisper and finish it later while building your 3 core items. \n\nAlso...his ult buff is not to be understated. whereas before an enemy laner didnt have to respect it until later in the game. now if they get hit by it even rank 1 for a couple seconds it melts them. if they take the full duration they might as well sign their death wish.","replies":[]}]}
