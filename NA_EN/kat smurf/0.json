My first ban was litterally saying \"wow fuck this trash afk\" and the AFK person reported me(because they 'actively' AFK) and I was actually flagged and given a 2 week ban for talking trash about a level 3 urgot sitting in fountain at 22 minutes.

That is not the full chat log. I said much more to Vayne, and am not surprised I was flagged. It's just bullshit still. Doesn't anyone feel the same? the dude litterally had 4,000 vayne mastery too, like what is even the point of having chat if people only actively try to lose the game? also obviously the fight starts with him engaging on my lane poorly into 2 champions alone and dying then flaming me first...zzzz banned.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-10-14T21:23:38.206+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your opinion of the rules is of zero relevance.

You are not a special case. You merit no extra consideration over other players.\n\nIf you misbehave but a teammate or opponent does or says something even worse, you should definitely report them after the match, just as someone reported you for your own misbehavior. Yes, that's certainly possible. Reports are not a limited resource. Any time someone believes that another player violated LoL's behavioral standards, they can report that player. Punishments are similarly not limited: if more than one player in a game merits a punishment, they can both get a punishment. This can happen even if the players in question were antagonizing each other. The IFS doesn't need to weigh the severity of all reported players' actions and then \"award\" the \"winner\" with a punishment; it's not a contest.\n\nThink of it like dealing with a noisy person in a library: ask them to keep it down, and then notify library staff and move to another area if that doesn't work. If you get into a shouting match with them, you're just as likely to be removed, even if you weren't shouting _quite_ as loudly as they were. The goal is a quiet library.\n\nUsually, one transgression by itself wouldn't be enough to bring such a punishment to an otherwise clean account, but the IFS works on an escalating punishment system. Breaking a minor rule, like engaging the team in useless arguments, has a minor punishment: a chat restriction. Breaking that same rule over and over again, however, doesn't prompt an endless series of chat restrictions. The severity of the punishment ramps up over time, because the goal is to eliminate the punished player's willingness to break the game's rules. If two chat restrictions don't stop the useless arguments, the system will increase the punishment to a 14-day suspension and deliver a very clear message that the continued rule-breaking is becoming a serious issue and any further instances will result in a permaban. Again, the point is to put a stop to this misbehavior. If a player is more interested in repeatedly breaking the rules than in maintaining access to their account, they'll lose access to their account.\n\nOf course, it's possible to break major rules, like cheating, threatening people, or using chat for hate speech, and skip punishment tiers so that a clean account ends up with a 14-day suspension or even a permaban.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> **PUNISHMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW A BASIC ESCALATION PATH:**\n> \n> * First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n> * Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n> \n> However, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.\n\nBehaving well sometimes doesn't mean you behave well all the time. In this instance - and possibly others, since the IFS punishes based on severity and consistency, and the reform card doesn't necessarily display logs for every match where you were validly reported - you behaved poorly. Poor behavior is very impactful and thus carries a lot of weight with the IFS. The IFS does forgive the occasional bad day, but if that kind of behavior becomes habitual, you might be greeted with a reform card telling you to rein it in, or with a permaban message if the temporary punishments haven't worked.\n\nYou weren't doing the equivalent of speeding to a hospital. It's not uncommon for police officers to assist people trying to get to a hospital and waive their ticket, because getting to a hospital quickly can be very beneficial and important. What you were doing had no justification whatsoever, no benefit, and no redeeming value. You just flame people all the time. I actually find it pretty distasteful that you think insulting people on the Internet is equivalent to a medical emergency, that you just HAVE to do it.\n\nWell, now you can't do it on this account.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-10-14T21:05:13.722+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you flamed someone, got a final warning, then continued to flame in future games.\n\nWhat is the problem?

The second offence despite also being legitimate is the same issue, there is no context. \n\nIt's completely reasonable for someone in promos to be mad their jungle is a first time vayne that is running it down. And compared to chat logs I've seen from other players I was actually quite reserved. Maybe I just misunderstood what \"Ranked Que\" meant. It must mean first time vayne jg and flame your team, then report them and pray for bans.\n\nI'm not arguing my bans, I'm arguing that the reasoning to ban people like this is flawed because it empowers toxic players that intentionally want to lose over everyone. You can't even tell the person 'fuck you' or else you're just also axed, meanwhile they get to ping and chat and say anything they want because they already know their account is doomed, and you just have to sit there for 15 minutes to wait to FF because they quit mentally in less than 2 minutes. There is issues with this imo, not just my ban.\n\nAlso, this might sound stupid, but small flames here and there have gotten my teammates back on track and focused to win, like pinging a deathtimer or a MIA ping. If all they can focus on is flaming me back, then I know that person was never going to do well anyway and has terrible mental. The difference is I flame them once, and they flame me every time the MIA ping is back off cooldown. \nIt's absurd being compared to that.\n\nThe \"you are more toxic than .006%\" of players message is cute too, when there is racism and just literally the worst chat you could ever imagine in a video, in my games, nearly every single game, and there is legitimately no way that this single game was in the worst of the .006%, I could really post the logs if you want to dispute that, but it's not really arguable to me that is untrue.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-10-14T21:32:31.748+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Riot should let you flame because it somehow will reduce toxicity.

I don't think that telling Vayne Fuck you after flaming me first and feeding is acceptable, but I just also don't think it's comparable to how people are typically banned for toxicity. The point is you don't have to be in the .006% most toxic players to be banned, just coming into contact with them is enough and that is less fair. If you just want to be an obvious hall monitor and argue toxic words should always be banned, more power to you, that's not the point of this thread, the point is there is sometimes situations that are less typical. Like me being banned for flaming an AFK player, is not what the rule was intended to prevent. It's still 'not allowed' but it has less scope of context. If you don't think that's an issue, that's your own opinion, but at least understand my point before endlessly putting words in my mouth and misrepresenting what I said as a different argument.
