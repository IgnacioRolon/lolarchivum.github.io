I really want to work for riot games, but i dont want to be consumed by it so much that all my artwork is just for them and i cant do things i want. I want to work for them, but i also want to some day make my own comic too. I want to be able to play video games and spend time with friends and family. The reason i ask this is because iv been watching this guy on youtube called Kienan Lafferty, and he used to work for riot, but then quit because he felt like he had no time for himself, and now is working for them again but from home. I want to work in a studio, maybe even from home too, but i dont want to feel like i just have no time for my personal stuff. I want to feel like im a valued employee, but i really want to keep a part of me to more personal things. If anyone has experience with working for a big game company please enlighten me about this.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ve1vet","date":"2017-01-04T17:53:34.834+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being an artist is like any other job, you go to work, get your stuff done and head home. It's up to each individual to manage their work/life balance. Some Rioters spend a lot of time in office, and some come in right at 10 and leave at 7 (our usual work hours).","replies":[{"poster":"Acolyte of Steel","date":"2017-01-06T10:41:01.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for popping in!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-01-02T22:01:53.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on what I have heard from Rioters (and a bit of experience myself as I try to stay connected with those in the game industry since that is what I am going into) they seem to have time.  It is still a job, and you are expected to deliver, but that doesn't mean you can't do stuff in your own time.  I know lots of Rioters get together after work to play LoL with each other, not for their job but just as fun.\n\nThat is definitely something to discuss at a job interview though.","replies":[{"poster":"Cheated On Lily","date":"2017-01-02T22:05:51.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know alot of rioters?

Looking at the Rioter comments might help you get an idea of what working at Riot is like.\n\nOnce again though just check out http://www.riotgames.com/careers \nYou can also go to here http://www.riotgames.com/articles/20150817/547/working-riot to learn a bit more about working at Riot.  If you can't find out the info you want there then you can also send in a player support ticket, although you might get a generalized response so i wouldn't try that first.","replies":[{"poster":"Cheated On Lily","date":"2017-01-02T22:25:26.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, ill definitely check those options out now.

I meant that I hear a lot from rioters who post on the boards, reddit, etc.  I _also_ know people who work in the game art industry.  Those people don't necessarily work for Riot, but they have similar jobs and would have similar experiences.\n\nIf you are interested in reading a bit more there is an old thread lying around in which Rioters answered a lot of questions relating to getting a job at Riot and what the experience is like, but I can't find it.  I will check around some more and throw it at you if I find it.","replies":[{"poster":"Cheated On Lily","date":"2017-01-02T22:16:39.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!!
