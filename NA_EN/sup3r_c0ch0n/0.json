The shield is big enough and the point of the shield isn't the shield itself but the fact that Shen suddenly appears and joins the fight. So he bring an extra person to a fight. He can pressure a lane and when someone comes to contest he can join his team in whatever they are doing without the need of teleport. The map pressure is provides is the reason his ult is and will always be good, the shield isn't why you care about it.","replies":[]}]}]}
