Some on special itembuilds, some built it (and still build it) all the time (looking especialy at Kalista and Kog'maw).\nOnly Caitlyn, Jinx, Tristana, Kindred and Xayah came to building Runaans after it got Crit (or the champs were released ;) with some of the listed champions above now buying it maybe more often as before.\nLook how Runaans works on Twitch, Jinx, and Kayle. Look how Runanns works on Ashe, Varus, Kog'maw, Teemo, NOW on Cait and Kennen. And look how it used to work on Cait, Kennen and i believe is still working on tf:\n\nThe 3rst three get from the purchase of this aoeitem just more aoe. Funny how Twitch, maybe with the highest Range, ahs the least benefit of extra Damage on Primary target. Cause the Bolts on the secondary targets don't pierce threw enemies. But Jinx does triple aoedmg, so damaging a primary target gives them aoedmg from the secodnary targets as well and secondary targets get runans damage and the aoe from the main target. I believe on kayle its like it is on Jinx. Point here is: If these 3 fight 1v1 with no other enemy champions or Minions, Runans provides no strenghts compared to the other Zealitems beside that it has higher Movementspeed and higher Attackspeed as Stattiks and Rapidfire. But these 2 give you extra Damage regardless if it is a 1v1 or Teamfight. And Phantomdancer gives you more Attackspeed, more Movementspeed with enemies near you and Dmg Reduc vs the last enemy champion hit, making it still the best 1v1 item. On the other Hand Jinx aoe rockets are slow and cost mana and Kayle and Twitch have limited Time on their natural aoe.\n\nThe secodary Category doesn't have aoe basicattacks and get definetly not increased damage on a Primary Target if there are multiple targets. Still they share their onhitdmg, if it is Ashes Slow and Q Damage, magic onhit damage or increased Headshotdamage. Keep in midn that even if Caitlyn doesn't get stacks anymore threw runans, her headshotdamage is still applied to secodnary targets.\n\nNow the last category was mostly removed cause Runans, the Aoe Damageitem, increased their effectivness on Singletargets heavily too. Caitlyn and Kennen got stacks faster. Faster Stacks meant for Caitlyn more Damage to a primary target, far far more Damage as Jinx can provide with Aoe Rockets. And Kennen could place his Marks much faster, so even in Solotoplane with Minions it was a big diffrence if he was alone or before buying runans or if he had Minions. Both were obnoxius.\nTo compare that, imagine if Ashe would get her q not after 4 Autoattacks but after 2 with Runans (she can appliy the damage to mulitple enemies saiying it again but not get stacks threw them). Or if Fervor would work like that, geting with Runans it triple it faster. If i read it correctly on lolwiki Tf still has this interaction, but hell: He probably still has that cause no one realy plays ad tf cause it sucks.\n\nConclusion: It is fine, if Runans helps Champions to deal more aoedamage and increase champions effectivness a bit. But its not fine that it doubles or triples a champions effectivness. \nTwitchs interaction isn't even that big. You don' rush this item on Twitch always cause stattiks is atm the most effective zealitem and sometimes you not even buy it. But have fun playing Kog'maw, Kalista or Kayle without Runans. Kalsita is special that she depends far more on her e damage as Twitch or Xayah and she cang et a reset after she kilsl one target with it. So its a singletarget damage increase but only after she kills one singletarget before (like tristana passive e).","replies":[{"poster":"Poske","date":"2017-11-01T17:46:17.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Häxel,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nWoO4zKp,comment-id=00010001000000000001,timestamp=2017-10-31T20:38:33.623+0000)\n>\n> wrong: Kalista, Kayle, Teemo, Kennen, Kog&#x27;maw, Tf, Twitch, Ashe and Varus were all Hurricane users.

But it has diversity ); something other classes lack\n\n\nI completly forgot about kalista. Did say she essentially revived that item. I vividly remember people starting to build hurricane once she came out not just on her but testing it on others such kayle\n\nNow I said that 1/3 high elo kayle players are curently using it not kalista (Might be a typo sorry then)\n\nYes Hurricane is core on Kalista\n\n\n\nI just feel like it synergizes the best with Twitch\n-850 Range with ultimate. Jinx has 700, Tristana hits what 669 at level 18 to cait Has 650. So in short Twitch outclasses in range deparment\n- Twitch has AD steroid unlike the champions above. So he is fine getting other 2 stats. Jinx kinda wants first item to be AD. Cait same (Atleast BF)\n- Twitch has Rend like ability (Now granted kalista wins here twitch stacks it faster and likes hurricane for other reasons aswell) Keep in mind kalista autos hurt less because of Rend\n- Spreading irelevant true damage dot is a small bonus\n\n\nOnce Hurricane became a zeal item twitch spiked the most. I imeddieatly assumed he ll be ban tier (Which is what would happen yes) but they even gave him pointless unessesary buffs such as Q resset\n\n\nWho else could spike back then. Kayle didnt care about crit. Kalista builds dont care about crit and crit is better the more crit items you have\n\nKalista builds hurricane lifesteal lastwhisper...\n\n\n\nJinx gained this unhealthy pointless AOE rocket interaction just recently (that interaction is unhealthy for game)\n\nIt also just how naturaly it works.

He melts people since when he ults he shoots 3 ult bolts at a time, which is insanely broken. Yes I understand its an auto attack enhancement, but its busted and stats show. Why is he allowed to shoot 3 PIERCING LONG RANGE autos?\n\nJust imagine if Jinx or Ashe were allowed to shoot 3 rockets or arrows due to it? It isn't far off.\n\nIf his ult didn't work with Hurricane it would be 100% fine.

Twitch gets to use it with his ult which makes him long range, have piercing shots, a burst of AD, and now he can shoot 3 of them?\n\nThat is the issue people mostly have with Twitch. His ult is already powerful as is normally. There really is no reason he should be allowed to have Hurricane work with his ult. He shouldn't be shooting 3 ULT AUTOS every shot.
