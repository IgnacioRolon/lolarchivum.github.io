Because i guarantee its not the problem you think it is. \nThe problem is crit items are extremely cheap, extremely gold efficient, and extremely powerful compared to other items. \n\nEnergized is not a problem. In fact, its what crit SHOULD be reworked into; Energized is much easier to balance and still retains that \"power spike\" playstyle that riot and marksman mains love.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2017-10-04T07:57:07.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to nerf marksmen without reworking crit then you need to increase their combine costs from their current ridiculously low (400-600) to a much more reasonable 900-1100.\n\nIf you want to nerf marksmen by reworking crit then you turn all crit items into energize items.","replies":[]}]}
