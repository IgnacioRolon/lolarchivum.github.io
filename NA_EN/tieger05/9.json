It seems like the perfect time to do it, now that champions like Xin, Urgot, WW and Evelynn all got their reworks. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know about the rest of you, but I used to adore playing Zyra Mid.

Her seed spawning passive could use a tweak(like having that random seed spawning an entire screen away  fixed would be nice), but it helps her set up her area of control. And everything else(but the shape of q) is exactly the same as when she was viable mid. \n\nSo what changed? Her damage and scaling. Buff the ap scalings on her skills(plants especially), and trim down the base of her plants and maybe her e, and she would be heavily incentivized to go mid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Officer Zyra ","date":"2017-10-04T07:45:51.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"she isn't viable mid?\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-10-04T07:47:34.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No she's not anywhere above bronze/silver.\n\nHaving some of the lowest base def/hp gets her punished.","replies":[{"poster":"The Last Ballad","date":"2017-10-04T19:55:21.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.lolking.net/guides/314140\n\nMelyn, widely regarded(and by that I mean I have never heard anyone else even suggested, even on the Zyra Reddit) to be the best Zyra one trick, begs to differ.
