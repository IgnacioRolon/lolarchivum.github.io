Not only does it grant armor and attack speed in the same item, it also grants straight up uncounterable damage reduction.\n\nThe item looks appealing to me. Until i think about something a lot of people are incapable of visualizing what this would be to play against. Not just assassins - bruisers and even tanks (heck, bruisers and tanks will want this MORE than assassins) will pick up this item, and couple it with {{item:3143}}.\n\nI figure these champions would absolutely love this item:\n{{champion:96}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:142}} \n\nI hate to say this, as this is one of the better item concepts i've seen on here. I'd want to use this item myself - and i main top lane tanks. That i would want to use this means everybody else would, too.","replies":[{"poster":"tieger05","date":"2018-03-15T13:07:38.241+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres alaays a way to fix things though.
