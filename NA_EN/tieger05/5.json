CSing is part of the game, but holy crap they have all this talk about wanting interactivity and how trading is exciting, yet the design of the professional scene **(and therefore the game in general)** has defaulted the ADC to be a literal potato that the support carries around in their pocket for 30 minutes. \n\nThe crux of the problem is that since other champions rely on abilities to deal damage, and since bot lane levels slower than the rest of the players on the map, any mage in the bot lane is inherently in a weakened state by being there. People would love to try comps with Karthus or Ziggs bot (that one we've seen) but the limiting factor is the Lvl 2 power spike being prohibitive to some champions because the lvl 2 lasts so much longer in that lane. Combined with farming being difficult with low AD numbers and being pigeon holed into building mana instead of actual stats, it's just an up hill battle. There's no reason to do it, so nobody does.

They *half* reverted.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nHis E was never his problem. His problem remains that his ult plus stealth is extremely difficult to deal with considering the range he receives. Most champions in the game cannot even react in time before Twitch shreds the hell out of their health. After early game ends, he will get at least two autoattacks off before another player can get in range to fight back. With IE, that is a huge fuck load of damage.\n\nIn a teamfight setting, this is even more problematic because Twitch will have peel, especially from Champions like Lulu and Janna.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2018-03-14T21:17:11.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> His E was never his problem.
