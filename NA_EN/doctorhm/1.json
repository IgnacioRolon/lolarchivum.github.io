No email","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, first of all. I would like to say I haven't played on this account for about a week now. I just tried to log in today and there was a permanent suspension. I don't have chat logs, nor have i cheated. I don't have an email on details in my inbox. I'm sure it is the correct email and everything, i just was wondering if I could get an explanation from a rioter. I don't think I even typed in my two most recent games on this account. I'm genuinely confused on how I was banned and am asking for a re send of the details or help from a riot employee. I figure this is the best way to get a hold of one of them because I have sent in multiple tickets on things like this before and never get a response. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-22T03:18:29.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked up on this for you, and it actually looks like there was some rather suspicious activity going on that might have meant his account had been compromised. No worries just yet, be sure to hit up our account team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) whenever you can. After verifying yourself as the creator, they'll be able to go into more details on this.","replies":[]}]}
