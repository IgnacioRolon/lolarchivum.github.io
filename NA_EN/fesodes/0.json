Although it is more than 5 years old(if I remember correctly) it is still pretty new in the sense that i own very little champions and only have 1-2 skin shards coming into 2017.  I only started playing LOL again this year because of my love for LOL esports.  \r\n\r\nJust today I purchased 2 capsule packs(5 capsules +2 hextech chest) and here are some of the duplicates that I got.  \r\n\r\n-2x Star Guardian Janna \r\n-2x Snow Fawn Poppy \r\n\r\nI also got the following epics and legendary which I already own via chests and capsules purchased from the previous 2 events(2017 worlds and 2017 project).\r\n\r\n-Mecha Zero Sion\r\n-Battle Boss Ziggs\r\n-Death Sworn Katarina  \r\n-Lunar Wraith Caitalyn \r\n\r\nOh and did I mention I disenchanted 3 Dragonslayer Braum, 2 Yellow jacket shen,  2 Gladiator Draven, and If I remember correctly 2 Muay Thai Lee Sin, and 2 Traditional Lee Sin.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-13T01:14:23.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hextech crafting is absolutely random, but the capsules you bought have a few special things about them which are causing you to get more dupes than usual. Those Snowdown Capsules are guaranteed to give at least one 1350 RP skin for sure, and the other two have a decent chance of being higher tiered as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Fesodes","date":"2017-12-13T02:45:35.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm wondering if its a good idea to buy more than 1 package deal per event(ie 5x capsules package or 10x orb/chest package).  Could it be that drops are some how related to the time period you buy them?  If that is the case perhaps its best to space out your purchases?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-13T03:31:55.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ehhhhh I don't think the contents are related to anything like what time of day or how close to the start that they were bought.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
