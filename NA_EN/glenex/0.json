Is that common? I mean I'm playing with my friends and they are getting tons of Key Fragments and I'm not.\r\nIs there a drop rate for keys or something that I can look at?\r\nThank you for your help.\r\nGreetings Glenex","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-10T16:28:22.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Glenex, there is indeed a limit on key fragment drops per the [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide.  They will drop around 12 per ~28 days.  The drop rate is reduced each time you receive one, until it resets around 28 days.  I do see you've been getting quite a few, 3 just this week.  Keep it up and they will come!","replies":[]}]}
