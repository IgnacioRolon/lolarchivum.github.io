Is it possible that I can get those refunded lol?  Or am I just screwed cause i don't even think i'll be able to get even some of the medium tier items in the essence shop.  Just feeling a little screwed over. \r\n{{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-26T03:57:15.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're welcome to reach out to our billing team in a ticket to see about that, but I'm not so sure we'll be able to provide refunds simply because new content is being made available.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2017-09-26T02:27:34.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Refund Credits are used to refund items bought from the Shop.
