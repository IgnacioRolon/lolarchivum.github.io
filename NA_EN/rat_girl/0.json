I am a NA summoner and when I went into game for the first time today after the Preseason roll over I noticed that my border and reward Icon were for silver 1 when I&#039;m a gold 3? Also I don&#039;t know if Victorious Sivir has been released yet but I think that ranked rewards don&#039;t fully roll out until the 17th? So I&#039;m not sure whether or not my Sivir skin should have come yet or not. Regardless, I was hoping you guys could help me clear up this issue on my account!","replies":[{"poster":"alasarcher","date":"2015-11-11T19:33:53.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you seriously just coming to boards and opening thread before even looking at board?

The rewards are rolling out in waves and all rewards should be distributed by the end of the day on November 18th. If you don't have the proper rewards yet, hang tight, they're on their way! ^-^\n\nHope this clears things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dukues","date":"2015-11-11T19:35:46.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't played yet, but was just curious if you were playing a normal 5s game? Or perhaps a teams game? I know after last season if I played ranked 3s I would have a silver border because my 3s team was silver. And if it was ranked 5s I would have no border because ranked 5s team was bronze. But norms just matched solo/duo que rank.","replies":[]}]}
