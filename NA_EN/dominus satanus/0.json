The enemy team has team mates that go 0/10 and blame each other just as often as you do.\n\nAlmost everyone feels like their teams are holding them back, myself included. Mathematically though that's impossible. \n\nAnyway long story short unless you're literally the unluckiest person on the planet, You'll reach your actual rank within 100-200 games max. From there you will steadily see your winrate decrease to around 50%. So the best thing you can do to climb if you're become stagnant and are really serious about climbing is practice and try and improve.\n\nSomething important to remember is that winrate does not represent your skill. Just your ability to climb at the elo you're currently at.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-01T00:24:10.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A majority of players find themselves hovering around a 50% win-rate, even the pros!! It's not intentional, it's just the way wins and losses equal out over time. I find the same thing happening to me, and most of the time it's due to my own overconfidence. \n\nI start doing really well, and then in the next match I'm more relaxed coming off of my last win, so my reflexes aren't up to snuff. Focus on making every game count, as if it was the first one of the day, and you might see that win-rate get a bit higher!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dominus Satanus","date":"2017-07-01T00:12:22.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I did vote for the second choice.","replies":[]}]}
