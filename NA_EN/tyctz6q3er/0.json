Equally you have to have a different play style for each type of build. Another point i feel i should add is my build up there is just for an end game-ish build, i build a sight stone ever game on sejuani after machete upgrade. So that helps a lot with my early game tankyness when i go ap.\n\nSo her ap ratios aren't THAT bad considering her ultimate is 80% and permafrost is 50%. These are the two main damage dealers. With the coming changes to PBE Flail is going to be another spell that ramps up with AP very well because it now scales with both on hit % health and aoe damage.\n\nWhen you build full AP you do get chucked  a lot easier than anything else, but you are actually pretty resilient, but not resilient enough to take 4-5 ults. Then you play sejuani full AP you have to play a little more passive and you MUST MUST MUST use your ultimate very effectively/carefully. If you aren't getting 3-4 people in your ultimate you are probably going to do all inning, but you will also very likely get a kill and trade evenly. What actually ends up happening once you get a enough ap is you do your combos and atleast 2-3 members get 80% of their health chunked and run away. In the time they are frozen and cc'd your team has enough to come in and clean up the team fight without you dying.\n\nNothing ever works as planned or according to theory but ap sejuani is the type of champion that does the her combo then walks out and waits for her long cd to come off cooldown before going back in. When you build hybrid or tank you can just sit in there using your w damage and probably a sunfire to do DOT and soak up damage for your team.","replies":[{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2014-12-05T21:58:24.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha, makes sense to me!

You can always max E first. Just depends on what build path you want to go. I do it all the time when I need to carry in solo queue and want to go 10-0-10 out of the jungle. It'll still be fine to do that if the PBE build goes live, but you may want 2-3 points in W first (depending on where the ratios/dmg numbers end up) to help with her early clearing (changes are designed to speed that up!). Okay, here's what I said before edits:\n\nI don't think permafrost is nerfed though!\nNotice how the cool down reduction decreases on PBE with levels now? That means if you're playing well and landing your combos, you can get multiple permafrosts off in fights! Items like {{item:3025}} will help A LOT with this.\n\nLevel 5 Sej gank would look like:\nJump in with Q (maybe {{summoner:4}}  mid Q for style points).\nAuto + W during knockup to apply %HP dmg and start aoe. \nE to slow so your lane can seal the kill.\n\nLevel 18 5v5 Sej fight would look like:\nLand perfect ult.\nQ into squishy champ (not tankline like on live)\nAuto + W tankline.\nRun around making sure W aoe is applied on everyone.\nE to slow.\nQ to peel tankline or gap close to carry.\nAuto + W whoever the focus is.\nE again to slow and clean up fight.\n<Rinse and Repeat>\n\nYou definitely want to be building 40% cdr to make that happen though. This is one reason why her mana pool just got buffed in the PBE notes. More spells, more mana, more problems. Items like {{item:3025}} {{item:3110}}  are fantastic for extra mana.\n\nAnyway, that's my hypothetical two cents. Still need my PBE account to play her.

Can't remember), but ever since the rework the delay between the skill and the second cast activation or the interaction between her skill and her slow aa animation has always felt awkward, the idea of now relying on that skill completely just seems really tiresome.\nThe nerf to her e for ganking also seems to hurt what was one of her best/only ways to come back from the bad starts she's always been prone to. Or are these changes meant to fix her starts?\n\nI dunno, I just know I was super excited about her new skin as of this morning and by the evening I'm wondering if I'll even enjoy playing her as a champ anymore. Hope it's not as awkward as I'm worrying about, but that w's still tripping me up months later. :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tengrichan","date":"2014-12-05T21:51:06.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My only problem was that her clear speed actually slowed down instead speed up in early game with the juggernaut upgrade.\nIt seems only the magus is the only choice to keep up against attack speed junglers who buy devourer and just destroy the jungle.\nAlso you can easily clean the jungle while getting both buffs too without recalling,it is very doable you just have to time her abilities right.\nIt was also my first try with her in the jungle and had to recall only at lvl4.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Robot Beat Rally","date":"2014-12-04T20:25:27.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I don't like how the PBE sej plays.  Not only is she forced into one role / item path, she is also forced to afk farm jungle.  It made her more consistent in the jungle but takes away the fun of playing her.  \n\nI sincerely hope they DO NOT push these changes through.\n\nI do prefer sejuani in lane and play her AP in lane more than jungle, but even in the jungle I just dont like these changes.\n\n\nI would much prefer tacking something onto her passive along the lines of \"if sejuani has a jungling item, she gets xx life regen while her w is proccing jungle camps\" or something like that.  Then they leave other sej builds alone while also giving her a little more sustain in the jungle.   Everyone wins.  barely anything is changed, she's still fun and has two builds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2014-12-04T19:11:45.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're buffing her!

The changes on the PBE are there mainly to improve her clear and tone down her burst a tad, not change her playstyle.
