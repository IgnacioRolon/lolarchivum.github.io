All I do is lose and get like 1 win, never a consecutive win. I know your formula tries to keep it to 50:50 ratio but this is kinda bs and not fun especially since it only happened IMMEDIATELY AFTER I got to my 50 wins over losses. This game is dying for a reason and this doesn't help or add to the \"random\" factor that ARAM prides itself off of.","replies":[{"poster":"Tranney Hunter","date":"2019-09-28T21:21:02.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll even take a close game at this point","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-28T20:12:42.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]}
