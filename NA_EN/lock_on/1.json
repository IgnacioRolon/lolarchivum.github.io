I know this because I often report players for serious offenses. Behavior that makes a DIRECT, incontestable influence on the game for the worse such as ragequitting (player will often admit to it in one way or another before coincidentally leaving game) or otherwise moving around in fountain as an AFK. Yet over 90% of the time, no suitable punishment is inflicted. I can verify this by checking their op.ggs or any other match history website and getting a real-time update. Such players would continue to play games regardless of how severe the offense. I've checked back on those players days, sometimes weeks after and will find they're still playing games almost every day, so no suspension was given out.\r\n\r\nJust now some fuckwit decides to pick his own role in ranked, play badly, then sit on fountain and all/chat enemy team to push in and win. And you're seriously telling me you're not willing to ban him on the spot? Why the fuck is this tolerated? Why can't this behavior be an instant ban on the spot? Why do you insist on waiting for people to ruin MORE games consistently before being willing to punish them? Tribunal is a JOKE and has been for the longest time and you know what, I don't blame the non-believers. I've been suspended for far lesser things while these inbreds can continue to ruin games so long as they play the system correctly and do it infrequently.\r\n\r\nLosing LP over this is bad enough. Knowing that it's highly likely these human pieces of shit are going to get away with it boils my fucking blood. And it's @Riot 's fault entirely for their incompetent policies. And another reason I can't financially support this game. I don't care how many fruity Ezreal skins or edgy battle boss skins you put out. Nothing will get me to support a company that stopped listening to its founding community years ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Shabbos","date":"2019-06-15T22:06:31.497+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you happen to have a video of this match?","replies":[]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-06-12T03:10:18.876+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"You are right.

You could say like a mirror, it reflects how you normally act within the actual matches. Now I will side on how unfair it is getting afkers and feeders, but the issue is also player attitude, toxicity breeds toxicity. Maybe they been on a losing streak and that was the final straw. Maybe some came from constant games where the ally team was afking/feeding and end up becoming them. Some end up doing it because they \"want to teach\" a lesson to those being toxic towards them. And some...well they just like upsetting people and ruining other's day (like to watch the world burn).\n\nShould Riot find a way to fix this? Of course, is being toxic to others going to solve the issue? No. If anything it puts you in the spotlight hence all the negativity towards you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-06-12T03:12:27.422+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"There is no tribunal.\n\nSounds like you are mad because you joined the leaver in ruining the game, and then got justly banned.
