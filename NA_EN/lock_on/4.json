And he'd still die anyways, potentially letting the enemy carry come out *ahead* in health if they have enough sustain.\n\nAlso toplane is typically the one with the tankiest champion. Remove the tanky champion, and the rest of his team will probably just get wiped by a Kat passing out on their keyboard.","replies":[]}]}
