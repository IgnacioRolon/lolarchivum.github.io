I&#039;m just hoping they fix so that it shows his skin in-game on your icon. This is really annoying when playing as Soulhunter Kayn, because before you get your form, your icon (the one on the bar with all your abilities that shows your character&#039;s face) is the same as Soulhunter Kayn&#039;s face. But, after you get your form, it changes to the face of base Rhaast/Shadow Assassin so the colors are just all off.\r\n\r\nAnyways what I&#039;m saying is I hope Rhaast/SA get their own icons :)","replies":[]}
