This has already caused me to dodge the queue 3 times, making me lose lp so it's quite frustrating.\r\n\r\n Then when i try to log in after I have been DC'd I will get an error for trying to log in and the authentication process will take an extremely long time for no obvious reason. Any ideas?

I recommend sticking to custom games for now to troubleshoot until you're certain the issue is resolved.  It sounds like your network is getting blocked from transitioning you over to the game server, or losing sync during champion select.  You'll want to run through the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help fix that up.\n\nI also suggest downloading our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to auto-configure your firewall settings, as that can be culprit here as well.","replies":[]}]}
