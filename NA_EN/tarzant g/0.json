I'm quitting for the benefit of doubt... I've been playing since Season 4 and had been enjoying the game ever since but it seems that every now and then I get the one player on my team that tends to purposely troll then act ignorant about it in all chat to play victim. I did rage, I did flame, I did act toxic. I can admit that. But to be punished for raging at someone who intentionally trolled my game then have the text log based off that one game is complete bull. It's season 9 just turned 2019 and the Report System is still flawed. A billion dollar company and they tell players to mute in-game players like that will solve anything. Update after update bug after bug. I'm not looking for forgiveness, because it's passed that. Just another perma banned case. It seems hopeless to cry about the system.. It is how it is. Been like that ever since and the fact that Dunkeys good bye video is still relevant to this day sup rises me.
