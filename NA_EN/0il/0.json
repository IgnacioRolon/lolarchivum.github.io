How does changing to %s affect Soraka? Would this change make my rune page useless now since her base hp/5 is low? \r\n\r\nI used to run around at like 1.7k hp and like 15/hp a second which was really fun.. Is this no longer possible?  Super confusing maths.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2014-11-20T01:54:27.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This change does not impact runes. Nor does it interact with runes.\nThe base % regen impacts only the regen you gain from the champion itself. In the item shop, you will see what this actually means calculated out before you purchase.","replies":[{"poster":"0il","date":"2014-11-20T02:22:50.456+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome.

If they do you may wanna clarify that a bit.\n\nAlso the PBE had health changes, but on the Patchlog I only see the mana changes?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gamrcub","date":"2014-11-23T03:41:25.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm curious on why Runes were left out of the change? Was the concern that Runes would become more/less effective (thus increasing/decreasing value per IP spent) based on the selected champion?","replies":[]},{"poster":"mcjagger","date":"2014-11-20T06:23:00.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After playing a few games with her, it definitely feels like Soraka's regen is way weaker. I even play with full hp regen yellows and quints. Gonna have to do a different build now.","replies":[]}]}
