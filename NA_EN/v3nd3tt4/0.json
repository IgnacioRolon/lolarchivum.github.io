If I use the arrow keys to move around it falls asleep every ~5 seconds but restarts again. Has this happened to anyone before? I did a quick search and some people had similar problems but I never saw any resolution or how did they fix it.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T02:46:47.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best way to stop that from happening is to probably adjust the sleep settings on your pc itself. League doesn't have any specific settings to cause your pc monitor to go to sleep.","replies":[{"poster":"V3ND3TT4","date":"2017-10-02T04:05:41.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was the first thing I did. I turned off the sleep and monitor turn off entirely. It only happens when I go into spectator mode in the client.","replies":[]}]}]}
