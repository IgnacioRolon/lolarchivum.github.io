After a few minutes the EULA agreement pops up so you would think as simple as in accept and play. I press Accept and then nothing happens, pretty sure it should auto launch afterwards. After a few minutes i press the launch in case i need to do it and then the EULA comes up again a few mins later. \r\n\r\nWHAT do i do????? Please help it wont stop no matter how many times i re-download. Happens after every patch","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-22T21:22:41.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like your network isn't able to establish a connection to the authentication server, so it's stuck at the EULA screen.  Your best to get this fixed up would be through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.  The instructions there should resolve whatever is preventing that communication to the server.  Hopefully, that will get you back in game!","replies":[{"poster":"SpaceAkaliX","date":"2016-09-23T16:44:49.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the advice, i hope it helps.
