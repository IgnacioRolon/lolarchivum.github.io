After I log in it becomes extremely slow and it takes me 2 minutes to even set up a game. Once I start the game I can't even accept the queue because its too slow. Additionally my desktop icons and taskbar constantly flash while the client is running. Every other application on my computer is slowed as well like if I try to get on the internet or something too. This didn't happen prior to this patch. If anyone has a fix, I'd love to know! (game ran smoothly prior to this patch)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-04T22:40:54.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you could be having some driver or file issues causing your game assets to act weirdly.  I recommend going over the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to make sure your drivers are up to date, and everything is setup nicely.  If you also updated Windows 10 recently, disable the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) as it's been causing fps problems for some players.
