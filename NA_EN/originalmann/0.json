I couldn&#039;t do anything and I exiting the client would give me leaverbuster. But after getting kicked out of champ select, I see that I have a 5 minute leaver buster. This is absolutely broken and good thing this was only in intermediate bots.\n\nI was able to play a game earlier today but with this bug I can't, plus I would get punished for something that is not my fault.\nEdit: Went into another game and got the same bug, I can change summoners and runes but thats it. Can't choose champions or even a ward skin or emote.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2018-08-07T17:14:57.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi! \n\nCould you let me know the following;\n\n1.
