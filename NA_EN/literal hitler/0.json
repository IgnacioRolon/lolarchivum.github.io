First up, Lee Sin gets buffs because he hasn't been seen in nearly every game in months. We feel like he can offer so much to impress the mouthbreathers in the crowd, and gave him a leg up to dominate the meta once again. Also, we all know that the last couple of months has been pretty great as far as diversity goes (remember the diversity dirigible? Yeah, we crashed that mother right into the ground this patch) but we just can't have tanky champions all over the place. They tend to put the people watching the game to sleep! So we're getting rid of those unflashy disgraces with broad nerfs to armor and tank itemization. Goodbye entire role, hello lots of people dying in a quarter of a second. Those are the flashy plays we like to see at worlds!\n\nWe also have included the Juggernaut update this patch. For those of you that don't know, our Juggernaut update has two main goals:\n1) Make Garen, Darius, Skarner, and Mordekaiser more unique.\n2) Nerf those four bastards to the point no one will play them.\n\nWe feel like we've mostly succeeded at those goals (although Darius may need more tweaking as he still might see play) so we're pretty confident in releasing these changes now.\n\nFinally, and this is our biggest change, we're effectively ending the PBE. The PBE was put in place to find bugs, test new mechanics, and gather player feedback. Since we at Riot haven't used the PBE for any of those things in a couple years, we decided it wasn't worth the hassle anymore. We would like to thank all the players that have participated in the PBE over the years. Any new champion, map, game, etc. updates will be posted about on Reddit instead. Maybe the actual League forums as well, but only if we can be bothered.\n\nPatrick \"Scarizard\" Scarborough\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"grumpyfrogy","date":"2015-08-05T18:09:22.416+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":1,"body":"i wont be surprised if they didnt even make a 5.16 patch rundown because they dont know how to explain it","replies":[{"poster":"ForPortal","date":"2015-08-05T23:45:13.985+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"The patch notes are just an image macro of a guy shrugging.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Manwalrus","date":"2015-08-05T19:43:36.913+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"We're buffing MR, but it's such a meaningless buff we may as well not have, we're also nerfing the shit out of all the armor items for no reason.
