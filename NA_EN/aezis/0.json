I&#039;ve never been chat restricted, and i&#039;ve never been warned before in the entire time I&#039;ve played League. \r\n\r\nThe game I was banned for, this guy was flaming me and decided to int because our bot lane wasn&#039;t doing so hot. I got tired of him flaming and running it down and this was my chat log.  \r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nAezis: yep\r\nAezis: imma auto him a lot\r\nAezis: this xin\r\nAezis: xin is camping us so we have to just sit under tower\r\nAezis: tru\r\nAezis: jax\r\nAezis: dont bait us\r\nAezis: like that\r\nAezis: didnt u get solo killed like 5 times talon?\r\nAezis: when we got camped\r\nAezis: do you know english?\r\nAezis: learn english buddy\r\nAezis: %%%%%%%%%%% bing bong?\r\nAezis: talon u china\r\nAezis: like china town?\r\nAezis: %%%%%%%%%%% bing bong?\r\nAezis: bing rong ring dong?\r\nAezis: i know chinese too buddy\r\nAezis: ggwp\r\n\r\nWas this inappropriate on my end? Yes. But is this really subject to a 14 day ban with no prior punishment since my account creation in season 2? I wouldn&#039;t think so. How is this guy allowed to flame and int with no punishment, yet I get a 14 day ban for messing around with him? I didn&#039;t call him names, or anything of that nature. I was frustrated at this guy for running it down, and this was my way of venting it. Had I got a chat restriction instead, I would&#039;ve known better in the future and I wouldn&#039;t say anything that&#039;s unhelpful or offensive in the slightest.\r\n\r\nWhat I said was wrong, but this punishment is way over the top.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2017-10-07T23:56:53.870+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, you might think it's banter, but others didn't take it that way.\n\nI think it's ironic you have a Korean icon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stay Close Dear","date":"2017-10-07T23:01:13.199+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"riot's system is extremely sensitive to or anything related to racial harassment and causes you to skip ban tiers.
