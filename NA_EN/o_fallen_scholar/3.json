Sure.

Also due to range he'll never have a shield, so, the damage will always stick.  Yasuo will eventually be down in cs and also gankable, and if he retaliates he'll just die to jungler anyways.  And if his jungler comes Lux'll just snare the jungler and walk away.

Go on and waste your 20 second cd ability to windwall the E heading for cannon minion  while putting yourself out of position for a gank!\n\n\nSo, as of just one to two months ago. It has been changed so that Lucent is blocked. But only if  windwall hits the center of E before it reaches its  destination. If windwall only touches the edge of E before it reaches destination, it will not block it.  You're pretty much never going to block this ability without getting yourself killed. \n\nJust tested myself personally.

I remember when I feared Kassadin/Talon/Le Blanc/Akali. Kassadin, well he just died to nerfs, Le Blanc as well (though I still have to be wary of a highly skilled Le Blanc...), Akali, well I learned that I can, at least, not LOSE by running barrier, Talon is still, well annoying, and I can win/lose that one depending on how on my game I am that day, Yasuo...I had trouble with him at first. I lost a lot, but after enough match ups I stopped losing. Mostly a farm lane now. I can sometimes win... usually not, but I don't lose lane.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-10-17T15:56:26.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"OMG\nHOW\nHOW\nHOW\nHOW THE FUCK\nLMFAOx1000\nok im good now.
