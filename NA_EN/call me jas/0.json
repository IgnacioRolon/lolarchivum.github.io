Whenever I tab out during a game and go back in, the taskbar shows on the bottom. The only temp way I know to make it go away is putting on windows mode then back to full screen. The taskbar comes back everytime I tab out. This doesn't only happen with league but everything that goes full screen. Like twitch, youtube, etc. Does anybody know how to fix this taskbar issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Senorsalsa","date":"2017-05-31T19:03:27.467+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well this post seem to be old however for those who still have the same problem there is a way to solve it.\" Go to Task Manager \"PROCESSES\" scroll down all the way to Windows Explorer right click on it and then on restart. It will solve the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Andoo1234","date":"2017-06-17T11:40:16.119+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks you!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Who Fed lrelia","date":"2017-12-12T14:13:51.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"very much helpful thanks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rimram","date":"2016-11-19T10:30:21.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"try going into task bar and ending any uneeded or unseen programs running. my backup registration just kept on coming back and when i ended it it immediately auto hid\n\nhope this helps","replies":[]},{"poster":"Call Me JAS","date":"2016-10-18T07:06:54.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[{"poster":"Macro111","date":"2017-06-02T08:38:40.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey i know i'm 8 month's late to this... but here's something you can do while in game... if your running windows.\nRestart explorer.exe\n\nsimply alt tab, bring  up task manager, look for explorer.exe in the task list (might have to look at the detailed tab under windows 10)\nThen just File > run new task > explorer.exe\n\n:) works for me anyways.

If you have any apps running like overlays, disable it as that could be a factor.  You could also try running the game in Borderless to see if that might help out!  Check out our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide as well incase there might be a setting or driver problem causing this to occur.  Otherwise, your best bet may be to not alt+tab.

It nearly makes the game unplayable. I do not EVER alt+tab out, my computer can more than handle whatever's running (nothing), and switching between window/borderless/fullscreen doesn't seem to do a damn thing either. Restarted, nothing. Changed screen resolution, nothing. Changed graphics settings, nothing. Changed visual settings on desktop, nothing. Windows 10, please help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jesusisrippin","date":"2016-10-20T16:40:06.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not alt tabbing doesn't fix anything.
