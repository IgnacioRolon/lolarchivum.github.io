OLAF IS TOO POWERFUL IN TFT! \r\n\r\nLet's just layout the facts a moment here:\r\nOlaf's Stats - 70 / 126 / 252 DMG and 0.85 attack speed\r\nHis ability - Olaf gains 100% / 150% / 300% Attack Speed, up to 50% Lifesteal based on missing health, and immunity to Crowd Control for the rest of the combat.\r\nHis elemental synergy - Glacial: 20% / 40% / 60% Chance to stun.\r\nGuinsoo's Rageblade - Attacks grant 5% Attack Speed. Stacks infinitely. Has 20% attack speed to start.\r\n\r\nSo, a 1-star olaf with the rage blade takes a combination of 10 hits and attacks to gain enough mana to use his ability. If he uses only attacks to get there, he will activate it in 8.34 seconds and have 2.25 attack speed with at least 1/5 of his attacks stunning his target for say 1.5 seconds (it is a rough estimate.) At this point there is no CC effect that can stop his attacks, he has already dealt 700 points of DMG, and now heals for up to 35 health PER ATTACK. For comparison, Warmog's armor regenerates 6% max health/second but Olaf is healing for about 10.5% of his max health (79 health) per second at this point. \r\nA 2-star Olaf has 2.68 attack speed and heals 12.5% of his max health (169 health) per second.\r\nA 3-star Olaf has 2.68 attack speed and heals 12.5% of his max health (337 health) per second.\r\nBear in mind this is after less than 9 seconds and at max lifesteal. \r\n\r\nNow remember that with just 1 more Glacial champion on the field he also stuns you once every 5 attacks but with 5 other Glacial champions it goes up to 3 /5 attacks. These attacks start at once every second then quickly rise to over 2 attacks per second.\r\n\r\nSoooooo, I need to deal a minimum of 750 damage to Olaf at 1 star, 1350 damage at 2 stars, and 2700 at 3 stars all in 8 seconds to stop him from recovering his health faster than if he had a Warmog's Armor, with his main targets being stunned for 1.5 seconds every 4.5 to 1.9 seconds, against a champion that becomes immune to crowd control, and without being distracted or killed by the other champions on his team. And all of this does not take into account that he could have his Berserker synergy, more items equipped, and a team mate that can shield, health, and or buff him. \r\n\r\nWOW RIOT! You really didn't think this through.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to change his ability from his ult to his Q. The axe would stop the rageblade effect, remove the life steal, remove the immunity, and still be true to the champion.","replies":[{"poster":"ScarletVixen","date":"2019-12-02T06:33:54.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Olaf is too strong right now, there's no way around that. \n\nThe winning strat is 3 poison, 3 predator, 4 glacier. If you can get these you're set. All you need really is the silver glacier buff to practically permanently cc a unit. Predator guarantees an instant execute if an enemy gets to 25% hp after at attack (meaning a Rek'sai can ult and instantly kill a unit at 80% hp if the attack drains 55% of their hp). Also, Kogmaw and Warwick. For Poison, Mundo, Twitch added and you're golden. \n\nGive Olaf Bloodthirster, and two rageblades if you can get them (the trick seems to be purposely int early to guarantee your pick then hyper stack your comp together to win). If no two rageblades just throw a sword breaker or for Olaf (cuz of Olaf's attack speed, he will permanently disable basic or spells for the one he's attacking). \n\nFixing this is fairly simple. Riot removed the ability to stack Morellonomicon, do the same thing for Rageblade's effect. Make it so a champion can only have one rageblade only. Furthermore, reduce Olaf's bonuses so he gets less attack speed so he has to work to get up in speed with Rageblade (since it's a required item for him). \n\nNext is to fix predator so they aren't such a guaranteed win in your comp. I like the execute, just not how it is right now (Rek'sai is pretty strong for what predator does). Dropping the execute % to 20% would be decent and give a bit more for other comps to compete. \n\nMundo is too damn good. He heals like a truck and is impossible to deal with if you don't execute him quickly. \n\nAlso they really need to fix the audio bugs with Singed and Mundo as well as fixing how teams react to Singed. He seem to completely break the AI and is allowed to freely roam around the map and give no shits cuz the AI has no clue how to fight him. \n\nIdk how Riot could fix Glacier. It's been a permanent problem since they released TFT. Idk if it can be properly fixed to not be so abusive when stacked. Maybe nerf silver tier's strength so you have to get 6 to win with a primarily glacier comp? idk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garen is adopted","date":"2019-11-30T20:59:35.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah he's not to strong, if he couldnt stun and outdamage 9 units at same time then there would be no counter play potential in this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThisName1sDumb","date":"2019-11-30T20:22:38.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Laughs with my {{champion:201}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3083}} (dragon's claw) + 6 warden bonus.

Indeed he's pretty strong... if you turn him into a Light unit paired with 3 other Glacial (for the 4 x Glacial comp) - or if you manage to raise 6 Berserk where the other 5 tank most of the damage (again - either paired with 3 glacial or 2 x ocean). Tho... in the right mix  - so are the other tier 4 units. If not stronger. I mean, Olaf needs around 40+ seconds to do his thing. If you manage to mix a Brand with 5 other mages and 4 Oceans - as a carry - he can clean all the map in less than 20 seconds. Or even if you mix him with 6 Ocean. That's basically Olaf's weakens/counter = a fast death.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuw3yjMhz8I\n\nTill patch 9.23 i used to go for Olaf quite a lot. After the patch - i think i lost almost every game where Olaf was my carry (last game with Olaf carry - i end-up 4th place). So i switched to other comps. I still pick him once in awhile - for the 4 Glacial comp - but i'd rather make Ez carry (proved to be more efficient - mid - late game).","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-30T02:03:08.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Watching a voli with two dcaps outright oneshot a gold olaf is immensely satisfying, at least.","replies":[]}]}
