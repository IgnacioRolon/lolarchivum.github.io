I cant even play normals. Why? When i am in champ select in ranked, my game just froze, it happend like four five times, then i cant select a champ, and i have a too wait to search a match.\r\nThen in every game there are feeders and people that dont gank etc........ Every game, and you ban me cause i flamed, ban people who feed. \r\nFirst fix ur game instead of adding new champs and skins every month.","replies":[]}
