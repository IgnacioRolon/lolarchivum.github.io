I also feel like I'm held up into a few choices in support champions if I truly do want to set up game winning plays. But, even then, if I have players on my team who are dragging the team down, I feel that as a support there is nothing I can do to change the course of the match. I can't shut down fed players, I can't deny them kills well enough, and I can't pull a free kill, at least with the supports I tend to use. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, why should I play support? I like being one, but I don't like losing games.","replies":[]}
