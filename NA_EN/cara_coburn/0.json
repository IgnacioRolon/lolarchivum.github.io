Every time I try to open league the icon pops up for maybe a second then goes away. I&#039;ve looked at all the threads and youtube videos and nothing has helped so far.

The first thing I'd check is that you're launching League from the *Applications Folder*, rather than a shortcut on the dock or on the desktop. If that doesn't end up being the fix, then what's likely happening is that your client is unable to establish a solid connection to our servers. In this case, I'd say our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#section-mac) would be the best course of action, as it goes over the most commonly conflicting network settings that can cause these issues.\n\nLet me know if this helped!","replies":[]},{"poster":"LightPathic","date":"2017-04-27T14:52:58.964+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":5,"body":"I left a comment on another page but long story short go to C drive (located in my documents, my computer), locate riot games folder, then into League of Legends folder, locate the file \"LeagueClient\" and if there's a messed up symbol or says error when you try to double left click on that DELETE IT. Then, a few files down is \"lol.launcher\" click that and it should run to the client, hit the LAUNCH button then it will do it's update.
