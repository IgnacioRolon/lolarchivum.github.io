I mean, if in the respawn animation they come back to the pit, from wherever they were, shouldn't they leave the pit when they \"die\"? I personally think it would look awesome if the Dragon flew away when he \"dies\", and then comes back when he recovers from his injuries (6 min later). Same for Baron. Just like Vilemaw in the Twisted Treeline.\nGreat job on the new rift, tho. its looking marvelous. cant wait to play it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Relorian","date":"2014-06-18T04:20:07.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was watching the VOD with the game commentary and I noticed something during the Baron fight. Baron has a succession of spells that he uses every 3 auto attacks. One of the spells is a projectile that rains down in a line (like Viktor's laser or Rumble's ultimate). I noticed that it seemed to rain down in a random direction away from baron, even while nashor was attacking the tank elsewhere. Wouldn't it be more interesting if the line always stretched towards the champion holding aggro? Then you could use baron to land his skills for your team. You could have the tank rotate baron so he landed attacks over the wall at the enemy jungler awaiting the steal. Or make baron land the last hit on a fleeing champ with low hp. Just a thought.","replies":[{"poster":"LittleFifeKnight","date":"2014-06-18T07:42:43.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me it looked like baron was aiming the spell where it would hit the most champions, not just aiming it in a random direction.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oyaji Oldman","date":"2014-06-17T21:13:40.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will there be more lag when monster camps spawn?","replies":[]}]}
