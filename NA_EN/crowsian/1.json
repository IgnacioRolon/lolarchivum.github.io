New or not you still have a rating. The point of ratings are to tell you where you stand and they still exist in normal draft or ranked draft. It&#039;s just that there is no visible rank in normals.\n\nTo put it simply everyone who supports keeping normal draft alive are players who don&#039;t take league matches seriously, or sucks so much that they are insecure about getting a rating that accurately shows their skill level.\n\nThere is no reason to NOT play ranked.  Practice? The best practice would be against other players who are playing to win, not other players who just want to practice too. Being scared of losing rating in ranked is a pitiful reason for keeping normal draft. More so if the fear is from knowingly having radical picks in champ select.\n\nedit: Answer to all future posts: It's more likely for someone on your team to have mastery 7 on a champion and feed their butts off even when trying their hardest than getting someone on your team who simply plays to lose by picking radically incompetent champion choices in the wrong roles,(such as soraka jungle or twitch support). then again, I haven't experienced bronze or silver for a couple years. SO, hypotethical incompetent picks are not exactly a strong contention point for drafts being merged, because these kind of troll picks happen in ranked regardless of there being an open normal draft queue 24/7.","replies":[{"poster":"Live2LetDie","date":"2016-11-10T01:56:58.951+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

You will get people of all rankings playing all types of things. It is a very lax and \"Do whatever\" environment that is very much different than the meta oriented gameplay we experience in rank. My bf wants to enjoy the game in a meta oriented style without the pressures of letting down his team or being flamed for 20 minutes for his champion choices. This has nothing to do with the division he is placed in during ranked.\n\nI doubt this is hard for you to understand considering the amount of down votes you have accumulated, but not everyone is interested in the competitive scene or in pissing off their team every game.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadlinWalking","date":"2016-11-10T05:24:56.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt this is hard for you to understand considering the amount of down votes you have accumulated, but not everyone is interested in the competitive scene or in pissing off their team every game.\n\n\nheheheh.","replies":[{"poster":"Crowsian","date":"2016-11-11T01:43:28.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do you have to care about being in the lcs to play ranked?

It's silly how players who are trying to keep normal draft always use hypotheticals that only happen to them. It happens to everyone. The possibility of it happening on either team is equal.\n2. Well, looking past your falsely premised rhetoricals, you are assuming first time on a champion always sucks, which is a trademark of low elo. It's very very widely accepted that if you reach the very top of the ladder, you can play any champion decently compared to a low eloer. Building skills on any champion builds skills for other champions too. Positioning, decision making, damage calculations. \n3.\n4. people don't get better by playing against bots 24/7. Why would it stay true for mastering a champion in a \"normal\" game.\n5. If they want to chill, let them drop their rating? I get that league is just a game but if you do not play to win you should be punished accordingly. And of course by punish I mean a simple drop in rating.\n6. I will touch lightly on the many reasons the positives of a merging of essentially merging all draft queues into a single entity.
