This move, along with other components of the [NA Server Roadmap](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/WH8doH76-na-servers-and-the-future), should improve connection quality for the vast majority of NA players. West Coast players will see an uptick in raw ping numbers, but should also see that uptick mitigated by connection improvements in the form of better overall stability and reduced packet loss. Over the next couple days we&rsquo;ll be troubleshooting any emergent routing issues (help us out [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/PZclbVoE-chicago-connection-clinic-megathread)!), followed by a **weekend stress test** (complete with **Party IP**) from August **28 - 30**. More details below.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs of 12:00PM PDT today, the new NA game servers in **Chicago, Illinois** are now fully online and handling all League game traffic in the US and Canada. The new servers have improved ping and overall connection quality for a substantial majority of NA players, and drastically so across much of the eastern US and Canada. West Coast players have seen an uptick in raw ping numbers, but should also see that uptick mitigated by connection improvements in the form of better overall stability and reduced packet loss. Most importantly, this move has brought the **vast majority of NA players under 80 ms ping**.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UHSZvvb.gif\n\n&nbsp;\n# What&rsquo;s next?\n\nGiven the complexity of NA&rsquo;s internet architecture and ISP landscape, we fully expected some wonky local routing issues to crop up in the wake of the server move, and the Roadmap team is already hard at work making sure any wayward connections are taking the most efficient possible paths on our dedicated network to the new game servers.  \n\n&nbsp;\n# Connection Clinic Megathread -- *closed*\n\nMost connections should already be well-aligned, but we&rsquo;d like your help tracking down the ones that aren&rsquo;t! ~~Join us in this **[Chicago Connection Clinic Megathread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/PZclbVoE-chicago-connection-clinic-megathread)** to help us troubleshoot any emergent network pathing problems by testing your connection to Chicago and sending us traceroute info from your machines. ~~ While the Megathread is now closed, if you are still seeing issues, make sure to fill out our [Log Gathering Form](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/tools/network-logs) so we can investigate further!\n\n&nbsp;\n# ISP peering\n\nOn a related note, **ISP peering** will of course play a major role in making sure your connections are getting to Chicago as quickly as possible. One of our key Roadmap efforts over the past year has been signing and maintaining agreements with ISPs across the US and Canada - check out our latest peering list [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204246204-NA-Server-Roadmap#h3) and at the end of this post. A note on some of the more high-profile names missing from that list - we&rsquo;re currently in talks with **Cox**, **AT&T**, and **Verizon**, and expect to have inked and implemented peering deals with all three within the next couple of weeks. \n\n&nbsp;\n# Transfers\n\nNow that the move is complete, we&rsquo;ve enabled free server transfers for players located in the US, US territories, and Canada who are currently playing on other servers - look for a transfer email from us and a free transfer option in the store on your account! Lingering questions about transferring your account? Check out our [Account Transfer FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751924-Account-Transfer-FAQ).\n\n&nbsp;\n# Stress test weekend\n\nWhile we fine-tune any remaining issues over the next couple days, we also want to roll right into a **stress test weekend** from **August 28 - 30** to observe how well the new game servers handle peak traffic. To help make sure we really put the new Chicago infrastructure through its paces, we&rsquo;re enabling **Party IP** over the weekend - check out the details below in case you need a refresher.\n\n**Number of players in party  -->  Bonus IP awarded**\n\n* 2  -->  100% bonus\n\n* 3  -->  150% bonus\n \n* 4  -->  200% bonus\n\n* 5  -->  300% bonus\n\nYou earn rewards win or lose, but only if you&rsquo;re in a party with at least one other player. Make sure to log in, help us test, and earn extra IP from **August 28th, 00:00 PDT** through **August 30th, 23:59 PDT!**\n\n&nbsp;\n# Going forward\n\nWhile the Chicago move completes our outlined milestones for the NA Server Roadmap, there will always be more to do on the service front. ISPs will change, routes will merge, and the landscape may shift, so multiple teams here at Riot will remain dedicated to making sure players experience the best possible connection while playing League.\n\nDrop us a comment below if you have any immediate questions, otherwise we&rsquo;ll see you in the connection-clinic megathread or online throughout this weekend for the Party IP stress test!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n----------\n&nbsp;\n\n#UPDATED PEERING LIST\n\n**Talks in Progress:**\nAT&T\nCox Communications\nVerizon \n\n**Partnered ISPs:**\nAtlas Networks Corporation\nAccelerated Connections\nBell Aliant Regional Communications\nBell Air Internet\nBell Canada (We&#039;ve hit a snag and are currently working through logistics.

I had 18-24 ping (i live right next to portland) and now i'm at 65 ping, which honestly i see 0 difference in. Game still plays and runs smooth as it did just the other day. If this is the ping most west coasters are getting, then this shouldn't be a huge deal. Sacrificing my ping for EU is pretty worth :D\n\nStill good idea ^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bryteness Falls","date":"2015-08-25T19:47:43.738+0000","up_votes":262,"down_votes":34,"body":"So here I am in Alaska, used to have 60 ping, now have 160+ ping.

You have successfully found a way to make a portion of your customer base exceedingly happy, at the expense of others. Congratulations!\n\nOn a serious note...\n\nI have read through a lot of the comments being made, and had to laugh to myself. Riot, you say you want to keep your community together which is why you are keeping with a single source server for North America. Perhaps you think this will all die down in a few weeks or months, and perhaps you really do believe that you can get this Chicago server running and capable of supporting ALL of North America below 100 ping. It is a very optimistic view you are presenting. Reminds me of children talking about what they want to be when they grow up. Only problem is, you are a company who should be going on hard facts and numbers, not on optimism.\n\nYou have also created a more toxic environment then it already was. You have successfully succeeded at pissing off a large portion of your customer base by stealing from them (**_People do have financial investments into League, from the Pro players who have moved across the country, to those who have spent large amounts of money supporting your game, if your decision to move your server had lead to their inability to play the game, then that is theft from them._**), and pleased another portion which is rubbing the situation into the faces of those customer's who are pissed. You have divided the West from the East, pissed off the North (Canada) and the South (Mexico), completely destroyed any chances for Hawaii and Alaska, and given a middle finger to those wonderful players from Japan who had easier connections in NA.\n\nYou also missed a golden opportunity here, which I am very shocked at. If you had decided to split the servers and make a NA-W and NA-E server, you could have made an even bigger sell of your North American Championship series by doubling it, and then really igniting the whole country by having East play West for the big title. It was in your benefit to keep the Portland Oregon server, and establish an Eastern server (Although, honestly, I still would never have recommended Chicago).\n\nMaybe the next time you decide to make a big decision like this where your action will cause hardship to a portion of your player base, you will stop and ask yourself, \"Does this benefit all of my customers, or only some of them?\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"SODA Alvaloz","date":"2015-08-25T21:13:58.643+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":7,"body":"Why not just two na servers?","replies":[]},{"poster":"QiuZou","date":"2015-08-25T19:57:04.793+0000","up_votes":73,"down_votes":28,"body":"300 pings from the west coast... this game is not playable anymore... two servers will be the great solution for these problems...","replies":[]},{"poster":"PierceBlade","date":"2015-08-25T21:46:52.356+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":9,"body":"Vancouver.

So number 1 here Hawaii and Alaska cannot play league anymore so those guys literally have 0 choice to play the game or not. 2 NA is larger than EU and has a larger player base but EU has 2 servers.
