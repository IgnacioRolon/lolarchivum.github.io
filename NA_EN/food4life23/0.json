It&#039;s just that I think it&#039;s a bit unfair that if you&#039;re in bronze/silver, you&#039;re surrounded by these trolls {{champion:48}} and feeders and just horrible players. Now I know a lot of people are going to say that the only reason I want this is because I&#039;m a trash silver player and that I deserve to be in this elo. However, I think that the current way it is doesn&#039;t really reward you for your improvement fairly. I was a really horrible player when I started playing ranked a few seasons ago. And while I&#039;m still not that good of a player, I definitely think I&#039;m a lot better than I was before. But I&#039;m stuck down here because my teammates sometimes drag me down. I&#039;m not putting all the blame on my teammates, I make mistakes too, but I can&#039;t help it if someone goes AFK or trolls around on my team. The way it is now if you&#039;re in a low elo you have to get out by completely carrying your team through your games, and I just don&#039;t think that&#039;s fair at all for support mains or for people who main a lot of champions who fall of late or are really weak early. You can&#039;t control your team&#039;s actions, so it isn&#039;t really your fault that your team didn&#039;t want to group and end while you had a lot of power or just play passively to get through the early game. And you can&#039;t really carry 1 vs 9 as a support player. Riot is trying to encourage more people to play support because the majority of the community does not like to play support and this is making the queue times higher and Autofilling is happening more often. Nobody wants to play support because nobody can carry their entire team as a support player, which is what you have to do to climb. I don&#039;t really know what goes on at higher elo brackets because I&#039;ve never been there, but right now at the lower elo bracket if you want to climb you have to do everything yourself. It really discourages teamwork and communication, which I think is a real shame. If we had something to clear our ranked stats and elo it would make a more accurate determination of rank, especially for support players, and reward improvement more directly. I&#039;m totally sure not sure how the elo system works every season; from what I know they reset your elo to a certain number that was around what you were the last season. Sometimes this can drag people down, and I want to have sort of another chance to play your FIRST 10 promo games again, where those were the games that determined your elo.\r\n\r\nA lot of people are going to bring up how this would be abused. Say some spoiled 12-year-old is stuck in bronze 4 and gets his/her parents to buy like 10 resets for them. I think it would be fair to put a rather higher price on it (20k IP, 30K IP, this can be debated upon) and make it so that you must have at least say 150, or whatever amount of ranked games played before you can purchase it. This way people can&#039;t buy it as soon as they&#039;re placed just because they hate their rank. \r\n\r\nAs for resetting stats, that&#039;s just something I&#039;d like to have the option to do. I don&#039;t like it when people can just go on Lolking or something, search up your name, then judge you and flame you in a game for having a bad KDA or win rate or whatever. Maybe it&#039;s just me, but I think if you&#039;re gonna clear reset your elo might as well reset your past stats too so you can start fresh. Some people might want to keep their stats, so it would be nice if you made them separate or when you purchased it an option window pops up or something.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me your thoughts on this idea!","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-18T22:02:19.318+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why?\n\nAll it will do is make people in high silver/low gold have to deal with twice as much falling trash ruining their games.\nTrash will just fall back to bronze V and stay where it belongs. They ended up there for a reason.\n\nActually _getting better at the game_ seems like a good strategy, instead of asking for a pay2win feature that would not actually help at all. Consider riot's stance on boosting. This would just be officialized boosting.","replies":[{"poster":"Food4Life23","date":"2016-12-18T22:05:19.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If they fall back to bronze 5, then they deserve to be there right? If you make it so that people play 150 games or something, they should improve if they're serious about doing so. This is simply for people who feel like they've really done well but fail to see results because of others. & I'm not sure who people who play their first 10 promo games are matched up with, is it high silver/low gold?\n\nBoosting is having someone else go on your account to play, is it not? This isn't really pay to win because you do still have to win the game yourself. I just think it's not so fair that you have to absolutely 1 vs 9 carry your team to win a game, especially being a support player","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-19T21:03:46.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support {{champion:86}} \n\nReally, bronze is the easiest place to support carry, assuming you are actually any good as support. Most support players in bronze seem to be flaming garbage and just play it so they can pretend nothing is their fault.\n\nBronze players are used to supports being useless, so when they build full AP or AD after their sightstone item, and start hunting down fools, nobody reacts until it is far too late.\nRemember, playing \"meta\" is pretty meaningless in low elo (because nobody understands what it actually means), and the element of surprise far outweights the tiny balances that define competitive meta. If someone starts crying that you are a troll, just ignore them and get on with winning. If your support rages because you stole one CS with a spell or stole a kill, explain how killsteals do not really exist, then ignore them as a backup (really, look up the thoughts of pro players on \"killstealing\" in league).\n\nChampions that are actually midlaners are especially good at carrying from support: {{champion:1}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:99}}\n\n{{item:2301}}{{item:2302}} {{item:2303}}  Get this. You need it. Anyone that says \"wards do not raise damage, ur retard\" needs to uninstall and go play cow clicker. End of season stats always show the massive increase in warding as rank and team size goes up, and in my experience the winning team is almost always the one that warded the most. That means everyone, not just the support.\n\n\"OMG NO MIA REPORT BAD\" is not a valid excuse for getting 1v3 ganked in top lane when you have a trinket that has not been used once all game. Ward and look at the map, it exists for a reason. If you cant see people, they are probably about to kill you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2016-12-18T23:53:37.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude bronze ain't that hard. Here is what you do.\nGo a tank support, no one plays this on bronze so you have 4carries and a tank vs 5 carries. Tank has the advantage.\nGo splitmosnter tank. I usually play leo and go {{item:3117}} {{item:2303}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3512}} {{item:3060}} (optional) and my last item is usully some HP+armor item like {{item:3742}} {{item:3143}} or both if I skin the banner, although i go {{item:3025}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3109}} if I skip the banner (which I normally do).\n\nFrom there just pick a side lane and keep it pushed with those items (if you have banner you can keep both lanes pushed). And then you go and teamfight mid like every bronze player loves. If you win you then proceed to go to the side lane and take the tower or inhi. If you lose your enemies are only left with either a drake or if late enough a baron since all the lanes woudl be pushed or fairly pushed minimizing your risk on the messy teamfights.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2016-12-18T23:48:10.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If such a thing existed it woudl (or should) reset you back to B5 (800 MMR) otherwise everyne who just hit bronze woudl reset so they can go back to 1200 MMr which you have upon starting ranked on a new account.","replies":[{"poster":"Food4Life23","date":"2016-12-19T00:39:16.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I know, but if they made it so that you had to play a certain amount of ranked games it seems reasonable to me.
