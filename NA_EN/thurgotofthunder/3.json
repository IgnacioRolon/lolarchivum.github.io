Both are going to get hit, which reduces the bias towards ranged champions. Of course, melee-ranged point and click CC (Leona Q, as an example) is still biased to ranged champions.\n\n- By contrast, line skill shot based CC is considerably more difficult to dodge as a melee champion compared to a range champion simply in virtue of having less reaction time to sidestep out of the way.\n\nThe best CC is either:\n\n- Ranged point and click. Reserved for less impactful CCs that are short and/or soft, and for ultimates, because they're ultimate.\n\n- Ground-targeted CC. Still interactive for both parties, but doesn't bias ranged champions.\n\n- Instant-travel pass-through line CC. Interactive for both parties, but doesn't bias ranged champions.\n\nI still believe that LOL has a massive over-abundance on CC, with most champions having access to CC (most have hard CC, or it sure feels like it), and have high access to CDR to spam CC. Of most of the CC, most of it biases ranged champions, and makes it much harder for melees.","replies":[{"poster":"ThurgotOfThunder","date":"2018-02-14T04:13:08.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every game I have to play vs a Vayne or Yasuo I dream of having picked Maokai.
