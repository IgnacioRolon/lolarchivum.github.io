I just think the less true damage in the game the better. I had a game as Rammus the other day where I had 900 armor with my Aftershock and D-Ball curl on, and I died in under 2 seconds to a Camille and one other champ, who I forget now. \r\n\r\nNow, I think true damage could be a great counter to a 900 armor Rammus, but Camille landing Q2 once for 1100 true damage, every 3 seconds, feels incredibly bad. Vayne hitting me for 1700 true damage in 6 hits, under 2 seconds, feels so. bad. Fiora pushing R and lunging at me 7 times in a second for 70% of my max hp true damage, while also healing herself, gaining movespeed, and getting cd reduction on her Q, just plain feels bad. Cho one-shotting squishies, while hilarious, felt really bad to be on the receiving end of. Not always, but Garen dropping a 2K true damage nuke on your tank to execute them from half health feels bad.\r\n\r\nEven in a meta dominated by tanks, which I don&#039;t feel we are in right now in most ELOs, true damage feels bad to play against in MOST circumstances, squishy or tank, beefy or glass cannon. And it always will as long as there is damage in the game that cannot be itemized or kitted against. Adding true damage to Ryze Q, I promise, is going to feel bad. It&#039;s a spammable spell that also will now get a %damage amp via true damage. I just can&#039;t help but worry about the precedent some of these reworks and additions are adding. I don&#039;t think leaning into true damage is going to work out in the long run, because true damage, in many cases, simply feels bad to play against. \r\n\r\nAgain, I think true damage can and has been implemented into this game well, but I think it&#039;s a mechanic that should be used sparingly.","replies":[]}
