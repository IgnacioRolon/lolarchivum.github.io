My favourite way to play her was using her e into w combo to burst people and that was fun for me, I never maxed q ever and I never had an issue.  Landing the combo wasn't difficult when you played her often enough, you got the feel for it.  Now with the change in casting it just feels uncomfortable and awkward and in most situations it's just better to cast w into e.

Riot will pay the price once they do this too often. I think they're starting to learn their lesson because Kog'Maw is becoming a Special Snowflake and getting a revert to his old self. I'm not sure if I should feel jealous or glad for Kog'Maw's playerbase lol. \n\nThe problem with Taliyah's changes is that Riot went in circles with her and ended up making her even worse to play than she was on release. After they removed Lockout, she became an unbalanced mess due to her ability to W E. The ability to perform W into E made that setup lose all counterplay and forced those two skills to be nerfed into the ground. E can barely perform it's function as a zone anymore, being nothing more than a tacked on Utility skill that is mainly used for cheap DPS. Of course, performing E into W was affected by this change, effectively making it not optimal to use despite it being her main setup before.\n\nIn my opinion, Riot screwed this one up more than they did with Kog'Maw. Taliyah cannot be balanced in this state because the nature of her E and W require a mechanic like Lockout. It's the simplest solution if Riot doesn't want to code specific situations into her kit such as E does not have falloff if E into W is performed. She'll either be garbage or overpowered. I'd rather stick with garbage at this point until some proper adjustments are made or a revert happens. Riot made her too accessible and that goes against her high skill floor, high skill ceiling design altogether.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2016-09-10T08:16:51.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get where riot is coming from with vector casting, because people thought the lockout wasn't fun and Taliyah was a lot less popular than expected.

Without it, she's becoming an unbalanced mess because of the ability to land W E with ease. Back when she had to use E into W, it had counterplay. Opponents can preempt what she wants to do and simply walk away. This justified her insanely high E damage because it was situational and mostly used for punishing bad positioning and excessive gapclosers. E could've been used as a zone or as a hard to land burst combo. \n\nRiot handled her Vector Casting change VERY poorly. They didn't fine-tune it in the slightest and didn't even go ask Taliyah mains for adjustments. She just needs a unique form of casting altogether. Vector Casting isn't cutting it because doesn't suit her W at all from just using it. You can't even see it's radius lol.

Not everyone has the time to play 24/7 and gain 100 games on one champion in a matter of 2 weeks.

I don't mean to be rude but Azir has been destroyed by his nerf, removing a lot of the utility that I thought made him fun, in exchange for high damage but then they nerfed his damage anyways. Azir is a shell of a champion, Taliyah is still fun and can have high moments. Think of all the different and unique things you can do with her kit. Now think of what you can do with Azir. She has a lot more potential to be fun and a lot more options which is what I feel makes her (and used to make Azir) so unique.\n\nSorry, I am just seriously pissed off at how Riot throws certain champions in the dumpster and forgets about them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unlucky47","date":"2016-09-10T04:36:39.323+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is this thread serious? Taliyahs q can take half of someones health at level 1, and her full combo at level 3 is enough to kill some mid laners. ESPECIALLY if you poke them once or twice with her q. And unlike azir who actually had some difficulty in my mind, a taliyah with rylais has to land one ability and then that person is dead due to either her e, w combo, or her q hitting them afterwards. She is ridiculously strong as one of the mages that build health and ap items. My problem with her is the same problem i have with sol. That she can have upwards of 2,500 health and still instant burst anyone with around 2000. You cant get close enough to her to kill her and if you do, you probably wont do enough damage anyways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2016-09-09T19:00:02.196+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I tried to main Aurelion Sol jungle before the W colldown nerf and the ult nerf, and now there's massive nerfs on the PBE too.
