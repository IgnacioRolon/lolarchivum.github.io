I feel like I have to scream it out sometimes that League is a team game, and that playing a match isn't suppose to be a 1v9. If there is one major issue I find in the league community, its that \"carry syndrome\" is rampant, and endorsed by a large portion of the leaguetubers you see out there. People keep getting told that to win they have to \"Get off their asses and carry their teams\", and it makes them inherently mistrustful of their teammates sometimes even before the match begins.

But on the other hand, if you are the only one who knows communication, composition, and win conditions; how do you win? What i mean is that if your team doesnt know how to play and throw what are you suposed to do? If they don't try to do baron when we win a fight, if someone keeps dying for going alone with no vision (turning the game a 4vs5), what do you do? I strated to think than the only option is to be able to make the job of the player that is stupid, to be worth more than 1 player. And probably its true: I am main adc and the only champ i play archiving a 60% winrate or higher is vayne. It means that i have to play an hipercarry who can fight more than 1 enemy at once at late game if you are decent at it, that can do objectives alone because you dont care if an enemy comes because you know you will be able to kill him alone (not the opposite like it happens with regular adc). Vayne is not team reliant in teamfights also because of evasion power. The only weak point is when you team fails so hard in early or when the enemy botlane (ex: cait and sona) doesnt let you farm and your support is not able to do anything at it and the jungler doesnt care, what is more, other lanes are feedeing so you dont even have the chance to recover during midgame.\n\nThats my ranked experience, lats season i got gold just playing vayne (sometimes jinx or lucian), now i tried to play more adc and at first i thought i was bad and i keeped practising in normals, i became good at them but when i started again with rankeds i losed too many games if i didnt play with friends or with vayne.

I remember having to try to explain to my teammates that Ashe didn't have to go mid, that pros and high level players were taking AD Carries bot lane. The idea of having one player dedicated to protecting the carry *literally did not exist in low level play back then*. Hell, climbing to Level 30 I was unable to practice jungling and was constantly flamed whenever I tried because the game never explained that you can start in the jungle (and because no one had any concept of playing a 2v1 lane if the enemy didn't bother jungling). Support and Jungle basically require immense game knowledge *just to exist as player roles* because there is nothing in the game that explains them. \n\n**Of course we have no faith in our teammates' abilities: The only way to succeed is to have mechanics/tactics/knowledge that does not exist anywhere in-game and we have no way of knowing if they actually have them or not. *Most of the people playing this game aren't even invested enough to use the Boards, Reddit, or third party sites that might explain these concepts - tons of people that play don't even read the patch notes.     ***\n\nNot too long ago I had a Ranked game where our Bot lane carry was a Lucian main...and the other team picked Lucian first. He ended up playing Sivir, who was one of the only other Marksmen he had, and he admitted that he basically never played her before.

Many people have mentioned a lack of faith and that is a big part of it. Many low elo players (bronze to mid gold IMO) share the mindset of a \"solo-carry\" , cloud out their team mates as they view them as a hindrance and  live in a \"god complex\" (they're perfect, always right and belong in diamond). They view themselves as the teams only hope, hogging cs and kill gold from other lanes in a sad effort to fulfil their fantasy of \"solo-carrying\" their way out of bronze/silver. \nWhen everything falls to crap, say they start dropping off while the enemy scales or their team mates are too far behind due to gold deprivation, they generally don't go \"oops I hogged all the gold MB\". \nMore so \"OMFG YOU'RE ALL SO SHIT!
