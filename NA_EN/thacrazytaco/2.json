So imagine 17-20 year old \"kids\" and how they would take the fans laughing at them etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-09-09T22:31:07.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion it is because LCK is seen as the best region in the world. It is a goal for each region to win its respective region but the bigger goal is trying to win worlds.\n\nFor the LCK since people consider them the best region already, winning that region is a real accomplishment but for the other regions it really feels like just a step in the journey.\n\nCould be wrong but that's my theory.","replies":[]}]}
