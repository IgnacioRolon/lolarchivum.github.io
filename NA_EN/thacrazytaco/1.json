You don't have to though) that would be great.  I'd just like to ask why the AA reset was removed from her passive despite it being important to her fluidity in combat (in my opinion).

Burst is not supposed to be a big strength of her, so the fact that she would get Ex2, Q1, Q2, passive + Auto more or less for free when she got the jump on someone was deemed an inappropriate strength.  Of all the things in that combo, the one that made the least sense was the random AA reset after the ranged basic attack, so we removed it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-10-08T00:50:35.712+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the detailed answer SmashGizmo.
