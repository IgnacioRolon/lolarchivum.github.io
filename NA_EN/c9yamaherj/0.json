So if i am in google chrome and i exit it and click on league when i hear the game start the window opens but as soon as it opens my whole computer shuts off and goes into sleep mode and i have to turn off the power supply and turn in back on.

When switching between processes, there would be a rather large spike in power usage, which could trip out a failing power supply. I would suggest getting it tested or temporarily swapping in a known good one to see if you notice any change.\n\nLet me know if you notice any changes.","replies":[]}]}
