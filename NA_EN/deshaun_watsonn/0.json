I assumed that it did because I guess you could technically classify it as a reward.","replies":[{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2018-10-23T06:35:12.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.riftherald.com/platform/amp/lol-gameplay/2018/10/13/17972896/season-8-2018-ranked-end-date-rewards\n\nHonor has a seperate reward system.","replies":[{"poster":"Baby Ghoul","date":"2018-10-23T06:43:29.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wolfcub2000,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=bUzfpRum,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2018-10-23T06:35:12.628+0000)\n>\n> https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.riftherald.com/platform/amp/lol-gameplay/2018/10/13/17972896/season-8-2018-ranked-end-date-rewards\n> \n> Honor has a seperate reward system.\n\nI'm aware of that. What they were asking is not if they'll have access to honor rewards or the victorious skin. They are asking if it is possible to get the gold border if they gets gold, but are still below honor level 2.\n\nAs you know, you need to be honor level 2 to get ranked rewards this season.","replies":[{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2018-10-23T07:15:10.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011781068-League-of-Legends-2018-Season-Rewards-Update\n\nHmm... it didnt say anything about honor in the first one, but you are right.

OP I'd say it is safe to assume that you need honor level 2 to get a gold border as well. However I believe your profile badge isn't effected by the honor system.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-10-23T05:16:47.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"November is when the season end.\nSo you'll unlikely get it.
