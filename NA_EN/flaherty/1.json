I logged in and submitted the ticket, and I was able to see my history of tickets sent over the last few years. When I checked today I logged in to the same place but the only tickets that were present were two that I submitted and were completed more than a year ago. Nothing about the unanswered ticket nor any of the one I had answered from 2017.","replies":[]}]}]}
