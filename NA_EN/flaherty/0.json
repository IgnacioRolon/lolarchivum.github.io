Seems to be about every other time you use it if you keep spamming it.","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-06-17T02:16:12.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That seems to be because of how most of the voiceovers work. If there's already a line playing it won't start a new one. Dark Star Thresh's voice has a filter over it, along with extra sound effects, so a line may actually still be playing for a second or two after you think it's finished, which would stop him from beginning the next line.\n\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/uapodl802ce.png","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-17T18:59:50.349+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct! (It's processed, btw, not filtered! We hand process each line. ^-^) But yeah, if the line isn't finished (due to the trail off at the end of the line, the next one won't play, but the animation will!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flaherty","date":"2016-06-17T02:17:43.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm you might be right, his animation is pretty long and I didn't listen closely to see if there was any other sounds after the laugh","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-06-17T15:10:05.902+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly it's a bit of a pet peeve of mine. Particularly when one of your movement quotes goes off just before you stop and use a joke or taunt, so you don't get to hear the emote while everyone else does. I'd really like it if emotes overrode any currently playing voice lines.\n\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/uapodl802ce.png","replies":[{"poster":"Flaherty","date":"2016-06-17T16:29:15.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried it again in game and it's definitely not playing anything else.  His laugh has other sounds that go with it, like how he looks into his black hole lantern and sees a picture, that play but the actual laugh itself does not.","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-06-17T16:34:52.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose there's a way to check. Voiceover videos on youtube are all the audio files stitched together one after the other, so you could try finding his laugh in the voiceover and see how much of a pause there is between one version of the laugh and the next.\n\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/uapodl802ce.png","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kac√©ytron","date":"2016-06-18T12:53:05.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"please fix the bug on dark star thresh. which is FoWi just bought RP just to buy him and now he's unavailable {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} {{champion:412}}","replies":[{"poster":"Pabro","date":"2016-06-18T22:03:06.801+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Firstly, we are so sorry we had to disable him.
