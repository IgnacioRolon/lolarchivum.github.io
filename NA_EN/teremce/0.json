In fact, it is the random problem of connecting to the server that lead to the problem. This adversely affects my gaming experience as I have to wait a much longer time before every game starts and I lost my LP for no reason. I hope this problem could be solved ASAP as it really affects my experience on this game. ty.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-05T17:03:40.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having issues reaching the game server.
