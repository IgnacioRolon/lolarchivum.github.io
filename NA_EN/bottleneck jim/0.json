If they really wanted to keep him imprisoned, he would be skinny to the point that they would have to update the chains to fit his skinny malnourished limbs. As far as I have seen, this is guy is chained to the floor for however long, and yet he looks as if he goes to the gym all day every day. Does his magical power also include immunity to atrophy, and a constant, but steady increase to strength? I get it that he might just be flexing within his restraints to gain something, but that brings me back to, \"just feed him less\" and he won't be able to get swole anymore.

Although, as a guard or maybe the commander, I'm pretty sure someone would have the idea to restrict his diet a bit more in order to prevent any kind of resistance he might offer, even if its just physical strength. Also, the rat corpses that litter the floors would also be a bit of an indicator. If he was a Noxian prisoner, he would be skin and bones or dead.\nEveryone in this game is ridiculously proportioned, and it makes sense for sales or character appeal. In terms of making the character believable, they really screwed the pooch on that one. It just doesn't make any sense that a maximum security, always tied down, prisoner should appear to have that much physical strength.\nI guess the moral of the story is that if you're going to be a criminal, you should do it in Demacia- Land of Justice and Stupidity. Sylas probably has amazing health and dental coverage as well as a 401K through the Demacian prison system.","replies":[{"poster":"StormBladeMaster","date":"2019-09-11T18:23:42.706+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it's mostly character appeal...
