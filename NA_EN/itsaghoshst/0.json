Starting with something like Youmuus or BC, then going to Duskblade then Infinity Edge is something I'd try likely.\n\nFor Runes, surprisingly we see a lot of MFs go Sorcery as their main tree to get Arcane Comet or Aery like Jhin does and the flat Bonus to AD. Getting Sorc runes that help you sustain, build damage over time, and stay mobile are suggested. For your second path, definitely go Precision since it helps ADCs the most, and take Triumph and Coup de Grace to help you win and stay alive in those low health duels in lane.\n\nHope this helps out! Can't say I'm the best ADC but I think trying these suggestion could help. And like Kokua said, focus on staying alive and poking your enemy out of lane more than actually risking your life to secure a kill.\n{{sticker:sg-kiko}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-03T10:21:11.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are lots of good ways to build. Some people like to go straight for a BF sword, while others want more attack speed or lethality. The key to staying on top of your levels is to not die, to try and make your opponent back by poking them until they aren't comfortable staying, and to known when you should go back. If you want a more in depth guide, you can find several of them online. Not all games are the same, so you shouldn't rely on a single build for every game.","replies":[]}]}
