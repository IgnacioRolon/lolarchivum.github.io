I wish to exchange art for RP!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bard is my favorite League of Legends character. Everything about Bard is awesome and I would like to purchase a Chroma for my favorite cosmic friend! However, I'm saving RP for another cosmic acquaintance, Soraka.\n\nUnfortunately, if I purchase a Bard Chroma for 290 RP, I'll be short 5 RP for the Star Guardian Soraka skin! I have come to you, great Rioters, to exchange art for RP so that I may acquire both! For your viewing pleasure, I have created a pixel Bard! I hope that you will love Bard as much as I do!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6BO0VsT.png","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-31T16:27:36.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow, this is some of the best pixel art I've seen.
