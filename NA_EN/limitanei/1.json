Yes, its a lategame buff. However, its 1st and 2nd upgrade are weaker, in both AP and Mana.

I can also tell you don't play Viktor enough because you want to max and augment Deathray first because you want to clear the wave immediately or improve your poke. The Speed boost is only good if you know the Jungler is camping.\n\nYou know what's awesome? {{champion:61}} 's Shockwave. It can force five people into an optimal position for an AoE Combo (and does great damage) Viktor's Gravity Field augment is literally a Mini Orianna Ultimate on like, a 15-12 second cooldown. Seriously, pair that with {{champion:54}} or {{champion:157}} and your Gravity Field can and **will** win teamfights. In comparison, your Power Transfer augment just forgives some positioning mistakes.\n\nThis change to his kit was literally the best thing about his **entire rework** because it put his Teamfights on Steroids (even if the change to remove slow after stun made {{item:3116}} less niche on him)\n\nAnd Viktor isn't meant to be an Early-Game Champion. **He was never meant to be an Early game Champion even Pre-Rework.** You don't pick Viktor to dumpster a lane, you pick him because he has very powerful teamfights and strong poke with his Deathray and you pick him to scale hard.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2015-08-14T07:31:58.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I do max and augment Deathray first. And the Q speed boost is great on Viktor, since it ensures his next autoattack. Most players dont let you stand there and Q-Auto you. If they see the Q coming, they run away - its hard to get the auto off without the necessary upgrade unless you run movespeed quints and 21-0-9 masteries. \n\nNow, why do i think Viktor is an early game champion? Base damages and ratios. WIth one upgraded Hex core on his E, he unlocks possibly the strongest, non-ult ability in the game - 500 +140% AP ratio. Thats HUGE - thats stronger than most champion's ults. However, he has relatively short range on his abilities aside from his E, he is immobile, he is squishy, and he has no real peel. Yes, his W can peel, but most assassins can kill him before getting stunned. \n\nNow, for the reason why i dont get the W upgrade (and consequently, the ult upgrade) until later in the game - a stuns a stun. If an enemy is stunned within your W, does it matter if they move 200 units to the center? They are already stunned in a fairly small area. Also his gravity field has a 1.5 second delay on a 700 range ability. Ori ult is .75 with a 1225 leash range. Youre comparing two abilities, one which is practically twice as easy to hit  - almost twice the range and hits twice as fast. \n\ni think youre playing viktor wrong if you decide to get a perfect hex core as your first major purchase. I dont do it. The pros dont do it. I dont think you should do it. The main reason is damage. For 1000 gold to get the tier 3 upgrade, you get 20+1AP per level, along with 200 mana. Now, with a mana pool of 300 from 2 upgrades, you shouldnt need the extra 200 mana (especially if you start dorans). Lets say you fully upgrade your hex core at level 10 - a reasonable endeavor to gain 3000 gold. That means you get +30 AP at level 10 from your hex core. For less gold, you can get a Fiendish Codex for the same AP and 10% CDR. For less gold, you can get a Blasting Wand for +10 AP And for a little bit more gold, you can get a NLR. I agree - it improved his super lategame teamfighting. But it only improved after level 15 and after 3 upgrades. Look at some pros play viktor in solo queue. \n1. [Bjergsen](http://www.probuilds.net/guide/NA/1917079600/49159160) - 22 minutes, no third upgrade. Bought Ludens and Void staff though.\n2. [Febivan](http://www.probuilds.net/guide/EUW/2248050276/30657524) - 35 minutes, upgraded 3x after Morello, Zhonyas, and Void.\n3. [Fox](http://www.probuilds.net/guide/EUW/2247819971/27550839) - 40 miuntes, upgraded 3x after Morello, Deathcap, and Void\n\nMost of these guys upgraded 2x immediately, or bought only a Morello (or parts of a morello) before getting 2 upgrades. However, they dont finish the full 3x upgardes until they get 2-3 AP items first. Now, unless youre telling me you know more about Viktor than some of the people who play him on the LCS stage, youre absolutely wrong about Viktor.","replies":[{"poster":"Crowe Stalker","date":"2015-08-14T10:34:04.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ChaoticPinecone,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=g801KVgv,comment-id=000a00000000,timestamp=2015-08-14T07:31:58.824+0000)\n>\n> Now, for the reason why i dont get the W upgrade (and consequently, the ult upgrade) until later in the game - a stuns a stun.

That was how he was designed with his (crappy) passive back then, and that's how he'll be when this patch goes live. You want an easy Early game with some mobility? Get {{champion:103}} or {{champion:101}}. Viktor is designed to scale and this 'nerf' is going to have him play the way he was before the rework.\n\n140% AP Scaling on Deathray? No, you really **don't** understand how Viktor works. Augmenting his Deathray causes an explosion, but if the laser hit the first time the explosion only hits for 40%. That's roughly 100% AP scaling (Technically 98% but who cares? We'll round up.) Short Range is for idiots who try to not use Smart Cast. Let me tell you a little tip I learned way back when: Keep Smartcast on, **BUT HOLD THE GOD DAMN BUTTON.** I see so many people who don't understand this, I see so many instruction videos and so many 'guides' but I seem to be literally the only Viktor player alive that knows you can aim a Vector with Smartcast on by holding down the button.\n\nAnd for the love of god, stop thinking of Gravity Field as 'a Stun' or I'm going to start calling Power Transfer a Phage Proc because that's essentially what you are getting: **A burst of movement speed.** And yes, it does matter if you move all of your enemies into the center of your Gravity Field because that center allows your team to better aim their ultimates and abilities. I've seen cases where entire teams were pulled to the center and what was already bad positioning turned into an absolute perfect 5 man Deathray/Chaos Storm/Whatever the hell my allies were doing wombo combo and that can happen before you get full build. You are so focused on Trading Early on with your Power Transfer (What are you even doing with your Deathray if you think you need to use Power Transfer to trade?) that you miss Viktor's true testing grounds: Teamfights.\n\nIn Closing:\n\nWith Power Transfer Upgraded\n{{champion:157}} : \"I really wish I had a secondary Knock-up.\"\n{{champion:112}} : _Incoherent whistling_\n\nWith Gravity Field Upgraded\n{{champion:112}} : _3 Man Gravity Field_\n{{champion:113}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:25}} : **LET'S GET READY TO WOMBOOOOOOO!**","replies":[{"poster":"Razgriz990","date":"2015-08-15T20:54:09.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His E not smartcasted like 98% of people suggest is simply a lack of physics comprehension..
