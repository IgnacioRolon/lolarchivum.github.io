After the transfer process was completed (after the Client gave me a sign to log out to sign in in the NA server), I made an attempt to log in to NA server, but it responds by saying &quot; invalid combination of Username and password&quot;. I gave about an hour to re-attempt logging in, but the result remained the same. I tried to log back in on EUW server, for I thought the transfer process takes long time, but the server responded by saying &quot;this account has been transferred to another region, please log in on corresponding server.&quot; This indicates that my account was transferred to NA server, yet It seems to be that the account does not exist in NA server as I could tell from the failure log in attempt in NA server. My account has gone missing. I have been realizing lately that services Riot offers are no longer acceptable. Right before this error occurred, I was facing an issue of not being able to purchase RP. Whenever I tried to make a purchase, the server responded &quot;you have reached the maximum transaction, come back 24 hours later&quot; despite it was my very first transaction in 2 month. This still remains unresolved. \r\nSo the account disappearance error is no surprise to me, but if anybody has helpful suggestion, please do comment below","replies":[{"poster":"Beamon Bot","date":"2016-08-05T09:22:32.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I was going through google search result in a pursuit of solution for my problem (since Riot isn't capable of), I encountered this my very own board, and said [deleted] After transferring an account from EUW server to NA server, account goes missing.

Sometimes it can take some time for a transfer to finish processing.  Looking into this, it looks like you're currently in a ranked team so a transfer wouldn't be possible.
