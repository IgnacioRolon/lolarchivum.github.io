I experience significant difficulty with seeing Tham Kench&#039;s grey health in juxtaposition to his regular health, even on colorblind mode. I know that you all have more than enough on your plates in terms of game updates and cool changes to enhance player experience, but I saw mention of a hot fix for the professional players who were also colorblind and having trouble with seeing Tham Kench&#039;s grey health. So, I was wondering if those changes were on a list for upcoming adaptations on the live version of the game. Either way, have a nice day and thank you for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-08-08T07:40:28.301+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":2,"body":"I believe we've got that change on the PBE at the moment, tentatively scheduled to go out in 5.16. If you manage to get a chance to look at PBE Tahm footage (or have PBE access) would be great to hear how much the change does or doesn't help you out. We've run the changes past a couple of colorblind Rioters, more feedback's always useful though, especially on something like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Crowe Stalker","date":"2015-08-08T08:03:27.547+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to say I think this kind of change is really good for the game, even if it doesn't affect many people and doesn't instill a direct 'buff' or 'nerf' Thank you and the development team for adding this in :)","replies":[{"poster":"Gunslinger744","date":"2015-08-08T15:00:56.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, I'm not colorblind but I like colorblind settings on LoL because it makes the game a lot more... what's the word. Easy to look at, I guess? I have trouble noticing Tahm's grey health too, hope the PBE change will fix it a little.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2015-08-08T13:29:56.535+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am not colorblind but I can barely see the grey health difference as it is","replies":[{"poster":"schlagsahne","date":"2015-08-08T17:38:53.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sam, they should make it abit brighter in my opinion ðŸ˜¥","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BatchBustsMeta","date":"2015-08-08T15:39:38.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i feel like making it brighter or changing the color might just be good for everyone because it is kind of hard to see at a glance.","replies":[]}]}
