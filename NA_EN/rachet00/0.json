Sorry to use up your valued time but the rioter i was contacting after i explained my situation said they could not unban my account because what the hacker said was too toxic. i would not want to argue with the rioter because of what happened, but that really doesnt make sense to me. The hacker was too toxic for the account for me not be unbanned and not because of a lack of proof, can you shed some light on this for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-16T01:37:52.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the slow reply, but I wanted to make sure you saw my response so I'll be re-posting it here for you as well!\n\n\"If you've already spoken with an agent in your ticket, their decision is going to be the final one essentially, but I can still provide a bit of context for you. The agent looked over your account, and there weren't any signs of it being hacked or compromised in any way. Without any evidence of someone hacking your account, it's difficult to say that the ban was issued because of the actions of someone else.\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rachet00","date":"2017-08-15T14:43:27.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes i have but i dont believe they will be able to see the signs of the hack given it was a third party program that gave them access to my computer :(. that is quite unfortunate if the ban cant be lifted oh well.","replies":[]}]}]}
