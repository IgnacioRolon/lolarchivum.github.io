The icons appear next to others summoners' names on friend lists, in chat rooms, in custom games, or in arranged teams. With the collection always expanding, everyone can find a special avatar.","url":"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Summoner_icon?file=ProfileIcon1624.png","image":"https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/b/bc/ProfileIcon0000.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/64?cb=20170517190707"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When was this icon available in the store? I play every day (as well as check the store for icons/skins/etc) and bought my region tier 1 icon as well as tier 2 icons for multiple regions &amp; The Karma skin/ward skin bundle. Also I purchased Xayah &amp; Rakan with both skins day 1. I'm fairly certain that I played 2 games as one of them with both of them in it during the time frame to get the blazing feathers icon but have not received it. Is it possible that you could add a section in the game client that shows limited availability icons and the requirements for getting them?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-28T22:44:12.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe that icon you linked me to was the MSI 2017 Winner's Icon awarded to the region who had the most summoners equipping their MSI icons. Check out [**this page**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/msi-2017-hits-rift) and scroll down to the section below Conqueror Karma called \"MSI 2017 FANDOM CONTEST\" for all the details.\n\nI've also double checked your account for the Rakan and Xayah Icons. It doesn't look like you played 2 games as Rakan or Xayah with the other champion also on your team during the event, which is why you didn't get the blazing feathers icon.","replies":[]}]}
