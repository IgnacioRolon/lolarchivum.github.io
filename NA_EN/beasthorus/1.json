He asks for a LANE SWAP with the Mid laner in his team who is supposedly in Gold Elo for Mid lane, and then destroy the enemy laner because his diamond skills are way above a gold player????\r\n**\r\n\r\nI know the devs addressed that &quot;they will receive the lp for whichever role they played rather than the role they queued for. But the problem still stands: If he&#039;s a smurf, he will dumpster the fk out of the enemy laner, so he will most likely get the wins anyway and the other team gets a terrible experience. \r\n\r\nplease hold your horses with your changes riot, and give me an explanation now!

That tech will be used to calculate LP gains and minimize the impact of role swapping.

They said \"If you played in a easier game, you'll gain less lp and lose more lp if you lose\". The problem is THEY WON'T LOSE, WHAT IF they just want to fuck some newer players up and gain lp anyways? They can't punish a player for winning! Unless the loss of lp is minimal for the opposing team, this is still quite a flaw imo.","replies":[]}]}]}
