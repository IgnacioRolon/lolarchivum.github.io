This champion is probably the most unique and fun champion that Riot has ever released and I really hope she can return to the meta again. I have some proposed buffs to her kit:\r\n\r\nMartial Poise (passive)\r\nREMOVE THE 90% AD SCALING DEBUFF. Why does it even exist?? The champion does no damage after 30 minutes, and I kid you not, a 0/10/0 Caitlyn can do more dmg than a 10/0 Kalista at this point. When I play her I literally feel like SHE'S THROWING PAPER AIRPLANES IN A TEAMFIGHT. So please, remove this stupid thing, it is outdated and ultimately why this champion is so weak (IMO)\r\n\r\nREMOVE THE \"MISSES TARGET IF VISION LOST\" debuff as well. Again, this shouldn't be a thing anymore, right? What's the big deal if Kalista gets an extra AA in if literally every champion in the game can't miss their autos if their target is lost? \r\n\r\nI would also propose reverting the ability where Kalista gains bonus lunge distance while lunging backwards, but I do think this might make the champion too slippery for anyone to kill in a TF. But due to the recent addition of champions like Sylas and Qiyana, who are known to stick onto targets very well, I think this change may not be overpowered.\r\n\r\n\r\nRend (E)\r\n\r\nI don't have too many complaints with this ability, but can we possibly revert the mana refund? No, not the \"killing one target refunds all mana\" but the old \"Killing two targets and refunds all mana\" change. This makes lane trading with Kalista a bit more difficult for new players, and it helps Kalista with staying in the lane a bit longer. When I play her I tend to run out of mana pretty quickly, because the ability simply doesn't refund enough mana. \r\n\r\n\r\nSentinel (W)\r\n\r\nAgain, this ability barely does anything now. What happened to the oathsworn buffs? I don't mind if it grants attack damage or attack speed, but can we please add that back in? This champion is supposed to stomp lane, but now any champion with a decent support can do better with dominating lane than her...\r\n\r\n\r\nI won't propose any more buffs because I don't want her to be overbuffed, just to be nerfed to the ground once again. The main problem with this champion is she doesn't deal enough damage. I'm a pretty bad ADC player and Kalista is the only champion in bot lane that I like, and I have to play fights extremely well in order to do some damage, but even then, any other ADC can just sit there, auto-attack and still somehow outdamage my output. I propose Kalista to be buffed in her laning phase, while also keeping her relevant in the late game teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"Get Ogre Here","date":"2019-08-20T05:17:22.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that for her to be even viable in casual play, she'd be completely broken pick/ban in competitive.

As much as it's annoying that some champions get the Ryze treatment (aka, nerfed out of viability because of pro play), it's kind of necessary.\n\n######wouldn't need to happen nearly as much if CertainlyT didn't exist but whatever","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-20T05:50:09.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BeastHorus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ks50eUTA,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-08-20T05:36:59.664+0000)\n>\n> I know, but they're favouring the minority. there's only around 300 pro players against almost 2 million players per server.\n\nCorrect, but the post you're replying to is also correct. If a self-proclaimed \"pretty bad ADC player\" could succeed with her, then good ADC players would do far too well. There are several champs in this boat, like Ryze and Azir.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2019-08-20T07:51:15.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her rend needs to not be able to stack while her E is on cooldown and her E needs a longer cooldown if its gonna be fully resetable.
