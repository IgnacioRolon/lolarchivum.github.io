I&#039;m pretty confident we can.&quot;\r\n\r\nWell, it&#039;s been 6 months, and with the release of this Star Guardian story, you have not only failed to exceed my expectations, but you slam dunked them in the trash. Obviously I&#039;m crushed that this story is pushing Lux/Ez so hard, and I feel like I was purposefully baited into being excited for something that was never going to happen. Because of that I have several questions for you: \r\n \r\n1.  Why get my hopes up at all if this was what it was leading up to?\r\n\r\n2.  Why not just be honest and realistic about it and tell me to expect nothing?\r\n \r\n3.  Why even bother going out of your way to retcon the Lux/Ez thing and even make a voice line about it if you were just going to start pushing it again?What on earth was the point of all that?? There was a really good opportunity here and it was squandered to repeat the exact same thing that you had just retconned. \r\n\r\nThis sucks, dude. It feels like you lied to my face. This makes me feel really, really bad and I don&#039;t understand why you did that. Please help me make sense of it.

All that voiceline is was a reference to their possible relationship in the previous canon, which makes no sense in the retconned Runeterra.

Even if you subscribe to the notion gay just means male. You're wrong first of all. But beyond that there is indisputably a catch all term for both: homosexual. You could remove G and L and replace them with H. \n\nThen there's the Q, queer is already a catch-all term for a non-cisgendered individual. It covers everything else on the list except arguably transsexual and intersexual. And there are many who thinks it covers those two as well. \n\nThat's just adding unnecessary complexity. I hate that. Efficiency in all things. Now I'm not saying we should just call everyone queers.

But let's be honest - this leaves an incedrible bad aftertaste in my mouth. I'm aro/ace myself and I would love to get some representation. I get a incredible well-written psychopathic serial killer with some OCD. Should I see this as a good representation for a LGBTIAQ champion?\nYou literally saying me, that the first champion you literally see as non-straight is an insane serial killer. Right...\n\nThat doesn't mean every LGBTIAQ champion has to be a good person. Make LGBTIAQ villains, I would love to read about them, but honest it can't be we have one (1) LGBTIAQ champion and he is literally a crazy serial killer. I mean, if we had 5 LGBTIAQ champion and one of them is Jhin, that would be great.\nBut for now? It feels like a slap in my face.\n\nNot considere, you guys never confirmed him as aro/ace.

I'm sure that in some of the regions that LoL is played in it is either illegal or would make the game have a higher rating, maybe putting taxes on it or something? I've noticed Riot likes to tiptoe around the issue and I'm sure it's not because they don't want to make an openly gay/bi/whatever character, they probably just can't or they'll get hit with a sledgehammer in international sales. Take Taric for example. It was super obvious old Taric was probably gay, the new reworked Taric is probably closer to a Pansexual but Riot is always like \"well, you know, wink wink but we can neither confirm nor deny these allegations.\" So that's probably why.\n\nJust keep in mind that Lux and Ezreal has been a fan favorite ship since basically the beginning of this game and while they haven't met in the current lore, Riot saw a window to kind of make that ship come true in an unofficial sense so they did.

But I really think op is overreacting quite a bit.\n\nI dont think their sexual orientation matters in any way. Its only something you should know if itis important for the development of the character. You can easily have gay situations appear on straight characters too. It's a way to embellish writing, adding deeper content that most people can relate to. Being gay you likely can relate to Lux since she had to hide from everyone out of fear. That doesnt mean Lux has to be gay or bisexual or anything. It's there to add depth to the story, and it makes it so people who have been in that situation connect emotionally with the character.\n\nI dont want to see a gay, lesbian, transgender, etc champion unless those characteristics made them who they are. Otherwise it's just like knowing someone's exact age or shoe size. Why do you care?\n(Though i do care a bit about age. I always guessed Lux was like 25, Garen 30, Katarina 28, Cass 26, Talon 25, etc - but those are in my head. You want to headcannon lesbian Lux? Go for it)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zero Drive","date":"2017-09-11T13:31:02.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer my relationships ambiguous. Riot does not create nearly enough lore for me to invest in a relationship, I'd starve (metaphorically, im a fat freak) waiting to see some development. You may be overeacting though.. I mean I was annoyed with this game when I started playing and realized there wasn't a single black champion. I was also pissed when they finally released said champion.. and he used hand guns. Also is a feelsbadman when the closest I have to a gay character is a super flamboyant Taric who reinforces stereotypes I cannot relate to. All in all though, I think Riot is at their best when they allude to the possibility of champions having feelings for one another instead of outright shipping them. I'll use my favorite champ, Ekko, as an example.\n\nEkko has hintings of some kind of romantic relationship with:\n {{champion:40}} - Just uses a pretty standard conversation breaker that many men use to start a convo. Also alludes to her weather abilities.\n {{champion:222}}- Claims he had a crush until she started talking to the guns. May just be acknowledging her mental instability as opposed to any actual feelings.\n {{champion:163}}- Lastly Taliyah is the one with the romantic reference, asking if the earth moved for Ekko too. Self explanatory but also alluding to her earth bending abilities.\n\nNone of these are concrete, but they're enough to get a few lore invested people to ship their favorites. All remain valid so long as riot keeps their mouth shut. That's what they should do in my opinion. Also Ekko x Arjuna cause it makes more sense than the above three. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2017-09-07T05:31:38.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Dolljointed, i remember your post and i also left a comment there if you remember.\n\nas Jaredan mentioned and i said in another topic and some others mentioned it here, this is starguardian lux , i like to see this as an alternative universe lux which is not the same as prime runeterra lux.\n\nto be honest i cant care much about THIS lux because its not the one i come to know and like, i love lux becuase of who she is in her main lore which most of her traits are missing in SG story, first thing that cross my mind everytime i think of lux is that she is a normal girl with an extraordinary gift and she lives in a place that she cant be herself. when i look at SG lux she is flying around shooting colorful lights so openly...thats not my lux...no way!\n\nshe can be in relationship with anyone in an alternative universe but keep in mind that everything is still as it was for Prime lux in her original lore :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Muranodo","date":"2017-09-07T01:22:52.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As The Djinn and MidnightOil24 described, there's also different and broader orientations that are feasible---Riot's lore is hardly definitive and often just a blip in an individual character's timeline. And the particular story-line released only hinted at the general relationship specifics. All-in-all, it's hard to discern anything even about SG Lux's orientation besides that she's flattered by the attention. Which, if you consider, her motivations throughout the story about bringing everyone together by her feeling of necessity---it's not surprising she would respond to the first non-dismissive attention she got after feeling like she was failing as a leader.\n\nIf you consider this on a theoretical timeline, there's certainly plenty of narrative space for Riot to do what they want. But as with any lore development, it's a team effort with different opinions and they are always looking for the best fit. Regardless, I've certainly seen enough anime where emotional attachments and twists pop-up in unexpected ways off veiled comments such as those that could have been said by Jinx or Ahri, for instance, to Lux.","replies":[]},{"poster":"łnśane","date":"2017-09-07T12:03:47.857+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Since when did league become tumblr?","replies":[]},{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2017-09-07T00:37:36.890+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"I do wish that they weren't pushing it in this skin line (or at all, really).
