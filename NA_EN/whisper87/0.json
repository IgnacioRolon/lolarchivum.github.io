Heimer, Velkoz, Lux, Xerath, Karma, etc.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else think it&#039;s an issue that I can think of 5 really viable AP poke champs but only 1 really reliable AD one in Ez and one super risky one in Varus?\r\n\r\nAlso why do AP poke champs get to scale like crazy (looking at you Vel, Lux, Zoe) but AD poke champs are all super mid game focused?","replies":[]}
