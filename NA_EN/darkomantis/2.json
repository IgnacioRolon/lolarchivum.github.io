If Kha&#039;zix could apply On-hits or even just a buff to the listed three I have then Riot could effectively help him without giving him an extreme buff. Take a stroll with me:\r\n\r\nhttp://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/a/a2/Hunter&#039;s_Machete_item.png/revision/latest?cb=20130710102448\r\n\r\nAs a single-target jungler, {{champion:121}}  weaves a series of basic attacks and Taste Their Fear(Q) in a way that you think he was more or less auto-attacking. But Kha&#039;zix can&#039;t apply the machete passive since it only works on basic attacks. If {{champion:121}}  were able to apply the passive with Taste Their Fear(Q) or Riot buffing machete to apply bonus damage on both single target spells and basic attacks, then {{champion:121}}  could see a facelift. On live, he suffers from a brutal struggle against Gromp with Hunter&#039;s Tailsmen, an item that doesn&#039;t do much for the bug. With him applying Machete&#039;s passive on Q, you could see a healthier jungle start against Gromp and even a different jungle path like Blue &gt; Gromp &gt; Wolves with better results. \r\n\r\nhttp://lol.esportspedia.com/w/images/f/fe/Ancient_KrugSquare.png\r\n\r\nAt the moment, {{champion:121}} can only be able to use Gromp&#039;s Toadstool at the moment but the buff is weak for a champion who is again, a single-target jungler. Currently, if other single-target junglers die once or twice early game, then can still clear their jungle fast by using Heavy hands buff and insanely cheap 300g Dagger. This doesn&#039;t work the same for Kha&#039;zix. If he dies early game, then it results in not enough gold to buy damage to clear the jungle fast enough and get back to ganking in comparison to other junglers. If the Heavy hands buff could be applied to Kha&#039;zix&#039;s Taste Their Fear(Q) then this could be a huge buff to his clear time after the initial clear. This would mean that Kha&#039;zix even when behind can still have good clear without needing an early kill to boost his clear time. \r\n\r\nhttp://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/a/a9/Fervor_of_Battle_mastery_2016.png/revision/latest?cb=20151103094518\r\n\r\nThis is where it gets a bit more controversial but continue with me. While Kha&#039;zix does have a good mastery page for him in the Cunning tree, this isn&#039;t ideal for Kha&#039;zix, especially after the penetration nerf. Also, Kha&#039;zix doesn&#039;t use Thunderlords as effectively since it deals magic damage. Sure it can help his damage rotation, but it isn&#039;t as effective as there is more access to MR now through Scimitar, Locket, and Spirit Visage. \r\n\r\nIn a ideal state Kha&#039;zix should favor the Ferocity tree with Battering Blow&#039;s 7% armor penetration, but at the moment he can&#039;t use neither of the possible Keystones in the tree. Fervor of battle remains a distant island for him and Deathfire Touch is more or less useless for an AD champion. But the thing is that Riot can bring that island to Kha&#039;zix. If Kha&#039;zix could apply the Fervor of Battle stacks then this could potentially give Kha&#039;zix the power he needs to deal with both isolated and unisolated opponents since he lost power in the transition from S5 into S6 with removal of Brutalizer and Last Whisper. By possibly being able to use Fervor and Battering Blows, Kha&#039;zix can return to being able to deal with tankier targets who are stacking more armor and **high health**.  \r\n\r\nTL;DR: If Kha&#039;zix can apply on-hits then Kha&#039;zix could have better clear times and better mid/late-game against tankier champions and competent teams through Machete, Gift of Heavy hands, and Fervor of Battle.","replies":[{"poster":"AChanceOfReign","date":"2016-01-28T14:58:20.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to see this for the next Kha update, maybe 6.4 or 6.5 patch Riot??","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-01-28T07:13:36.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems like a very reasonable change, and much needed considering how jungle items changed in the new season.
