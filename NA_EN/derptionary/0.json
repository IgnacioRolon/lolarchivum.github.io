His Scream when he dances, his joke, and laugh instead of playing his audio for the emote there is just silence. I&#039;m not sure if it is exclusive to the Reaper Karthus Chroma or the skin in general, however in testing the same emotes on the Statue of Karthus skin they all seem to be working fine.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-05T00:10:09.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is affecting all skins and the base.
