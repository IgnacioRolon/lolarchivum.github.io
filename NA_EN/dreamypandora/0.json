And kept nerfing the damage for functioning as a champ who&#x27;s late relied directly on their early.\n\nThey have a high skill cap for a great many reasons. Mechanically, they're fairly simple. But they have Lamb's Respite, which is a very tricky spell to utilize properly, and they also have to know when and where and how to get around the jungle. There's a lot of macro level decision making required to play them effectively.\n\nThe problem with their late relying on their early is that if you give them an unbeatable early (which they had before) then they WILL hit their late game, full power, and be an early game monster, and you just flat out lose. Kindred mains and people in Plat+ were banning them like 80% of the time because of how ridiculously broken they were before all the nerfs. You could out-duel anyone at level 3.\n\nI know. I used to regularly 1v3 at level 5.","replies":[{"poster":"AninLegions777","date":"2016-11-27T03:03:19.915+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"1v3? Must have been vs bad players.

I can kill and carry just fine it's a bit hard ultra late game, but early and mid game they are really good. The CD on their ult is a bit much, but other than that they are fine. The only thing that bothers me is their W will not attack enemies that go into a bush or behind a bush where their is no vision even when you has lamb run through the bush and continue attacking wolf just sits there and does nothing.
