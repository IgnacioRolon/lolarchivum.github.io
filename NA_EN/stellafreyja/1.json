I really like the skins, but \"Program Lissandra/Soraka\" just sound... off to me. It doesn't sound like a proper title or description the way other skin names do and it lacks a certain gravitas. I feel like these skins deserve a cooler-sounding name, something like \"Mainframe Lissandra\" or \"Matrix Soraka.\"\n\nJust my two cents.

For example in wall-e we have the evil robot Auto and the good robot Eve both are machine that capable of thinking for themselves so their action reflect what they want.

I think the narrower, shorter version from the splash looks better because it makes her look more shapely and makes the bottom half look more like a metal dress.\n\n2) The splash has smaller shoulders and a upper arm \"plates,\" emphasizing the fact that the arms are foating/disconnected. That's super badass, and it's almost completely lost visually in the game version.\n\n3) The game version is a completely different color than the splash, which is mostly teal with the eggshell stripe down the front of the breastplate.\n\n4) The off-white robot plates look amorphous and undefined, especially on her arms. The gray shading is not dark enough to communicate depth, perspective, or that the plates are jointed. It looks like mottled blobs. This also applies to the triangle pyramid at her feet.\n\n5) Insert my recurrent complaint about X skin being beautiful and wonderful, then processed through a filter to desaturate the colors and desharpen all the lines/details before being shipped. \n\nSpectacular concept, but it looks unfinished, especially next to the brilliant splash. The animations and spell effects look awesome, but the triangle base looks even worse in-game. It's just such a shame that all this time is spent creating wonderful art that gets pushed out looking so muddy and diluted.","replies":[]}]}
