The fact that the Tribute passive gets turned off if you kill a minion helps a little bit, but you&#039;ll be generating gold at nearly double the rate as your lane opponent (if they don&#039;t also have it) while  also farming gives such an unfair advantage. AP Mid and Top laners will be making far more gold than any other lanes. And I distinctly remember reading something that Riot doesn&#039;t want their support items to be strong to avoid laners abusing them. Well look what you just did Riot.\n\nEdit: Hell, they can still abuse the Tribute passive. You let the wave reset or freeze and then when the enemy laner comes back you pop a few AAs and collect some extra gold and go back to farming.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-07-09T04:34:09.935+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't have any planned changes to the gold generation rates on the support items.
