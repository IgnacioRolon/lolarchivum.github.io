That's really it in a nutshell (there are lots of special cases and things to consider while making one though!)\n\nAnything else you are wondering about? \n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"DwarvenGiant","date":"2016-03-25T10:13:15.618+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, just a reminder, your name isn't 'Red', so you might wanna take care of that or something. :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"√ùones","date":"2016-03-25T19:20:52.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess you can make some process with an animating tool called \"puppet tool\".
