There isn't even a button when I tried to buy those champion. It say I don't have enough \"Not enough RP/IP\" but on the top right corner it say I have more than enough IP to buy the champion. So far it is only allowing me to buy champion under 1350 IP. This happen when I went to store recently, It been happening for a few days now.","replies":[{"poster":"Zhizhou Li","date":"2017-01-11T00:58:18.295+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still buging in 2017!","replies":[{"poster":"Devalic","date":"2017-01-11T01:51:16.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't realized it was still bugging.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-06T03:44:35.751+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're currently tracking this issue to see what specifically is causing it, but in the meantime, I'd like you to try a workaround that has been resolving this for some players. Close League out entirely, then launch League, but don't log in. You can access the *Legacy Client* from the login screen, as shown below:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/215576628/Launch-Legacy-Client.jpg\n\nHit that button, then log in and head to the store. Try making a purchase from this client and let me know if this worked and if it made any changes in your ability to make purchases in the Beta Client as well.","replies":[{"poster":"CloneAndBoxes","date":"2016-12-06T04:06:28.570+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used this trick and it worked.

To people commenting the different champion prices, I find it shorts you about 300 IP.  Is more so related to your IP total, and not the champion price.  I have not noticed it being associated with time, but i play daily so could not say if it would correct the balance after a while.  \n\nFor those of you who are like me and cannot be bothered to keep the legacy client updated as well as the new client, I just stay in the mindset of having 300 less IP than it shows.  Those are about the only two options until the bug is squashed. \n\nGood luck in your games!","replies":[]},{"poster":"porcupain","date":"2016-12-24T18:57:51.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"FYI this is still or is again a problem 19 days later in new client.\n\nLaunched old client as described and after it updated, I could buy from store with IP, but my IP count still shows as if I didn't make a purchase a few minutes later.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Magyk","date":"2016-12-06T00:48:51.995+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same issue only with 6300 champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"pltnxFuBar","date":"2017-01-01T21:12:33.169+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol How fucking hard is it to fix a simple problem in store? for fuck sake! its been like this for a month now! \nall I want is {{champion:43}} _-_","replies":[]},{"poster":"GANG7A","date":"2017-05-06T16:26:16.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How to fix pls i cant buy any chracters pls pls is been a long time now pls anyone help","replies":[]},{"poster":"breadsticks28","date":"2017-02-09T22:11:19.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:92}}  i had enough i couldn't buy it and i relogged in and i lost 100 ip?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Star Bait","date":"2017-01-30T00:55:45.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is not letting me buy champs that cost 4800, I have many champs and I have never had this problem before my username is Star Bait if you can fix it please do whenever I have 4800 IP now it just says I don't have enough.
