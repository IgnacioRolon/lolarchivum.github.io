These crashed had affected the game massively because from what I have heard from my teammate when I crash I don't just go back to base like when I disconnect, I walk to random places and often get myself killed. I had crashed during early game and late game, I give first blood most of the time due to this. I also have lost a game due to me crashing during a team fight. \r\n\r\nI don't know why crashed started happening to me but any advice to solve this problem would be greatly appreciated because I don't want to ruin games for other players and myself.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-02T18:50:15.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Losing matches because of this has to be maddening, and I'd like to help.  I do need some more info, though!  Can you specify what you mean by crash?  What is happening exactly, are you getting any error messages like a bugsplat?","replies":[{"poster":"BubbaTiner","date":"2017-12-07T19:59:17.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same thing for a month and support never helps even after sending logs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devalic","date":"2017-12-02T19:17:42.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game just froze for like half a second and I get returned to desktop and the client pops up. At the first few crashes the bugsplat shows up, but after that, it stopped showing up.  Hopefully, these info are good enough.","replies":[]}]}]}
