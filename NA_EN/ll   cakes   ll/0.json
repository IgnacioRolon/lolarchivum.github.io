I'm streaming HD videos just fine, can load anything else, but the client just took about ~5 minutes to log in, and the entire client is super laggy and buggy (more than usual believe it or not). No clue what's going on, in the game I was lagging in earlier I was talking to my teammates about it and one said he experienced a similar thing the other day. Is there a known connection issue going on right now? Or it just garbage weather/my IP? (even though my connection works for any and everything else)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-05T21:36:49.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At this point I'm not sure the connection is going to fix itself, but our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide can help strengthen things up a bit.  The chat and failure to connect to games sounds like an unstable connection, so stick to custom games for now until you know you can play without further issue.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"dàojiào","date":"2017-09-06T08:30:47.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Answering your comment to add something to the discussion.\n\nSince last patch (Ornn release) I have strange lag spikes in game. I play with normals 35 ms but there and there it goes to 150 - 400 ms for a fraction of a second, just enough to give a strange \"freez\" feeling.\n\nAt first I thought it was me but I checked my internet -> ping to riot server and It's constant. I started asking ennemies team or my teammates, and lot of people have the same issue.\n\nPatch might've broken something, worth checking I guess.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-06T15:20:34.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're running into packet loss, which can happen even with consistent ping.
