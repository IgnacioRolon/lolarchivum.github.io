I'm just about to get keystones, I'm level 3 honor and perform consistently well, probably never been reported or anything. If priority is a thing in queuing my account should have NO PROBLEM with that at all, but yet I find myself waiting 12+ minutes to find an ARAM game????? Estimated time is ALWAYS like 1 minute or less, and then I sit here for 10+ minutes every. single. time. This has been happening for like 3 weeks ever since I made this account, thought it was just low level problems but good god when does it stop?! \r\n\r\nThere's no connection issues and I've tried restarting queues (which hasn't worked once yet, seems like I just have to wait the full 10+ minutes before finding a match). What the hell do I do? Just quit League and come back in a month when the client works? I play ARAM because I don't have the time for Normals but with this added 10 minute queue makes it just as long a process... Do I just have to suck it up until I hit level 30? By then I'll have a total queue time of like 20 hours...","replies":[{"poster":"ll   CaKeS   ll","date":"2017-08-28T17:10:10.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I wanna update on this and say it's gotten worse, ARURF is now gone, I've continued to level up, and I'm still waiting about the LENGTH OF AN ARAM GAME just to start one. Earlier today I hit my record which was over 22 minutes of sitting in queue. Also, restarting the queue does nothing but reset the time, if anything that may actually slow the process down. Something is wrong here, this is not just a lack of players, this is a problem. (not to mention the fact once I wait 20 minutes and find a lobby, it's MORE OFTEN DODGED THAN NOT, and this is not an exaggeration).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-20T22:40:49.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your matchmaking queue isn't affected by any kind or priority, unless your account had a low priority queue from leaving/afking in too many matches. I checked that out as well, and it doesn't seem like you've ever d/c'd so that's not the case. Overall, it just sounds like you've been unlucky with a number of people around your MMR and who are actively queueing up for ARAM. \n\nKeep in mind that there are several other queues, and as a bit of insider knowledge.....this can typically happen with ARURF is around. Most likely a number of people queueing for ARAM is so low due to everyone playing other types of matches. It doesn't sound like anything is wrong with your connection or the client, try queueing up for a different game mode to see how that goes.","replies":[{"poster":"ll   CaKeS   ll","date":"2017-08-21T17:46:42.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome thanks for the clarification! I guess I just have to suck it up until it starts working again. I did start the account when ARURF came out, but I used to only play ARAM on my main as well and I was always in Zocon's position, where it was almost NEVER above 1 minute, of course this is with a level 30 acc so yeah I'm assuming it's just difficult to find accounts my level to play with. \n\nThanks again!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kevin711","date":"2017-08-21T02:10:43.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its cause of ar urf alotaa people playing that it's almost over though","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zocon","date":"2017-08-20T21:36:18.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It may indeed be due to low level I'm not sure. I know I don't have any aram queue time issues at lvl 30, 1 minute max for me, and that is all that I play. \n\nMaybe playing in a premade with others would help?","replies":[]}]}
