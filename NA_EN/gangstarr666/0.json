If you're handed a free win then it's no longer a fair system overall. \n\nThink of it this way, if you were on the winning side of a 5 v 4 as part of the 5, is it bearable that you gained a little less LP because of the AFK on their team? \n\nOtherwise the reverse side is you're losing a full amount of LP for a loss if you're in the same game but on the losing side that really nothing can be done about unless there is a ridiculous skill difference between the two sides. \n\nWhich one feels worse to you? \n\nI wouldn't mind gaining 15 free LP for a free win instead of 20, and having the enemy lose 15 instead of 20 because they basically handed it over.

You don't plan on fucking up a whole system to fix a minor issue. \n\nThis is a mathematical situation, AFKs **will** earn you more LP than they make you lose, period. Any change on LP loss must be exactly mirrored on LP gains so the system isn't totally fucked, meaning that most non-leaving players would benefit more from the current situation than the \"fixed\" situation.","replies":[{"poster":"ROYALR3IGN","date":"2018-12-27T03:18:18.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats why I left in the bottom paragraph that you would mirror the amount of LP lost by the losing team in terms of gains. So if this game would have normally netted you 20 LP it would only net you 15 instead because the enemy team had an afk. And if you were on the losing side of the same game you wouldn't lose 20 LP but rather 15 LP because your team (Thats not partied with you) costed you the game. This way there is no inflation of the system because you're balancing off the amount lost by the amount gained, the only difference is, is that you're minimizing the effect of a game that doesn't accurately measure your own skill due to an outside factor, which is what ranked is all about in the first place. \n\n\nEdit: If anything it would cause a small amount of deflation each time because if you are duo'd with someone you would still lose 20 LP and therefore 2 people would actually end up losing more LP than was gained by the other team. So you wouldn't have a problem with inflated LP, but rather the other way around.

It's two separate issues. Intentional trolling is for all intents of purposes makes no difference or not whether people on their team save a bit of LP or not. Why? Because as the system is right now, you can achieve the same goal (You can still run it down mid and ruin the game for people, so this change doesn't affect that). That means the only real difference is the games where someone is not trolling but rage quits, or D/Cs for whatever reason then those people in the game will benefit from the LP mitigation. \n\nIf this change went through it would only be done to protect the randoms in games.

It stops people from intentionally leaving to save their friends when they are losing a game. All it does is protect the randoms from people rage quitting or afking. \n\n> Fyi people have no idea if someone left a game without them having the 20m penalty which boosters won't > > likely have(especially if they know that it affects their cut). \n\nBut they do? If someone leaves the game then the game announces to your team that your teammate has left. Boosters don't need to leave games, they can usually stomp hard enough and win regardless, in most elos. \n> \n> Two fold problem, make it just on someone leaving a game recently then random person who didnt know their friend left a game recently suffers. Set it to the penalty, you can clear that in normals and yes still exploitable. So no the problem is not solved.\n \nI don't really understand what you're saying with this last part sorry.\n\nEdit, it would only apply to the game thats at hand. It doesn't matter or not if your friend left the last game and then you duo'd with him after. How it works is if you duo with someone and they leave THAT specific game then you will still lose the full LP for that game because you were qued with the leaver. Not because they left the game before. I hope this is what you were referring to.\n\nThis system will save more bystanders by reducing the amount of LP they lost. How much can be debated but even saving 5lp from a game that was basically an auto lose because of an AFK feels better than losing the full amount.
