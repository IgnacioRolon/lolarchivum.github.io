Right now we're assessing the magnitude of the issue and exploring potential root causes.  We'll update as soon as we can.  Please hang in there.\n\nFrom our understanding, it appears that the issue:\n-Began happening after the 5.8 deploy\n-Is not specific to one ISP\n-Does not prevent players from playing games, unless it happens during champ select\n-Is happening to some players, but not all players\n-Is definitely a pain in the ass\n-Is not likely related to any client crashing issues, but we haven't ruled that out yet\n\nAny trends that I'm missing?","replies":[{"poster":"TacoPunch","date":"2015-05-07T04:32:41.628+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you disable IP helper, it works fine.
