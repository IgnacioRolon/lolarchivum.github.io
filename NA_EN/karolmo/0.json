Do you realize he&#039;s gonna lose his teammates like 50 games before dropping to bronze V? How does someone who goes 0-10 even get placed in Bronze 2? What the heck is wrong with your placement system?\n\n\nPS: No, i&#039;m not lying.\n\nEdit: This post is about how fucked riot placement system is to allow this to happen. Not about him. He'll drop eventually, but not before fucking up over 50 games.\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/fB3iD","replies":[]}
