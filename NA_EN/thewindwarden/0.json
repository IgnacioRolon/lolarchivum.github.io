It is only level 3 as I have had to do the tutorial twice to rank it up. I've tried every queue and waited for 10+ minutes to see if I have found a game. As I'm writing this I'm in a queue for hunt of blood moon and the queue time is at 14 minutes. Not sure if it's always been like this, or if something is wrong. Please let me know if you know anything. Also i get better ping on PBE than real servers? How does that work","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-30T02:37:05.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Queue times can be a bit longer on PBE since there are a lot fewer players on the PBE region than the live regions. If you experience something completely out of the norm like a 50+ minute queue, let me know.\n\nAlso, latency (ping) may be better for you if you're closer to where our PBE servers are, which is on the west coast in the US. If you have any other questions, let me know!","replies":[]}]}
