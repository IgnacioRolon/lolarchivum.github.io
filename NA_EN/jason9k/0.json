When it would spike usually the clicking would be unresponsive for a couple so seconds then go back to normal. It fucks be over a lot. It started when i switched my router a few days ago. I switched it because I would also lag with my old one, but instead of the clicking being unresponsive, my game would just freeze, like nobody was moving and then suddenly it would unfreeze and I would be dead or something. My current router has a tri-band for my family and they said the third one is just for me(5.0ghrz), so I don't think anyone else is taking the bandwidth and I don't have any other programs running in the background. I does happen for other games like battlefield 4 and such. Does anyone have any answers? I don't know much about computers and such, but all help is appreciated! Thanks.\r\nInternet: https://gyazo.com/6a29dc629f46562f0ffa05e98bba9a5c","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-30T01:49:25.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm this almost sounds like you might be dealing with packet loss.

It's not much, but that could still cause the problems you were having when the packet loss occurs. I'd suggest getting in touch with your ISP to see if they know about any current issues, and possibly asking for a reset to your modem/router. If that doesn't help, go ahead and hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so they can take a closer look with you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
