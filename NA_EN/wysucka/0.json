Warding doesnt help because simply good shacos know where your wards are.  He just do so much fucking damage lvl 1-6 it barely survivable. Worst part is that pinks cant stop him either in lane.  (pinks are visible?are you serious). Removing oracles?Dumb as well.Champions like eve,shaco and rengar are just unbelievably strong.There has to be someway to stop the ganks and splitpush ability.Because as of right now they cant be stopped.","replies":[{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-07-07T22:39:41.318+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You forgot to mention he falls off faster than a roller coaster with a broken track late game...   Perhaps at level 25 he feels too OP, but once you learn how to Counter Play him, he's easy to beat.","replies":[{"poster":"WYSUCKA","date":"2015-07-07T22:48:09.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not playing against him that makes him op. I just had a shaco that just fucking splitpushed and destroy the entire team.We were mad behind and doomed. It seems that every game I had shaco or against my teammates dont know what the fuck they are doing. What makes you think im playing against shaco and crying about it? Im talking about his splitpush ability and seemly unstoppable damage he deals out when snowballed. Even on my main. Believe me playing against shaco was pretty easy season  1-3.... Dont you ever know that pink wards are destroyable ?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Trash MammaI","date":"2015-07-07T23:10:40.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bull shit warding doesn't help. I hate when someone drops a pink the second I use my Q then an entire army swoops in and murders me.

Most of the time the enemy mid will try to kill it which leaves you open to harass hard. If you don't want them bothering it put it closer to your side and stay close to tower.\n\nBot lane same as either mid or top lane. \n\nHis ganks are easy to stop","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-07-07T23:04:58.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You neglected to mention that the Shaco in your game was a Diamond 5 playing against a Gold 4 and a bunch of new players... any champ is OP in that scenario.","replies":[{"poster":"WYSUCKA","date":"2015-07-07T23:19:39.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if that was the case.....then the ZAC I faced as vladimir(he was plat) against new players shouldve been op(went 14/0 with his team)....But he isnt.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2015-07-07T22:50:51.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah!

What I am talking about is seemingly psychological presence he brings.(Solo lanes have to play more defensive lvl 1--8 all that needed to bring your team  a advantage in solo que)https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2wwkpf/lcs_picks_bans_after_week_5_eu_na_separated/.....These champions listed are all balanced in nature since they remained the same in nature. Sure.... He might have lost some of jungle clearing power and some damage early  but his ganks/splitpushing have never been stronger. What makes you think every game will stretch out 45 minutes? What makes you think shaco has any synergy with team comps that will thrive him in tournaments?  Sure the meta sure as hell hates him because since when did any team meta favored him?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MohawkBird","date":"2015-07-07T22:40:10.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was hoping by balancing you meant buffs, but boy was I more wrong.","replies":[]}]}
