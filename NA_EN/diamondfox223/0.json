I had downloaded league through that link (above) and for half of this year, it worked fine until a couple days ago. PvP.netkernel error started popping up everytime and have not been able to fix it. i have tried deleting and redownloading league several times but had no success. it is almost like it is unfixable. Before this point in time league had been working perfectly, no errors before and i only i used the files that i unzipped from the folder from the link above. also this is my second time dealing with this mess. last year, it did the same thing and then i quit league for half the year, i used the same unzipped folder last year to play league, then computer got reimaged by the admin and first thing i did was download it using the above link. so reimaging works but only the admin of this device can do it and i dont have that option. i have tried another method as well and for that i require (LoLPatcher.exe) thing that i dont think i can get just off the webs. I'm sure there are tech gurus out there who could help me so plz :).","replies":[{"poster":"diamondfox223","date":"2017-06-11T02:31:03.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My main problem is that I dont have admin privileges and so i cannot do anything about it. If there is a way to install league without admin rights then please recommend me. As for installing league from the 'original source', it doesn't work out for me because the last step of 'installing', requires admin rights which i do not acquire. Just a side question, I have an external SSD drive that I have ordered and I will receive it soon, but is it possible to download league onto that SSD drive from another computer and then play LoL through it, on this device? Would I need admin rights to be able to launch LoL from that drive onto this unprivileged device? thank you very much for answering :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-10T17:04:08.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This error is almost always caused by a security setting with your OS or anti virus blocking League or the patcher from launching.  Running as admin is a good step but there might be more.  I suggest first going over each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure league is added as an exception.\n\nUsing old files on a new system is likely going to cause you a lot of trouble as well, and force the patcher to fail every time it tries to update you.  Instead, you should download League again directly from the original source [here](https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/redownload).\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
