With each fragment you earn, the chance to earn your next one goes down slightly. This number resets roughly every thirty days after you earn your first key fragment.\n\nRiot wanted to give players who didn't play as frequently a good drop rate for keys, without making it feel like farming was mandatory if you wanted keys.\n\n \nNote: There's currently a bug which prevents you from earning key fragments if you're playing a champion you don't own. This is unintended, and a solution for this is being worked on.\n\n\n**[Learn to craft.
