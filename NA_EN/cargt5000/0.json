I think that his kit needs to be changed, because it feels awkward, purposeless, and Riot seems to have abandoned Galio in general as a champion because he hasn&#039;t been in the meta for a very long time.\n\nNow that my reasoning is out of the way, I thought up a rework for Galio that is directly inspired from my favorite game of all time, Dark Souls.  Keep in mind, the kit would definitely receive changes for originality because of how directly similar the design is to the Gargoyle boss from Dark Souls.\n\nI haven't done anything like this before, so forgive me for any mistakes I make in terms of formatting.\n\nThis rework would make Galio an unconventional tanky mage who was actually BUILT to be played as a bruiser.\n\nPassive: Guardian's Vengeance: Galio gains desire for revenge whenever an ally is struck by an enemy.  Whenever an ally unit within 1500 units takes damage from an enemy champion, Galio gains 15% of his maximum health as a shield for 5 seconds.  Whenever another ally takes damage during the shield&#039;s duration, another 15% of Galio&#039;s missing HP is added to the shield, which also resets the duration of the shield.\n\nQ: The Last Blow: Strike: Galio swings his halberd in a cone in front of him, dealing 80/140/200(+65%AP) magic damage plus 5% of all enemies&#039; missing health in the area. (9.5/9/8.5/8/7.5 second CD)\n\nW: Overhead Smash: Galio's next basic attack gains 100 range, and deals an additional 75/125/175(+55%AP) magic damage.  The attack strikes through the unit it hits, dealing damage to units behind as well.  All enemies hit are slowed by 35%. (7/6.5/6/6.5/5 second CD)\n\nE: Assault from Above: Galio lunges to his cursor as long as it is within 400 range.  Upon arriving at his destination, Galio smashes into the ground, dealing 60/80/100(+25%AP) magic damage in an AOE around him.  The AOE has a range of 100. (16/15/14/12/10 second CD)\n\nR: Wrath of the Guardian: Galio breathes fire for 4 seconds, which travels towards the cursor(The turning would not be instant, it would take time for him to turn his head.), dealing 150/200/250(+45%AP) magic damage per second.  He is slowed by 45% while his ultimate is active, but it can be canceled at any time by re-activating the ability(Which means he can move while his ultimate is active, however he cannot cast other spells.).  While active, the duration of all CC would be decreased by 50%.(Does not apply to the slow on this ability.) (120/100/80 second CD)\n\nI wanted this kit to make Galio more thematic as a defender, as well of a magic damage bruiser with good peel and engage.  With his passive, you would somewhat get the sense of being a protector who gains power as his allies are being struck down.  He would bring up interesting counterplay in the form of evading his ult and would create openings where going aggro on him would be a good idea.\n\nKeep in mind this is a suggestion intended for modification, and I of course allow Riot to use these concepts in design freely.\n\nGive me some feedback!\n\nFOR{{champion:3}}!!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"plss enjoy game","date":"2016-07-10T05:43:06.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was here fastest {{summoner:6}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"geya","date":"2016-07-10T07:58:35.954+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel this would be a cool rework; however, the way his kit works makes him very similar to maokai with a \"dive in to the adc and tank\" strategy.

This kit design was directly inspired from the Bell Gargoyles from Dark Souls, so I recommend looking at the boss to see what kind of theme the character would have roughly.  Because he is a champion, he would have some kind of personality, most likely optimistic.  In this kit, I designed Galio with \"The best defense is a good offense\" in mind.  The kit has a variety of purposes, I feel like.  There is the element of offense in his kit in the form of his damaging abilities, dash, and slow.  There is also the element of protection with his passive making him more powerful as his allies are being harmed, somewhat making him feel more like a guardian, and then there is his ult which also contributes to that because I wanted to make it feel like zoning tool.  For those 4 seconds of his ult, people would be out of their mind to continue fighting you.\nI think he has an interesting gameplay design being able to either attempt to burst down Galio early to avoid him stacking his shield, or forcing people to try to ignore him as they burst down the rest of the team.  Both scenarios are dependent on situation, but this makes Galio a very interesting teamfighter.  However, I would not call it broken considering the shield isn't ridiculously big.\nOne goal I have in making this design is making the champion have meaningful counterplay, and don't see buying a QSS as being very meaningful counterplay.  I personally feel like point-and-click hard CC are just frustrating to play against to the point where you feel like you can't do anything.  His ultimate also feels awkward to use, relying on Galio having flash up to make it unpredictable.  Overall, I feel the ult in it's current state is pretty poor design, and needs something that creates interesting scenarios.  Rather than the Galio flashing into the middle of the enemy team and pressing R, imagine this: The enemy team is engaging in a teamfight, and is trying to ignore Galio to kill the backline squishies and eventually deal with him.  However, the Galio pops ult and the enemy team retreats, 1-2 of them getting caught out in the process.\nOne last thing, with his current passive with the magic resist scaling, it makes little sense to have his ultimate scale better with armor because of the enemy champions' basic attacks.  His kit right now just feels all around purposeless and awkward to play with.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-10T07:38:32.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That just isn't Galio in the slightest.\n\nEdit: no mr scaling and no aoe taunt","replies":[{"poster":"CarGT5000","date":"2016-07-10T09:24:01.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"But why does something a champ has now have to effect it's gameplay in future design?","replies":[{"poster":"FloRaider42","date":"2016-07-10T09:48:41.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because that is his niche and thematic ?\nEvery rework should try to improve upon the iconic side of the champion and remove his weaknesses.

Makes him more of a bruiser/fighter than a guardian.\n\n>then there is his ult which also contributes to that because I wanted to make it feel like zoning tool.\nFor those 4 seconds of his ult, people would be out of their mind to continue fighting you.\n\nGiven the slow rotation speed and the self slow, it's more of a damage tool (if you have a support with CC) than a zoning tool (especially against assassins) and even lacks in that regard, since you have to rely on outside CC to be able to land your own damage, since you lack a lot of that.\n\n>I think he has an interesting gameplay design being able to either attempt to burst down Galio early to avoid him stacking his shield, or forcing people to try to ignore him as they burst down the rest of the team.\n\nHow is that interesting ? You hardly have any interaction or counter to it (you don't have a way to deny it and no way to actively play around it) and most of this other abilities are very bland.\n\n> Makes Galio a very interesting teamfighter.\n\nHis Lack of CC and Lack of Utility aren't really offset by his new mobility and damage tools, making him actually weaker in a TF.\n\n> One goal I have in making this design is making the champion have meaningful counterplay, and don't see buying a QSS as being very meaningful counterplay.\n\nCurrently he has so little mobility that he has to flash or suprise you to use his ult and Allies that weren't hit can CC him to cancel his channel. Leaving him with quite a lot of counterplay. Amumu's ult has a similiar duration and effect and he has an easier time to land his Ult thanks to Q.\n\n>I personally feel like point-and-click hard CC are just frustrating to play against to the point where you feel like you can't do anything.\n\nMost get removed or reworked (taric stun etc.), but Galio is offest by his lack of mobility making it less of a problem.\n\n>Overall, I feel the ult in it's current state is pretty poor design, and needs something that creates interesting scenarios.\n\nI agree with that (Either changes to his ult or changes to his mobility), but I don't think your attempt is that thrilling.\n\n>The enemy team is engaging in a teamfight, and is trying to ignore Galio to kill the backline squishies and eventually deal with him.\nHowever, the Galio pops ult and the enemy team retreats, ~~1-2 of them getting caught out in the process.~~\n\nHe is slowed and doesn't apply CC with his R how exactly is that going to catch out opponents?\nAnd mobile champions can still dance around his ultimate to kill the backline.\n\n> One last thing, with his current passive with the magic resist scaling, it makes little sense to have his ultimate scale better with armor because of the enemy champions' basic attacks. His kit right now just feels all around purposeless and awkward to play with.\n\nWell he is an old champion and was designed as an anti Mage tank, which is why the Ultimate scales with amounts of AA and not with damage (with W on you hardly will take damage anyway).\n\nTL;DR:\nI would like to see his rework explore his role as a gargoyle (guardian against evil) and anti mage tank (maybe keep his ult in some form [benefits from drawing enemy fire on him]) and not turn him into a rather generic halberd swinging fighter/bruiser.","replies":[{"poster":"CarGT5000","date":"2016-07-10T21:19:09.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the feedback.
