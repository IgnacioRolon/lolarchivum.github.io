Now imagine what it's like when you've been penalized once and, though are \"unlocked\", can't level even after like 60+ honors and daily playing. You get no hextech l00t, you get shamed by people who think rito has a flawless 100% accurate system and haven't been disillusioned yet like i have (When you report someone out of pure frustration for no reason and they somehow get penalized you kinda just realise that its not exactly the most functional..) etc\n\n\nsorry dood but looks like riot screwed up the honor system.
