How does the system look at chatlogs? Riot is pretty much removing all the fun you can have with talking retarded to your friends, joking around or actually doing something fun. Why is that?

This could have been just before, or during the new honor system. When you get punished, your honor progress is locked for a while, and punishments could even reduce your honor. Also, your in game behavior will affect your honor, regardless of other people honoring you or not. If you haven't had any punishments and have had an overall good behavior in game, I'm sure someone could look into it for you.","replies":[]}]}
