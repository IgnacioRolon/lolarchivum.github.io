Today I see, There is an error, and Leauge of Legends - Client Alpha, was removed from my computer, with no reasons, because yesterday I could play at 7-9 pm.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-12T18:43:16.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not aware of anything that would simply remove it.  A recent update may have removed the icon from your desktop, though.   You'll want to check to see if the Alpha is still installed in the same directory as your original League of Legends client. Navigate to the location you installed League, likely **C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends** \n\n You should be able to recover it by going to the LeagueClient executable in your install folder and creating a new shortcut for alpha from there.\n\nHope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
