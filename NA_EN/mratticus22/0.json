I got stopped at the C++ install. I end up having to cancel it but then it still goes into my list for \"uninstall a program\". I've tried uninstalling and going directly to the Microsoft websites download, but it gives the same error. Please help, i'm going through a league withdrawal.\r\nPS. Riot Eambo touched on this, but his link to resolve it has closed.{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-24T21:08:28.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This usually happens after a reformat or out of date OS that doesn't have the necessary products to install League.  I'm not sure which resource you downloaded, but usually [Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3387) link does the trick.
