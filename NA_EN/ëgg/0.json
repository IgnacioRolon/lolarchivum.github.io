However i understand i may deserve this as i was toxic, however i have spent over &pound;1100 on this game... which for some people is a considerable sum of money, i have had my account for 5 years and this is a lot for me. once again i understand i was toxic, however this has been an account accumulated for years and it is now gone. &pound;1100 down the drain, is there nothing that can be done at all...","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-03-03T01:09:39.227+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the account was banned for toxicity, there is nothing that can be done, no.

If you ever make a new account ask yourself this question: \"Is flaming this stranger worth more than the account that I've invested so much into?\" Personally, I'd rather keep my account clean than to risk losing it because I was angry at someone that I would mostly never meet in real life.
