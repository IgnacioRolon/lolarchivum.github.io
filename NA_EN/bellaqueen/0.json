I miss the things that made league special. . It stuck out from other games that were similar and the holiday&#039;s felt inviting on the game! I miss the winter map, and I miss the limited edition Runes that you could purchase as well. . You also did little things like turn the health potions and such into cups of hot cocoa or candy. League has grown and as a person that has been here since the start I can honestly say it&#039;s become a little disheartening to see the holidays that were once cherished just thrown away. . It&#039;s halloween and the halloween skins aren&#039;t even out. .The little events we were able to do for special rewards and Icons are far less with holidays..and both the winter map and halloween map are vanished forever so it seems. These little things are what kept me the loyal customer I am with league of legends.. I literally cannot be gifted because I own almost every skin ever made (not kidding here..Just missing the pax skins really). . and I gift my friends often.  I am one of the people that helped put you where you were and believed in you.. and that&#039;s not me having a big head, that&#039;s me being honest. . I own over 600 Skins. . Do the math? that&#039;s ALOT of money. . thousands of dollars. .  I didn&#039;t mind paying for the skins or spending the money for the time it took to make such awesome stuff. .But I just want to ask a simple favor. . Please do something for me for a change.. for the community... For the people that have been here and the new people that never got to see it..Please bring us back our winter map this year? I have patiently waited to see the game I fell in love with come back to me.. Those little things, the special things that you looked forward to every year. . are just gone. collecting the runes was awesome. . It gave me something to do by saving up my IP and patiently waiting. Seems now though. . that things like that. . the ones that make no real profit are just not here anymore. I just have to ask, were those thing genuine??? OR were they to build the game into what it is now??? You have your money... can we please have our fun? You&#039;re still going to get your money off the skins you release, and several other things you make profit from.  As a loyal customer (and I am sure I speak for many) can we please please please have some of these special little moments from the past back? I hope you take the time to read this riot. Thank you for many years of fun..here&#039;s to hoping for many more.. Please prove that my money and my time have been spent well. . show us you care about us by treating us to the things that used to make league what it was..  The special maps. . The special runes. . The tiny little things  that made you say &quot; oh hey that&#039;s pretty darn cool. . my health pot is a cocoa cup!&quot; OR &quot; oh sweet I get to collect these limited edition runes that have pumpkins and snowmen&quot;. . The new people to this game have never got to see these thing and think I am crazy when I say they were a thing.  Please try and remember who you were before you got so big. . You were loyal to those that were loyal to you.  -awesome winter map-http://www.gamingnexus.com/Images/News/nwuzjn15448/3.jpg  AND http://www.onrpgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/HolidayRunes.jpg &lt;--- Link to the runes.  -sigh-","replies":[{"poster":"Nixas","date":"2015-10-31T15:32:00.943+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"I for one would love to spend the holidays with my friends on League!
