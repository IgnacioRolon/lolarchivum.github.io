I recommend running our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs), which will provide some options for a full uninstall.

Hopefully, that will get you fixed up but let me know if you run into any issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RagingMammoth","date":"2016-08-03T17:45:47.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go into my computer\nopen C:\nthen riot games\ndelete all folders\n(if unable restart your computer and try again)\nIf you have the launch still in your riot game folder run it and it should update and download everything you need\nif not go on the official LOL site and download the game again","replies":[]}]}
