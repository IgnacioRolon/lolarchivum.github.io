When champion select hits, it spikes to a massive 40%, and then drops back down to under 1% in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-09T18:54:33.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your task manager may show low processing before champion select because pvp.net is idle, so there's not a lot going on.  That will change as soon as you're in champion select and interacting with players and servers.  There's certainly a lot more activity happening during champion select, but it shouldn't be enough to cause major issues.  Pvp.net will become idle again after champion select is finished and transitions from the client to the game.  \n\nIf you're on the updated client, what happens if you toggle to low-spec mode through the client settings?  Let me know if switching to it helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Ocelote","date":"2017-02-28T18:25:23.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i understand the change in processing when in champion select, but it is kinda ridiculous that champion select uses more processing than the game itself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Readycheck","date":"2017-02-09T20:20:41.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is something definitely different with this patch. I used to get about 15%> cpu max with animations during champ select. I now spike up to about 45%. I disabled animations and went low spec, it fixes the problem only partially. In low spec mode cpu usage is lower but it still spikes back to 40%+\n\nYes I'm on updated client.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"a7xAfterlife","date":"2017-02-09T19:35:54.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/3kCBMbv This is during the game search. Everything is perfect.\nhttp://imgur.com/B5Atg1l Moment the champ select hits, my CPU skyrockets. It's an i7 6700k and basically brand new. Only started happening after the update. I turned on the low-spec mode, and same result. When the game starts, my CPU instantly goes back to normal.","replies":[]}]}
