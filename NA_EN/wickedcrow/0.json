This new scaling is much better late game but thats the problem. This new \"buff\" means nautilus wont SURVIVE to the late game. Think about it, what kinds a champs are most common in the jungle now? Sustain and damage. Nautilus has neither. by severely weakening the early game \"power\" of his already inferior shield, Riot has effectively made a difficult tanky champ unplayable against any jungler that has the potential to counter jungle. It was already hard enough with the removal of the Spirit Golem item that helped give Naut the HP and defense to power through the jungle, but now...I'm not sure hes even playable. Can someone, somehow enlighten me as to how he could possibly be used anymore?\nHere are the problems I see:\n-Horrible early game due to ease of being counter jungled and lack of early game hp/def items\n-Horrible gank potential due to low hp and shield values in laning phase\n-Requiring lanes to check for counter jungles or leave to assist Nautilus during a counter jungle (essential makes him more of a burden)\n-Expensive item build means he wont have a complete item as early as most champs\n-Horrible damage values even for a tank, due to his DoT being linked to his shield\n-Current \"buff\" being effectively useless due to late game damage anyway (that extra 200 hp wont mean anything to the enemy ADC)\nThis is just SOME of the problems that I see\n\nEDIT: At Level 9 with a Giants belt\nNautilus w/Giants belt has 1,296\nNew Scaling: 85 + (17% of MAX HP) = ~305 Shield Strength.  (1,296x0.17) = 220\nOld Scaling: 300 + (15% of BONUS HP) = ~357 Shield Strength (380x0.15) =57\nThis is roughly the end of early game and the new scaling is STILL WEAKER\n\nEDIT2: Junglerboy16 Has made some excellent points and even has a graph showing that the new scaling is weaker till level 11, around where mid game tends to start.

He can do alright in the current jungle if you start Krugs (the stun lets him keep the shield up longer), counterjungling is a real problem for him but you can always just gank constantly and hope you get your team ahead enough that they can carry you later when you have no gold because the enemy jungler has been taking your camps.\n\nThe biggest problem with him, which numbers aren't going to change, is that some games all 3 lanes are going to idiotically push for all of lane phase and you won't get any ganks off. Then you're stuck farming the jungle with your crappy clear speed while the enemy jungler either takes all sorts of free kills or just outfarms you. Your only recourse at that point is to try to steal camps, or countergank (which is hard when all 3 lanes are totally gankable and you don't have deep wards).","replies":[{"poster":"WickedCrow","date":"2015-01-16T10:44:02.727+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"His ganks are good due to him being a CC monster, but with his weakened shield and the lack of good defensive items early (Aside from the juggernaut enchantment i guess?) means its possible that a gank could easily turn into a double kill for the enemy. Considering there are a myriad of ways the gank can go wrong (Hitting a minion or completely missing the q, getting poked out of his shield's hp, getting counter ganked,etc), he can end up just being more of a burden and feeding the enemy lanes.","replies":[]}]}]}
