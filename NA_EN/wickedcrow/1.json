You shouldn&amp;#039;t need to be inside a bush to have Sion do any reasonable amount of damage.\n\nHe can cancel it early to make it a slow and easily hide the indicator while being in a bush for some retarded cheesy B.S. not to mention he's a champion who can gain max health just by killing units with no real limit on how high it can get up to, Technically its fair for someone to be able to interrupt the ridiculously large hitbox on the ability. Plus Galio's 'taunt W' has a number of limitations on it:\n\n1. Mobility is 'significantly lowered', so its not going to be hard for people to quickly move out of range of him, leaving him to rely on flash or R jump in ambushes, which opponents could save their own flash or simply be ready to quickly move away from him soon as they see him to minimize how many targets he can taunt.\n\n2. Sadly i can't pull up the actual stats on the new Galio just yet (call me lazy or just blame the wikia for the champion not being updated yet), so i am under the impression that Galio's W deals no damage, making it purely a defensive tool with the passive and a disruption tool for the active, So unlike Sion's who can wind up the damage to up to triple its 'value+scaling', but also gets a FREEBIE cooldown of 2 seconds if he's interrupted mid'channel, something i have not seen really freely granted to other champions for 'interruptable abilities', plus Sion's Q only needs a charge of 'atleast 1 second for knock up and can still have its slow harass variant within less then a second of the first cast, it makes it ridiculously versatile in what it is able to do and yet it has a low mana cost and tacted on a champion with plenty of other silly strong abilities.\n\nI'm seriously sick of seeing you kind of guys who don't pay attention to when a champion is already so overloaded with gimmicks (even on just one ability alone!) that its a wonder why the hell aren't the rest of the champions just as loaded to 'make things fair'.\n\nPlus if any other champion who uses a wind up/channel based 'high damage' ability can get 'interrupted' by a stun, then its only fair for Sion to keep that weakness, Since he's leaving himself open for that silly windup for a good old kidney punch barrage, Galio's W is atleast where he's taking a defensive stance and making good use of his title as a 'anti-magic construct' to shirk off such things.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}\n\nBlame the retarded lethality 'aggressive meta' since before that, tankie run arounders like Sion were annoying blockade harass to deny CS and kills in the top lane because of that hard to kill nature and killing him is just going to let him revenge kill ya with ease for perfect 'gold trading' to get'm to be even tankier.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"WickedCrow","date":"2017-03-16T07:15:36.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Galio's W does indeed not do any damage, and while you make some strong points, I am still not wholly convinced. Sion's stuck in one place with channeled ability that only has its full effect after two seconds, as well as only gaining hard CC after 1, while Galio gets the full effect of his Damage reduction and taunt no matter the duration of the W, only the Range of the taunt effect changes with charge and Galio is still able to move and flash while doing it. I understand wanting to add counterplay and Riot's obsession with \"minigames\" but a Tank being denied their ability to CC pretty much guts their relevancy to a team. Admittedly, the 2 second cooldown is nice, but since Sion was hard CC'ed he would likely be out of range to utilize his Q again effectively. He can't even use the Q as a peel mechanism to protect his team because he can be interrupted. It wouldn't be so bad if his Ult was reliable, but both it and his Q require so much time to be of any actual use that most people can dodge/outplay a fully charged version of either with relative ease; because of that fact there's practically no reason to pick Sion because not only is his CC easy to negate but his damage is too. It really ruins the idea of this hulking zombie warrior that can decimate entire legions with a smash of his galactic axe when some riverboat gambler tosses a yellow card to sucker punch him out of his wind up. You would figure he would be able to at least shrug off a CC effect or two. \n\nObviously theres some worry that this could make Full AD Sion absurdly annoying since he could bait an opponent into wasting their mobility effects and squashing them with an unstoppable fully charge Q, but you could cut the damage and scaling a fair bit to compensate for the extra reliability. Think of it kind of like how Taric's e got changed from a point and click stun to a short-range timed AoE. It lost reliability in being able to guarantee a stun on click but it cannot be stopped for any reason (unless the champion cannot be stunned due to spellshield, etc). To make up for this, Taric has to actually aim the ability and the stun duration + damage is weaker to compensate. \n\nIf cutting damage from his Q would be too dramatic, then he needs some form of reliable CC to be a useful tank, otherwise he should be considered some form of mutant-Juggernaut, and possibly require a rework, though not every champion gets to be lucky enough to receive a kit overhaul. \n\nHonestly if you think Sion's kit is overloaded I don't blame you, the health adding thing is just a holdover from his old kit. His Passive is just a singular spiritual successor to his old kit's ult. I think he could use a passive that would make him more useful perhaps, and even just remove the health-stacking since it's effects are comparatively weaker to most other stacking champs. Hell he might need a light rework just to remove some of the useless tack-ons and focus on the major components of his kit.","replies":[]}]}]}
