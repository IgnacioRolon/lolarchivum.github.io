People start tilting in chat, go troll picks, or even purposly ban their allies&#039; picks. Ofc most people dodge to avoid that situation while the one who caused it, goes on to bother more people. Yet there is NO punishment for them? The people who dodge are stuck with a waiting time because they opted to avoid a toxic enviroment. Riot could simply setup a report system on the accounts despite before, after, or during a game. So like you go on their profile in the Client, then report. Which also solves the issue of toxic players or hackers who try to friend then message things. This might help Riot establish which accounts are scammed (because the spam links and reports) as well as get a understanding of who the really toxic players are. Since we can already search summoner names, then it helps pregame too. Just take a pic or remember their name then search up to report. It&#039;d be amazing in the cases where players and banning ally picks, their punishment is that the player gets no choice on who to ban (only option is none) or not allowed to play Draft/Ranked. Now granted, some flaws with this system is sometimes people do it on accident or have to because troll pick. Granted, Riot can make their call in these cases since they # of reports would help indicate if it&#039;s on purpose and people shouldn&#039;t ban ally champs even if they are trolls (puts fuel on the fire).","replies":[{"poster":"Butt Ρlug","date":"2017-12-30T22:05:25.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is quite a complicated issue.\n\n>Yet there is NO punishment for them? \n\nWhen you see people tilting, you can screenshot before dodging and send a support ticket about it.\n\"troll pick\" is complicated because you can't punish someone for playing an off-meta pick.\n\n> and people shouldn't ban ally champs even if they are trolls (puts fuel on the fire).\n\nYou have the right to ban a champ someone has declared, it's not a good idea since it can tilt them, but you have the right to do it and you won't be punished for doing so, sometimes depending on the pick order you can offer to pick a champ for someone, but for example if your teammate that is last pick wants to pick Vayne, you can ban her \"because you don't want the enemies to pick her before your ally\".\n\nAlso, there is two recent threads on the same subject in this sub-forum : [this one](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/XwlUxswZ-reported-for-banning-others-champion), [and this one](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/qWWEvVqV-there-should-be-a-way-to-report-players-before-games-start).","replies":[{"poster":"RedstoneRailroad","date":"2017-12-30T23:06:48.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sirthael,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=31wA5Ght,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-12-30T22:05:25.538+0000)\n>\n> That is quite a complicated issue.\n> \n> When you see people tilting, you can screenshot before dodging and send a support ticket about it.\n> &quot;troll pick&quot; is complicated because you can&#x27;t punish someone for playing an off-meta pick.\n> \n> You have the right to ban a champ someone has declared, it&#x27;s not a good idea since it can tilt them, but you have the right to do it and you won&#x27;t be punished for doing so, sometimes depending on the pick order you can offer to pick a champ for someone, but for example if your teammate that is last pick wants to pick Vayne, you can ban her &quot;because you don&#x27;t want the enemies to pick her before your ally&quot;.\n> \n> Also, there is two recent threads on the same subject in this sub-forum : [this one](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/XwlUxswZ-reported-for-banning-others-champion), [and this one](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/qWWEvVqV-there-should-be-a-way-to-report-players-before-games-start).\n\nI mean I am fine with troll picks, but if ppl try to communitcate like let's say a Troll ADC and the support asks them to go something more fitting as they refuse to cooperate with the team. That's one thing... Troll picks do lead to new strats a lot of the time tho... I also understand the need to ban some champions. Yet what if that's their best or most reliable champ? All you did was tilt them and put your team in poor odds. Maybe a team wide agree on \"CANCEL MATCH\" since it can happen. So like 3-4 ppl agree. Would help in cases where there is a toxic player and no one wants to play that match. I didn't know about the support tickets would apply to those cases, but it would be nicer to at least have a client way of doing that. Plus Riot could not rely on bots for bans in this category, I mean they have work arounds since some cases it's just spam reports which could work here. Maybe the only ones truely filed are those with evidence or a screencapture. My personal situation with this is that my current computer either has no screencapture functions or I have yet to discover it. \n\nBTW, thanks for letting me know there are other threads on the topic.","replies":[{"poster":"Butt Ρlug","date":"2017-12-30T23:25:58.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Yet what if that's their best or most reliable champ?

Relying on people instead of bots is a terrible idea given the incredibly huge number of reports.\nI don't know for sure but I'm pretty confident riot save the logs even from a game that was dodged, just in case someone wants to make a report about it for example.\nBeing able to cancel a match with something like a surrender vote let's say if at least 4 people say yes, might be nice but i'm sure there would be other issues with it, premade would be able to abuse this system a lot.\n\nOverall when i end up with a troll in champ select, i usually dodge.

Also dodging is a great tool but it sucks with 5-20 min waits and if you are in promos which means you lose more than the 3 LP. Plus the vote system would only function in Solo/Duo. Since that means no 4 mans, heck they can't do 4 mans in Flex either. So that stops that. Draft is well... draft, no lose of LP in any case. I know climbing that the hardest part was a majority of games, someone is already running their mouth and trolling so I dodge to prevent a lose of 10 LP. Just, Riot system isn't perfect and nothing is in this world.. Doesn't mean it can't be improved. Just currently, it seems like the true offenders never get punished while those who try to avoid those issues are. Kinda like how the ban system is, major offenders it takes FOREVER to ban while those who have an off day seem to get banned fast...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Broken Bandle","date":"2017-12-30T22:44:17.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I often end up banning Zoe if we don't have first pick because I loathe her.\n\nEven if we do have first pick....What usually happens is that I asked whoever has first pick to communicate with the Zoe player for a trade.

Plus ranked flex doesn't allow 4-mans... The other thing to consider is that riot could simply establish a better system for those type of tickets since there are cases where the # of reports might be fake so they ignore it. Plus trying to communicate your champion.. I mean there is a enough time to select them and wait. Even if you spam \"I'M PLAYING ______\" doesn't mean they care or will pay attention.  When people communicate NOTHING about banning ally champ because ____ reasons, even if they are not used in that lane (like top banning an ADC who never goes top). Then just ban them without reason or warning, it's just like someone smacking them saying \"Too bad, do what I want.\" People could say \"Go blind, no champions banned\" but that's a fiesta just to get your lane. It'd be fine if you could do like draft and select certian lanes, then wouldn't be as messed up. I doubt Riot would ever establish that or make another mode for that though.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Bandle","date":"2017-12-30T23:47:53.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe that if you don't want a flavor of the month champion banned that blind is for you. If they're over tuned they can be played in most any role anyway. Still, I always try to communicate with my team before banning something out from under them. ( In the case of Zoe, I feel like they already know why I did it and just want to be upset. ( 73% banrate))\n\nThe current system is far from perfect, but no system is. I enjoy being able to have some agency over champ select, and never use my ban to troll....but if communication fails, I'd rather not take a loss because I couldn't ban what I wanted to. Thats why I dont play blind.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
