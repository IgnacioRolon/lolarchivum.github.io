I'm honestly happy to be back. \r\nI am just a bit sad because I just need 27 RP for a project skin orb which is 250RP in total. I have 223 RP. \r\nI didn't want to get a key or a chest because it would leave more left over RP and I'm scared I'll get a champion shard from a chest. \r\n\r\nIn my best effort, I drew the project skin orb. Please Riot send for help :( \r\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-01T17:27:24.126+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meme art is best art!

All from the one Skin Shard Orb you helped me get :D \nThat's an epic skin shard, legendary skin shard and some orange essence! Although it's going to take some time saving up enough orange essence, it's definitely something I can do with enough patience. Thank you so much!
