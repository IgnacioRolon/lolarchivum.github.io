Everything is fine, I get in lobby and fix my stuff. The loading screen goes well too. But the second I've got in game, it crashes. I try to get back in, BAM. Another crash. I try to restart my client, BAM. It crashes again when I get in game. I've tried 7-8 times by now, but it's always the same result.\r\nWhat is causing that?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T03:09:19.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there may be either an issue accessing your display driver or something wrong with your input settings.
