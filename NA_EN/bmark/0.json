I have tried everything. I have re-installed multiple times, I have allowed League through my firewall, i have turned off my firewall, i have gone into my router and tried to port forward. Nothing has worked. I downloaded the hextech repair tool and sent in a support ticket a long time ago and never heard back. I am at a loss. I love this game and have been a player for years but lack of help with this matter is really starting to bum me out. any suggestions would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nP.S. i have also checked into my internet and it is not the issue either","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-22T03:56:42.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your internet is definitely the issue. Port forwarding would have absolutely no effect, you are not hosting a server or using peer-to-peer connections. Neither will doing anything to the game client.\n\nCheck your router event logs while using the practice tool, see if anything happens when you get a disconnect.","replies":[{"poster":"BMark","date":"2019-10-22T04:08:50.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My internet is not the issue. I have done loads of testing. I have 0% packet loss as well as a stable internet connection. also if it was my internet my other games would be effected but i can still play heros of the storm, diablo 3, starcraft 2, apex legends, team fortess, and many other multiplayer games with no issues whatsoever. this is a Leauge of legends issue.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-22T04:39:32.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are no current server issues, let alone persist ones. Thus it is an issue with your computer, LAN, or ISP. There are not any other options.\n\nWhat testing have you done? Your mention of ports and packet loss suggests you know nothing about networking, neither of those are relevant or would indicate a router dropping a connection due to excessive UDP packets.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AceInYourHole","date":"2019-10-22T04:02:51.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same issue.
