Well, she&#039;s currently sitting at a massive winrate.  70%.  Next closest is 63% with Ziggs.\r\nhttp://www.lolking.net/charts?region=all&amp;type=champion-winrate&amp;range=weekly&amp;map=ha&amp;queue=normal\r\n\r\nWhat&#039;s so strong about her?  It&#039;s not just her ult or the heal, it&#039;s that she&#039;s able to just about everything.  She can move in, hit you with a powercord + Q [adding on the lich bane and luden&#039;s procs] and walks away safely.  She can sustain the team with a chalice and has rapid movespeed for herself and those around her.  She can snowball ult and heal the team up with the mana regen that the map gives.  The heal isn&#039;t a big heal but it&#039;s so spamable now.  Her healing/sec is higher than before.  She can speed up the team and slow one person down.  She can also reduce their damage output.\r\n\r\nDamage, sustain and utility.  Soraka is close but the %hp and mana costs mean that Soraka needs to pick between tank/hp battery Raka or a damage mage Soraka.  Sona can do it all with Chalice, Lich bane, Deathcap, voidstaff, ludens and boots.  Or even sell the boots for another item.\r\n\r\nMost of the balance is done for Rift, I get that.  But we&#039;ve had champions tweaked for ARAM.  I think we might need to adjust that as well as the changes have really made her the ultimate carry/support that just does everything on the map.  I think the issue is how fast her abilities come off CD.  On rift she can&#039;t have the mana for it but on the abyss she rarely goes oom.  Or perhaps increase the cost of her abilities as well?","replies":[{"poster":"SnowLeopard91","date":"2016-07-20T12:08:36.551+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not surprised that Sona is extremely OP in ARAM.  She's by far the best support right now on SR, and does best in team fight situations where she can throw buffs and poke like mad.  Her power level will probably stay overly high on HA, but should come closer to in line as she gets nerfs aimed at her SR dominance.\n\nEdit addition: My point is that she just got a hotfix nerf, and will likely get hit even more in the next patch, simply because she's so strong on Summoner's Rift.  While she still might need a map-specific nerf after she's brought into line for SR play, right now you're gonna have to wait it out.  If Riot hits her on Howling Abyss while also hitting her on Summoner's Rift, she might end up severely underpowered in ARAM when all is said and done.\n\nEdit addition 2: For your specific points about the nerfs to her, Riot wanted to make her cast more stuff, so they put free CDR on her ultimate, making it so that at full CDR build and rank 3 ult, her basic abilities have about a 62% CDR (or whatever the multiplicative result of 45% and 40% is, I don't feel like doing math right now).  The fix will be in lowering her base damage and healing, so that her core gameplay with the new CDR remains intact, but her overall impact isn't so dominant.\n\nLast edit, I promise:  I decided to do the math, because it was bugging me.  At full CDR and max rank ult, her base abilities have 67% CDR.","replies":[]},{"poster":"amd098","date":"2016-07-21T02:29:51.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, I think that she's not too impossible on Rift, but on the Abyss she's extremely strong.  The changes with the live patch don't change too much as aram Sona builds differently than support.  I think that she really needs to be tweaked for ARAM.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-07-20T11:16:29.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone just realized that sona is op.
