My team is currently seeking a new addition to our main roster! We are looking only for a adc main that sits in mid elo (Gold-Plat). We mainly use Curse Voice for comms and it is a requirement. We are on a pretty active schedule playing together 5 or 6 times a week. When it comes to the schedule we start practice around 5-6 est, (we are looking for people in either EST or CST) and expect you to be there. If not please let either myself or the creator of the team know in advance. Below will be an application that you will need to fill out entirely before our tryouts begin. Showing to us that you can fill out this form will be the first impression that you are dedicated. WARNING: It is quite a long application, so if you do not feel like filling it out then don&#039;t bother looking for a tryout. Also, do not just add me or the leader before anything, it will get declined immediately and your tryout will be terminated. Once seeing the application we will see who best fits our criteria and will be added by myself (IGN: Sh&aacute;w&ntilde;) or the leader (IGN: MinatureBeast). Once doing so we may add a few more questions to ask you, and then we will get into your in-game tryout. Hopefully you will progress with us into the future. Good luck!\n\nAPPLICATION\nAge:\nRank:\nChampion Pool:\nTime Zone:\nCurse Voice:\nReason to join this team:\nGoals on the team:\nOpen to Constructive Criticism:\nWilling to Listen to Shotcall/Leadership Roles on the team?:\nWilling to Obey Schedule:","replies":[{"poster":"CheerfulScoreb","date":"2017-03-12T23:44:48.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Age : 20\nRank : Plat 1\nChamps: Jhin Varus Vayne MF Twitch\nTime zone : EST\nCurse voice : Not yet but soon will do\nReason to join : Always wanted to see if I could improve as a player if I joined a team\nGoals : Do as best as we could\nOpen to criticism : Always if they are constructive as mentioned\nWilling to Listen to Shotcall/Leadership Roles on the team? : Of course\nWilling to obey schedule: I'll try my best yes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blush uwu","date":"2017-03-12T21:36:42.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Age:18\nRank:gold4/3 on two acc's\nChampion Pool: Meta ad's\nTime Zone:EST\nCurse Voice:Yeah\nReason to join this team:Everytime i joined a team i improved a lot and i want to keep improving \nGoals on the team: To get better And win if torneys :D \nOpen to Constructive Criticism: Yes\nWilling to Listen to Shotcall/Leadership Roles on the team?: Im kinda shy i guess so i dont really talk too much so i just listen XD\nWilling to Obey Schedule:All i do is play this game so yes >.<","replies":[]},{"poster":"Muzzik","date":"2017-03-12T02:03:09.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Age: 22\nRank: Challenjour\nChampion Pool: {{champion:41}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:41}}  and {{champion:41}} \nTime Zone: Australia Time\nCurse Voice: No but I only use Mumble\nReason to Join: I wanna get better results in solo queue\nGoals: To get better in Solo Queue\nOpen to Criticism: No im self conscious\nWilling to Listne to Shotcall/Leader: Im a rebel\nWilling to Obey Schedule: eh i have better things to do","replies":[]},{"poster":"brain rot","date":"2017-03-12T01:36:59.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Age: 23\nRank: season 3 diamond, season 6 plat, current: silver 3 (soloq)\nChampion Pool: nidalee, graves, kindred, gragas, chogath, khazix, rengar, olaf, warwick, xin\nTime Zone: est\nCurse Voice: yea\nReason to join this team: looking for new team for tournaments\nGoals on the team: climb ladder\nOpen to Constructive Criticism: yes\nWilling to Listen to Shotcall/Leadership Roles on the team?: yes\nWilling to Obey Schedule: yes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hallbuster","date":"2017-03-12T01:22:45.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll come back after I leave bronze.","replies":[]}]}
