I&#x27;ve been playing a lot of mid this season but I have over two years of experience at purely ADC and two more years before that as a support.

I&#x27;m aware my current rank is a bit low but all I can ask is that you give me a try and judge me off of that.\n\nEdit: I do in fact own discord and use it constantly as my main voice comms.","replies":[{"poster":"MaChInImEr","date":"2017-02-26T00:04:04.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ScorchOne23,realm=NA,application-id=K6EGEal2,discussion-id=rAgngirb,comment-id=000d0000,timestamp=2017-02-25T23:56:40.064+0000)\n>\n> Edit: I do in fact own discord and use it constantly as my main voice comms.\n\nAdded","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MaChInImEr","date":"2017-02-25T21:11:54.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Age?: 20\n\nChamp Pool?: Thresh, Blitzcrank, Alistar, Sona, Malphite, Olaf, Tryndamere, Annie\n\nCurrent rank(Solo/Duo)?: Silver 5 (In promos for s4)\n\nCurrent rank(Flex)?:None\n\nRole you're trying to fill?: Support/Top\n\nTime zone?
