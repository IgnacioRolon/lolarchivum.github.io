Teammates reporting me for no reason.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please guys, do you people think I'm inting? In a game, our yasuo who fed the enemy yasuo 7 times complained that I was feeding. I tried my best to help him by ganking all the time to prevent their enemy yasuo from getting more cs and being more fed. Apparently I died 4 times. The sad thing is, I said I was trolling. I didn't mean it like that. When I say \"trolling\", I didn't mean trolling my team, I meant that the enemy team will be \"trolled\" when they are playing against a yi. \r\n\r\nBefore minions spawned, I said \"i am pentakill one trick no skill yi\" as a joke (really don't have to explain it). And this yasuo used that as the evidence of me \"trolling\", saying that I promised I would get a pentakill but I didn't LOL. Somehow 3 people also started flaming me saying I was \"trolling and inting\". I said \"I'm inting because their yas is too fed\". \r\n\r\nMy team thought that I was purposely feeding to their yasuo when I'm not! I quickly knew that I worded it wrong. I basically meant that \"my kda is bad only because your laner is too fed\", but my team thought that I was inting only because I practically gave up (which I never meant). I tried explaining to my teammates that I worded it wrong and I told them what I really meant, and how they were just confused as to what I was trying to say.\r\n\r\nApparently, they flamed me more saying that I was lying and that I only say that so I wouldn't get banned by riot. I don't know what to do here. I explained them everything to saying that they just misunderstood me. I even said that I swore to god and on my own life that I'm not lying and that I'm trying my hardest and I'm not purposely trying to die. Somehow they still think I'm lying. The entire team except one person threatened to report me. I told them everything I can but they just won't believe me!\r\n\r\nNow I'm scared I will get banned. They are dead serious. Will Riot employees ban me?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-16T05:14:47.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as you were legit trying your best (and we can usually tell the obvious differences between inting and actually trying) you should be fine. Getting reported by a lot of people at once doesn't mean for sure you'll get any punishment, it just means we may need to take a closer look. As far as I can see right now, this account looks pretty okay.","replies":[]}]}
