I do not see how Shaco fits in with the theme of CLARITY. \n\n1. His Q is not an ultimate (nor should it be). \n2. The player has control over its activation, unlike LB and Teemo.  \n3. There is no demarkation of activation. Wukong and Talon begin their steal where they are; they cannot blink over walls into a bush then disappear every 10 seconds. Akali is bound by the aoe of her shroud. \n3a. The mana cost of these spells increases with level. Shaco's *DECREASES* with level.\n4. There is no proximity alert, such as with Rengar's or Evelynn. \n\nPlease help me understand why Shaco is exempt from the past stealth nerfs.\n\n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"eyes wide shut","date":"2015-02-05T18:55:01.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"um. twitch has no stealth indicator. buy pink wards. upgrade your sweeper. it's that simple.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDr√°co","date":"2015-02-06T03:51:31.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it had an indicator it would effectively delete Shaco from the game.
