These leaves still cause others a negative experience, so your best bet is to play consistently without interruptions and do your best to make it back if something does happen.  20 minutes of waiting does indicate a history of leaving games, due to the escalated wait time.  With your standing improving, an issue beyond your control won't penalize you harshly.  If you have any other issues that's causing you leave, let me know and I'd be happy to help!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rawbeefy","date":"2016-08-24T13:25:24.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of people have been getting lower priority queue for the minimalist things. Game crashed for a few minutes, lower priority queue. Go afk for 4 minutes or so for something urgent, lower priority queue. Sorry bud, but I don't think this will have much attention.","replies":[]}]}
