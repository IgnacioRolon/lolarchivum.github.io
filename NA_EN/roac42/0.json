It is only during me playing league. Ive disconnected twice in two games which has put me in the lower tier. I would like to know other people are having this problem as well as you acknowledging this is a problem. Any help/suggestions would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-10T00:13:10.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While there may be other players (especially here in Help and Support) who have similar issues, we aren't seeing any widespread server-wide disconnects.  That is not to say that the problem is solely on your end, but we do need to eliminate some possible root causes because we can get to heart of the issue and why this is occurring.  Because of this, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).  I know there are a ton of steps there, but they are crucial in hopefully resolving this issue or removing some possible root causes.\n\nLet me know if are still seeing these disconnects!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaycie","date":"2016-05-09T22:44:13.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same problem, not every game but every few games.
