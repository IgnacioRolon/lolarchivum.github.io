Open your File Manager, go to your C Drive. Then, click on the 'Riot Games' Folder. Then click on League Of Legends, then RADS. After that, click on the 'lol_game_client' folder. Then, delete the file titled 'filearchives'. Then, open up your client again, and commence the re-patch!

There have been more hotfixes than usual this week which is why scanning is constantly being triggered. Restarting the patcher will actually slow down the patch because the patcher will have to rescan your files to pick up where it left off. This is totally normal and could take some time (up to 20+ minutes). Also, if your hard drive is almost at capacity, this could slow down the download as well as the applying patches process. Clearing up some old data on your machine and restarting the patch could speed things up although it still may go through the \"scanning files\" process.\n\nIf you could send me your logs that would help me out tremendously. A 33% issue can really be anything but everyone in this thread seems to be having similar issues so the more logs I get, the more likely I will be able to track down the root cause. You can upload them to Drop Box or Google Drive and PM me the link. (make sure to make the link public)\n\nHow to obtain patcher logs:\n1) Launch Patcher\n2) Press on Help Icon (\"?\")\n3) Press save logs\n4) Upload to Google Drive or Drop Box\n5) Share link with me\n\nExtra Stuff!!

IT DID!! or not... My launcher stopped scanning files after about 10 but then proceeded to download 3 Gigs of data. This was a minor patch. I was in curse call with my friend and he was able to get the patch in less than 3 minutes where as I took 5 to get through the first stage(up to 33%). My Laptop is much newer than his and I have a much stronger hardware/Internet connection, so it really makes no sense to me why this is happening. It just doesn't make sense why Riot, a REAL company, that makes REAL money, that has REAL employees, that get paid REAL money, can't make a REAL game. REAL games work for the consumer, which by the look of this discussion obviously isn't true about League of Legends. Please give us a fix that works, that wont require more than basic knowledge of computers to fix. I work in IT and I figured out how to get rid of old unnecessary files well before I went digging on this thread, but that isn't a fix that people with minimal knowledge should have to use to enjoy a \"free to play\" game that they have probably spent way too much time and money on.
