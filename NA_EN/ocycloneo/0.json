Dragon Trainer Heim was one of the lucky, as was Pizza Delivery Sivir and Meowrick(formerly known as Crazy Cat Lady Yorick). And I believe champion concepts are entirely out of the question, due to the fact that they range from barely even a concept to insanely high quality and detailed.\n\nNo one here posts their fan concepts with the hopes of getting them into the game. They're for fun. If Riot wants to use an idea we post here, they can and will.","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2019-09-01T06:00:17.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would imagine that some champion abilities have been taken from fan concepts in the past.
