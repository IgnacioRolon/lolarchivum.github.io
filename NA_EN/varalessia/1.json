Three normals I played last night, one with Leona, one with Zyra, one with Miss Fortune. Let's talk about the Leona one first.\n\nMy Team: {{champion:89}} (Support, ME :D), {{champion:67}} (ADC), {{champion:114}} (Top lane), {{champion:238}} (Mid lane), {{champion:11}} (Jungle).\n\nEnemy Team: {{champion:5}} (Jungle), {{champion:268}} (Support), {{champion:236}} (ADC), {{champion:31}} (Mid lane), {{champion:41}} (Top lane).\n\nYou know what? Even though we were the team with broken-ass sated devourer Yi, all in all that game was honestly fun. I loved going against the Azir botlane support, congratulated him for it afterwards if I recall correctly. And damn, Lucian ADC? You know that guy no one ever uses? He whooped me early game! But I still had fun, because it wasn't the norm! But the actual game as a whole? I felt so bad for their team! Literally, all of them were building non-OP items (Xin went warrior!!!). They used balanced, fair champions to fight against and I actually wish that I could have convinced my entire team to surrender and honor them just for actually having the confidence to do that and not just dishing out the BS that is the group of popular champions as of late. Bot lane was fun, but the fact that we had meta champions on our team was quite disappointing if you ask me, but whatever, I'll deal with it.\n\nSecond game I played as Miss Fortune:\n\nMy Team: {{champion:21}} (Me, ADC), {{champion:64}} (Jungle), {{champion:74}} (Mid lane), {{champion:131}} (Top lane), {{champion:412}} (Support)\n\nEnemy Team: {{champion:119}} (ADC), {{champion:412}} (Support), {{champion:77}} (Jungle), {{champion:238}} (Mid lane), {{champion:157}} (Top lane).\n\nDamn, this is one of those games that I'm hoping Riot would finally say \"Miss Fortune really needs a legitimate rework.\" Being immobile as I am (That is, no dashes or flashes), I got DESTROYED!!!!!!!!!! Not only bot lane against the automatic Thresh enemy support (I wish I honestly didn't have Thresh supporting me) literally being able to stand IN FRONT of my minion wave and FORCING me to stand back and hide because there's nothing I can do in fear of being grabbed and automatically killed by his BS of CC. And the best part is? My Thresh sat under turret the entire game, and waited for them to engage! Did we win lane? Actually, yeah, he got one really sick grab and gave me a double kill, and then I just snowballed. But late game... may I just say how unfun that was? I guess it was a taste of my own medicine for using someone close to meta last game (Leona), but seriously, I wish we had just surrendered the second it hit twenty regardless of the possibility of winning, because I legitimately wasn't having fun anymore. It's not enjoyable to get elated by Zed, and Yasuo at the same time. It's not enjoyable to know that you are one of few ADC's that cannot make it out of those sort of... hard engages to say the least. It wasn't enjoyable. Damnit I want to use Miss Fortune and prove to the world her strength, but the problem is that, what she has in actual damage is lost in her ability to escape ANYTHING. It's so frustrating I could scream! And don't even get me started on how broken Udyr and every other sated devourer jungler is. Look, I get it; in LCS, it isn't broken! You know why? Because in the LCS, they are all five, on a call, with their coach right? They communicate verbally! They can convince each other \"Hey, Udyr is going to BS late game, so what we need to do is choose one lane and push hard before he can get his sated!\" \"Wow smart idea guys, let's do it!\" Things like that. But the issue is that the best counter to this sort of BS (if you ask me) is good communication, and typing in chat isn't even close to what can be accomplished through skyping. Damn I wish they had a voice application in this game... would use it to speak to everyone regardless of how much of a nervous wreck I am tbh. We need this sort of communication to deal with these champs, otherwise we simply don't stand a chance. Do I think Sated Devourer is OP? No, honestly I don't, because it has counterplea. But it's best counterplay is legitimately IMPOSSIBLE to pull off without being in a high enough rank that you actually all know each other, are on a team, and Skype each other whilst playing to strategize. You can't do that in game. Too many stubborn people want to do what THEY want. Too many people don't even use chat, and just mute everyone prior to the beginning of the game (And to those that do it, kudos to you! You're choosing not to deal with absolute bullcrap from your team members, nice job!). Too many people sometimes don't even speak english (no joke, I legitimately have matched up with people who speak very little English and I find it astonishing). Sorry everyone who chooses to read this; that was quite a rant. Anyways, what I was trying to basically say was that, with the most recent inventions enabling so many champions to outperform the others, I can't use my queen Miss Fortune anymore and expect a victory. I simply cannot. She does not stack up against the others. I honestly am totally fine with nothing being done to her ultimate; it's really good, it's just people don't like to actually strategize and think about when best to use it, so when people get interrupted with it, or when people get killed during its usage, they instantly complain about it on the boards instead of thinking \"Wow, where could I better place my ultimate so as to inflict the most damage without being killed? Oh, maybe when the enemies abilities are on CD? Yeah, I'll try that next time!\" \"Wow, I just killed three people with my ultimate! It actually works!\"\nANYWAYS, I forgot to mention something. This was the same game where my poor Heimerdinger gets flamed by my Diana and Thresh for \"feeding Zed\". Are you fucking kidding me? They literally told him to uninstall and quit forever, and reported him post game, for feeding Zed. He was trying to explain himself and nobody would listen to him. In all seriousness, I EXPECTED him to lose. How do you even win against such BS? But they still chose to flame. I was honestly half tempted to 1v1 both of them as Zed and force them to use Heimer just to make my point, but I decided against it. I decided to friend this Heimerdinger and apologize profusely for my teammates ignorance, and we played the next game together. But honestly, so help me if I have to see this sort of atrocious behavior towards people who use non meta champions and lose against meta ones...\n\nThird game I played as Zyra:\n\nMy team: {{champion:143}} (Me, Support), {{champion:119}} (ADC, was actually the ADC from last game that I chose to be friends with because he was the only balanced, fair, fun champion on that team to go against and to use, I thanked him post game and offered to support him next game), {{champion:134}} (Mid lane), {{champion:67}} (Top lane), {{champion:98}} (Jungle, this was the Heimerdinger that got flamed the previous game for losing to Zed, I apologized profusely for my own teammates poor behavior towards him when he could literally do nothing considering how immobile he was). \n\nEnemy team: {{champion:131}} (Top lane, same Diana I was with before that flamed the poor Heimerdinger), {{champion:67}} (ADC, who else but her? :P), {{champion:53}} (Support, because \"Synergy\"), {{champion:268}} (Mid lane), {{champion:77}} (Jungle, also went sated ;)))))))).\n\nHonestly, this was my favorite game of the night. It was so enjoyable, and no, I'm not talking about laning phase. I'm talking about the fact that none of my teammates gave up, when we gave Vayne two kills bottom lane. How, we continued to fight for victory even with what we were up against. And you know what? We won! We contested Baron and we ended up demolishing them near Baron pit with my Vayne and I being the only sacrifices! I was even using an off meta support omg I was so cheery. We were even dealing with Meta buillshit!!!! But then unfortunately post game chat the enemy Vayne has the audacity to say \"GG easy\" because who else but Vayne? But regardless, what made this game fun was that all of my teammates continued to fight for victory, and we actually made it through all the way to victory, regardless of how frustrating beginning game was. \n\nAll in all, those three games were mostly satisfying, aside from the Miss Fortune game. However, they would have been EXCEEDINGLY more fun if meta champions were not used. It's just.. they aren't fun to play against. At all? Was the game all-in-all fun? Yes, all three were for the most part. But they weren't \"Wow, I had so much fun that I'm going to go use another off meta champion!\", but rather \"Wow, I had lots of fun, but you know what seems more fun? Using bullshit! Time to try it out!\" I don't like leaving games contemplating if I should start using meta champions because they seem so much more fun. I like leaving games still being able to use off meta champions. I'm genuinely concerned however, that eventually I literally won't be able to use ANY off meta champions and expect a victory, and instead it will turn into a game of \"Which team has *insert BS champion here*?\" Oh how I miss the game back in December/January, back when I first started playing and these champions weren't used all that often...","replies":[{"poster":"Citavista","date":"2015-09-01T01:03:04.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Master Yi with Sated isn't that broken.\n\nNow let's talk about on-hit Twisted Fate with Sated, Wit's End, Blade of the Ruined King, and a whole bunch of Gold Cards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EkkoFroffles","date":"2015-08-30T19:20:00.202+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing normals exclusively for months, and I'd honestly say I see just as much outside-the-box stuff as I do people spamming Vayne and all the other FOTM champions.

Back when I started at the beginning of S2, I remember how I used to see a wide variety of champions and it was almost rare to see the same champion three times in a row. People tried wacky builds, /allchat seemed to have more friendly banter instead of actual insults or plain silence. I do acknowledge there was a fair amount toxicity back then too, though.\nI'm one of the people who don't bother with ranked- I got Silver in S3 when I did my placements just to see where I'd end up. I have too many awful memories from Halo 3 and how my experience was ruined when I felt a massive need to always win. And even if I got to rank 50 in Lone Wolves playlist, no fun was had, every death was stressful and every loss hit my mood harder than I'd like to admit. I've decided to strictly stay out of ranked gametypes in every game because of it.\nBut when normals start feeling like ranked matches... what's the point? Why would I want to play? :l","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knalxz","date":"2015-08-31T07:48:57.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well OP I'm unranked and what you've said you don't see is what I see all the time. I actually can't remember the last game I had where some one didn't say GL HF. I also continually change it up with the champions i play and I see a wide variety of different ones being played. Not to long ago I saw a melee bot and before that an AP bot.\n\nIf you're looking for a more chilled environment, just don't get a rank. That alone says you're wanting to compete with the elites or you're in it for the competition. My first year of league was spent in ranked and I saw alot of the shit this community has. This year i've spent all of it unranked and I'd think it was playing a different game.\n\nAlso you'll find alot less tryhards on 3v3, Dominion, ARAM, Customs and the PBE (depends on what's been updated). \n\nI can have fun with league but the one thing that drawing me from the game is how Riot is just makes a random change to force in the meta. I haven't been around in league for a long time but what's wrong with the idea of everyone being a viable pick? Really, does it take over a year to rework Poppy or is riot just trying to spread around their content so they don't have any droughts? It's a good business tactic and I understand it but that doesn't mean it's fun because we still have to deal with the broken messes they haven't changed.\n\nHell it's pretty much confirmed that Riot won't nerf Fiora until Riot release the new Project Skins. Could be a reason we haven't seen a nerf to devour either considering Yi is getting a Legendary skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fiveofswords","date":"2015-08-31T07:29:19.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think some people consider those champs op and i think they are just wrong.

Like Quinn. Nobody plays Quinn. Nobody expects a Quinn to do well and yet suddenly everyone and their mother is an expert at balance and say \"Quinn needs to be nerfed\" because they tried to fight me through a blind or tried to jump on me when i had vault. It's the same reason I've loved playing Diana through seasons 3 and 4. I would get reported and flamed in ranked games for picking Diana, but people would shut up if I won their games for them. Same thing with AP eve with DFG, fairly powerful but people flamed me for doing anything other than AD or Tank eve.\n\nYes there are champions that are stronger than others but if you really want to solve the champion diversity problem, you'll have to reach outside of your comfort zone and play champions that reddit tells you are bad. Have fun playing champions you love and suddenly the game becomes much more enjoyable.\n\nBe the change you want to see.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hgjkdlsaf jeldvb","date":"2015-08-31T07:07:14.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been meta long as I remember.

Now.... that happens like once a month at best.\nWith the current meta it's just a painful, boring drag with a very small champ pool and a low chance of enjoyable comebacks. \n\nYes, people got really sick of the assassin meta, really quickly but I liked the fact that even though assassins reigned supreme, EVERY FREAKING CHAMP WAS VIABLE. I could play naut, zyra jungle, ad TF mid, the list goes on and even with 2 assassins on the enemy team(mby kha and zed), someone could usually peel for you.\n\nNow, we have people as tanky as pre-nerf mundo with the damage of pre-nerf ekko. \nLike darius, garen, gnar, gragas, irelia, skarner, diana, cho, renekton and j4 just to name a few offenders, all of these champs need merely one core dmg/tank item, whether it be hydra, tri force, cleaver, or HP item. Upon full build with their single core item+the rest, makes them into **apparent** 4K hp hyper dmg AD/AP carriers.\nThese hyper carry  damage tanks are killing the game. A tank should be a freaking tank, and a carry should be a bloody carry. Not both.\nEG: diana shouldn't be able to build a rylais or abyssal and somehow be tanky enough to survive any burst most mid laners could dish out. Or gragas being able to build zero dmg items and somehow burst a carry **seemingly** as effectively as a full ad zed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CoffeeDave","date":"2015-08-31T06:34:58.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having a blast with Dominion.
