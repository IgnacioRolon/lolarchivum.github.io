Firstly is that with him being so new, no one had time to practice against him and learn counters.  The second yes being that he was released a bit overpowered and needed a few love taps.

I mean, let's be honest, adding an entire 3 seconds of chain-snaring early game was the breaking point that pushed him. His Rune Prison already had a WAY harder scaling, and was outright better at Rank 3 in 5.8 than it is now.\n\nAnd I'm not saying that these buffs made them op, but it gave them something to be viable for, at the very least a niche. No one plays Urgot or Varus every game, but they play them in composition that they fit in, and as counter-picks, rather than as out-right picks overall.\n\nAs for Viktor, it helps that other low mobility mages like Kog'Maw, Varus, and Cass came back into competitive play. His high burst combo makes his trades nice and his CC, while unreliable, is good as a zoning tool in teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2015-06-30T18:40:29.847+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i admit - im talking about specific champions that shot up in popularity, not the ones that are overall strong.
