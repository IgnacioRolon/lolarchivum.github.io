I've been on my computer for at least 6 months now.. I've gotten the ropes of it now... I know how MY game is supposed to work. In fact, I've been playing league for a long time. I've started on a literal toaster that got so warm you could make eggs & bacon on it, League ran perfectly fine on a GT325m. Over the years I've moved onto better things. I am now more or less rocking an i7 4790k + GTX 1070. It hurts to say that I've seen a massive decline in my framerate since last year. I used to be able to pull between 300-400 fps. Now my frame rate hardly sticks around 200 during the early-mid game it begins to drop into the lower 100's. Until at one point went below 80. Now we are talking about the performance on the rift, take ARAM, for example, a similar thing happens where my frame rate just barely hovers around 150. Not to mention the game visibly stutters and hiccups when entering bushes sometimes. I can for sure say that this isn't my computer's problem. It has been rebuilt completely recently, on top of that I do not have such issues with any other game. I think I actually get a higher average frame rate on Warframe now than I do on League. I surely cannot be the only one that has noticed this? League isn't a demanding game, it was designed to run on almost any computer so why are frame-rates tanking so much? I don't suppose reinstalling the game on an SSD would do much, but would possibly be worth a shot. I understand we have had many updates/changes but they should in no way affect performance as they weren't really visual updates. I also anticipate some of you will probably say that having high frames doesn't matter, or that I should be happy to have at least that many. If my frames dip so much on such hardware, I cannot imagine what lower-end users are going through.\nI know how hard it must be to be the beta here... I understand.. I used to be like that too. But to be good with computers all you have to do is delete your system32 folder on your computers files. That really got mine running. It crashed one time but then it started windows backup and chose a restore point. When it did that it secretly picked a point to where my computers fans glitched and went twice as fast.\nI know wut am tolkien abowt here mk? Now go fix ur game big boy.\n\nP.S.
