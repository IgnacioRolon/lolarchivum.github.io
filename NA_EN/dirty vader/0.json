But now they&#039;ve gone and made that into a sight stone!!!!!!!! Completely ruined my way of playing thresh. \r\n\r\nI used Talisman to catch up to players that were a bit far away. And now i would be forced to run predator on Thresh to do that. Righteous glory can&#039;t replace that since enemies needs to be nearby for it to work. \r\n\r\nThey have also made face of the mountain into a sigh stone. That was an extremely popular item for tank supports. The shield active was very useful to help your adc and other teammates, even yourself. I feel like Riot is just trying to force us to ward more. In the low silver elo there are rarely a lot of wards. These changes might help that, but completely changing those two items doesn&#039;t make sense at all to me.\r\n\r\nHopefully they can add some other items that can replace those two.  What do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Bangtail","date":"2018-01-25T21:18:45.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's what Riot Meddler said in the PBE:\n\n\"We'll be moving the Frost Queen's and Talisman actives onto new items, with a goal of finding costs and build paths so that they're accessible to both supports and non supports.\"\n\nMeddler also stated-\n\n\"We'll be considering something like Face of the Mountain's active for a new item, though aren't as certain about that one. Certainly possible there's a need for a single target (ish) protective item like that that Knight's Vow, Mikael's, Locket don't meet. Purchase rate of FotM has also historically been quite low (versus Eye of Targon), and use of the active lower again. We're less sure that it makes sense to port the active over just like Frost Queen's/Talisman as a result.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skeezicks","date":"2018-01-26T02:26:32.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am extremely disappointed with the removal of talisman of ascension. I play only support and always run this as my first item. It is absolutely essential for my style of play and I feel I have been completely gutted. I get that they want to push supports getting an early sightstone but it seems unnecessary if you simply time your wards correctly. They even granted that they didn't feel a later sightstone had a significant effect on the game. I have refined my support build to center around that extra movement speed boost from talisman. I understand that they will be implementing the active in to another item but I don't think I will be playing any more placements until this is resolved. What bothers me is that they seem to be forcing players to conform into roles more and more, regardless of the effectiveness of a given tactic or build.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-25T21:22:13.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"༼ つ ._. ༽つ{{item:3306}}","replies":[]}]}
