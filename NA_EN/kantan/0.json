Any way to make it load faster?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-17T02:20:02.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm let's check really quickly that the option called **\"close client during game\"** isn't turned on in the client options. With that turned on it will take a little bit for post game to load, so try turning it off and let me know if that helps you see post game lobbies quicker!","replies":[]}]}
