I do not play adc. I play top mid and jungle. I enjoy high mobility and roaming. I enjoy talon, riven, and irelia a lot but I am looking to find more. I saw Rek'sai come out and thought he was cool but kinda under powered. I realize now I was wrong. And fiora has always looks like fun but I don't think she can carry. Tell me if either of these would be good for top, or any other carries you can think of who kinda play like talon, irelia, or riven. And do fiora or Rek'sai play like them.","replies":[{"poster":"Pæan","date":"2015-01-02T21:12:23.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jayce mid/top is awesome.\nA little wonky at first because of multiple passives and lots of abilities, but once you understand his playstyle you will really enjoy him.\n\nquick tips:  Fire your Q first THEN open the acceleration gate.  It gives them less time to react and dodge.\nWhen running low on mana, swap to hammer form, your W passive restores mana on each hit while in hammer form.\nHis W in rifle form is an AA reset, so fire an auto then press W asap for quicker shots.\n\nJayce is very strong in lane and can snowball quickly, he can get to the point of near one-shotting with a good burst and landing your skillshot.","replies":[{"poster":"IIlIlIIIlIlII","date":"2015-01-02T21:26:51.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll think about it but ive tried him and I dont really do well.","replies":[{"poster":"Pæan","date":"2015-01-02T21:32:46.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Expect to feed and do bad whenever you learn a new champ, especially a semi-complex one like Jayce.\nGo into bots and just try out the Q-E combo, normally you will stay in rifle form when farming and poking.\nI also prefer Jayce mid over top because he is very strong against standard laners, especially squishy champs like Brand, Anivia, and Zyra.","replies":[{"poster":"IIlIlIIIlIlII","date":"2015-01-03T00:25:11.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay. Does he play like a lane bully or a late game carry. Is it a possibility to roam or not. My bot lane usually doesn't do well and I like a champion I can roam bot frequently as.","replies":[{"poster":"Pæan","date":"2015-01-03T00:37:11.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With his poke from Q-E and his AA reset with W he can poke very well.\nHe can also Q onto them in hammer form, use one AA for the stance change bonus, then E to knock them away, basically without any lash-back.\nHe also gets a speed boost from stance changing 'R', and from his gate, so he can move pretty quickly between lanes.\nNormally I just bully the enemy laner until his tower is down or he is  stuck at turret and then you can go do w/e.\nHis Q in both forms is an AOE so you CAN hit both of the enemy bot laners, but that is rather hard to do.","replies":[{"poster":"IIlIlIIIlIlII","date":"2015-01-03T00:57:57.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, how hard can Jayce carry?","replies":[{"poster":"Pæan","date":"2015-01-03T01:01:53.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your CS is good, and you can firstblood your opponent, normally you can snowball to the point they cant touch you.\nMy first time going mid as Jayce i went 12-1 (iirc), i was able to combo and instakill anyone.  The only exception being the tank which took a couple aa's after the combo.\nSo he can carry but if you get focused or cc chained you'll fall like anyone else.  His Q=E combo when he is ahead can take half the ADC's hp or more if you've got the right items.","replies":[{"poster":"IIlIlIIIlIlII","date":"2015-01-03T01:27:36.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for this I got Jayce.

I'm not quite sure.  But you could watch \"Pawn\" in the LCS, he plays Jayce and is amazing.\nThe way I got used to him was just thru trial and error.  It just takes time.
