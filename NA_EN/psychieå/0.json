During a game (i&#039;m level 16) one of my team mates said. &quot;LGBT?&quot; I said yeah. He replied are you a guy? I didn&#039;t answer. He said.. are you gay.. I said nonya and a few other words... He responded with well dont come near me or touch me. I muted him. After game I reported him and he told me he reported me for being gay on him... smh. I have had to report about a dozen people in the past week for all kinds of harrassing things. I have never ever ever played a game with so much anger and hatred. Is this common? why does this happen and do reports ban people? what happens when someone gets reported?

When someone is reported, the system will review the game and assign a toxicity grade (0% for no toxicity, 100% for severe toxicity). Think of it like a leveling system,  everytime they are toxic, it adds to their toxicity level. Minor toxicity within the game will add a bit to their toxicity meter, and severe toxicity will add a large amount of toxicity points to their meter.  When they reach 100%, they'll get punished. \n\nThe review process is the same regardless of how many reports a person recieves, so it is pointless to ask for reports.\n\nFor verbal offenses, there are 4 tiers of punishment. \n\n1. 10 game chat restriction \n2. 25 game chat restriction \n3.  14-day ban\n4. Permaban \n\n\n\n\n---\n---\n---\n\nIn the low level games, many of the games are filled with people whom got their accounts 14-day banned or permabanned, they start a new account to continue playing but they haven't reformed, so they are just as toxic. We call this a pocket of toxicity and it gets much better once you get out of the pocket.\n\n---\n---\n---\n\nAlas, welcome to Player Behavior.  This is just the basics of the system, there is much more to the system than this alone. Feel free ask more questions.

Unfortunately if thats litterally all he sais to u its not to harsh of harassment to warrent a chat ban or 14 day ban. That is unless he started using slurs at u.\n\nU did the right thing for muting, as to why people do this. The same reason why people intentionally feed. The same reason people ninja looted back in vanilla wow. The same reason why people purposely jump off the map in ranked overwatch. The same reason why people swat atreamers. \n\nPeople are idiots, people are mean, and most importantly people are sadiats who want to get a reaction. The degree in which it occurs in each person varies  but humans are just jerks like that no matter where u go.\n\nAs for the report system.\n\nThe IFS (automated report thingie) is in place to pick up and ban people for using exceedingly heinous speech, aka slurs of any kind whether they be sexual or racial, and some other exceedingly distasteful stuff. If someone is reported and the IFS see that they said a trigger word, its usually a chat ban or 14 day ban depending on how much of a jerk they are. What should be noted is that 1 report=9 so asking for reports does nothing. 1 is all it takes for the game to be flagged. Once flagged he systema locks onto the player and if it finds that the reports were made in ernest (usually after 1-3 gamea or so of beong reported) it issues a punishment.\n\nFor things like behavioral trolling, the IFS cant do those since its hard for a ai to tell between legit trolling and someone just having a bad game. But it still flags the game for manual review, so if they are trolling they will be punished, it just may take longer.\n\nOverall, keep muring the derps and try to enjoy playing. Some idiot on the internet shouldnt effect your day, so juat keep staying the bigger person mah dude :3\n\nAlso dont hide ur tag. Do wat u want, cuz ur better than randos on the ibternet who wanna pull a negative reaction from u :3","replies":[{"poster":"psychieå","date":"2018-09-03T14:43:26.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the very thorough answer.
