She was picked as jungler to catch people off guard. You know, something everyone is complaining about even in solo que. I am camille main and if she gets rekt so hard she is incapable of junlging, i literally dont care, as long as it means that she can stay relevant on the lane and in que she was intended to be in\n\n> PTA exists, and it works just as fine against tanks. There´s also Last Whisper and LDR, but because Conqueror exists, Fighters don´t need to buy it. But they should have to.\n\nNo pta doesnt work againist tank. 10% increased nothing is still nothing. + I wonder why was jax played exclusively in jungle before conqueror. Maybe because PTA does work after all. And this is so funny that you even bring it up because noone used PTA on top. Camille comet, darius grasp, fiora grasp, gp grasp, list goes on and on. Only PTA user was renekton. One of few champions that could actually lane vs tanks. Now people are actually using PTA because they can actually afford it, because top lane isnt infested by tanks anymore. You can actually play more champions not only tank busters and you can actually go for different runes instead of sitting on same safe rune because you wont beat that tank anyway.\n\nAnother funny thing, last whisper. How many times have you seen that item in game. Not on your champion but actually in game. In last 13 games I saw it once. On my incredibly fed 8 1 3 jayce. Do you know why I could build it? Because I was already winning. You arent already winning vs tanks. You cant kill em you cant get fed. LW is thrash item for lategame in meta where lategame does not exist. So no, last whisper does not exist.\n\nAlso why should a class intended for 1v1 fights even consider buying last whisper when fighting teamfighter? Why should I waste 2900 gold just to take down 1 target who can buy item for same price that give him defense againist 5 of my allies? Let me remind you what are fighters supposed to be especially bruisers. They are supposed to have upper hand in drawn out fights. Tanks have a lot of health and defenses ergo they fight for longer periods. ERGO FIGHTERS SHOULD WIN BY FUCKING DEFAULT. Thats simple game design. Team fighting champion should NEVER EVER win duel with duelist. I shouldnt even consider tanks existence on my lane when im playing pure 1v1 champion.\n\n> It is. It may have a large AOE, but it is still a skillshot. You can call fact a joke any day, but it&#x27;s still a fact. You can miss Malphite ult.\n\nThen Syndras Q is skillshot. Cassios Q is skillshot. Karthus Q is skillshot. Jayce hammer Q is skillshot. However they all have one difference with malphites R. They can be dodged. Well not so much Jayces Q but he has to come pretty close. Malphites ult has travel speed so fast, if you arent already expecting it, you wont flash it. Which is also only counterplay. Flashing it.\n\n> You can´t miss Camille&#x27;s ult.\n\nBut you can get knocked out of it. Whereas while you are knocked up malhpites facerolls his rotation that exhauts your entire fucking team and most likely blows up your carry. Camille needs at least 2 seconds to actually blow someone up. And that is if she doesnt get stopped.\n\n> Never said that they need to run away from Sion, but in 99% of the time they will effortlessly dodge his stuff because it&#x27;s too telegraphed.\n\nJust like any other skillshot? I mean what the fuck is this point? Sion is melee champion that has skillshot taht can force players out of the lane. Sion has mage spell with melee advantages. Imagine 3.4k hp ahri that doesnt need items to scale to deal damage. Only disadvantage is that she is melee now. Is ahri too telegraphed now too?\n\n> He&#x27;s a Specialist. Like Azir, Kayle, Heimerdinger, Singed, Mini-Gnar.\n\nNo, he isnt. He is a tank, he has 6k hp and builds defensive items. He has CC and nuke. He is a tank. Because at this point im calling Darius specialist too and now he isnt bruiser so there are no good bruisers. Cho gath is a tank. PERIOD.\n\n> These champions don´t entirely fit in any class, or fit too well in more than two, hence why they had a class made just for them.\n\nNo they dont. Kayle is adc with magic damage. Azir is mage with auto attacks. Heimer is mage with braindead kit. Cho gath is tank with Darius ult. Idk whats so special about it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2018-07-31T20:57:42.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Because any class being unable to do the job they are intended to breaks the game fundamentally\n\n>but when fighters arent allowed to play then its okay i guess?\n\nYea those are absolutely the same thing. \n\nBoth classes have a place in the game.
