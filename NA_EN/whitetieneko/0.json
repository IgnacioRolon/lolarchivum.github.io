Giving money to the enemy) is one of the main reasons of toxic behaviour, generating insults and rage.\r\nAlso its not fun when the enemy is insanely fed, because when that happens we hardly can win over the enemy.\r\n\r\nBut what if the gold system was changed or reworked?. what if you don&#039;t need to kill at all to gain any money thus not requiring it to buy items?\r\n\r\nThis will erradicate the &quot;Feed or get Fed&quot; problem and leaving players to battle with only their individual skill without any advantages nor disadvantages, not worrying for anyone to get an advantage (not taking in consideration general balance).\r\n\r\nA good gold system would be something like the one on &quot;Nexus Siege&quot; game mode but at a slower pace, passively generating gold without the necessity to get kills or CS, and giving everyone the same amount of gold so there are no advantages or disadvantages leaving the game only to personal skill (and game balance but thats another problem).\r\n\r\nOr maybe implement another system for the acquisition of item that doesn&#039;t involves **&quot;getting fed&quot;**.","replies":[{"poster":"ScissorsNstuff","date":"2017-01-29T02:59:45.733+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"gold does not make you a dick\nfeeding does not make you a dick\n\nbeing a dick makes you a dick, they are that way because they are bad people who reveal their nature when under pressure","replies":[]},{"poster":"RivetAce","date":"2017-01-29T02:58:30.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally think the gold system is great.

There is also no reward for being better than your opponent early on, all they need to do is not lose objectives and everything remains even.  A system with no gold would be crappy to play as the regular game, maybe a game mode at best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-29T03:12:35.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every F2P PvP game has extreme toxicity regardless of what sort of in-match progression (or lack of) it has.\n\nF2P games attract kids.
