Also the one ability in her kit which is the main spell for both farm and poke also has prohibitively high mana costs (30 higher than the standard for ultimates at max rank). \n\n2) Her comboing is clunky since it involves hitting multiple skillshots and interleaving autoattacks. Her AA range also forces her to make good use of that shield to survive.\n\nHence why people are constantly asking for mana cost reductions on her E. Because it's the clunkiest part of her kit, and because she sticks out among similar mages (like Orianna or Syndra) as not being able to clear the caster minions in one combination of ability use (on top of that her E costs about the same amount of mana as most similar combos, but unlike such combos (Orianna's Q+W, Syndra's Q+W, Morgana's W) fails to clear the caster minions most of the time, even with proccing her passive afterwards). Her E also doesn't carry all that much damage by itself, because while it deals a lot of damage Lux has a lot of her damage bound up in her passive, which she can't proc at E-poke range.\n\nOverall she's probably quite balanced, her ult is fairly strong, her combo is pretty damn great when she can get it off, and she is a combo mage with an AoE shield which refreshes itself slightly after cast.\n\n---\n\nAsking for these kinds of relatively minor, mostly QoL, buffs impacting mostly her clunkiness is much more sensible than asking for real buffs (like more dmg vs minions on her E, or longer attack range to proc her passive better, or lower mana cost on her E which can't even clear caster minions).\n\nAnd buffs which increase playability and clarity of play are more important to get out there than straight up balance issues.\n\nI don't care if pre-detonating her E makes her OP, or if her shield coming up slightly earlier makes her nearly unkillable.

Because it didn't. But the fact that you brought it up means you will obviously not believe me because you are just like all the other internet trolls that litter the internet boards. You probably read an opinion/editorial article on some tech news site about how ISPs are doing all these evil things. But you don't actually understand what these alleged things are. And because of that you don't actually know if they are happening or not. But none the less you are an expert on it. Just ask you.","replies":[{"poster":"Minrog","date":"2015-06-13T13:50:14.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some ISPs do throttle traffic.  They specifically target traffic that comes from companies that provide services that rival their own services (think Comcast and Time Warner throttling anything related to online TV/music).  They also charge inflated rates for co-location of servers if those servers would make a rival service more appealing than their own.  Not all ISPs do this, though, only the ones that have been propped up in their government sponsored monopolies for years with little to no oversight on their activities.\n\nAs for the original trollness, yes it sounds like Riot is co-locating servers across a bunch of ISPs.  It should make the ping times very fast for everyone, since the receipt of the data packets will be sub-10 ms (however long it takes to get to your ISP's data center) and the servers won't be bottlenecked on their client side communications anymore.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
