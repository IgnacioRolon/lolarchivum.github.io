I got an email saying that my order had just been shipped and included a order tracking number, however the number turns up nothing when searched and still nothing has arrived. I am confused as to what could have happened because it looks like the package never got shipped as the tracking number is a fake. What should I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-27T17:57:46.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so our merch team can look into this for you and reach out directly.  Otherwise, it can also take a little bit of time for tracking to update on shipping sites, so there's a good chance your tracker should be up to date now.  Otherwise, we'll take a look and see what happened!","replies":[{"poster":"Quyguy","date":"2017-10-29T22:28:24.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was going to put that support ticket in, but looks like everything was fine.
