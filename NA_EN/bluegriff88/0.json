I figured it was mostly due to a losing streak I recently had. Well, starting this season in my provisionals winning my first game. Good start with my first game, until I realized I was placed in Iron 2, Okay no biggie. I play and win my next 3 consecutive games only to find myself winning 41, 39, and 37 LP each game. which roughly put me in Iron 1 ~30LP. I lost my 5th game then won my next 3 to barely put me in Bronze 4 with about 25 LP. My last two games were losses. Since then I have played 4 games, winning 2 (gaining 20 LP each) and losing one (losing 18 LP). Now what is the deal with me winning my most recent game and now only winning 16 LP as now I have a record of 10 wins and 4 Losses. at this rate climbing in soloqueue is going to be impossible. I'd like some answers on what the actual deal is since I play multiple roles and champs and most of my games were in the B to -S category so I'm finding it really hard to believe that I can't get my main account up while on my other accounts i'm gaining 70+ points on provisional wins. This ranked system seems to be getting more and more flawed the more I play on my main account.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-01-18T02:18:59.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your rank is a fairly meaningless number compared to your MMR. If your rank is far away from your MMR, your LP amounts are adjusted to push you towards the rank your MMR suggests you belong in.","replies":[{"poster":"bluegriff88","date":"2020-01-18T02:43:15.549+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically my MMR is trying to get me to go down to Iron 4? because my win loss ratio is 10/4","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Live2LetDie","date":"2020-01-18T02:10:36.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the closer you get to 50% w/l the closer you get to +20 -18 etc.. streaks also get taken into account.

So if you're getting 20 LP then your rank on that account is probably low bronze. My account is Gold 2 and im still getting 25LP and losing 14LP cuz my MMR is higher than my current rank","replies":[]}]}
