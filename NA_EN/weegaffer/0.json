No idea how, feels like a keylog but i'm not positive. \r\n\r\nAnyway, just frustrated that RIOT support is so garbage tier. Even on WoW, there's live chat or atleast you can call in on business hours. Yes this is my alt so I still have something to play on for the time being.. That being said, it's really quite sad/discouraging that a massive company like riot has no livechat or any means of getting in touch with them. All you can do is send an email and just pray? No response from riot support, no nothing, if there was quicker action I could have stopped my account from being transferred. I tried to log in and it said that it was being xferred!! \r\n\r\nAnyways long story short, upset my accounts gone for the time being, spent over 3k on it and gifts for others. Can promise, if I don't get it back i will never spend any money on anything riot affiliated again... RIP.{{item:3073}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-23T03:11:42.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh SNAP, I can't imagine how frustrated you must be watching someone play on your stolen account =(....\n\nFirst and foremost, I was able to find your other account that was hacked and transferred. Rest assured that I've looked into it, and that your account will now be safe for the time being. No further damage will come to your account, and they won't be playing on it until we can find the original creator. \n\nSince you have a ticket open already, those account agents will be able to help shortly with getting your account back in your hands!","replies":[{"poster":"WeeGaffer","date":"2017-05-25T11:03:23.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Days later broporo, still no account back... Still emailing support and getting response in Japanese. Literally feels like 0 support from riot.

I've got your tickets pulled up and something about the email you're using is causing the ticket system to get a little confused. Try using a different/new email in your tickets and that should make it go through to the right place.","replies":[{"poster":"WeeGaffer","date":"2017-05-26T20:33:14.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks broporo, have sent request with new e-mail. Was told I would get a response with a link to reset my password. Nothing ever came, can't reset manually.

Riot support is not \"garbage\" as you say, its actually Very good. For example my friend had an account problem, he had spirit guard udyr skin and a refund shard and it wouldnt let him refund the skin, and within a short time he had it all resolved. Me myself i had some trouble with my eune acc too, once it even got hacked and then banned for cheating... someone had fun i guess. And boom, within like 3 days had it back and cleared of the cheating strike. You have to understand that League is one of the most played games in the world. These tickets storm into riot in million sized swarms. Rioters are also just humans. Well apart from Blitzcrank bot but he cant take care of it on his own","replies":[{"poster":"WeeGaffer","date":"2017-05-23T11:54:35.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=0101010010111010,realm=EUW,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=AE76KANe,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-05-23T10:22:23.812+0000)\n>\n> To be honest i have to stop you there mate.

I guess I was just more triggered that I was watching as someone was actively stealing my account and no way to stop it. The mode is I guess more my issue. Of course it would be a holiday weekend.. anyways within a few hours seems like riot have got it a line on it atleast. \n\nUnfortunately account got suspended last night but maybe that was riot just suspending activity to it.","replies":[{"poster":"0101010010111010","date":"2017-05-23T14:17:55.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes thats exactly what it is, as broporo stated, riot locks every account that has suspicious activity on it. Either the attacker tried again, or simply you logging in was suspicious, since the account was flagged as \"in potential thread\". Either contact riot support or simply wait what they reply to you in the ticket you opened.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Galacius","date":"2017-05-23T01:42:34.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Wee,\n\nI'm sorry that happened to you.
