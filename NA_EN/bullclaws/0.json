And along with that a lot of hardcore fans would spend anything to use a character like that so it would also contribute both rin giving her poblicity and making a large profit for the company. i hope that my words will be heard in this. and if you want to give a 13 year old boy a heart attack and kill him give a shout out on youtube infront of all of your audience and i will die without a doubt\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nsincerely: Dax","replies":[{"poster":"RinTheYordle","date":"2015-04-25T06:59:32.178+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"...I smell cupcakes..
