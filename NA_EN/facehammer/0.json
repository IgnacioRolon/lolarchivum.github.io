Shipping is dependent on your address of course, but all our packages for addresses in Europe ship out of Germany if that helps.  We subsidize shipping for most countries and I don't _think_ there's anything different for Netherlands so it should just be 5 Euros for flat rate shipping to Netherlands assuming you're only ordering the two mystery figures (adding more stuff may increase the shipping price).\n\nKeep in mind though that if there are any special customs requirements or charges for your country, we legally have to declare the full value of the figures and not the mystery price, which is 25 Euros per figure, to the customs office.\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"facehammer","date":"2016-06-13T22:46:51.092+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zephyreal,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=5j3AEnqq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-06-13T20:43:41.870+0000)\n>\n> Hey facehammer,\n> \n> We actually make an effort to not to have duplicate figures in the same order, but this isn&#x27;t 100% guaranteed.
