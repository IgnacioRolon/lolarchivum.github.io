At first, i thought &#039;wowww, this is so sick&#039;, then, it starts to lag. I opened the &#039;collection&#039; tab because i really wanted to know what is that. And when i opened my runes/masteries, their animation and sound weren&#039;t synced, everything started to lag. When i click on a &#039;play&#039; button, sound is played but i need to wait atleast 5 secs to open that. The same goes for &#039;accept&#039; button. Music is played, i wait 5 secs, then it pops up, laggy as f*ck etc. The same for champ select.. Finally i got in the game, my fps was horrible.. I think it was about 15-20.. Then, i just opened up my task manager.. And when i saw my cpu usage at 100% i was like wtf.. At first, i thought &#039;ok, i&#039;m in the game, it might be because of that.. So i HARDLY finished the game, restarted pc, opened ONLY alpha client, baaam, 0.95 GB ram used, and 98% cpu only for client... You&#039;ll lose so much players if you don&#039;t optimise this.. Majority of us play on the toasters.. :D\nP.S. I've started next game on the old client and i had no lag at all..\n\ntldr: Client is awesome, i like everything about it, but it's so unoptimized, so laggy, so buggy.. I hope that final verison will be more optimized for our shi**y PCs. The game is unplayable because of the client..","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Grumbles","date":"2016-10-20T20:46:26.678+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback. We're still very much working on the updated client hence the alpha. Currently one of our top priorities is that it's stable and runs smooth. While we've been able to reduce the RAM usage of the updated client we're aware of the high CPU usage that some players are seeing and we're actively working on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A≈Åokin","date":"2016-11-16T12:11:16.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello everybody ^^ this is actually the first time i join a discussion, reason is, i'm playing on a toaster and the alpha client for some reason literarly sucks up 100% of my cpu which the legacy client didn't do, so now i wanted to play a game and it looks like i'm for some reason forced to play on the alpha client, i started the old one but the alpha opened, idk if just me but nvm, i literarly cant play i get mad fps drops in game because of high cpu usage, please riot fix this soon or im pretty sure a lot of the players wont be able to enjoy the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rebirae","date":"2016-10-21T19:06:57.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having this issue every time I went to play with the new client. I have no issues running with the old one, but the new client, while fantastic in the aesthetics department, just requires so much CPU that I can't really play the game very well with it, and my toaster doesn't see 30 fps on any game at all.\n\nI'm lucky to get 25 fps, honestly. On the lowest graphical settings lol.\n\nNonetheless, I love the new client, but I've got the same wish as most everyone else here: I just want it to run better on my MSI A6200 x.x","replies":[]},{"poster":"uBoss10","date":"2016-10-21T18:26:37.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i play on a toaster but i dont to much lagg, i have some other problems but it's good","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bomberanian","date":"2016-10-21T11:26:25.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I have to agree, it looks awesome, but it lags soo much, also it doesn't tell you when you've been gifted?

I thought i was the only one with this problem.. So the only problem is CPU usage ? RAM seems fine, i got opened both internet browser and the alpha client, had no freezing at all.. While i tried to browse the internet with legacy client i literally needed to wait 20 secs for my browser to pop up. Glad RAM usage is reduced, gj rito. I'm not worried at all because of high cpu usage, that problem is going to be fixed soon.. Everybody reported lags and cpu usage, so riot team cannot just give up on that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mJrA","date":"2016-10-21T06:40:09.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh i dont have those problems at all. I wiont even use the old client anymore xD. I mean of course the client still has some problems, but thats what we are for. They fix bugs kinda on the fly, didnt even realize they patched the soundbug in champselect until now ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kio the Slayer","date":"2016-10-21T06:22:26.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that's why it's still in alpha...lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"cMc Hippie","date":"2016-10-21T03:03:23.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To continue the discussion, this has happened to me as well. I understand that this is an alpha client, but considering riot has been doing this for such a long time now. You would think they would fully understand that the legacy client is causing a lot the issues and know to be on top of things. However, the truth of the matter is, its an alpha client. There will be issues. That is your job as an alpha tester. I understand that you take pride in League and that you may or may not pay them a lot of money *cough* me *cough* so you may feel some type of way about it. All I can say is I get it.  {{champion:104}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathYui","date":"2016-10-20T23:27:32.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the legacy client, I generally run with a ping of 100, but today when I ran it I was sitting with a ping of 5200. Is there at least a chance that the client could fall to the background like legacy does when you move into game?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rendath","date":"2016-10-20T18:08:32.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm getting 10% CPU usage from it just open to my list of champions. I used to leave the old client always open. Not sure if I can leave this one at this point; it affects other stuff when I'm not using it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"negative jinx","date":"2016-10-20T18:02:25.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I faced this issue last week. I was waiting for my friends to come online. Meanwhile I was browsing, and suddenly browser became slow all other apps started responding slow. When I check the task manager, the CPU usage was 100% and league-alpha client was taking so much of CPU. Made the system very unresponsive. It doesn't happen all the time, but it happens.","replies":[]}]}
