I lost LP because of this and had a queue dodge timer.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-12T19:31:22.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really strange that the client was trying to update while in champions select, and I'm not sure I really understand it.  Did it log you off?  Were there any error messages?  You should report this over in the [client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards for review.  It's still in testing, and you can return to the legacy client in the meantime if you run into more issues:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nThanks for the report!","replies":[]}]}
