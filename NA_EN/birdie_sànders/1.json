To use Shadow Assassin in Blood Moon you'd have to be in basic Kayn form for far too long compared to how long those matches last, quite possibly the game ending before you even get the chance to wait out the timer to use Shadow Assassin.\n\nRhast has too much sustain for him to be healthy for the mode, which is why Riot did not add Kayn to the list to begin with. They'll have to disable Darkin in order to use Kayn.","replies":[{"poster":"Inting Pillow","date":"2018-01-21T04:07:22.527+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot said if they added him they'd disable Darkin, also darkin kayn would be shit in that mode, sustain is countered by burst, and he cant build tank due to the item limits, so he'll get bursted down before he can heal.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SzGamer227","date":"2018-01-21T02:31:25.375+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason they didn't include Kayn in the first place was because Rhaast would break the gamemode.
