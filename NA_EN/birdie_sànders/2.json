That is the last, and truest death you will ever face. A point where whatever decisions you made, no matter how grand, will cease to affect anything anymore.\n\nHow horrible it is, that so many people are so close to this end even while their bodies are still alive. They walk the streets, invisible. A backdrop. Scenery to the lives of everyone else's life.
