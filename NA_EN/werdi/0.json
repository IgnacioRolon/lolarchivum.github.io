In this game getting level 2 or even 3 star units is pretty strobg. When adding new champions, the deck size increases (if im wrong, please correct me). For example adding 1 cost unit meand +39 cards to the deck, wath will make the chances of getting the desired coppy lower, and lower still with higher tier units.\r\n\r\nIm not telling the game can not accept more cards right now, but im worried about riot adding new units/origins every month as a way to maintain the players hooked and end up flooding the deck with too many different cards. Do we know something about their intentions on this?\r\n\r\nIf i were to suggest, i would agree with changing the deck every split or season. This will change the meta early enough so people do not get bored, if that is what riot fears.\r\n\r\nAny feedback is welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks,","replies":[{"poster":"PikemanDim","date":"2019-08-02T09:50:03.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe the plan is to have a full new set (or atleast mostly) in the next \"season\".  They are probably still figuring out the best amounts for each tier etc etc.","replies":[]}]}
