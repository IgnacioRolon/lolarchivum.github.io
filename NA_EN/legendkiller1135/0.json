Say I'm playing a game and the enemy team goes on all chat and says report X player for spam/harassment/verbal abuse. But I personally have no evidence that they are saying or doing anything and for all I know a group of people in a skype call are bullying some dude and threatening reports to troll him for whatever reason. I would feel like shit if I reported some guy that honestly didn't deserve it. Like when it comes to all chat I can see that and feeding I can see those things and know what I'm reporting for. I mean after the game is over there shouldn't be any need to hide the chat from both teams. I doubt someone on a public video game is going to be including private information or addresses in  their chats. It would be nice to be able to look at the chat at the end of the game to confirm accusations so that I can report confident that someone is indeed doing the things they are accused of. Of course if they were to be looked at and are innocent then they would just be let off but it still makes me weary of just reporting any average joe they accuse guilty or not. Wouldn't the value of my reports go down if I report indiscriminately?","replies":[{"poster":"freya od","date":"2015-09-18T23:05:06.483+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know, they SAY the end game logs are recorded, but I don't believe they are at all. For instance, i had my chat logs sent to me once like a month ago or something, and it included no end or pre game chat logs at all, even though it would be in favor of toxicity.\n\nMy husband once told someone to kill themselves in post game lobby, didn't even get restriction or anything at all. I think they say that, but they don't actually record them. I've never seen them used.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-09-18T20:16:31.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot keeps the chat logs, and they are scanned for verbal abuse reports.\n\nAnd yes, your reports do lose weight if you keep reporting people that are not found guilty.","replies":[{"poster":"legendkiller1135","date":"2015-09-18T20:55:12.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that riot has it but it would be good if they could allow players in the end game menu to view it as well. Someone says report but after what you just said I'm probably not going to report just based on their word. That raises the question will riot ban someone for verbal abuse if no one reports it. Do the number of reports even matter? Are 9 reports the same value as 4 reports? What I am saying is that I want to be able to see that chat log otherwise I'm just going to end up ignoring any pleas for reports on someone who may be toxic in order to preserve the value of my reports because I have no evidence to support their claim just their WORD.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-09-18T21:27:40.222+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, if someone tells you to report something you didn't witness (like enemy chat), then *don't* report it. 9 reports in a match are indeed no more effective than 4 (this prevents premade abusing reports). Your assumptions on how it should work are basically spot on for how Riot has created it.","replies":[{"poster":"legendkiller1135","date":"2015-09-19T05:14:33.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welp if you could site your source that the number of reports don't matter that would be nice I can't find a quick link from riot when I google if the number of reports count per game. I think the logic is it should I mean a person who gets 1 report in 4 out of 10 games is going to get less attention than someone who gets 9 reports in the same ratio. Not doubting you completely but I would like a reference source.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-09-19T05:27:22.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/37jego/doing_badly_is_not_reportable_being_toxic_while/crncnvr\n\nThere's a lot to learn about the system by stalking Lyte.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Live2LetDie","date":"2015-09-18T20:22:22.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"End game chat log is recorded as well","replies":[{"poster":"legendkiller1135","date":"2015-09-18T21:06:02.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My question is do the number of reports matter? Do 9 reports outweigh 4 reports? Reason I'm asking is because like Deep Terror Nami said my reports value goes down if I report incorrectly. The enemy team could go on all chat and say \"X Player is harassing could you please report?\" I can sympathetic with having negative players on my team but at the same time I can't report that player without evidence because if he didn't do anything wrong and its just someone sharking or trying to troll by claiming someone did something wrong and I buy it my report values go down and my future reports may go ignored because of this. I want to be able to SEE the entire chat log in order to confirm it. I used to vote in tribunal I know riot saves the chat logs but can they not display it in the end game screen in a new tab next to their graphs? So if x player says y player is spamming their chat I can go and confirm it before I report. This question those hedges on whether the the value of 9 reports outweighs 4 reports. If the value of reports is increased by the number of reports it would be more efficient to allow players that knowledge to safely report harassers knowing confidently that they are doing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Live2LetDie","date":"2015-09-18T21:29:44.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=legendkiller1135,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=gNJ3Ecjy,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-09-18T21:06:02.184+0000)\n>\n> My question is do the number of reports matter?

I don't see why they coildnt just keep a log and display it separately but it would be usefull.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
