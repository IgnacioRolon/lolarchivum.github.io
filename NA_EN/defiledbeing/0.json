I have repaired fully LoL and reinstalled all drivers for my graphics card, yet I still get this in game visual bug. When I minimize the game and re-open it, it looks normal for a few seconds then right back to this color issue. I have to close the game entirely and re-launch when in a match and SOMETIMES it will stay fixed but not always. Here is an in game screen shot of the issue. Any solution?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-23T03:01:14.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try running a quick repair if you haven't yet, since it looks like the HUD is displaying fine. Since the HUD is okay, that means this is most likely just some damaged game files. Hit me back up if that repair doesn't seem to help so we can try a couple other steps!","replies":[{"poster":"DefiledBeing","date":"2017-11-23T12:52:41.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scratch that, this has NOT fixed it. Late last night while I was playing it happened again. It seems if I leave the game on VERY LOW settings it will last awhile before it does it, however it is still not fixed and I can not play on Very High when my hardware should support it","replies":[]},{"poster":"DefiledBeing","date":"2017-11-23T04:22:15.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried the repair and it did not work.
