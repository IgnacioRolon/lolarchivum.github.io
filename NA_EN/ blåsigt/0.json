I recall when I first played League, Katarina was a regular choice encountered with the same frequency as Yasuo or Zed. However, after her rework, her appearances equaled a fraction of her prior play-rate. \r\n\r\nPerhaps I just do not know how to use her, fair, (I thought new Eve sucked for awhile LOL), but her passive seems a little too random for the precision required of an assassin champion. Am I missing something?

You have no idea how many times this actually works(like 9 times out of 10 someone will walk over it while you're low health and running away and you can just kill them right then and there). W has different uses for early and late. Early game you can get away with waiting on the W to drop, but late game you can't, so you bait people into it. Like someone else said though, there's just so much CC in the game it's hard for Kat to function, especially considering her kit kinda forces her into an initiation position if you don't have an initiator, and a lot of the time for some reason I don't have an initiator. You just have to think strategically on ways to get them to get on top of your daggers and kill them literally before they can react, because if they have CC and they have time to react you're dead.","replies":[{"poster":" Blåsigt","date":"2018-09-21T08:55:53.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=VoraciousX,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XXMxlYRT,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2018-09-21T08:40:50.981+0000)\n>\n> Late game with W you usually use it to bait them into walking over it as you&#x27;re running away.

Clearly with LB and Rengar, this tactic was a disaster. Feels the same for Kat. I hear what you are saying though. To be honest, this same tactic could be implemented with a quicker deployment time.","replies":[{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2018-09-21T09:02:00.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name= Blåsigt,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XXMxlYRT,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2018-09-21T08:55:53.177+0000)\n>\n> I dunno, I feel like the assassin update was a means of implementing time-gates into the assassin champions' kits.

That would make her too oppressive. What I would like them to do to Kat is 1. remove the E bug where you path to your last target, 2. lower the delay on dagger drops by 0.25 seconds late game. I think the dagger drop time should still start off at it's current level because people need time to get away from it, but late game is where the problem lies. Maybe do something like they did with Akali's Q but instead of extra minion damage make it lose 0.25 seconds at max rank.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Attticus Finch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XXMxlYRT,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-09-21T09:01:08.114+0000)\n>\n> 53% win rate, 5% play-rate.
