The occasional graphics skipping, freezeups, etc.\nNote that it has absolutely nothing to do with my laptop, As i am able to play much more graphically dependent games without any issues whatsoever on steam.\n\nI have searched through a lot of other threads and found no other answer to this problem. \n\nToday I finally made a post because A thing popped up saying that my settings were changed because new settings were added to help low spec mode. And that it basically \"auto setup'd\" my client. And when checking settings it showed low spec mode, and close client during game automatically selected.\n\nWhy with such a good quality laptop and more then necessary components to play league of legends would it auto set me up to be in absolute \"garbage mode\".\n\nWhat is riot doing? Do they actually think I need two 1080ti's to play this god damn game?.\n\nIf anyone else is experiencing similar bs please enlighten me.\n\nEdit: Also, when the game is on the lowest possible detail, in the geforce experience thing it actually shows that my game is not optimized and offers to optimize it, which would end up putting the client/game in full max detail/very high.

I can't even read that with a straight face. \n\nHiradaira I have a 3k computer and I have the same exact issues that you and so many others are experiencing regarding the new client. There has already been countless number of threads posted about people expressing their frustration on this specific issue. Two things i can recommend to you is don't waste your time seeking a legitimate and genuine response from riot. Their client is 100% not optimized. I have run multiple tests between the legacy and the new client, and the new client loses by a landslide.  it is a huge resource hog for starters and also causes massive amounts of input lag in game regardless of my fps. I have 120-150 fps with the new client, where as before I was at an easy 200-180 mid -late game on high settings while streaming. And even though this issue is not as severe for us because of our pc's that doesnt change the fact that there is still an issue. The input lag i receive  in game is literally unbearable. So save yourself the hassle of updating drivers, reinstalling the game, and performing any other kind of pointless diagnostic. Unlike riot I will be up front with you and tell you the truth so you don't end up wasting you time like I and so many others have. It's sad that these devs can't just admit that this issue is blatantly on their end.","replies":[{"poster":"Not HeIping You","date":"2017-05-12T07:10:49.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I know exactly what your saying, it's pretty clear that this client was released w/o any consideration or testing of mid-high end user pc's. \nI mean it's really sad too. Like, all of these issues could have easily been solved if riot had a room that they constructed like, 20 custom desktop pc's of all different varieties from low end budget, mid end and high end ultra builds. And then fully test the client on each of them in both windows and mac setups with average driver installs. and then grind out any issues on all of them. They'd probably pop off some excuse that everyone builds their computer differently, but we really don't. There is no significant difference in playing league if i had a 1080ti or a 780ti, other than the graphics card capability of handling the game. Which league really is mostly a cpu dependent game anyway.\nAnd yeah, theres countless times where I'll alt tab and check and the client will be sucking 86% of my cpu for no reason.","replies":[{"poster":"md litey","date":"2017-05-12T20:43:44.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree Hiradaira and those tests sound resemblant of \"proper beta testing\". Improving an aspect of the game is all and dandy, but when your are compromising the integrity of the game, and the integrity being the \"performance\",  than that's when you take not one, but several steps back in the other direction. If they did a poll on how many players play on medium to low end computers I think it would be close to half if not more, and that's not counting European countries. They are removing that demographic completely from their overall player base.But fuck it \"let's do it live, let's do it live\" as bill oreilly would say. That's the overall image that is painted in my head, when I see half assed shit just rushed out like this.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-10T18:12:04.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These frame drops could be happening for a few reasons.

Hope that helps!\n\n\nMy pc wasn't \"too good\" before the client update, adding a few fancy features and changing some server sided stuff wouldn't change how my pc reacts to it. I would never allow myself to play with less than 75 fps, because that of itself is what the refresh rate of my g-sync display is 75hz. \n\nIf it helps, back in november i played a game with the lcu beta and it was so drastically unplayable I was being forced down to 18fps and the screen was stuttering and skipping. Before the two minute mark of that game i had to quit. Switch back to the legacy client, and then when reloading the game, I was able to play fully normally without issue.\n\nI just feel like someone released this update with poor optimization. Anybody can make and release a game but if it's poorly optimized it will always run in a poor quality set up.","replies":[]}]}]}
