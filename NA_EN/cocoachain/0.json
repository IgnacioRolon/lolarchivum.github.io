Riot and Garena are two separate companies. Garena simply bought the rights to host the game on their servers.\nRiot have nothing to do with them as such.\n\nI would however suggest looking at what MS you would get to Russia or Turkey servers, as these are closer to your location.\n\nOtherwise you should just create a new Garena account, they have a really nice levelling system where you get a lot of BE and champion from levelling.","replies":[]}]}
