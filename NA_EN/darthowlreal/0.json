Ornn hasn't gotten a skin since his release in 2017.Kindred hasn't gotten a skin since May 2016,and super galaxy is not an amazing skin overall in my personal opinion.Riot games should really think about making new skins for champs that haven't gotten one in a while. Ahri doesn't need another skin,Teemo doesn't need another skin.Riot pls,make new skins for champions who need them.","replies":[]}
