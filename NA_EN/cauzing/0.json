I attached USB-Stick and installed the game onto it, it has about 15 GBs so it should be big enough. It's downloading right now, very slowly which could be just my system as it's pretty outdated, the good thing is it hasn't closed and error coded me yet so it might work? Not sure, I'll see and if not I'll submit the ticket. Thanks for all the help still!\n\nEDIT: nvm it just error coded me as I sent the message above lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-24T15:56:54.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll want to run League on your primary internal drive.
