Kept doing it no matter how nicely I asked for her to stop. Then the lux mid starts to defend her and call ME a troll (???). The above few gently messages are literally all I said in the entire game. Is she really going to get away with this and keep trolling games while I'm here looking at locked client? I was the one trying to win the whole game while she trolls, please unban this account, this was clearly an error on the part of the algorithm.

You didn't listen, and so here we are. A permaban in this case does make sense, because in this very thread after punishment number four you still somehow believe that belittling and harassing people during an entire match is perfectly fine (\"gentle\") and any punishment for it must be a bug. You demonstrated no ability to follow the rules, so the wisest course of action if Riot wants to stop you from ruining the experience of other players is to close the account, which they did.\n\nBy the way, the fact that other players do or do not get punished has no impact on whether you are punished. For your account, the only behavior evaluated is your own. No action another player takes justifies you in breaking the rules yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"lnteIIigence","date":"2019-07-01T07:18:06.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"But is it fair?

Would you rather people get banned for something as simple as e.g. \"this lane is brutal\" just because the rest of their team was incredibly happy and almost sickeningly positive? I'm sorry the person who bothered you got away with no punishment, but toxicity isn't a contest, and Riot has enough punishments for anyone who appears to need one according to the IFS.\n\nIf you wanted to retain an account, you should've taken responsibility for your own behavior.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2019-07-01T07:02:11.486+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=lnteIIigence,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=z38EWoA0,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-07-01T06:59:27.089+0000)\n>\n> Definitely more worth a permaban than trolling the game away.\n\nIf its a perma in guessing you had a 14 day ban before?","replies":[{"poster":"lnteIIigence","date":"2019-07-01T07:05:41.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"Now you're dodging the topic at hand because you know it isn't a fair permaban.","replies":[{"poster":"Nik Nikerson","date":"2019-07-01T07:11:58.439+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"No he's not dodging the topic.

The punishment system works in escalating. If you had no priors this would likely be a chat restriction. If you had a 14 day ban it would be a perma. Its like if you commit a crime for the first time or if you have a criminal history.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
