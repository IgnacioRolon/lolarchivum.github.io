Lag report thinks I'm almost 200 kilometers north of where i actually am. any ideas as to how or why this may be happening? i'm pretty sure both are related, but i'm not knowledgeable enough to know how or why.\n\nEdit:\nin case poeple want PC specs:\nwindows 8.1\nintel core i5 4460 @ 3.2GHz\n8GB DDR3 Ram\nGTX 1070 (latest drivers)\ni don't know what model my motherboard is sadly, soon replacing it along with my other less powerful pieces\n\n\ni recently re-installed windows 8.1, was on 10, but my hard-drive crashed,  burned, and was otherwise non-functional.\ni am now on a new hard drive and my only backup OS was win8.1\n\ni have only installed the basics for a gaming PC (steam, discord, Skype, blizzard launcher, and some games) as well as libre office, nothing there should affect anything.\n\nall PC related VPN settings are off.\n\ni've tried all the basic and many more advanced fixes.\n\ntried on 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz due to my unfortunate lack of an Ethernet cable (nothing in my house has changed that might have interrupted signals, only thing I've done recently that could possibly have effected Wireless Internet were things that should have FIXED the problem. (replace my hard drive and unplug my PS4, turn off my laptop, ETC)\n\nI've also noticed that along with the massive ping spikes, I've actually had lower base ping recently, having dropped as low as 54 from 63 average.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Viscarious","date":"2018-02-06T21:51:41.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Gxinva!\n\nThe Lag Report uses your IP address to identify your current location, but it isn't always correct.
