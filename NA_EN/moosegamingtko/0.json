However I have not received a level up capsule for level 34 or 35 and I'm extremely pissed. What's the point in putting time into the game if I can't even unlock the champions I want. Are the level up capsules supposed to only have a chance to drop, or am I simply just not receiving any?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-27T01:50:46.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries! I was able to see that you never got those capsules from the recent levelups so I've got those added.
