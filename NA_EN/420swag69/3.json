Giving me the same teammates over and over only just kills my sanity, making me lose so much LP because my teammates decide to feed.\r\n\r\nWell why dont you just **take a break?** I do, usually between matches where my teammates are planning on reenacting Veggietales I take 5-10 minute breaks hoping to not see them again, usually, I get the same teammates, or similar clones in which they decide to die 10+ times solo, or straight out flame the whole game.","replies":[]}
