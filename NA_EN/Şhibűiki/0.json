Click on that icon and it will bring you to the store's account options, and to the left there will be 3 categories. Click on \"Purchase History,\" and then a little further down there should be a \"Gifting History\" option. If you click on that, it will show you all of the gifts that you have given and received within a certain time frame.\n\nHopefully this helps.","replies":[]}]}
