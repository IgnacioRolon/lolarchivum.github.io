And before we event _**get into**_ a game, I am reminded of all the reasons I stopped playing SR in the first place. The good old fuck yous, reported, role/position arguments, troll or int threats.\r\n\r\nMy goodness... I haven&#039;t such consistently bad pre-game lobby for ARAM in years, YEARS. Every single time we&#039;ve had a RGM that is on SR, or I just play a game on SR with an old friend / someone new to league, I give it a chance, and yet, every single damn time I&#039;m faced with the most unpleasant of experiences.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I really tried to give it a chance again today, and so help me I couldn&#039;t even get past the pre-game lobby.\r\n\r\nAnd you know what, I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t get into a game and save myself all the grief of dealing with people that play like dogshit and somehow justify flaming more than the California wildfire. Thank goodness I avoided the people that decide they&#039;re going to troll and be a total child because they know deep down they can&#039;t salvage the game due to their horrendous play, but they&#039;ll be damned if they admit defeat so better take things into their own hands and be a dick cause then at least they feel like they retain the illusion of control.\r\n\r\nTo all of you that still _actively_ play Ranked and SR, bless you all for putting up with these horrid people. I&#039;m glad I don&#039;t play SR anymore, but I really hope you all don&#039;t become like them. Try not to forget that this is a game, and it&#039;s meant to be fun.\r\n\r\nY&#039;all %%%%%s have a good day.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-03T01:27:34.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why i only play ranked on TT.","replies":[]}]}
