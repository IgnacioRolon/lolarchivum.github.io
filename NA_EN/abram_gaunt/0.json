Its extremely frustrating playing fizz and my w or e not going off until a sec after i activate it, or i click 3 times and my champ doesn&#039;t move. Its not a hardware issue ive already checked. Anyone got any fixes? Its making the game unplayable. i have tried the hextech repair tool and it says everything is fine. funny how 1 command in 10 makes such a big difference, and how much of a idiot it makes me look like in game. been playing the game poorly for 4 years id hate to have to stop now.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-01T20:24:16.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is all input delayed, or just some?
