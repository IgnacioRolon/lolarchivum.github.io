I open the settings in and deselect the check box next to \"Enable Language Filter\" and click \"Done\". Even when I immediately reopen the settings menu, all my changes have reverted to defaults. Is this just a temporary bug or am I just clicking something wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-12T22:52:15.331+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a potential bug or issue with toggling in the client options.  For your specific issue, I recommend posting about it in the [Client Boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) for that team to look at.  Thanks for the heads up!","replies":[]}]}
