What we needed was so that champs who build armor don&#039;t become immune to towers. We don&#039;t need Alistar tanking 8 turret shots in a row at level 6. We need harder ramping damage on turrets so that at the very least players have to toggle the agro among themselves and not just have a tank go in and ignore the turrets. I&#039;m not sure how this change addresses our concerns about turrets ineffectiveness. \r\n\r\nYou could make the turrets do mix damage so champs that have pure armor can&#039;t tank them forever or just increase their damage growth per hit.","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2017-11-21T17:11:41.584+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":3,"body":"I like the direction the changes are going, but I think they didn't add enough health. Personally I have no problem with a large minion wave breaking my tower if I leave lane for too long. Having to pay attention to large minion waves should always be a concern in the game, and making towers more effective against them could nullify the concern. \n\nHowever, while you should always have to pay attention to towers, the annoying part at least for me is when you recall or get killed literally once and the laner and jungler take your tower down from full health in single wave. This is the part that can make laning against certain champs such as Trynd or Jax feel so oppressive. The knowledge that even if you are laning very well and ahead in CS, a single fuck-up and you immediately lose lane. \n\nMaking towers overall stronger but countering that strength by increased weakness to minions is a nice idea, the problem is that 300 health is not enough to actually solve the problem. It is just 1-2 AA's for a strong split pusher, and won't even equate to a full second increased survival time if there is a top-laner and jungler both pushing. What I would like to see is an increase to the tower's armor/MR, especially top lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-11-22T16:05:22.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The last person I expected to make this comment lol\n\nSeriously though, you are right for the most part.

The most annoying part of top lane is when you are winning lane, but die once to a gank and then they 100-0 your tower in a single wave. Post laning phase towers are pretty good as they are imo, any stronger and they would force every game to need 5-on-5 teamfight comps as split pushing would die away. \n\nIdeally, what I would like to see is make the Fortification passive (-50% damage taken) last at least 10 mins on the top lane instead of 5 mins. This will still allow all the same late-game comps that exist now, but would make laning phase feel less oppressive","replies":[{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-11-22T16:23:58.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that is something I really wish they could push for as well. Fortification used to last longer if I remember correctly but it was lowered. I push lanes really hard and without even trying I can destroy a persons tower quickly. Top lane feels this the worst too because now I never want to leave lane. If I try for a TP gank I know I am losing my tower 100% of the time and it just makes that role feel way worse than it should.

I mean yeah, I would _prefer_ some more safety mid-lane and bot lane,  but I don't think it is really *needed*. \n\n> It's why I just play GP so I can at least get some map pressure in top nowadays :/\n\nYeah, I have been going Tahm Kench more often so I can ult back to top lane.

Towers are intended to get weaker as the game progresses.  If they were forever a protective force games go full turtle and it becomes a poke war where you hug tower.  Towers have to die at some point, I don't think just ramping up the damage is an actual solution to game pacing.  Maybe the damage isn't where it needs to be but everyone keeps suggesting they do % damage or true damage and shit but durability shoud be useful against them for dives to be possible, even if they're a little easy right now if dives are impossible the more towers are up the more space you can't play in and thus the less fighting is enabled.  There's a reason we have things set up as is.\n\nIMO with all the changes to make on-hits hurt more tower durability is important.  300 hp is short of what I was expecting but I think a bit more and it should be in a good spot.  The minion buff at the same time was pretty dumb since it effectively isn't even a buff early game at that point, but it means if towers get more armor/hp they should be durable enough to get multiple shots off for that ramping damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GettemClone","date":"2017-11-22T06:24:07.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but the turret changes we deserve - random ass guy","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2017-11-22T04:35:26.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fine with tanks tanking turret shots, they built themselves for it and by the time they've built enough armor to tank like that they're also getting melted by carries with armor pen.
