Literally impossible to play on my macbook pro. The ping would spike up to 500 and then i would disconnect for around 20-30 seconds then reconnect again. Sometimes it doesn't connect at all. Both my brothers play on a Windows PC and they do not have this issue. So I'm guessing it's not a wifi problem.
