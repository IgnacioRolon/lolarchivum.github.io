I remember being so excited that he was getting an ultimate skin, and still believe that it is an amazing skin. However, looking back on it, I have one issue with it. The theme. Spirit Guard Udyr, to me, is a symbol of what Udyr is after Udyr becomes a part of Ionia, and helping them in their battle with Noxus. That being said, the theme of Spirit Guard Udyr fits Udyrs current lore more than his classic skin, giving the feeling that Spirit Guard Udyr is what Udyr actually is, while his default skin is what Udyr was before he was a &quot;Legend&quot;. Ultimate Skins are suppose to be like a champion in a &quot;alternate universe&quot;, not at a different point in time. To resolve this issue, considering that the Lore team is doing a massive overhaul, I personally think it would be better for Udyr to change his lore, to where he was always a part of the Freljord, and never really became a part of Ionia. That way Spirit Guard Udyr wont just be a current version of what Udyr should be, but a version of Udyr if he where to go to Ionia, I.E, the alternate universe feel. However, that may cause issue with the names and animations of his abilities, but Im sure that could be worked around if he is ever to receive a Visual Update.","replies":[{"poster":"Gorgannan","date":"2015-06-15T05:28:45.530+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was a major complaint when the skin was released.
