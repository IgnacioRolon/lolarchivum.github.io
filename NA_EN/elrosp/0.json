If I were you, I'd avoid playing support solo.\n\nOf course, you could've played better, too. Never put 100% of the blame on your team, always make sure you're looking at yourself as a play and accessing how you can improve.\n\nI started my journey as a bronze V and it took me nearly 2 years to crawl my way up to Plat, and I did it with the mindset that EVERY loss I ever had wasn't my teams fault. There was always something I could do better, and that's how I kept improving.","replies":[]}]}
