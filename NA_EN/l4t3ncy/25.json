If you guys have any other questions or comments on things I've missed or you want to know more about, feel free to ask below!\n\nhttp://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/shurima/game-mode/index.html\n\n--------------------\n\n**Are any Summoner Spells not available in Ascension?**\nSmite, Revive & Garrison are disabled.\n\n**How much IP/ XP will I get from a game of Ascension?**\nIP & XP rewards are exactly the same as ARAM on Howling Abyss.\n\n**Is there a MMR for Ascension?**\nYes, it is seeded from your Normal MMR. If you're pro, expect to get matched against similarly pro players in Ascension!\n\n**How do Gold & XP work?**\nGold & XP in Ascension are EXACTLY the same for all players on both teams at all times. \n\nI want to give some extra context here. This means that at any point in time, you always have an equal chance to win/lose any teamfight. Even if you bought a GP10 item, say Avarice Blade, and never upgraded it to a Statik Shiv for the whole 20min game (coz that's a good idea?), the total spoils from your diabolical plan will be ~360G at the end of the match.\n\nThere is no mathematical 'snowballing' possible Ascension. Even if the other team has been stomping, they have as much chance to lose their next Xerath fight as your team does to defeat them, Ascend, and go on a comeback killing spree.\n\n**Can I recall or teleport back to base to heal or shop?**\nNo. Once you've used the Golden Transcendence trinket to teleport into battle, you cannot return until death.\n\n**What happens if people try to camp me on the battle platforms while I'm teleporting?**\nFor a few seconds after teleporting, players are imbued with the \"Phoenix Dawn\" buff, which dramatically increases resistances and tenacity. This prevents any teleport spawn camping.\n\n**Can I steal Xerath with Nunu's Consume or Cho'Gath's Feast?**\nNo. Being an Anceient Ascendant, Xerath is inedible (and not very tasty?). You can still use these two skills to efficiently burn him down, but they will always leave him on 1 HP at best.\n\n**Can I stealth while ascended?**\nNo. While Ascended you are revealed at ALL times to the enemy team, regardless of if you're hiding in brush or playing a stealth champion. Giant sunbeams of light tend to do that.\n\n**Can I stealth while capturing relics?**\nNo. Be aware that if you are Teemo, Eve, etc, you will still be visible while channeling a Relic of Shurima.\n\n**How long before Xerath respawns after an Ascendant dies?**\n30 seconds.\n\n**How long after capturing a Relic of Shurima before it respawns?**\n30 seconds.\n\n**If I kill Xerath just after I already died, will I still Ascend?**\nYes. Any posthumous DoT damage spells, Kog'Maw / Karthus passive, etc, which manage to kill Xerath will bring that player back to life on full health with Ascension, just as if they had still been alive when striking the killing blow. Death cannot keep one from Ascension.","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-09-10T16:43:57.536+0000","up_votes":49,"down_votes":17,"body":"> **Can I steal Xerath with Nunu's Consume or Cho'Gath's Feast?**\n> No. Being an Ancient Ascendant, Xerath is inedible (and not very tasty?).\n\nWhoa, whoa. Let's not get too fancy with all this new lore here. You should make sure that this isn't going to constrain the narrative team and prevent them from telling exciting new stories. Examples of things that interfere with their League of Legends storytelling include the League of Legends, the Institute of War, and in some cases gluten.\n\n> **Are any Summoner Spells not available in Ascension?**\n> Smite, Revive & Garrison are disabled.\n\nMy suspicions are confirmed. Please stop talking about Summoners. Just like it's well known that an activated cell phone on an airplane can cause the pilot's head to suddenly explode, such non-canonical terms as \"Summoners\" can cause Runaan to faint and fall down a flight of stairs by disrupting her finely tuned loresense, which she also uses for navigation.
