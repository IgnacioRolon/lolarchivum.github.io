{"poster":"L4T3NCY","date":"2017-11-06T22:15:48.435+0000","title":"I handmade our Piltover map into wall art for my place","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":110,"down_votes":2,"body":"TL;DR: I made a thing.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/RarlelD.jpg\n\nI was looking around for cool classic fantasy/video game maps for a piece of wall art for my place, but couldn&#039;t really find the size, shape and style I wanted. I was really close to getting the classic LotR middle-earth map framed, but it wasn&#039;t quite detailed enough at the size I was aiming for. Then I remembered we have a sick looking map of Piltover that got released a little while ago, and the res is huge.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/3/37/Runeterra_Map_01.jpg\nSo here&#039;s how I turned this map into a full size piece of wall art.\n---- Note: this isn&#039;t affiliated with Riot in any way, we&#039;re not selling them, not official, etc. I just wanted some cool wall art, couldn&#039;t find any, so made it myself over a couple of weekends!\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/prXwVZE.jpg\n---- First talked to our original artist of the map and got a PSD version with the letters removed as layers (will craft them separately later to be reattached).\n---- Aiming at 122cm x 61cm (4&#039; x 2&#039;) size for the main map (not accounting for frame).\n---- Print the size accordingly with a matte finish (don&#039;t want any gloss, go matte for that old world look).\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/VLy4DIw.jpg\n---- Next is to trim the map loosely to the edges.\n---- Leave a buffer of a few cm around the edges to give a runway for when you set fire to it (years of DnD campaigns and making scrolls for my parties finally comes in handy!).\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/W3SjXsk.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3fLJk6s.jpg\n---- Flame on!\n---- Always assume the paper will burn at least an extra 0.5cms or so long after you blow it out.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/2vt0fe0.jpg\n---- Intentional aggressive tearing and singing in a few feature spots can look cool.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/cJu5o7e.jpg\n---- This is the frame used.\n---- 3&quot; ornate bronze for that phat old world look.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/bUVZLG9.jpg\n---- Easy assembly with some wood glue.\n---- Clamp and leave for a few days to dry.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/QytMxlR.jpg\n---- This is the wooden board that will become the backing.\n---- This 4&#039; x &#039;2 piece of wood is Birch.\n---- The original wood was too light in colour, so I stained it to get the right look.\n---- Practice the stain in the middle (it&#039;ll be covered up anyway) before working to the edges to get the right tone.\n---- Stain used is an &quot;Expresso&quot; colour.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/SA2RyQF.jpg\n---- Printed out the original letters individually on parchment (in a variety of sizes to test).\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/MgNf8OW.jpg\n---- I find repeated folding followed by a hand tear gives the best natural look for edges (kind of soft and fuzzy edge).\n---- Again, add intentional feature tears for flavour (consider common wear patterns for paper along the folds and corners in particular).\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BfArO9g.jpg\n---- First time loosely arranging the pieces on the wooden board.\n---- Checking for size and position of letters mainly.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/S9GzIDu.jpg\n---- Iron &quot;clavos&quot; nails.\n---- Old world style nails to hold down our map and letters.\n---- We&#039;ll actually cheat and do some light gluing of the other elements, so these nails won&#039;t be holding the weight all by themselves (think over many years, the map might eventually tear and fall under its own weight if propped up by just nails.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/EjSGJeg.jpg\n---- Position checking before hammering in clavos.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/46yc7z7.jpg\n---- All base elements are here now. This is what will be framed.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/2Gh6iYz.jpg\n---- Foam board backing. This goes behind the wooden board for support and protection.\n---- Couldn&#039;t buy in large enough size so had to tape together two 2&#039;x2&#039;s.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/01jxn8T.jpg\n---- Checking fit inside frame.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/CiXgr89.jpg\n---- This is the acrylic that will be in place of the glass.\n---- Acrylic is more flexible and durable than glass (also wa~ay cheaper).\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Xsa9l5u.jpg\n---- I honestly wish I hadn&#039;t pulled off both sides straight away and left one side still covered. The static electricity that piece of acrylic generated was ridiculous.\n---- Every piece of dust &amp; hair in a 2km radius was attracted to that piece of plastic. -_-\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/DAt6sRG.jpg\n---- Square dowel to be used as spacers.\n---- Spacers go between the glass and artwork to create a buffer zone (like a mini shadow-box).\n---- This will keep the glass above the height of our clavos nails.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/JnGz2UP.jpg\n---- Stained the same Expresso colour as wooden backboard.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OfRJCme.jpg\n---- Marked for length cuts.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9drcF7z.jpg\n---- Spacer length in on top of acrylic.\n---- The woodboard + foamboard actually sat outside the depth of the frame rabbet at this point.\n---- I added a line of nails along the bottom edge for it to sit on.\n---- That way over time, the nails can take the weight of the artwork, rather than rely on tape to hold it up for years.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9GpNTA2.jpg\n---- Artwork in and taped up.\n---- Duct tape ftw.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/spO3lnA.jpg\n---- Heavy duty hooks.\n---- The whole thing weighs around 20kgs (45lbs).\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/RarlelD.jpg\nCompleted Piltover map! :D Some notes:\n---- Glad I only glued the elements in certain places. The shadow created by things &quot;hanging&quot; off the board is a nice effect.\n---- Can see the gap on the bottom edge created by the spacers. Keeps the glass off the nails.\n---- I almost used real wax on the letter&#039;s seals, but wasn&#039;t sure if it would stay up there year after year under its own weight.\n---- I considered getting the &quot;museum style non-glare acrylic&quot; that doesn&#039;t reflect light and makes easier to take photos/look at, but figured it would look weird. An old world frame &amp; map but then this futuristic non-glare glass? I thought this would look more authentic (even if it makes pics a little harder)\n---- Whole process was a few hours each block across 3 weekends. Most time was spent waiting for things to dry before moving to next step.\n\n-- L4T3NCY","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2017-11-07T04:26:32.945+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very nice summoner!
