That way you could let newer players learn the game, and then introduce the minion advancement as an additional tactical layer once players have some time getting the basics of the game down.\n\nI feel like the concept, both in terms of making minions more relevant, and letting you add power to the minions, is 'wonderful'.\n\nAlso, I want to see some of these items put into the rift. The Rite Of Ruin tome is something I never knew I needed until it was introduced. I think allowing an AP to buy an item to get the pushing power of a dedicated AD would fundamentally help the health of the game. Being able to actually split push objectives as a mid laner with minions feels good, and I feel like Rite of Ruin is perfectly balanced and not OP in it's current state, unlike some other items which I think are outright abusive, overpowered, and toxic (looking at you flesheater).","replies":[{"poster":"L4T3NCY","date":"2015-08-04T21:04:32.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That feels like a crutch.

Many of our earlier prototypes had the Brawlers feeling _very_ impactful, almost to the point where our champions cowered in fear at approaching waves of minions.  While this did solidify the Brawlers as a game-changing mechanic, it greatly downplayed the role of the player, and the game became this odd combination of standard SR play with horde survival play, which was fun but not quite the gameplay we were going for for this mode.\n\nAs a result the impact the Brawlers have is less on the overall flow of the game but rather how you interact with them in lane.  This results in new play patterns in the laning phase and teamfights near the Brawlers, but not a \"upgrade the brawlers and watch them smash the enemy team\" kind of effect.\n\nI imagine if we were to bring back BMB we'd look at tweaking the Brawler system (the upgrade paths are a bit overly simplistic), as well as changing some brawler mechanics or introducing other choices.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kongo Joe","date":"2015-08-04T19:26:43.495+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess this is more about the event than the game mode, but I personally loved the short story. I felt that it really gave good insight into the characters in a way that the lore blurbs have never been able to do (The champion lores have always had the problem of telling, but never showing). Sure, you can say that TF and Graves have a complicated relationship, but this event was the first time that i ever got to visualize the grudge, but yet still get a feeling of how the could have worked as a duo at some point. I feel like i understood the characters better than i ever have before, and the interesting decision to have one event told from multiple perspectives really gave a weight and sense of urgency to the story. I felt as if there were real stakes, and although, i admit, at first i was a bit leery of how the entirely serious tone would match up with a story about a man who uses a magic deck of cards, i never found a place in which the world was no longer cohesive and believable to me. Although the story certainly wasn’t perfect (some of the early parts with Graves seemed a little repetitious, and his very sudden emotional realization at the end was a little jarring), i was still pleasantly surprised to have come out of the experience with, (as you can see) mostly positive things to say.  All around, a solid story, with interesting characters that i found did more for lore building than anything i have seen Riot do so far.\n\nSo I guess my questions are, why was the decision made to create the story, who was primarily responsible for the writing(i.e. was it one person, or was there a specific team), and would they consider doing other pieces for future events?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-08-04T21:00:44.464+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Kongo Joe!
