In discussing Doom bots with some of my more skilled friends (Plat+) we began to realize that while the mode does put players in a very uneven environment, it does encourage split pushing and objective control. This is something I didn't anticipate going into the mode and realize it could be a very effective tool to acclimate newer players to some of these advanced concepts. \n\nDo any of you guys agree that the mode does a good job of encouraging alternate win strategies?

Sure, there are several bugs and tweaks that could be brought to each new game mode, but why recall the game modes that the community loves and not just leave them live?\n\nFor example, the infamous Ultra Rapid Fire mode in June was so incredibly amazing to play and to experience. It left me craving for more URF madness and I was very disappointed to see it leave. When it comes to normal League matches, there really isn't much room for \"fun\" as it were. PvP matches are always somewhat stressful and you are constantly focusing on winning and outplaying your opponent. With the featured game modes (especially with URF), there seemed to be that little injection of fun into League that I think is needed here and there.\n\nSo once again, my question is this: why not just leave these featured games modes like URF and Doom Bots within the live version without recalling them back to the workshop?\n\nKeep up the good work, guys!
