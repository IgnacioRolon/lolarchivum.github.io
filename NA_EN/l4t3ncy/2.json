We knew we wanted a the Poro King early on, and we went through several iterations on ways to summon him.\n\nOne early (failed) prototype had the Poros follow you in a long conga line, with the killer inheriting all Poros from the victim - at a conga line of X length, the Poro King would be summoned.  This led to some very strange gameplay, with players at (X-1) Poros playing super passively, and ultimately didn't feel that different from regular ARAM until someone hit that (X-1) number, when gameplay devolved into the weird holding pattern we saw.\n\nWe later had a prototype where the point mechanic happened for getting a kill on a champion while they were \"tagged\" by a Poro.  This proved to be fairly awkward, creating a sort of unclear scenario in which you would want to use the Poro spell - do I cast it for the damage, or should I save it in order to score a point?  Additionally, the free long-range summoner spell only further cemented the early dominance that high-poke champions already exhibit on ARAM.\n\nThe solution?  Change the mechanic into a gap closer, and make a poro hit == a summoning point.  Suddenly those low-mobility poke champions are quite a bit less frightening, and throwing Poros was a fun thing you felt like you should be doing frequently.  The tagging paradigm to recast was one that players were familiar with (from Lee Sin Q), but changed the gameplay in a way we found quite fun and different.  Even though the end result was that everybody is trying their hardest to be Lee Sin (and resolving those difficult mind/body conflicts), it wasn't the initial inspiration - but we can say that we're pretty happy with how it turned out. =)","replies":[{"poster":"Fomorian27","date":"2014-12-19T19:39:42.032+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Minor QoL change: could the indicator for when you hit someone with a poro be a different color for your target than everyone else?

In that one, the throw was doing physical damage, and the lob magic (and we were throwing around ideas for making them scale on AP vs AD, etc.). What we quickly realized however was that one of the spells always felt “weaker”, especially against tanks: I would buy a last whisper, so my throw would be awesome, and my lob would be somewhat meh, or the reverse with Void Staff.\n\nSo, to make it feel like it was doing good damage regardless of the target/ your build, we decided to make the throw do true damage once we moved to just having the throw. The full extension of that would have been making it do percentage of max health true damage, but that might have been a bit much :)\n\nAs for the second question:\n\nIn general, our goal with the poro throw was to make the players feel “I want to throw it as much as possible”, because throwing poros is, in general, fun. Adding an incentive on death somewhat changes the decision making ,and we felt it would have one of two outcomes:\n\nCase 1: If the incentive was very strong (Think Darius Ultimate), players would want to use their poro throw less, and “store it”. Not a bad thing necessarily, but not what we were aiming for. \nCase 2: If the incentive is weaker (Say, “Get +1 gold”), it wouldn't actually really change your behavior, so would just be additional information that could be a “trap”, as you try to optimize around it even if you shouldn't.\n\nSo, basically: We want you to throw poros as much as possible, and were concerned that adding an on-death incentive could move your incentives away from doing so.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Z46","date":"2014-12-19T20:54:06.251+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to one of your previous responses, L4T3NCY, you've considered a rotating Featured Game Mode, much like the free champion rotation.

Glad you guys are enjoying them!

We don't currently have any plans to transfer them over to regular HA after Poro King, but it's something we're going to discuss given the cool feedback from you guys.\n\nThe Poro King is a concept we'd been sitting on for quite a while, and felt this was the perfect opportunity to reveal him. The key was how to best express his nature through gameplay. Being a benevolent King, we wanted him to be a defensive, utility boon, rather than doing \"tons of damage\". We're pretty happy with his current incarnation.\n\nWe've seen a lot of players requesting the Poro Toss / Poro Dash spell in regular Howling Abyss. Rather than a Summoner Spell, it could be fun as maybe a new item though. This would preserve the longer cooldown impact design of Summoner Spells (assuming it could be worked into a champion agnostic item). It's not something we have planned though at the moment.\n\nAs we've shown in *all* previous Featured Game Modes, \"player perception\" of what is strong and the reality is often not 1:1.
