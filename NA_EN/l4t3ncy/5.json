How is it \"not a big surprise that [you] see champions like  {{champion:28}} ,  {{champion:83}} , and  {{champion:6}} \"? I have come to the conclusion that {{champion:6}}  is a big of a community wide joke, but anybody with enough brain functionality to read over his move set and build accordingly would know that he can easily be a power house if you give him a chance (Triforce + manamune on his Q after locking it with the grenade? Good like fighting that). Similarly, {{champion:83}}  is one of the strongest champions I can think of, being a huge lane bully, a massive sustaining tank, and having a godly amount of damage. Finally, I'm going to throw in this little [Hyperlink](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1729411601/202213646?tab=overview) for an {{champion:28}}  game of mine. I had no clue what I was doing, built hybrid with a Juggernaut enchantment (what the hell was I doing?) and then somehow went 23/5/10.\n\nI want the opinion on somebody up at Riot, is there any bad champions? Personally, I see this game mode more as \"Make a bad team comp\", because there is no bad champions. Give the entire team adc's and then rush thornmail? That's one option. Make them all supports? That's a terrible idea because supports are the sleeper cells of the League that only hold back their power so that {{champion:81}}  players can feel useful in the world.\n\nI suppose that in final, here's a few questions.\n* What champions did you expect to be played?\n Were you surprised by the champions who became used often?\n Why do people think supports are weak? Seriously, I saw an AP/Tank/Triforce {{champion:12}}  (in the {{champion:28}} game) who almost carried.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ponts","date":"2015-02-17T18:56:41.220+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think we'll get any information that will be actionable for us in terms of balance or kit changes that the Live Balance guys don't already know about.

I want to reiterate though that I'd be surprised if we saw anything in Nemesis Mode that we didn't already know from normal/ranked play.\n\nAs to the supports comment, I'd like to turn your attention to the video link below.  At the time these Rioters were in the topish section of players on LIVE (1800 to 2100 Elo).  Now that supports scale so well when they aren't giving all their moneys to the ADC it's even more scary!  \n\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h95HtcUJSCg (Man that old League of Legends...how far we've come :) )","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gathrl","date":"2015-02-17T19:38:34.336+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"What if I accidentally forgot to choose a champion for the enemy team while talking strategy on what we got assigned?
