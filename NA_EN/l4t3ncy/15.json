Basically it would be kind of a mix between URF and regular league in the since that it would have fast paced team fights without making champions over powered when it comes to taking objectives. In a certain since it would combine URF and NURF since champions aren't any tankier so the double damage would make it easier to die to things other than champions and getting objectives would be slower but it would have the action filled fights everyone loves in URF.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sinister Snail","date":"2015-04-13T14:04:57.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the games!
