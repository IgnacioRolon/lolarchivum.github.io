Darius, Yasuo, Katarina, Lux &amp; Heimer were pretty popular to ban. At high MMR none of them were really that strong, being itemised against or &quot;out-kitted&quot; depending on the enemy champ. They do have a fairly low barrier to entry to access power (except Yasuo), so that could be one reason?

Yasuo, Lee Sin, Lux, Blitz &amp; Ezreal all saw a fair bit of play time. I&#039;m impressed that Yasuo got through _so_ much, given how heavily he was banned. o.O Despite being overwhelmingly popular, champs like Nidalee, Fiddlesticks and Soraka didn&#039;t really fair too well.

I saw a LOT of times people would just ban Yasuo so someone wouldn't nominate it because they got tired of playing it, and not just because it was so strong. It was super easy to beat with tank teams, or Darius\naa\nI actually found one of the stronger picks that somehow showed up infrequently was Sona. There was just no dying almost with the heals, and the ults shut up everything, plus the poke damage. It beat tanks, assassins, mages, you name it. \n\nAll in all a lot of the champs that were strong were strong because of lane presence. If they could get ahead in farm and be a bully, they just easymode snowballed, like a Heimer. He could keep you from farming plus farm, especially 2v2, or if your team for some reason jungled, then your top was SoL 100%. Lux was similar because she could easily harass you away from farming with 2 of her. It was almost like 70% chance of winning that mode if you won laning phase, because usually you could just keep the enemy from farming, and I saw more often than not, if one team jungled, and the other didn't, the team without the jungler almost always won because of the lane advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"TheOneAndOlli","date":"2015-10-27T19:23:47.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xonra,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=WGJwh8YZ,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-10-27T00:51:09.808+0000)\n>\n> Heimer was banned a lot, and it had nothing to do with barrier of entry as much as...Heimer turrets.\n> \n> there was no way to siege or dealing with 6 turrets in lane, and if they grouped, you lost, and that was that.

We just kept pushing and disrespecting them until we won at like 50 minutes.\n\nKat vs Blitz (loss). I was against playing Kat from the start but one guy convinced the others it would be a good idea. So we loaded up game- and we saw our biggest counter. Me and one guy got pretty strong (I was like 22-7 I think) but the others fed and it was GG.\n\nRammus vs Yasuo (victory) So hilarious. We were all so tanky with Thornmail and DBC that they were doing more damage to themselves than we were to them. It did help that this was premade and my friends are pretty good (they trolled me and made me solo bot after I got Relic Shield lol, but I stole all his reds and Krugs). Ok. They also always missed their tornados, which makes me sad because I play a lot of Yasuo.\n\nTahm vs Bard (victory) I main Tahm and I got my teamates to do it with me. The endless Bard stuns were annoying but after we got tanky and started coordinating we caught out the pack leader a lot and one of us got Mikaels so he cleansed important guys of stuns. I was fairly fed (15-5ish) and it was very fun, especially agains a bunch of Bards building Wits End and Nashors and Runaans. \n\nSkarner vs Bard (victory) We were actually doing bad at first. They didn't have jungle, and I had take smite, so I just roamed all over the map and I was quadruple buff by 10 minutes. Me and my midlaner were caught out at the Baron pit. I made a run for it and he died, so the Bards continued to chase me. Get this: 2 magical journey over to me once I get to my inner top turret (I was about half health) I stun both and turret finishes them off. Double Kill. The other comes soon after, he falls in a likewise manner. The fourth Bard tried to be smart and tunnel around me, but I stunned him too. Quadra Kill! At that point no one wanted to fight me, I soloed Drag (I got my Sheen and Warrior on that back) and my top lane Skarner also got fed and we both just snowballed all over them even though out mid Skarner had fed, no offense to him, because he was mid Skarner after all.\n\nJinx vs Morde (victory) No mobility or CC against a Jinx team? Good luck with that. Our midlaner got super fed, our bot went about even, and I was support top but I roamed and bought troll items like Zekes and Zhonyas and Zephyr. I helped our top get fed and we pushed them to inhibitors by 15. It was a bloodbath after that, I don't think they even got a dragon ghost once.\n\nBans were always Darius and Heimer, but I also saw a lot of Vel, Kat, Yasuo, Eve, and J4.

AP Champion? Build Banner of Command and instantly win. \nDarius was another champion I pretty much perma-banned or auto-picked, because he is just so strong. Super high damage from level 1 and you can build him tanky so most matchups are a breeze. Sure he can be kited by a few champions, but those champions were VERY rarely picked.\nHeimer was one of the most annoying champions because it endlessly pushes and clearing 6 turrets are impossible to take out. In my last A4O game we were swain against heimer and that was a really good matchup against Heimer, but it wasn't like we picked swain to counter heimer since it is blindpick. The fact that it was blindpick is why heimer was so strong.\nVeigar never scared me, probably because in my first game against him I got lucky and was Olaf.
