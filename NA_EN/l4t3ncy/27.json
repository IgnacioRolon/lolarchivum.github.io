We hope you enjoyed playing the mode as much as we did! For the last few featured game modes, we've had a chat afterwards about *\"which champs were popular\"*, *\"who felt the most effective\"*, etc. In the same spirit, I'll kick things off again here. :D\n\nEveryone seemed to feel the increased presence of melee or 'hard engage' champs in Poro King (as indicated by pick rates). It was refreshing to see many traditionally side-lined champions on Howling Abyss actually get a heap of playtime and be intentionally picked up (using the Blind Draft pick type). Rammus & Galio in particular were pretty terrifying. Those diving taunts... o.O\n\nAt the top of bans, continuing her baffling popularity in the face of mediocrity, was Katarina. :P More than 4 out of 5 games had Katarina banned, despite her continued average performance. The higher we go in MMR brackets though started to see Alistar, Galio & Blitzcrank occupying some of the top ban spots (still behind Katarina of course :P).\n\nI also want to call out the Poro Toss summoner spell, which gave an across-the-board bump in viability to some historically unpopular picks. Even with picking your champs, engage from the Poro Toss summoner spell was able to wing clip the power of some notoriously strong Howling Abyss champs.\n\nSo what are your guys' stories from Poro King? Feel free to share below!","replies":[{"poster":"Masalar","date":"2015-01-17T01:06:57.089+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually got to play Kat {{champion:55}} once in poro mode. Got a penta and we won the game. My single game sample size proves all of your statistics wrong and she was clearly op.\n\nActually, for me, the single scariest, most op feeling champ in the mode was Annie{{champion:1}} . I only saw her a few times, (played her once or twice too), but she never lost. She won every game I saw her in. Her ability to poro{{summoner:31}}  tibbers instaburst one person while ccing the rest was godly. And I think that was the big factor. \n\nAny champion who A. Has \"difficulty engaging\" as their weakness or B. \"difficulty disengaging\" were the ones that became scary. When the poro king was out, champs like master Yi{{champion:11}} , Katarina{{champion:55}} , Yasuo{{champion:157}} , Irelia{{champion:39}} ...all those champions that can die if they dive too deep became nightmares to deal with. Others, like Ali {{champion:12}} and Galio{{champion:3}} , who have difficult engages (Headbutt > Pulverize is ok, Pulverize > headbutt to team is far scarier...guess which one poros facilitated?) also became far more consistently scary.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed the mode, but I also play primarily Arams anyway, so it wasn't much of a shift.\n\nEdited because I totally left a sentence incomplete and a second time because, oh yeah, champion icons!","replies":[]},{"poster":"insaiyanbacca","date":"2015-01-17T01:03:51.336+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"the poro toss galio ults where amazing","replies":[]},{"poster":"0115D8CF","date":"2015-01-17T00:57:31.849+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">At the top of bans, continuing her baffling popularity in the face of mediocrity, was Katarina\n\nmade me lol\nthat's all I have to add, I didn't play much poro king >_>","replies":[]},{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2015-01-17T05:58:36.325+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i had a decent amount of success with Sion. the gapcloser made the undead meatshield quite scary","replies":[]},{"poster":"FDru","date":"2015-01-17T10:41:14.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=L4T3NCY,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=A6AEIpqX,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-01-17T00:43:45.878+0000)\n> I also want to call out the Poro Toss summoner spell, which gave an across-the-board bump in viability to some historically unpopular picks.

Am I right?\n\nAnyway, since you asked... my favorite champ in Poro King was Fiddle, because Porostorm is hilarious and so are totally random Dark Wind kills. When he was banned (like 50% of the time) I liked picking Vlad who was surprisingly useful with the ability to dive, E, Q, then pool away, nevermind his ult. Rammus was also fun when a tank was needed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2015-01-20T01:20:08.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Galio is already very high-tier for ARAM *without* having that reliable and fluffy engage mechanism. Of course he was going to be a must pick/ban for the mode :P\n\nI pretty much rode Galio and Lux to a 14-0 record in the mode while completing the Champion of the Poro icon requirements. As an avid ARAM player, it was interesting to watch a bunch of people who clearly weren't ARAM regulars figuring out the game mode. I did have two Sona games in there as well. I was perplexed when she wasn't banned, and then even moreso when the other team didn't pick her.

I played {{champion:14}} the most because he was just so unbearably OP when played well.\n\nMy purrsonal musings....\n\n* I banned Kat, Akali, Blitzcrank, and Yi not because I was afraid of them (I was Sion). I banned them both because I didn't trust my team to use them right OR play against them right.\n\n\n* Next year^, the King needs some new code. Any Champion that did bonus damage to minions killed it way too fast for too little effort. {{champion:236}}'s Ult alone could clear the regent faster than the full timing of the power. Towards the end of the game mode's stay, I was calling out Lucian bans before any assassins simply because it negated the point of the whole game mode. It's like if a single champion just happened to have an ability that could outright kill the Ascended, it goes against the spirit of the game mode.\n\n* After playing against a suicidal {{champion:30}} I realized just how dickish Sion was. I didn't stop playing him, but I could see why enemy teams were raging as I crushed their skulls beneath my stump.\n\n* The greatest feeling in the world is killing the enemy with a Poro Toss. For the Ace. And the King Summon. It happened more times than one would expect.\n\n^ We'd better get Poro King again next year!!

She did take advantage of being able to shunpo to a target and instantly retreat back to the king, but it's not like the king was there the whole time. It's true she can clean up a whole team very easily if they're all worn down from fighting, a common scenario in that map, but even then that only happens if no one on the whole team has the necessary combination of wits and abilities to thwart her. With everyone generally relatively close together there's no excuse other than low level play for no one on a whole team of 5 not being able to do something to stop a champion with no untargetability and no CC.\n\nBut I had some great runs with Morgana and Soraka. I tossed lots of poros, even picked up quite a few kills with poros (I thought there should have been a special \"POROKILL!\" announcement whenever that happened) but I only rarely rode my big poro into the fray. Mostly because of the champs I was playing.\n\nI wanted to add that \"To the King!\" made for some dramatic moments when the last straggling survivor of a teamfight gone wrong would score a 10th poro hit on pursuing enemies, allowing freshly respawned allies to quickly rejoin the fight and completely turn the tables.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-01-19T14:24:26.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:90}} \n\nGot my very first Pentakill in this game mode using this champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HyperZEROXL","date":"2015-01-19T14:21:47.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played numerous of my champs either ones I use a lot or not a lot, but the ones I loved best were these,\n{{champion:101}}: Range was OP \n{{champion:31}}: CHO'ZILLA IS HERE!\n{{champion:80}}: This...is...PANTHEON!\n{{champion:68}}: Ultimate is OP!\n{{champion:35}}: ROFL XD ADC goes into bush, and it was massacred in 5 secs.\n{{champion:45}}: What's black and blue and about to show you the definition of pain?!

Galio really lacks the feel of \"in flight\" and a small dash would make a huge difference in his big plays potential since in League of Mobility you won't have a slow tank walk into an enemy team and taunt them all.

Alternatively, if the enemy team is near the Poro King, you can ult, go To The King, and still potentially get the ult off.\n\nMy favorite play, which I call the Fountain Wind Okie Doke, is when you Poro Toss a low health enemy in the enemy fountain, Poro Dash in, and land a Dark Wind before dying, hopefully getting executed in the process instead of giving away a kill.\n\nI also enjoyed Skarner, although I could never get the Impale To The King combo to work successfully without the target dashing out of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Aishi","date":"2015-01-17T03:49:53.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:122}} with a 10 second cooldown gapcloser was such a blast to play, get an early triforce, land a poro and combo someone to death since NO ONE CAN FLASH AWAY FROM YOU :D\n\nPoro King was the most powerful Darius has ever been in any game mode\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Foidewall","date":"2015-01-17T03:45:15.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mainly played Soraka{{champion:16}} , and had great success with it, her silence placed on the food of someone hit by a poro, has given my team countless kills, from poor enemy´s that thought they had a free engage.
