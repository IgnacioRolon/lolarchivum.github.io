Those ganks. -_-\n\nI wanted to chat about Katarina briefly. We often saw comments that she was “crazy OP” and “needed to be banned”. So we know that some players certainly believed this, as she was *ridiculously* popular. I mean, Katarina had a comparable play rate to the 10 strongest Hexakill: TT champs all added together! o.O However, looking at a variety of metrics we use to consider champion strength in particular modes, she was actually somewhat average (even accounting for mirror matches). *Substantially* less effective by comparison than champions like Sona, Janna, Soraka or Fiddlesticks. We saw a similar pattern emerge during Ascension where perceived strong champs actually turned out to be fairly average (or even way below average). So why are assassins so consistently popular in Featured Game Modes?\n\nThis feels like a matter of perception. Assassins generally thrive in chaos and a lack of ‘meta’. Each FGM brings a wild west in its first week or so, and when Assassins win, they’re flashy about it. You’ll notice when a Kat gets that Hexakill. You’ll remember *her* as the catalyst for victory. The comparatively low key nature of supports like Sona, Soraka, et al, aren’t always directly attributed to the winning moments in games, even if they were the enablers. \n\nIt's just one theory though, so what do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-11-06T05:45:32.491+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":2,"body":"I feel that assassins thrive when they are given map modes that feature a lack of vision and disincentivise supports. The reason assassins are unpopular in SR unless they have mobility and either untargetability or prolonged invisibility (Zed/Fizz and Talon/Akali), is because SR is overflowing with vision and the support role is firmly cemented into the meta. An assassin's main weakness is CC and their main strength is the element of surprise. Vision counters their main strength and most supports bring CC to the table and are in charge of maintaining vision control.\n\nNothing is a greater show of power and control than casual murder, and assassins are the epitome of that. Therefore, assassins appeal to people who want to experience that power and control. Some players enjoy the attention this brings to them, and revel in being the superstar of the game, while others focus exclusively on the feeling of power and control that the archetype brings. If you hear players who love assassins talking about the archetype (such as Redmercy, for example), you hear them talk about being aggressive and dominating, about taking control of the game and feeling uncomfortable when things are not happening on their terms.\n\nThis is an extremely powerful feeling for anybody who feels disempowered in real life, so you will always have an enormous pressure from the playerbase (particularly younger players) to play assassins in every single game mode. If SR allowed it, you would see assassins in every lane of every match, just like you see in the FGM. Not because they're particularly effective, but because they deliver on an emotional experience that a large part of the playerbase craves (and it's a testament to Riot's game design that it delivers the experience so well).","replies":[{"poster":"themaddscientist","date":"2014-11-06T17:39:47.240+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"I take a slightly different tact to that idea.

It might be just because I'm mechanically less than stellar, but the support role is my main because, while I individually can't usually kill someone, I don't need to kill anyone because I can set up the perfect opportunity to strike and let my allies do the dirty work. I'm not the assassin, I'm the unseen puppet master, the one in the background dictating how the game pans out. You might be able to dominate an opponent, but I'll dominate the game by forcing everyone to play on my terms, funnelled into a team fight of my own design where I will come out on top and your nexus is going to burn.

They know they can't win trades or get kills in lane, so they just focus on farming and not dying. Once they come online in the late game, you still see them playing very carefully and not taking unnecessary risks even when they could reasonably 1v5 the enemy team because they're a fed Vayne. These types of people IRL tend to be \"slow and steady wins the race\" type of people, who are risk-averse but goal-focused.\n\nThe ones who play lane bullies with good early and mid games, like Lucian, Miss Fortune and Graves, tend to be like assassins, focusing on the immediate satisfaction that comes with having power over the enemy and dictating the pace of the lane and the outcome of trades. These people sometimes get in too deep, and might rage at their supports for not bailing them out, which makes them hard to play with.","replies":[{"poster":"JevelFaithful","date":"2014-11-10T19:10:08.042+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A word of care about lane bullies.

Again, maybe a matter of interracting more with the bullies in lane.\n\nAnyway, as a mostly support main who is ridiculously bad at assassins, I know I, ironically, prefer bullies unless it's Vayne. I'm generally relying ery much on my team and playing more passive than aggressive, yet for some reason I work better with someone like Miss fortune or Jinx than tristana. What you say might hold more truth when it comes to the \"free-er\" adcs like Lucian. But many \"old school\" bullies actually seem to require a mindset that's pretty far from assassins as they are as fragile as assassins and don't have quite the same burst or defensive tools. \n\nOverall, while some players might prefer the assassin-playstyle, for others it might just be that they feel they need the tools to do something in the laning phase. As I said, I feel like I've met more whining hyper-adc than bully-adc. Maybe because it's easier for them to feel like \"we\" lost them their game.\n\nSorry the absolutism (is that a word?) of your post rubbed me the wrong way.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-11-10T22:12:28.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't mean to sound absolutist!

If you try to fuse them together, you get either the best of both worlds (and therefore the champ is opressingly overpowered) or the worst of both worlds (and he's so bad he's unplayable). Assassins are squishy and lack utility, but have high damage, mobility and a way to outplay and guarantee the surprise factor (untargetability/invisibility). Tanks are usually bad at mobility and damage, but have a lot of health and utility. Tanks tend to want to initiate for their team, assassins want to wait until everyone's blown their cooldowns and either clean up or assassinate a high-priority target. Those types have different kits and playstyles, and it's impossible to fuse them together and make a balanced champion out of it (unless you end up compromising everything and just making a plain old bruiser, which is not really a Tank/Assassin but a regular Fighter).","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2014-11-07T04:09:04.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ah, lol, but you can't say it can't happen.

I gave him a passive that resembles Shen's but harder and with less gained, 1 skill shot, a short bonus, a small bonus/a get away ability that can also deal damage if needed, and an ultimate that's only damage output is from the pets that don't stay long and aren't that hard to dispose of (it also has a nice 3 second or less stun but it is also avoidable). I'm very certain that you are correct but Ayleth won't be very tanky since players will most likely be getting AP items and his stats are also not very tanky.

Either you are misclassifying him (and he's not a Tank/Assassin) or he's going to be an overpowered/underpowered champion by virtue of combining two roles with 0% overlap. Fighter and Assassin overlap, Tank and Fighter overlap, but Tank and Assassin don't.\n\nYour individual champion design is not relevant to the conversation, this is a matter of understanding what the roles mean. Tank and Assassin aren't compatible by their very definition, not because nobody's got it right before.\n\nYou can solve this issue by simply reclassifying him as a fighter/assassin, though I'd get rid of the sustain mechanic. Fighter/Assassins like Yasuo and Riven tend to rely more on shields than sustain, given that they are proactive mechanics (need to anticipate the attack and shield myself) rather than reactive (oh I got hit, guess I'll just heal it back up). Giving fall-back mechanics like tankiness and sustain to assassins is generally not a good idea, because you create a situation where either they win hard and decimate the opposition or don't win hard but they can still avoid losing lane.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2014-11-06T03:08:41.111+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just want to point out that the reason Katarina perhaps wasn't always prevailing is because people expected it and brought anti-katarina champs to the game.

That's not fun. I'm not even convinced it's fun for the Katarina player to be so god-like no one can fight you evenly. Even if it is, is it fun for her team to go \"Oh look, Katarina killed them all before I could do a single thing. Cool.\" Because I know I felt that way.\n\nDid I play Katarina while we still had the game mode? Yeah, one time. But you know what? I regretted it. It was stupid. It was never a contest, they couldn't build enough MR to stop me, and I was taking EVERY SINGLE KILL. Other assassins felt much less restricting.\n\nAnd as for the popularity/success of supports: they are never appreciated truly. They're not the ones getting all the kills, doing all the damage. They're just there to make sure everyone else can keep on fighting. Which is fine! This playstyle can be fun but it's not for everyone.

She has the ability to do massive burst instantly and repeatedly so she'd end up getting the kills more often than not, which frankly, when she's already up 10 kills on every one else, isn't fun and is essentially kill-stealing. I had games where the Kat would be up around 15 to 20 kills and the remaining 5 champs wouldn't have reached 10 kills aggregate yet.\n2. Her resourceless abilities on a fairly low cooldown and being AOE allows her to farm the minion waves better than just about any other champion in the mode. Consider that allowing minions to whittle each other down isn't what happens in most games of Hexakill and you have a champ who can clear an entire wave and push herself farther ahead in gold allowing her to continuously deal all the killing blows to minions and other champs.\n3. On the enemy side, once she's ahead, her combo is capable of killing a squishy in like half a second. It's so fast that a lot of the time you can't react or once you see her closing in, it's already too late for cc, even targeted cc like say a Taric stun, to prevent a death as she just does her burst, is stunned and then has cooldowns back up as soon as the stun wears off. At best your team gets a 1 for 1 out of it.\n4. It's a fun mode and players want to play fun champs who aren't always the best picks or most rounded picks for the team, so you end up with teams that may not have a huge slate of cc to stop her, and then you're just out of luck and she kills everything. If you could just ban her, it wouldn't be as big of a deal. If the mode was draft you could also pick accordingly.\n\nSo in conclusion, I don't think it's necessarily that players found her to be an automatic win, thus warranting her being banned if it were available. I think they wanted to ban her because other players had much less fun in games she was involved in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2014-11-06T03:23:34.999+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just played Maokai every game.

Just Katarina. Not Talon, not Fizz, not Zed. Katarina. So the reason you see an average or below average win rate in these cases (at least in my opinion) is that everyone is playing to beat Katarina.\n\nI don't believe that is the intention of your Featured Game Modes.

I had been trying to point out the whole time that while Kat might have benefited from the relative plenitude of potential targets at any given time, so did most other champions, many of which have tools that allowed them to take advantage of the same situations far better than Kat could. I used Fiddlesticks as an example many times and was roundly ignored.\n\nKat is my favorite champion and at first I was excited about a game mode where I could pick her without igniting a firestorm of controversy because other people want mid and Kat doesn't normally go anywhere else, but I quickly stopped playing her when all the whining about her began. By then someone else was always raring to play Kat anyway - often getting a lot of kills, usually dying as often as they got kills if not more often, probably believing that, after everything they'd heard, they could jump in and R for an instant Hexakill, not even understanding how Kat's R works.\n\nBut as a result I played lots of Morgana and am getting a lot better with her.\n\nI died less often with Kat.

Get Katarina fed and you win. If she doesn't get fed you doesn't win. Many of the games contained katarina mirrors as well.\n\nEven if Katarina is balanced in win%, her snowballing and complete stifling of teamfights when fed overshadows that. Her burst is too fast, and her ulti deals too much damage even if you CC her, mix that with resets and you get unfun teamfights. Her winrate is probably lower because she is popular and not easiest champ to play (assassins as a class is not).

Lots of targets in a small area? It was difficult to NOT land their Qs.\n\nAs for why assassins were perceived to be better than they were, they're geared towards finding and eliminating enemies who venture out alone. The game mode was on a map not a lot of players know, with twice the chance of an enemy champ to be waiting in any bush. The \"wild west\" meta where anything goes is glorious for people wandering around and getting caught out. People had to be careful about pushing top lane while the enemy was bot (and vice versa), because it was only a short walk to gank town. No warding really helped people get taken by surprise. Players were running around making bad life decisions left and right, and that's what assassins love most.\n\n>and when Assassins win, they’re flashy about it. You’ll notice when a Kat gets that Hexakill. You’ll remember her as the catalyst for victory. The comparatively low key nature of supports like Sona, Soraka, et al, aren’t always directly attributed to the winning moments in games, even if they were the enablers. \n\nOf the four champs you mentioned being low key, three were supports. (And I don't agree with Fid being low key. When he ults into your team, you notice his contribution REAL fast) I think this is a symptom of a greater problem. When Kat resets like a madman and gets a hexakill, there's a banner and the voiceover lady goes nuts. When your screen goes grey and you see that banner and hear the announcer, are you going to think Kat did well, or that the Sona on her team set that all up by starting the teamfight with a beautiful flash ult that caught all six of you and enabled that hexakill to happen.\n\nEnabler champs get no fanfare. Everyone is going to pat Kat on the back, but no one is going to line up to shake Sona's hand. Some players are okay with this, being the silent helping hand; but most aren't. They want their skill to be praised, their team to slap them on the back, and the enemy team to curse their name. There's no glory in being an enabler, and that's why most players want to be the one enabled. Hence the support role often being the \"booby prize\" for last picks or longest queue in team builder. Supports generally don't get noticed by senpai.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2014-11-08T01:13:40.908+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree with the OP.\n[#NerfSupports](http://blangston.deviantart.com/art/League-of-Legends-cartoon-334033694)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aryzyra","date":"2014-11-07T18:01:43.344+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Played about 40 games of hexakill.
