ARURF death timers, RGM custom games and more.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":25,"down_votes":9,"body":"Heya guys, feels like a good time for one of these again. &lt;3 I&#039;ve gathered a heap of common RGM questions in here, but feel free to hit me up in the comments with anything else. I&#039;ll be around for a while, give me a poke. o^_^O\r\n\r\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/rgm-banner_1920x1080.jpg\r\n\r\n**ARURF Death Timers**\r\nWhile it feels like it might be fun to apply the URF buff to death timers as well, this would impact game length pretty severely. If champions respawned any quicker than usual in ARURF, games would drag on-and-on while turtling defenses could continue to hold out forever on the fountain. :(\r\n\r\nDeath timers in ARURF are actually the same, if not shorter than regular SR right now. They&#039;re also unchanged from regular old URF. Average champion level is generally higher in URF though comparative to game time, meaning towers can feel a little weaker than usual. We&#039;d still rather a snowballing game close-out than drag on forever though, so you can quickly get into the next match.\r\n\r\nThe worst feeling would be bumping up against a stubborn, frustrating defense that isn&#039;t earned through player skill, just facilitated by unnecessarily short death timers.\r\n\r\n**RGM mode custom games**\r\nWe still haven&#039;t been able add support for custom games in the new league client. This #feelsbadman. :( I was sad we didn&#039;t have custom games for the new Blood Moon mode. I&#039;m sad we don&#039;t have them for ARURF. I hope we can get them working ASAP. We want to do our community games again with you guys. They are not missing by design, we&#039;re working to get them back.\r\n\r\n**Old mode experimentation on PBE**\r\nThere&#039;s a few modes we&#039;ve run quite a lot (Poro King and Ascension in particular). They&#039;re both quite popular modes with healthy engagement, which made them good candidates for filler in between our bigger new modes (like Blood Moon or the new Doom Bots) that we run! Obviously we can&#039;t make a Blood Moon mode every patch though (as much as we&#039;d like to), so inevitably we enable modes like Poro King and Ascension to make sure there&#039;s still something light and fun to do on the weekends alongside ARAM, rather than nothing at all.\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re interested in seeing if there&#039;s some unique twists we can put on these modes though to further freshen them up. Right now on PBE we have a version of Poro King with Doom Bots style Ryze portals everywhere. We&#039;re going to watch it very closely. PBE is a place for us to test and gauge. We might delete it. **We might change it entirely. It&#039;s an experiment.** #PBEthings\r\n\r\nThis also doesn&#039;t mean we aren&#039;t still actively working on bigger new modes similar to Blood Moon that just released. We are actually focusing even more on modes like that this year, but in between those big mode drops, we still need to use reliable modes like Poro King to fill the gaps. Hopefully we can also expand the roster with modes like One For All once we get support for it in the new client too.\r\n\r\n**Why not put &#039;Mode X&#039; into the RGM queue?**\r\nIf &quot;Mode X&quot; hasn&#039;t appeared by now, it&#039;s probably because we weren&#039;t happy with the design of it and the outcomes (some exceptions are &quot;One For All: SR&quot; and &quot;Hexakill: TT&quot;, which are currently blocked due to tech reasons on the new client). We&#039;re still building support for a few modes in the new client, but older ones like Showdown or One For All: Mirror Mode just missed the bar on what we expect from an alternate game mode. I won&#039;t say &quot;never&quot; in game dev because anything could happen, but it&#039;s unlikely we&#039;ll bring modes like these back. That also doesn&#039;t mean that the core idea might not still be fun (the idea of an intense 1v1 is kinda cool) but we wouldn&#039;t use that particular execution of the idea. We&#039;d most like build a newer, better version, that better executes on that gameplay fantasy.\r\n\r\n-- L4T3NCY","replies":[{"poster":"World Ender","date":"2017-02-25T01:42:26.818+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any plans for BMB?

I basically can't play it on my account that owns all the champions, because despite owning them all, I don't enjoy playing a lot of champions, and a lot of them are frankly extremely weak in URF.  ARURF is just like ARAM, the team with the most poke wins.  Except there is a distinct lack of counterplay because CD's are nonexistent.  It doesn't matter if you dodged their poke, you can't think about engaging because it's just going to hit you in the face when you move forward.  It's not the direction to take URF.  I've played one game and I'm done with it already because it was just such a terrible experience.  It's unfun for the same reasons ARAM can be unfun, except it emphasizes weaknesses and offers little recourse.  At least with ARAM you are grouped as 5 and can weather the storm as a team, along with exp and gold gain is much better for keeping a team that lost the champion lottery relevant and feeling like they can even do something.  In ARURF you have to defend lanes.  Too much gold is spread out across the map to not try, yet if everyone is just in a losing matchup you get snowballed on and die anyways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Kog NA","date":"2017-02-25T02:26:52.668+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are we every going to get normal URF back or are we stuck with ARURF forever?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2017-02-25T01:37:00.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OT But since you are the game mode guy, will you guys also continue to improve upon practice tool as well","replies":[{"poster":"L4T3NCY","date":"2017-02-25T02:06:50.497+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, planning a light quality-of-life update to Practice Tool sometime soon(tm). :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Edge of Daybreak","date":"2017-02-25T03:25:29.812+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So can we talk about why riot won't make these game modes actually random?\n\nI get the argument of a player not knowing a champion but with a gamemode meant for fun trying something new every now and then isn't exactly world changing especially when free week champions can do this to a player anyway. \n\nYour random aspect to game modes is rendered almost pointless when I can make an account with only the busted champions and run that every time.

We liked it precisely because it is not balanced, and we enjoyed playing those op champions over and over.\n\nL4T3NCY mentioned that the randomness isn't an act of balancing, and I somewhat admit that, but still, it took away the appeal and raised the suffering just like nemesis or one for all did (players raging or getting blamed for having no idea how to play undesired champs). ARURF doesn't offer what urf does, thus I don't see these two modes as anything remotely close to each other and naively hope to have urf back, which tbh is very unlikely to happen. \n\nP.S. One last rant. I still don't get it. Normal game modes are where balance and fairness belong. URF is not intended to be balanced, it is a sanctuary for those who can abuse it, so why are we trying to mess it up?
