Fair how?  I'd say at this point it'd be not so bad if the option of not fighting Lee actually existed.  Except when you're both the king of abusing early dmg items *and* mobility, well there's not much escaping him without never entering your jungle in the first place.\r\n\r\nHe uses this huge early spike to run all over your jungle and make sure your game is ruined.  You can't do anything about it because he's Lee.  In the off chance that your team comes to help *and* gets there before he kills you, he can just jump a wall and  go about his business.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is this ok?  I'd really like to know what someone is supposed to do when Lee starts taking over the game 3 minutes in.  You can't escape him, you can't outdamage him 1v1, and you can't catch him.  Are you just supposed to accept that your game is just wrecked because you didn't get to pick Lee first?","replies":[]}
