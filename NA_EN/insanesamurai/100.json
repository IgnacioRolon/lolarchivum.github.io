So after making a log, I found that a little over 21% of the players I get paired up with are toxic to the point of deserving reports.  60% of the games I played were ruined by trolls, since they ended up wanting to argue/grief more than they wanted to play the actual game.  This is far from the stats that Riot has posted before, and even after sending the log to Riot support, they don't even seem to care.  So it looks like this is how things are going to be.  Garbage community that Riot just lies about and when you prove to them it's really that bad, they just ignore you :(  \n\nI think we need to make it a serious point to tell them that having at least a decent community is extremely important for the longevity of the game.  If you keep letting people go down these roads, sure you'll still have players down the line, but they'll basically all be trained to not even type anything without flaming someone, and all the people who prefer reasonable communication will go play something else.\n\nEdit: Why come in here and downvote everything I say and just leave without explaining yourself?  You're undermining the entire point of the forums.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2015-01-03T22:23:52.730+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"This really depends on definitions.  Riot is likely talking about people who only want to ruin the day of other people, where as you're likely talking about people who are frustrated or having an off day and finally snap.  One is a constant problem that can be easily measured, where as the other is a temporary thing that rarely lasts more than a game or two.\n\nThere is a huge difference between someone who is trolling and someone who is a troll, and I don't think you're making that distinction.","replies":[{"poster":"Legostrike","date":"2015-01-03T22:37:07.442+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"21% of the players he's met just are having a bad day?\n\nlet me put that into perspective, that is about 1/5 of the games he plays. Or 4 PEOPLE out of twenty. So twenty people, let's exclude the enemy team and say that's roughly a person PER GAME. \n\nyou get the picture here?

At the start they are nice, they make a few mistakes and they complain, and by the end they are insulting everyone.  The next game is the same exact thing.

Also, I'm only counting players on my team in this occasion since I generally can't tell who was and wasn't toxic on the enemy side(sometimes you can, but that would skew the stats since most games you have no idea).  Actually if I was doing it completely right, it'd be a little bit higher even because I played with some friends during this and included them in the total number of players when they kinda go against the random players statistic(and none of them were trolls, or course :D).\n\nWhat Legostrike is saying makes sense and doesn't really deserve all these downvotes.  21% is frighteningly close to one guy on every team.  Now it doesn't always work this way of course(there are often duo trolls, there have been times where my entire team deserved reports, and there are streaks of games with no toxicity at all), but that number is not really acceptable or remotely close to what Riot has stated.","replies":[{"poster":"PrinceOfStorms","date":"2015-01-03T23:15:24.539+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"FIfteen games is too small a sample size to apply it to the entire population.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-03T23:21:21.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"This is what it's always like.

My point is that something needs to be done about the people who consistently get stuck with problem players, because having such a large number of games be decided on arguments and random trolling makes it extremely hard to move on to a different pool of players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-03T22:41:01.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"If I reported them I put them in the troll category as far as the stats.  If they were just a random jerk temporarily but stopped and continued to play the game(which is kinda rare cause the random jerkiness spawns arguments usually), they were not included.  The trolls may have not all technically been trolls, but they are problem players for one reason or another.  This ranges from someone constantly being negative or insulting whenever they spoke(which distracts everyone from the tasks at hand) to the guy who spends the entire game trying to grief whoever he's mad at(and thus the entire team). \n\nBad day or not, if someone crosses the line where the game is secondary and the insulting/blaming/arguing/griefing is primary, they deserve a report.
