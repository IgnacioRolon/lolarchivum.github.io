As they say, \"Jack of all trades, master of none.\" - That's sorta where I am at this point, though to say 'all trades' would be a bit too much, maybe just 'jack of many trades'  :).  I'm trying to become a Gnar main (don't hate please :D), but that's gonna take alot of work methinks before I can really call myself that.  \r\n\r\nI mainly just want to play with people who can remain positive most of the time, regardless of skill.  You kinda people are what makes this game tick, and I'd love to team up with ya if you're ever in need of just one less chance of getting a troll :D","replies":[{"poster":"hawkman5879","date":"2014-09-09T02:55:06.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you hit silver I can play with you.
