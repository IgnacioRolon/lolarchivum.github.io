Anyone else on Comcast getting issues?  Also, last game was not loss prevented and nothing on the status page, so I'm thinking it's either rare or Riot just doesn't know yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Metaless Monster","date":"2014-09-23T18:52:59.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not just a comcast problem. Riot's servers are randomly fucking a lot of people, but do we get better servers? Nope, shiny new cinematics and a new gamemode. Riot should invest their money where the playerbase is begging them to.","replies":[{"poster":"Renzol","date":"2014-09-23T18:55:56.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not true, most of my friends with problems have run a program known as WinMTR, which shows packet loss, and most of them are usually one or two jumps out from Riot servers. \n\nThe one located in Oregon seems to get caught up right around where the hop leaves Comcast and goes to another company. Problem with dealing with these kinda of issues is that both companies will blame each other, instead of fixing the damn issue.\n\nSame stuff happens with Teamspeak sometimes. A hop that goes through a server farm in upstate NY causes like 2% outbound packetloss.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrSc0tty","date":"2014-09-23T15:21:29.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep! I've been getting 500+ ping spikes on comcast to compliment my usual 120 east coast ping. \n\nCourse, that only happens for league. I get 10 ping on Dota.","replies":[]}]}
