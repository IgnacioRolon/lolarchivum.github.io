Team work is more important in league and dota because there are more factors to control. In hots, teams only have to focus on objective control and soaking exp. In league and dota, teams have to coordinate objective control, level distribution, and farm distribution. On top of that, getting a player \"so fed that he can do whatever he wants\" against a good team takes far more teamwork than anything in hots. \n> \n> Also, there is a difference between requiring 5 competent players and requiring teamwork. Hots requires all 5 players on a team to follow a formulaic movement pattern and be at objectives at the right time. However, it does not require nearly as much coordination between team members as a game like league or dota because teams do not have to balance resource distribution on top of objectives.\n\nDid you really just say getting a guy who goes mid first time with someone against a LB, feeds her repeatedly, calls no MIAs, and doesn't ward requires alot of opposing team teamwork?\n\nNo, I know you didnt.  However, that's all it takes to get one of those champs that fed.\n\nBalancing resource distribution amongst random players in this game generally goes like this:  \"I do more dmg so if you can't sneak the minions in between my 3 aoe skills you just suck\".  So, I'm not really a big fan of that.  Maybe if your average player gave a damn about anyone else on the team that would matter more here, but that is rarely the case.\n\nRemoving resource distribution makes the game more team oriented in that fashion.  You might disagree, which is fine, but you have to at least admit that people don't fight with each other over kills or farm in that game, and that is quite refreshing.","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2015-06-21T05:57:53.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-06-21T12:06:53.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=haaaaaaaalp,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AwW1xzK7,comment-id=00040000000000000000,timestamp=2015-06-21T05:57:53.974+0000)\n>\n> No one fights over kills at high mmr in league or dota either. Removing resource distribution makes the game less team oriented because it is one less thing for a team to cooridinate. Remember, it takes a good gameplan from multiple people to get someone fed. No competent team is just going to let one player solo carry by themselves. Hell, even faker can't solo carry his team to worlds every year.\n\nNo, they don't, and generally the huge snowball factor also is not an issue because people know how to play safe or trade lanes.  That's my point.  If they're gonna balance the game around high elo and pro play, then why even create a champ like that since it's most likely not going to work out at that level?","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2015-06-22T23:45:27.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-06-22T23:57:28.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=haaaaaaaalp,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AwW1xzK7,comment-id=0004000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-06-22T23:45:27.350+0000)\n>\n> Because champions that require snowballing can still work at high level, they just require teamwork to pull off. Lategame champions like kog are still picked at the highest level because teams can plan around it. This is a strategic dimension which heroes of the storm is lacking and the reason why it ultimately requires less teamwork to play than a game like dota or league.\n\nThey do, but the vast majority of the player base is not playing at even close to that level.  When this happens in your average game, its the result of someone raging, not understanding their opponent, trolling, or being a new player erroneously thrown up against an experienced Kat main(or all of the above).  \n\n When someone gets fed in high level play, they have a small lead and the team is protecting them and encouraging that lead.  When someone gets fed in your standard game of random players, however, it's almost always just because one person refuses to play safe, trade, or roam, and continues to stubbornly feed that person(or perhaps the other people also refuse to help, which happens plenty).   That or when the enemy jungler goes into full on carrion vulture mode, notices that a new player is on the enemy team, and camps his lane into oblivion snowballing 2 people.   That one I guess is matchmaking, but still, that's not how this game was designed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LegacyDAP","date":"2015-06-20T00:57:20.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never thought I'd say this, but HotS is too team based.

Even in the case you mentioned, could you just go 1v4 straight up and win because of your sheer dmg?  No, I'm more than willing to bet you had to actually outplay the enemies at every turn, which is kind of the opposite of the snowballing that I am talking about. Nova is squishy as hell, and more experienced players know to look for the shimmer of a stealthed hero, so I seriously doubt that had much similarity to a Kat facerolling people.\n\nAlso, while the snowballing hero is technically contributing to his entire team, that exp is spread amongst everyone, and gold doesn't exist.  This makes it so that a 1v1 lane getting 2 kills over his opponent isn't the end of the world, which is pretty neat.","replies":[{"poster":"101100111000","date":"2015-06-21T13:02:56.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never had to 1 v 4.
