Do you seriously have nothing else to do that your life revolves around one single game?  Please, do yourself a favor and get a life outside of League.\n\nB)  Most big rich companies make you pay to play their games.  You pay absolutely nothing unless you buy the skins.  That is by your own choice though.  So don't get all high and mighty thinking a company that lets you play the game they spent so much time and money on for you for free owes you anything beyond what they are already giving you.  So ungrateful.","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2014-08-20T03:19:26.384+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"1) Ranked teams exist. It's already hard enough to get 3-5 people together at the same time to grind a ranked team. Bad servers makes this much much worse.\n\n2) Free-to-play business models pull in MORE money than subscription based ones. Ever wonder why Ragnarok Online went free-to-play and added in a cash shop? It's because it makes them more money.","replies":[{"poster":"BADxW0LF","date":"2014-08-20T03:29:04.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I said it earlier...boohoo, you can't play a video game.

Temporary exp boost, loot boost, etc. And all of their games are free. So no, it's not just the big powerful companies that make you pay to play that give some sort of compensation. Sorry. <3\n\nPoint being, the least Rito could do would be to turn on a temporary ip boost or something. Hell, even just like an hour or something. That's what they do at Aeria and many other gaming companies.\n\nAlso, not very smart from a business standpoint for them to continually let us down and not fix it properly or get new servers or something **and** not give us any sort of compensation because all that's doing is making people wanna leave. I've read plenty of comments on other threads about people saying their leaving for a different game simply because Rito doesn't do the things they **should** be doing just like any other popular gaming company. \n\nJust saying. <3\n\nPs.: For the record, Riot **is** a pretty damn rich and powerful company comparatively to other non-major-corporation produced games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Full AP Venusaur","date":"2014-08-20T03:13:36.257+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot don't behave like a big, rich company and they certainly don't hire like one. I'm not saying they have low standards but they just don't have ENOUGH people and they have said flat out that they do not hire specialists so its just as likely that they have accountants working on the servers right now as it is the splash art team. Specialists are the best at what they do but Riot won't pay for the best, I guess they don't think we are worth it. \n\nWhat we deserve is the intense, fun, strategic, competitive, and community based game we all helped fund.
