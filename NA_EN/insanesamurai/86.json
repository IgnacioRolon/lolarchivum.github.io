It's kind of amazing how common this is, and I don't understand how people think it's ok.  Even someone who isn't playing that well or is having a bad game can still help his team if he cooperates.  On the other hand, no matter how well someone's doing, if they refuse to cooperate and group up, they are going to start being a burden to the team.","replies":[{"poster":"PublicService","date":"2014-08-04T21:14:40.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What was the announcement I made? :)","replies":[{"poster":"Drunk Old Man","date":"2014-08-05T19:01:00.096+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's Tuesday, and you can get three tacos for $1 at Del Taco.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-08-05T14:41:04.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Drunk Old Man","date":"2014-08-04T17:22:00.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm.. I'd say it's because a lot of people see League as a \"game\", and the majority of them don't believe that they need to take a \"game\" so seriously. While that's certainly not a crime, I do agree that they shouldn't jump into ranked. I've proposed for quite some time now that we should have requirements for ranked (at least 100 or more normals wins, positive player background, etc) and I still stand by that.","replies":[{"poster":"Sadistic Cheese","date":"2014-08-05T12:55:24.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a bad idea, though I personally stand by what SMITE does: You can only play Gods that you have achieved 'Mastery' over in Ranked. Mastery points are obtained ONLY by playing  normal PvP matches with that particular God. Perhaps a similar system to prevent the 'lol, I'll pick Lee Sin even though I never play him!' kind of stuff paired with your idea might help things.\n\nI'd also say giving people an idea of where they stand in their Normal games would help too. Many of us play Ranked to see where we are compared to everyone else. Having a metric for our Normal status may keep out those people who 'aren't serious' and thus cause the more dedicated players to rage or whatever, as well as perhaps giving us an idea of where we stand to improve. \"Hrm, my Normal ranking is Gold, but in Ranked I'm in Bronze. Why is that?\"","replies":[{"poster":"Drunk Old Man","date":"2014-08-05T19:00:26.531+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually like that. The way it is now, people can just buy 16 champs and jump into ranked. And, sadly, that's probably what 60% or so of the people in Bronze to low Gold have done, give or take a few champs. I see people in Bronze 1 with over 1000 games this season.. and I'm not quite sure how they don't realize there must be something wrong. And, sadly, once people start losing, their default response to being told what they could do better is to get angry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-08-05T14:42:32.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't a bad idea, but my particular issue is people not having any sense of teamwork.  Some of these guys are actually quite good at their champ, but if they just run away from the rest of the team and do their own thing the whole time, it generally doesn't matter how good they are.","replies":[{"poster":"Drunk Old Man","date":"2014-08-05T18:57:42.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right, that's a huge problem with games like this in general. Unfortunately, the only thing giving them any sort of... reason? to become better at working in a team is the fact that a solo player can only get so far in ranked. Though, most just tend to blame their team and never look at themselves.\n\nLast night I played 4 ranked games. All of them, I went at least 15+ kills to less than 5 deaths I believe, one ADC game I was something like 32/5. While I absolutely _should_ have been able to carry it, two of my team members tended to stay in separate lanes and push to inhib (and of course get killed 3v1), and rather than the other one pressuring the lane the 3 enemies weren't in, they went to that same lane and died trying to \"save\" the other person (probably a duo?) It's kinda sad that they don't realize what they're doing, but at the same time, they don't really feel like they need to. As long as their KDA is positive, they think they're winning the game. That's something I think we need to find a way to fix. Maybe a video serious or something from Riot? Dunno","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-08-06T13:46:47.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree completely(except the part that you should have been able to carry a game with 15 or 30 kills, most champs can't win a game by themselves, no matter how fed they are:) ).  Far too many players think KDA is all that matters.  Despite how obvious it is that other things are also important, a good portion of the players seem to to totally convinced it is the end-all in this game.  So much so that they'll start ignoring teammates, often going out of their way to get more kills at any cost, and encouraging people to ignore supports and any other players that don't have a \"good\" ratio. \n\nAnyway,  it would be good to put out a video at least explaining how a guy with 22 kills still dies fast when he runs around by himself, but I'm afraid most players won't even watch it(the Teamwork OP video was similar, and despite it being correct, and one of the most common problems on here, it seems like not too many players really took that advice).\n\n  The main problems with the KDA are objectives and how people become so obsessed with score that they don't care about the actual game and the required teamwork.  I mean if your Riven has 18 kills and the entire rest of the team has 7 combined, its time for her to stop running around insta-clearing every jungle camp and specifically holding attacks until they can last-hit champions.  Then the biggest issue would be pushing a lane.  You'd think such a simple and important task to the game would not be so hard to accomplish, but it is.  You try, and try, and finally get the team together in a lane, kill maybe 2 minion waves, and more often than not, everyone ends up scattering off to go do random stuff and starts getting picked off.  You explain that we just lost a bunch of turrets because we spread out, get the team in one lane, and the instant someone walks off to ward a bush, the team scatters again.  Yikes!\n\nHere's hoping something happens that changes this, as it's getting really, really old.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
