This combined with Riot's over-lenient punishments, and people just adopt this as normal behavior.  Either you want us to be allowed to break meta or not.  There is no middle ground.  If someone does this, punish them immediately if it is not ok, because people are vicious and hateful about it(and are most likely either spoiled children or lifelong assholes so there's no reasoning with them).  If you don't want us to break meta, tell us, don't just let people abuse us in 9 out of 10 games for doing something that you say is ok and hope we'll stop eventually.","replies":[]}
