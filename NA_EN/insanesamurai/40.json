Seriously he was reaching insane popularity there with his ability to instantly stop a fight in its tracks where as we were still sitting around with our usual picks.\n\nYou say that like there's anything wrong with him becoming a popular pick because he actually countered mobility creep. Everyone knows why he was nerfed (countering #LCSBIGPLAYS), the reason is just stupid and it shouldn't have happened.","replies":[{"poster":"Zoof","date":"2015-03-02T05:06:54.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply, but I think the problem lied within what he could stop exactly. Janna for example can stop engages from melee champions and that is essentially her thing. Veigar, on top of being a burst mage was also capable of stopping a fight in its tracks with his e. Then again, everything I've said makes no sense since they're releasing Bard with his ultimate. But yea, I never liked playing against Veigar, and I often felt oppressive while playing as him so I'm glad his e was changed, just sad to see them decimate the rest of his kit too.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-03-01T17:03:01.476+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"God Nid has such a cancerous kit.

At least in S4 you can pretty much pick anybody and attempt jungle with them, I thought this season is all about \"diversity\"?","replies":[]}]}]}
