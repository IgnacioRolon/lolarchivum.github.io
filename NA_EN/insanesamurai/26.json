He makes changes based solely on his own personal desires, completely disregarding game health.  Then when he's had his fun, he gets bored and moves on.  He probably has a short attention span.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jefftiffy","date":"2015-02-12T03:08:28.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They said they were working on it and it wasn't going to be touched in 5.3.
