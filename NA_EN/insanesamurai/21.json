Yeah its fun to list all the removed items, but the thread's purpose is to ask for one specific recently removed item that doesn't make sense.  No item was made to fill its slot for that type of build.  The item was not broken, it was not overpowered, and it wasn't totally useless either.

It was an offense/defense item, with offense scaled on defense, and it worked particularly well with the class that scales best on--you guessed it--combined offense and defense. It was either just strong enough to be the best option for every bruiser as a 1st or 2nd item, or it was just weak enough that it was rarely wanted. Neither case is a good case.","replies":[]}]}
