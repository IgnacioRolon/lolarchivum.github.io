It's happened with Jinx and Ziggs, and both of them had the ult fire to the left about the same distance from where I clicked.  Kinda horrible to just randomly ult some trees.  I don't hate nature :P","replies":[{"poster":"Ice Weasel X","date":"2015-01-30T15:53:03.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This *might* be related to the delayed/lost input issue that a lot of people are experiencing.\n\nThe reason I think that's possible is because I've had that happen with other skills and the item shop.  Once I died in a game yesterday, I tried to finish my Statikk Shiv.  I already had Zeal and Avarice Blade, plus another 1100+ gold.  When I right-clicked the Shiv on the right side of the shop (full recipe view), nothing happened.  I assumed it just hadn't registered the click, so I clicked it several times really fast, then moved my mouse down to the left to buy something with my remaining gold.  Then I realized I had almost no gold left, and saw that I had bought another Zeal.  None of those clicks had registered while I was hovering over Statikk Shiv, but one of them triggered while I was moving my mouse *after* I stopped clicking.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-31T01:15:37.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh whoa... that kinda explains some of the most odd misses that I've done(backwards braum shield op)\n\nNeat that you were able to pinpoint it like that, nice attention to detail :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Der Lindwurm","date":"2015-01-30T15:56:30.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lux's laser too.
