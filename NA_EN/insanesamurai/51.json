When you lane against one of these two, the laning phase no longer becomes a battle of zoning or poking or csing.  It becomes a battle of how much cs can you squeak out by hiding far away, never walking in front of a minion, and spending extra gold on wards so you can replace the ones they sweep out of the bush.  Why does this change the entire laning phase?  Because if one of them hits a grab, its over.  That's all it takes is one grab and the lane gets a free kill or double kill.  The grabs aren't ults, and they don't have ult-like cooldowns, but they guarantee a death just for landing one move properly.  So everyone who plays against them has to play the most scared laning phase from the beginning, as if they started the game so fed you can't even let them hit you once.  How is this ok?\n\nEdit: for the generic answer forum posters-  \"Dodge it\" only works when the Thresh/Blitz player throws dodge-able grabs.  All you have to do is know how to play them properly and the only way someone will dodge it is if they have a flash. I know you like getting free kills off landing one move, but I'm sorry, that isn't balanced, and this game is supposed to be balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"HDPixel1080p","date":"2014-10-08T22:39:12.808+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hooks and Grabs are a MOBA staple, a concept that allows one teammate to lock someone down while their team piles in. \n\nOther than ol reliable, \"stand behind you minions\", you should constantly keep track of their position, ward the bushes. If they grab you, that means they had a straight-line path, with no creeps in between, and someone to follow up their grab with damage. Grabs/Hooks are undodgeable when you allow them to be. \n\nSpecifically for thresh, he has a windup animation, a good enough warning to get out. I would say that Blitz is someone stronger with his grab, that's fast, instant cast, and he can follow it up himself, but ultimately, they don't go invis, so it's still your fault if you get hooked/grabbed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2014-10-09T01:32:23.473+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"now imagine laning against both of them at the same time (adc thresh with support blitz)\ntry dodging a grab from the fog of war near the jungle.
