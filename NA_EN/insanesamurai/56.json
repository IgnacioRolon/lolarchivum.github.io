Have the base items that work off what's already there for income and perhaps something else, then convert the stats into enchants and you could have a whole new world of supporting :)","replies":[{"poster":"Nerphs","date":"2014-11-22T22:47:34.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why dont we just have 1 item for Top/mid/adc/sup and jungle and we all have to start that item, and it builds into all 6 items, then we wouldnt have to have a brain to come up with ideas as we could all just cs and pick champs that scale off the items built.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CoolKnightST","date":"2014-11-22T18:55:09.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think this can work and this is why:\n\nUnlike junglers that start with {{item:1039}}. Support start with stats depending on what champion & what role in support they are playing. An {{champion:201}} will probaly start {{item:3302}}, {{item:1028}} or {{item:1054}} while a {{champion:267}}  will probaly start {{item:1028}}, {{item:3301}} or {{item:3303}}. This means they build depending on the matchup they are facing.\n\nLet's say whe implement your idea and all supports will start with a item that gives 300 health & 5 movementspeed. A lot of supports will gain a disadvantage early and force them into one start. Riot just tries to make more diversity in builds & you just force them into one.","replies":[]}]}
