For example, one team is duo bot and another couple guys are top/jungle, both looking for games, so they get merged and it then searches for a mid for them.  I think doing this would lower the generally long wait time for supports at least a little bit, since not many people go solo support(understandably).","replies":[{"poster":"Pyrrasu","date":"2014-08-31T18:11:05.063+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think we should be able to join teams as a duo, but not any higher. Enough rooms will have 2 slots open at a time that it shouldn't take too much longer for the duo to find a room.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-08-31T18:24:06.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I could see where trying 3 could cause more problems than it's worth, good call :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2014-09-01T04:30:35.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making this happen would be more difficult than you know; as I understand it, the current system governing matchmaking is still pretty primitive, with a lot of cool extras slapped on to make it as fair and efficient as possible. It's more than likely they'd have to rewrite a large portion of code to get this to run efficiently. I'd be drooling if I could get my hands on the code for almost any of League's systems, but I don't meet the age or experience requirements ;-;","replies":[]}]}
