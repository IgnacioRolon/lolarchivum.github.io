The thing that really makes him unique is he has a playstyle unlike any MOBA character I've seen, and it's immensely fun.  Basically, he's a hive mind, so he posts up somewhere on the map where you need extra lane presence, because he constantly spawns a tough minion to go to the nearest lane.  He doesn't ever actually go into the fight, however, or anywhere near it usually.  He places low dmg land mines which provide a small amount of vision, and puts himself in a cocoon and attaches to another hero, anywhere on the map, and supports them with damage abilities and a shield.  None of these skills are extremely powerful, but the ability to help someone anywhere on the map(albeit with a short CD from the last time you did it) really makes him shine.  The wonderful icing on the cake is his ult, which copies another character from your team for a duration(minus their ult and extra build stuff), which is the king of all ults for someone like me who likes to play every damn character.  Finally my bizarre dedication to not being dedicated to a champ is paying off :D\r\n\r\n\r\nIMO, Abathur is just about the coolest champ in any MOBA.  I can't imagine what kind of nightmare he would be to properly balance, but they seem to have done a good job over there of making him amazing to play but not overpowering(If anything it seems people consider him weak).\r\n\r\nWould we ever be able to get something like this?  If not the support from anywhere style(he does lead trails to his hiding spot with his spawns and dies about as fast as a minion, so he's not immortal or anything), then at least figure out a way to get that ult in League.  Pretty please????  :D","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-03-17T20:56:30.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Abathur can't just sit in his base and help outside of the early laning.  He technically can, but he'd only be using part of his kit and you really have to use it all to be effective enough to make up for someone having to lane a man down.\n\nIf that part isn't possible(understandably) I'm just hoping we can get his ult someday.  That thing is sooo fun :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dest√≠num","date":"2015-03-16T21:01:40.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically what Eleshakai said. I don't think a character like Abathur would work in LoL because of how exp and gold works here. That being said, I do think the \"globally supporting your team\" type of playstyle could work. I myself has had some ideas where you're basically playing as a Starcraft broodmother and I think it could work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2015-03-16T20:21:37.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'd never work in League... the only reason it works in HotS is because of the unique combination of teamwide shared exp and no in-game items.\n\nI'm not entirely confident it works in HoTS to be honest(he and murky are going to be perpetually imbalanced one way or another I suspect), but it definitely wouldn't work here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matthias9119","date":"2015-03-16T23:59:00.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm pretty sure that people on Riot's balance team have stated they do not like the concept of a \"sit in base and have massive global presence just by existing\" champion.\n\nThat said, they also said in the past that they wouldn't have abilities that let you screw with your teammates, and now they have both Kalista and Bard.","replies":[]}]}
