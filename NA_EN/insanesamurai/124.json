You can make someone stfu in game and keep playing, when u afk or leave thats intentionally throwing the game. This whole report system entitles too many cry babies.

I'm pretty sure I've been stuck in a low MMR since I started, and since all the raging entitled children are around my rating, that's just about all I ever play with.  The problem is, I don't belong here.  I'm not some kind of pro or anything of the sort, but I can read, communicate with people, and cooperate with my team.  At least half of the people I play with do not do any of these things(unless you count starting an argument or blaming someone as reading/communicating), which makes every game more or less a crap shoot.  \n\nAlso, I like to break meta.  There is nothing in the Summoners code that says \"You will play a popular champ or face punishment\", but the general population sure does love a scapegoat.  Play a non-meta sup and it's a lose-lose.  If the lane goes well it's \"holy crap that adc is such a god, he practically didn't have a sup at all and went 12/2\".  If you lose lane, it's entirely your fault, no matter what.  Adc just blind charged into the enemy 6 times in a row and fed?  Your fault for not being meta. The feeding adc starts raging on you, then the rest of the team generally having no idea what actually happened down there, just assumes its your fault and joins in.  Adcs will just sit back and watch you try and hold the lane by yourself, refusing to help you because they don't like your champ.   Same goes for any lane, it's just compounded for sup and jungle.  You'd be amazed how many times I've seen people blatantly feed a lane and then turn around and blame me because I'm a non meta jungler.  I'd love to see what meta jungler can stop a 4/0 Riven 10 minutes in :P  People rage on this viciously and without any remorse or fear of punishment.  I can't even begin to guess at the amount of games I've spent waiting around for the next failed surrender vote listening to the team throw insult after insult, complaining about me to the enemy team, falsely reporting me after the game.

Combined, they can summarize to \"Remembering games in a negative light has led you to believe that most people are negative, and since that's what you're looking for, that's what you tend to find.\"\n\nThere's a couple of reasons for that. Eleshakai has noted one of them: people tend to react to how they are viewed, whether they recognize it consciously or unconsciously. As such, seeing people in a negative light *more often* leads them to fulfilling those expectations.\n\nThe other reason is more personal: when you expect people to act negatively, you will tend to *only* remember negative actions. You genuinely *won't recognize* other behaviors, or will attribute them to wholly created negative motives. This is the basis of the confirmation bias: people tend to look for evidence that supports their beliefs and *ignore* that which doesn't.\n\nAnd the thing is, *everyone* does it, and it applies to *any* viewpoint. Players who don't see a lot of trolls? They're seeing the same players you are, they're just seeing them in a different light. Instead of \"That guy was a douchebag, who just wanted to ruin my game. What an ass,\" they think \"Man, he's having a rough game. That sucks.\"\n\nAnd later on, when you're remembering what a jerk the guy was and how he trolled your game, they don't remember him at all, except as part of \"that game where people were having some trouble and we lost.\"","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-12-28T23:26:27.914+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually it's quite the contrary.

I challenge them to make smurf accounts and lose a big chunk of games to simulate having a hard time jumping into pvp with veterans.  Then see how their average game plays out when it's low elo and people can't tell it's a Riot employee.\n\nYou know what actually stands out?  The other night I played with a friend, many games, and i didn't have one single game ruined by a troll.  This is what I remember because its about as rare as winning some kind of prize.  The masses of bloodthirsty children fighting amongst themselves and with me becomes quite the blur after it has been normal for so long.\n\nAlso, everyone is not seeing the same players that I am.

It's almost certain that many of the players you view as trolls were genuinely trying their best. And it's just as certain that many of the players we may view as merely having a bad game were genuinely trolling. Like I said, Confirmation Bias works both ways.\n\n---\n\nConsider this: Riot has full chat logs of every game played for the past few years (and it's not unreasonable that they have chat logs for every game **ever** played). These logs include pre-game, in-game, and post-game.\n\nRiot has *data* from all of those games as well, and are capable of viewing the overall game state in a string of \"snapshots,\" taken about 5s apart (possibly less).\n\nThere's no need for them to try such a biased experiment as you indicate above, because they have *way* more data than that could possibly offer. And that data doesn't risk built-in bias in data-collection.\n\nA while back, Lyte actually ran a quick poll of the posting playerbase by opening a thread, inviting people to talk about how toxic their last 10 games were, and then he would post what was actually going on in those games.\n\nWhat he found was that *most* people didn't run into nearly as many players who were actually considered toxic as they might have expected - though it's important to note that that doesn't mean they weren't expressing toxic behavior, merely that toxic behavior was *uncommon* for them.\n\nThe point, because it wasn't even remotely scientific - way too many biases in the data - was to demonstrate how the Negativity Bias can change the way we view a game, and the players in it.\n\nIt's also notable that Lyte got his start as a researcher, which makes this a dream job for him, because the amount of data available to him is *ridiculous*. In a real sense, all he does is research toxicity in games, and what affects it. From his perspective, it's easy to see every system Riot develops and examines as a new experiment, showing more data.\n\nSome of what their research has shown is that some 78% of all toxicity demonstrated in games comes from the players who are categorized as \"good,\" and who make up 77% of the overall population. There's so much more related to that. If you haven't yet, I highly recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbYQ0AVVBGU), recording his Play Nice talk at MIT.

Leaving games is harmful to the other players, and that's wrong. Yelling at people for any of those things is *also* wrong. And two wrongs don't make a right. It just makes an already bad situation worse, and there's no benefit to that.\n \n> I play bot lane.

I never said that if someone's trolling you it's your fault. In fact, in another post (or another draft of one of these, I forget), I said this: \"If a genuine troll is going to troll you, he's going to troll you, and nothing you can say is going to change that.\"\n\nHowever, there are times when we can *influence* the people around us into worse reactions. That doesn't mean that the guy who decided you were a jerk and started feeding was *right*... he's absolutely in the wrong. But it also doesn't mean it's okay for you to bitch at him for doing so.\n\nAnd yes. Obviously, negative attitudes can come from being involved in negative situations. Toxicity spreads, from one person to another... but generally? Those players *aren't toxic players*. They're people having a bad day, or who just had a bad game where they got bashed on, or dealing with a string of afks. They're not nasty by nature, they're just on a hair trigger.\n\nIf there's something you can do to avoid pulling that trigger, don't you think it would be beneficial to do it?\n\n> Also, not everyone sees the same players.

Toxicity is being addressed, in *all* its forms.

I've experienced it myself, and I approach it from a position of sympathy. It *sucks* to be put in that position. But responding to toxicity with **more toxicity** isn't helpful. It's just feeding the cycle.\n\nc) I genuinely don't understand how you think I'm blaming anyone for anything. All I've done so far is explain how Negativity Bias and Confirmation Bias can combine, in the context of the game, to lead us to see toxicity that may not exist, which in turn can lead us to becoming toxic ourselves. It's a nasty, destructive cycle, and I've done it myself. I still catch myself falling into it now and then, and force myself to stop playing.\n\nBut if most toxicity comes from players who are caught in that cycle, who are just having a bad day or a string of bad games, there's nothing *I* can personally do about it, except to try to help people recognize the cycle itself, so that they can learn to avoid it.\n\nTo my mind, that's not victim blaming.

It's obvious that we both enjoy a good debate.\n\nI think the difference in opinion more lies with what is a 'valid complaint'. I don't think the victimization is valid. Comparing rape victims to someone who insults others for their performance online is not a valid comparison and it leads to exaggerated complaints. I will clear it up for you though:\n\nCase 1: Rape victim accused of 'asking for it' by their clothing: A person who did absolutely nothing wrong who was attacked, that's a victim.\n\nCase 2: A person who reacts to someone's poor play by making comments that that person takes out of context and overreacts to: The person making the negative comments is not a victim. They did something wrong - during a high-stress situation, they failed to show appropriate tact. This led to the OTHER person doing something wrong by overreacting to it. As Jubbinaut said before, two wrongs do NOT make a right... but it also doesn't make either player a 'victim'. They both did something to incite the behaviour and while, certainly, neither of them deserved the magnitude of what they got, they both played a role in it getting to that point, so neither of them are innocent.\n\nAnd it's an argument that I think is kind of silly. There are very few things in this world that approach the scale of crime that rape is, so comparing the way people approach it to other infractions usually leads to misrepresenting the situation. To use the above example... the reason things like rape whistles and mace and self defense techniques are valid in that case is because of the severity of the crimes. On the other hand, if you started using mace every time someone yelled at you or did something you dislike(which is essentially the equivalent of trolling/playing poorly), you'd probably be charged with assault before long. It's just not a valid comparison due to the magnitude of the infraction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkullDuggery19","date":"2014-12-30T07:05:01.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't even know you personally.

You assumed I meant wandering around and belittling, but that isn't what I said.  I also wouldn't recommend allowing people to talk to you however they want.  The truth is somewhere in the middle, though your self-righteousness is noted.\n\nThat's true, I did make that assumption. Because the discussion you're stepping into related specifically to toxicity, and those are the common toxic responses. In short, as you weren't specific about what you meant, I assumed the common case.\n\nAs for your now-specific response: Telling someone they're an asshole is kind of an asshole thing to do. It's something done in real life, because there are different social mores there than are applicable here. Responding in real life to those who are aggressive towards you is more acceptable because there's little other recourse. There *are* alternatives in League - specifically, a tool built into the system that completely protects you from toxic language.\n\nThe situations aren't the same, and the socially acceptable response to them aren't, either.\n\n> Where is the bans for trolling?  Where is the ban for dying the same way 10 times and then typing \"lol, it's just a game,\" knowing you are disturbing people?  There isn't any, or at least there are very few.

An uphill climb is slow, but a downhill slide is very fast.  When people I know are refusing to play, there is a problem with the general community.  Yes, that includes me.\n\nSince the Tribunal was taken down, I've seen multiple bans for intentional feeding, a couple for spamming emotes and pings, and at least one for a more general \"trolling.\" I saw these in the old GD forum, the old TBI forum, and one in the new General Discussion board.\n\nI didn't save them, because I don't tend to hang on to such things. Though considering how often I seem to need them, perhaps I should start.\n\nThing is, though, that it's only *habitual* toxicity that's punished. And those aren't *nearly* as commonly seen as habitual behaviors - at least without the addition of verbal toxicity as well.\n\nI'm also not really sure what our comparative play-rates has to do with anything.\n\n> Do you also empower women to not show skin because they could be raped? Here, take this sweater, I'm empowering you.  You aren't empowering anyone.\n\nI prefer rape whistles and mace. Or knives.

If 78% of all witnessed toxicity comes from the *generally positive* members of the community, one has to question **why** those players express that toxicity.\n\nThe obvious answer is that they're responding to other toxic players, which makes plenty of sense. But then, if *those* players are most likely not normally toxic, why are *they* being toxic in that game?\n\nEventually, one starts to recognize that *many* (not all, and not necessarily most) situations that become toxic do so because *both sides* are already expecting toxicity. A neutral statement from one player is viewed as toxic by the other, who reacts negatively, inciting the first into toxicity, and it spirals into an argument that leaves both remembering that terrible jerk.\n\nSure, there are people that are genuinely toxic. That really are just jerks and trolls. Only an idiot would assume otherwise. But those players are the ones the behavioral systems look for, because they're the ones Riot wants gone. But those players don't actually make up the majority of the toxicity in the game.

It's a bad idea because it's a waste of my time.\n\nIt's been my experience that the players who laugh about reports are the ones who bitch the most when they do get banned. Or they're the ones that are trying to play mind-games with you to avoid punishment - after all, if people are convinced reports don't matter, they won't bother, and if they don't report, no case is built, and if no case is built, they never get punished.\n\nNow, that's just my experience. I haven't seen any data about such a connection, so feel free to take it with a grain of salt.\n\nI do, however, believe that Riot *really* needs to step up their game when it comes to communicating with the community about their behavioral policies and systems. I personally believe they're some of the most effective and sophisticated systems ever used, but there's no faith in them. And I think, in large part, that's due to poor communication.

I dont care how bad it was the few games you were silver.  Tonight, right now, if you go play a ranked game on your platinum account what are the odds of you getting a intentional feeder in a ranked game?  How bout a rage quit?  How about a person playing a character for the first time?  How about someone who trolls and intentionally picks a bad character?  The chances are slim to none.  You dont deal with a quarter of the frustrations  the thousands if not millions of people in bronze and silver deal with that are actually stuck there.  I shouldnt have to be platinum to not have a 50/50 chance of having someone intentionally ruining the game.  I get games where i dodge multiple queues because of negative people in character select and poor champion choices, only to get trolled after waiting 30 minutes to play again.  \n\nIt really is that bad.  Play 900 games at silver and bronze and you will start to see a pattern.  When you are just passing through on your way to platinum it all gets lost in the sauce.  Let us not forget that even when you are silver5 they still put you on the team with people that are like bronze 2, maybe even 3 i think.  Meaning after climbing a division you still get stuck playing with people that you just pushed so hard to get away from.\n\n  Lose 200 games in ranked because of afks, feeders and trollers and then tell me how you feel about what should and shouldnt be said to people ruining your rank.  Thats almost as many wins as you have on this account this season in ranked.  and if you are wondering where the 200 number comes from thats 40% of my losses.  Which is about how often i get a troll, an afk or a feeder.","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2014-12-28T02:50:46.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was silver for a full season. Season 3 I was silver for the majority of the season. I reached gold right at the end, and then when S4 started I was back in silver and had to climb out again. I have spent a lot of time in silver, and I didn't run into feeders constantly. \n\nI didn't just magically get to plat, I worked for it. I improved. And I treated people well during it, so I didn't run into trolls that often.\n\nI spent a long time at silver. I didn't constantly see afks, trolls, feeders, etc. I just didn't. Why? Because I treated people well. I expected the best of them, and they delivered. I've said it countless times... regardless of what you go into a game expecting, you'll rarely be surprised. You, at your core, expect to see trolls, you expect to see feeders and ragers and etc... and you're rarely surprised. I go into every game expecting that people are going to be nice, and most of the time that's what I get.\n\noh, and I also don't blame others. Every single game I lost, except a few during the Riot DDOS issues where I had entire games with like 2 people in them, was my fault. I was responsible for every single loss. If I went 10/1/10 and we lost, it's because I failed to make a big enough difference on the game as a whole. If I had an ally who went 0/100/2 it was because I failed to provide them with the support needed to succeed. Every single game I play, from back when I started in silver to now... was my responsibility. If you don't feel the same, then there's nothing ANYONE can do to help you.'\n\n\nEdit: Oh, and one more point. There is no justification, no excuse, no reason that is acceptable for treating someone you meet in a game like crap. Sorry, I don'tr care if they went 0/100/2 and ruined the game. They deserve to be treated well. Even in ranked play, this is just a game... and the people you're playing with matter more than the game itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Knucklefist","date":"2014-12-28T04:19:46.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thats your opinion.

I been playing since season 1.  I've been trolled HUNDREDS of games.  Maybe even a thousand by now.  I dont care if I ever make it to platinum.  IF I am bronze and I'm not a total idiot, I expect other bronze people to not be total idiots as well.  I shouldnt have to kiss anyones ass to make them play like they want to win.  You were a high silver.  Go climb out of bronze and keep track of how many troll you get on your way to silver 1 from bronze 5.  Then tell me there arent any troll or you dont get them almost any game.  Idgaf about your experiences as a silver almost gold on your way to platinum.  They have absolutely zero bearing on my experiences as as bronze trying to hit silver.  People in bronze have absolutely nothing to lose.  There is nowhere else to drop.  The mindset is TOTALLY different.\n\nI started in silver 5 last season and silver 3 this season... how is that 'high silver'?\n\nPeople are people everywhere. Most people who play a game want to have fun and to win. Regardless of where they are, that's what they want... there are a few exceptions, but they're by far the minority. What happens is people have this mindset that everyone around them are trolls, that everyone but them sucks, that nobody else wants to win.... and it colours not only the way they perceive everything but also the way they ACT in general... and other people can sense that. Have you ever met someone, had a perfectly pleasant conversation with them, but afterwards had the impression that the person really didn't like you? People know. We can tell when others dislike us or don't respect us, and it's not due to anything blatant... it's just subtle language, reaction, and other queues... while some of them, like facial tics, don't translate online... enough of them do that when you're in a game with someone, they can usually tell subconsciously what you expect of them.\n\nAnd it colours the way THEY act. If I go into a game, and I get the feeling from you and my three other teammates that they think I'm terrible... I'm most likely going to care less about the game. I'm probably not going to give it my all because 'who cares about these assholes judging me before they've even seen me play'. Which is in turn going to feed YOUR perception 'I was right, he really IS terrible, god everyone sucks so bad'... and that bleeds into your next game, and it just gets worse and worse over time until you come to the forums and make posts with statements like \"The community is full of trolls\" or \"I've been trolled HUNDREDS of times\", etc...\n\nAnd, don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say those people aren't in the wrong too - they absolutely are. But it's avoidable. It's not about kissing anyone's ass, it's about showing people a little respect and NOT assuming the worst of them before you even meet them.  It's about treating others with a little dignity and not jumping down their throats over their performance in a video game.\n\nBut nevermind... you're clearly obsessed with blaming others... so have fun with that. Continue being a dick, inciting others to be dicks, and complaining when they give you exactly what you're expecting out of them... continue losing games and blaming others for it, Continue being miserable. Because that's clearly what you want. You just want someone to tell you that you're right so you can justify being angry at others for your misery... but sorry, I ain't going to. Your misery is your own fault, and it will remain as long as you continue denying that it IS your fault.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2014-12-28T19:45:30.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Knucklefist,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=rGq3J7aF,comment-id=00000000000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000005,timestamp=2014-12-28T18:41:19.625+0000)\n>\n> lol you are hilarious.

And if you're expressing yourself in a way that involves insulting others, then yes, you do NOT deserve to express yourself. If you say things like 'ah shit I screwed that up' or 'good play guys' or 'well that could've gone better' or 'we need to focus on x'... then by all means express yourself.

IF a woman gets sexually assaulted im sure its her fault for wearing that miniskirt huh?  FOr not running faster?  Other peoples actions are never my fault.  I dont know what fantasy world you live in at your computer, but here on earth.......your actions are your responsibility.  If I'm constantly losing games from people who afk, or never connect, or intentionally throw....that has very little to do with me. I have been trolled HUNDREDS of times, just in this season alone.  Doesnt matter if you in your wierd sense of whats right and wrong feels like It was my fault or not.  Like i said.  The fact that you are in a forum typing long ass paragraphs trying to convince me that other people costing me games is somehow my fault shows me just how detatched from reality you really are.\n\nThat's such a bad argument, no I don't agree with blaming a victim, when they really are a victim.\n\nIn your case, that's not what you are. If I go throwing stones at a herd of wild horses.... when they eventually stampede and kill me, I'm not a victim. In order to be a victim, I'd have to not be the direct cause of what happened to me. In your case, the behaviours you're describing ARE the cause.\n\nI'd also wager that of those 'hundreds of trolls', probably 99% of them were just people having a bad game until you starting calling them on their bad performance. And if you'd just kept your mouth shut - not 'kissed their ass', not 'sucked up to them' - they'd probably have never actually started trolling. You might've still lost the game, but they wouldn't have trolled. You've already acknowledged that that's what you do... when someone doesn't play up to the standard you expect, you start insulting them, flaming them... and you wonder why they don't want to help you win? When a person plays badly, that's perfectly acceptable. When you start flaming them, YOU are the one in the wrong. When they respond in kind, both of you become in the wrong. It doesn't make what you did suddenly justifiable.\n\nYou're not a victim. There is nothing about you that is innocent.
