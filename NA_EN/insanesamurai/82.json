Zed was forced to lane against my Nasus top and as you can guess, both me and my mid won lane and destroyed the enemy team.\n\n{{champion:114}} last picked and said he only plays Fiora, so he took her support and was useless. Didn't even buy wards.\n\n{{champion:266}} top, almost reported him but then he destroyed a {{champion:133}} top and got fed out of his mind, to the point that he bought an {{item:3031}} and singlehandedly decimated the enemy team.

My absolute best position is out of the meta and it is the best way I can contribute to winning a game.  So, playing to win is *exactly* what I'm doing.  Them trolling me for it is the opposite, only increasing the odds of losing because someone cant resist being a bigot and a jackass.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
