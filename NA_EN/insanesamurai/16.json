I know you probably meant to ask why Lee has sustain considering his kit has a bunch of other stuff, and I agree with that point.\n\nBut still, let me counter some of your arguments here:\n1. Aatrox has enough sustain to kill all camps in his first clear without using a single pot\n2. Nidalee is a top tier jungler at the moment\n3. I agree about Nunu\n4. Rek'Sai has at least as much sustain as Lee does\n5. Warwick has bullsht deadly ganks with his ultimate\n6. Xin Zhao does extremely broken damage in the early game with his Q, and has a targeted gapcloser\n7. I agree about Zac","replies":[{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2015-02-21T03:51:55.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not the op...
