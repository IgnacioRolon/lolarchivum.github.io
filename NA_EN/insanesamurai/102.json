People don&#039;t want to simply have fun, they want to pick the most broken thing possible, crush the enemy team, and sit behind the nexus taunting and dancing.  This was such a great thing before the standard community of entitled raging trolls got involved, but now everyone&#039;s being an asshole just like normals, picking the same broken champs every game just like normals, and refusing to surrender and move on to the next game just like normals.\r\n\r\nIf I wanted to deal with all that, I&#039;d just play normals :P\r\n\r\nSo, can you auto ban the most ridiculous champs again?  That would at least solve one of the issues.  The other probably will never be solved since Riot seems to think that treating everyone you meet like garbage is acceptable behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"Crett","date":"2015-04-05T00:21:47.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:81}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:238}}","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-04-05T00:37:38.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crett,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6nGO76hZ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-05T00:21:47.021+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:81}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:238}}\n\nAgreed.

They said he's not a lawn mower, which is I guess right, he's a terminator/demon/god in the form of a lawnmower.\n\nWukong turns invisble every 3 seconds, good luck with that.\n\nHecarim.... do I really even have to explain that one?","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-04-05T02:12:55.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3364}}  wrecks Wukong. And in a final teamfight, all you need to do is put down a pink and its GG since Wukong is basically immobile, at least compared to Ahri, Zed, Yi, etc.\n\nHecarim can't even touch Ahri while he can't out DPS Eve or Yi. Eve's Q is on a 0.3 sec CD while Yi's is on an effective 1 second CD but he's untargettable for half the time, while maxing out on autoattack speed.\n\nI haven't seen Skarner but if Ahri can even kite Yi and Zed, she can probably kite Skarner.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-04-05T02:54:32.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BluePolarizer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6nGO76hZ,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2015-04-05T02:12:55.231+0000)\n>\n> {{item:3364}}  wrecks Wukong.

If he knows what he's doing he will be plenty tanky enough to endure the 2 or 3 seconds you force him to actually be visible and just run away somewhere else if he has to.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-04-05T03:07:10.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"upgraded red is true sight.\n\nUnless you fight within minions, he can't dash to shit.
