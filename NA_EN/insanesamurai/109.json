The larger data, however, indicates some very interesting explanations for that experience. Here's a quick version of it.\n\nPlayers can be grouped according to their \"normal\" toxicity level into 4 basic groups:\n\n1. \"Toxic\" - defined as the most consistently toxic players, they represent the smallest group, making up <5% of the player base.\n2. \"Bad\" - defined as regularly toxic players, they represent some ~15% of the playerbase.\n3. \"Neutral\" - the quiet or \"clinical\" players.\n4. \"Good\" - the consistently positive players. Between them, the neutral and good players represent ~77-80% of the playerbase.\n\nWhile one would expect to see most toxicity from the \"Toxic\" players, it turns out that the vast majority (~78%) of the toxicity players see actually comes from the \"Good\" and \"Neutral\" camps. In other words, **most** of the time you see a player being toxic in a game, they **aren't** being toxic very often.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-07-26T22:43:22.564+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jubbinaut,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=zd1aywbh,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2015-07-26T21:10:25.104+0000)\n>\n> You're welcome to believe that - your experiences would seem to support it.

On these statistics, do they come from Riot, or Lyte?  All I ever see him do is use the statistics of how little they actually punish people and try and politically spin that into a good thing saying that those are the only problem players.\n\nFor example, In the past 12 ranked games I played, 10 of them had people who were so toxic that they completely refused to do anything besides run around on their own and argue with their own team.  That or intentionally feeding, griefing, or just plain old afk-ing.  10 out of 12 games with basically automatic losses because it was a 4v5 in one way or another,  One of the two games that I didn't have any griefers or trolls, the enemy team had one who was quite obviously intentionally throwing the game from the start.  So, that's one game out of a dozen where the actual gameplay, team comps, cooperation actually mattered.\n\nSure this is a relatively small sample size, and it's usually not quite THAT common from my previous experiences, but it's also usually not very much better than this.  Wouldn't it be nice if they actually spent some serious effort in making the community a better place instead of rehashing the same old excuses over and over again?  Could you imagine if that one game out of twelve was the only one that was ruined by griefers or trolls?  Doesn't that seem like what a game like this should be?","replies":[{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2015-07-27T04:20:02.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=InsaneSamurai,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=zd1aywbh,comment-id=0002000000000001,timestamp=2015-07-26T22:43:22.564+0000)\n>\n> As for the previous post, I did get the responses mixed up and I'm sorry about that.

So they were the estimates I remembered from [this talk](https://youtu.be/nbYQ0AVVBGU?t=300) given by Lyte and StatusKwoh at MIT. The link *should* drop you at just shy of the 5-minute mark, where he actually talks about these numbers. But, since I have the video in front of me now, I'm gonna go ahead and correct my numbers from above:\n\n\nBehavioral Profile Representation (by type of player)\n1. \"Toxic\" - 1%\n2. \"Bad\" - 7%\n3. \"Neutral\" - 14%\n4. \"Good\" - 78%\n\nToxicity Representation (by type of player)\n1. \"Toxic\" - 5% (significantly high for relative number of players, but still surprisingly low)\n2. \"Bad\" - 8% (again high for relative number of players)\n3. \"Neutral\" - 10% (significantly low for relative number of players)\n4. \"Good\" - **77%** (low for relative number of players, but shockingly high)\n\nIt could be argued that the metrics used to measure the Behavioral Profile Representation might be skewed, but that still wouldn't make a meaningful difference to what the combined data shows. **Most** of the toxicity we see comes from players who are not commonly toxic.\n\nI highly recommend watching the video, as it's full of really fascinating information.\n \n> Sure this is a relatively small sample size, and it's usually not quite THAT common from my previous experiences, but it's also usually not very much better than this.

Doesn't that seem like what a game like this should be?\n\nThe thing is, your **entire** experience is a small sample size. When that video above was made in 2013, Riot was measuring **20 million** unique data sets per day.\n\nNow, that's not to devalue your experiences - merely to indicate the relatively high likelihood that they're actually pretty unusual. I imagine mine are as well, as I only see toxicity in 1 out of every 30 or so games.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-07-26T17:52:47.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to consider that you are placed in Bronze 1.
