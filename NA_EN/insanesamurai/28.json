Because telling your teammate they suck or they're bad is not going to help them, it is NOT criticism it IS bashing. Criticism would be something like \"Hey, next time you split push wait for us to be in a position to take an objective.\"\n\nI know if I get caught I immediately think \"(random swear) I should not have done that, and I should pay more attention next time.\" Basically, if you are going to type something to a teammate put yourselves in their shoes first and ask yourself if what you are typing is going to be helpful or not. If you are just venting then keep it to yourself also if you are getting frustrated then you should probably take a break because it's easy to tilt if you're frustrated.\n\n>Wait a second you know what you're doing wrong, and you know that you continuously make this mistake and you're frustrated that your teammates are agitated for something that at this point can't even be considered a mistake.\n\nNow this is interesting as well but please keep in mind the difference between criticism and harassment. If you can't offer a solution to their mistake or point out their mistake in a non-condescending way then just keep it to yourself. I know this will probably make people upset at me but just remember I'm not saying you shouldn't point it out but if you DO have the urge to point it out then please keep it polite or offer a solution.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-09-30T08:36:46.104+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Indeed!","replies":[]},{"poster":"iStalkCheese","date":"2014-09-30T16:22:07.750+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"too bad 9/10 times people get offended whether you're rude or just giving them tips.","replies":[{"poster":"FourteenFCali","date":"2014-10-01T04:38:52.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> too bad 9/10 times people get offended whether you're rude or just giving them tips.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PhoenixOfHeaven","date":"2014-09-30T00:26:18.376+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"agree completely! ive been yelled at so much, especially since im the type of person to run into battle as a support.....","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2014-09-30T01:04:23.506+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":8,"body":"Wait a second you know what you're doing wrong, and you know that you *continuously* make this mistake and you're frustrated that your teammates are agitated for something that at this point can't even be considered a mistake (as being the 'type of person' implies you do it quite often) but more of a conscious decision to run into battle as a support. A mistake is when you go in on an engage thinking you have more power than the Jayce, and then he levels up due to minions and you realize that Jayce can 1v1 you and win. A mistake is not 'whenever I play support I run right into battle and die because of it' because you definitely know what you're doing wrong. If you consciously know you're doing it it's not a mistake, and if you want people to not get mad at you for doing it, you already know what you're doing wrong and it's a super easy fix. \n\nIf the problem is you're playing supports that you feel like should be engaging (of which a lot of supports are actually better for *counter* engaging than actually engaging) then play different supports. Leona is the *only* support I can think of that's better for engaging than counter engaging and she's a primary tank (which is relevant because it should be the tank/bruiser who initiates the fight with their disrupt/cc). Nami/Sona ults are better for counter engage, Thresh can do just as well with a counter engage/peel for the carry. Soraka doesn't get in people's face to start an engage, Janna is meant for disengage/counter engage, Orianna's 'engage' is often used by having someone else engage and then pressing E + R, Lulu's engage is having an ally engage and then pressing R, Braum's engage is better as a counter engage. A support's job is to protect the APC/ADC and help control the flow of the teamfight. If you're the one who *engages* the teamfight then you're not by your carry to peel for them. If you're *not* the one who engages and you're the one who follows up you shouldn't be yelled at for being a part of the battle.\n\nIf you're getting yelled at in 2v2 scrims in botlane either learn to just ping you're targeting an ally before planning to go in if you're Leo who actually gets pulled to them, or don't all in them. You're not going to get yelled at for tornadoing someone or bubble stunning them, you get yelled at for making a full on engage.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2014-09-30T01:11:15.928+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair knowing what to do (or in this case not do) is very different from doing it in an actual fight.

I generally have the same mentality when I support, and when I sup for a random person that doesn't know me, it often fails.  When I do this with people who know what I'm doing, however, it leads to extra pressure and sometimes kills/objectives.  Everyone has their own playstyle, and bot lane especially is the hardest to try and meld together when it comes to two random players.

For example, my biggest flaw was that I had little to none map awareness. I wasn't using Pings, nor was I paying attention to them from my teammates. My friends were much more experienced so they were mad at me for getting caught, chasing too much or going for an objective while I should back away.\n\nBut some were nice enough to tell me nicely to check my map more often, to use ping and to wait for back up for objectives. Thanks to them, I am now a much more experienced player who take better decisions. I'm even the one making the calls sometimes, because I know I improved a lot and my judgment is good (not perfect, but good enough most of the time).\n\nTL;DR: Be patient with the ones making mistakes. Pointing out their flaws nicely will make them better players after a little while. Bashing them will just make them become trolls or worse, Teemo users.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2014-09-30T05:15:17.646+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"More like: \"When you type, you can't play\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2014-09-30T02:15:14.388+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"I usually will ignore a teamates mistakes except if they do it continually (such as walk into the river when you know their jungler has been camping you) or when they do something completely illogical (trying to win a 1 vs 5 even though most of the enemies have the same amount of items as you)\n\nI will then tell them what they did and only get angry if they continue doing it.

Also anger is not helpful either, it doesn't help them and it clouds your own judgement as well which makes you play worse too which only feeds the fire. Feedback is necessary but there is a big difference between \"Pls stop overextending baddie, you're single-handedly losing us the game\" and \"Don't push up too far without wards, if you need wards somewhere ask and we can all group to gain vision\".\n\nStop treating solo Q as a blame game and start treating it more as a team game, don't think of your teammates as the reason you're not challenger but rather think of them as teammates. The goal is to win so use teamwork and communication to win.
