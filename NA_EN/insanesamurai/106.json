GC explicitly indicated that their team isn't sure what level of play they are balancing for.  A number of their staff give the cop-out answer \"for all levels of play\", which is hopelessly naive.\n\nAnyway, if Riot were balancing for champions in the hands of the qualified, the case for nerfing Lee is very strong.  If Riot were balancing for solo queue, the case for buffing Lee is quite good.
