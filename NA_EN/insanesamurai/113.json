I think the token idea was really cool, and if you REALLY care about the mastery levels on a champion (e.g. because it's your main) then you can spend 1700 IP a few times (or less) for champion shards (and I got 20 blue essence with the one shard I bought) to rank up.

Remove the champ essence/IP thing and leave it as just combining tokens. Do you lose anything? Actually you probably gain something. It makes mastery more about skill-based stuff. \n\nDoubly so, the things that Riot -COULD- let you buy for IP are still locked behind RP barriers. If 3-5 icons are put on the store, only one will be available for IP. Chromas are RP only. You can't even buy crates/keys for large IP costs.
