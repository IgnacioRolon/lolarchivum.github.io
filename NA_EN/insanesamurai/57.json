I also never said that adults are always reasonable or that children are never reasonable.  I'm just trying to find the easiest way to reduce the most amount of inter-team fighting that I can think of.  Generally since the age gap seems to create the most situations where people seem to be completely incapable of understanding each other, that's what I chose.\n\nThe actual thing I'm aiming for is the yolo mentality, which is obviously not directly tied to age, and the vast majority of players who play this way are so young that having a reasonable discussion with them is impossible.  They generally don't even want that in the first place, so why not place them with like minded players?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klatn Yelox","date":"2015-07-22T12:38:36.848+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"well, in that case, I would call you a pedophile.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-07-22T07:40:09.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then don't split it by age, that just seems like the easiest go-to without trying to ask people questions or whatnot. \n\nHow about you have one small paragraph for each option, the first one sounding like some sort of hero who leads by action and not words and does not take orders, the second one sounding like someone who wants to combine efforts and try and work yourself into others' strategies, perhaps sacrificing personal glory for the sake of the team.\n\nIf you worded it right, you wouldn't have to use something as unreliable as age, just let the descriptions filter us into where we should be.   Sure there would still be problem players as there likely always will be, but this would cut back on inter-team conflicts immensely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"His Goatliness","date":"2015-07-23T08:09:23.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saying only adults can play a game like a mature person is pretty god damn rude really.

It's always because of either one person being a complete ass, which doesn't happen as much anymore, or because somebody doesn't know how to be constructive with criticism.

Simple idea really, some people will not group up or listen to anyone no matter what.  Those people should not be playing the same game as the ones who want an organized team effort in a team-based game.  If you ask me, they shouldn't be playing this at all, but if Riot wants a bunch of team deathmatch players ruining their community, more power to them I guess.  Plenty of in-game fighting happens because of age gaps, champ selections, mistakes someone just assumed someone made without even looking, saying anything that isn't an abbreviation, asking for help, asking someone to be safe, hell basically saying anything at all.  If someone isn't mature and/or intelligent enough to realize that fighting with your teammates is going to make you lose, than they don't deserve to be here.  At the very least, they don't deserve to be thrown in the game with people who actually want to play it properly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ARequestOfDeath","date":"2015-07-22T17:31:00.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly i hate playing with kids my age my thoughts are way too complicated for them to even comprehend so i like playing with people in their twenties.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-07-22T17:35:59.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=pokemaster275,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=uUT5GQfK,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-07-22T17:31:00.714+0000)\n>\n> honestly i hate playing with kids my age my thoughts are way too complicated for them to even comprehend so i like playing with people in their twenties.\n\nI think that is cool, and under a system using anything similar to my idea there should always be an option to switch to the other group(maybe not unlimited, but still).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-07-22T07:34:06.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And then the adults that don't want to be told what to do will make the whole division fruitless. :(","replies":[]}]}
