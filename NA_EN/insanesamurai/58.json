Has anyone seen reasonable success with any sort of item builds?  I generally do frostfang, sightstone, athene's, rylai's, lissandry's- usually in that order- but i feel like it's majorly inconsistent.  Sometimes you feel like he's the best support in the universe, others you feel like he's almost entirely worthless.  Some of that just comes with being a zoning type support, but I think some of it may be prevented with a more consistent build.  Anyone found a setup that seems to be less feast or famine?","replies":[{"poster":"HigeR","date":"2014-09-18T18:30:48.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don think he's a good tank since his base stats are so low, if you're going to support with him you better take advantage of his damage potential.\n\nRylai's is not really that good on Azir since all his spells are AoE, plus his slow on Q is pretty powerful already.\n\nI'd go with an Spellthief or Coin -> Sightstone -> Berserker's -> Nashor's tooth (Core in every Azir) -> defenses, I'd consider a Wit's end against heavy magic dmg, I wouldn't pick Azir against heavy AD teams.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kowlin","date":"2014-09-18T11:57:18.294+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I build him as an offensive poke support. Utilizing the cooldown  and mana regen of {{item:3174}}. This allows me to harras further then any ADC (This includes Caitlyn)\n\nAs starting items I prefer 2 Vision wards and a Fairy Charm, or 2 Fairy Charms and a ward. Depending on the enemy laner I judge if I want more poke over time or more safety for my ADC. As starting 6 levels I use W-Q-E-Q-W-R, below is a spreadsheet of my skill allocation.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AV6AkYf.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2014-09-18T10:52:55.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Relic Shield or Frostfang -> Sightstone -> Chalice -> Rylai's \n\nProbably how I'd build him as support.

Other 2 items depending on team needs like Locket group MR and shield, or Frozen Heart AA slow + armor, or Liandry's and Nashor's if you're so far ahead your team doesn't need defense.\n\nI've only played him once in a Normal match so far, as a top laner, but I look forward to trying him in the support role. Will check this thread later to see if anyone has an actual good supp build.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-09-18T20:58:49.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all the advice guys!
