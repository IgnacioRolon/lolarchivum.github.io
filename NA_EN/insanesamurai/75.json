Allow us to seperate into smaller groups based on age ranges, and a huge amount of the trolling and rage will not be an issue anymore.  His point was that most of these kids probably just want to play with other kids, and most adults want to play with other adults.  Mixing us together only creates extreme frustration as the age gap seems to make it almost impossible to see things on the same page more often than not.  I wouldn't hard limit it either, just make it an honor system type of thing.  If there's an extra mature teenager who is reasonable(and they do exist, I have a few youngins on my list that are quite pleasant and perfectly easy to communicate with), then let him choose to play with the adults.  Sure some random spoiled kids will click the adult range anyway(and the adults who are trolls will still be trolls), but they will probably get reported more effectively considering the general population will want a different experience.\n\nHave you ever considered something like this and how much it could help the dreadful state of the community?\n \n\nEdit:  Since you're spamming me with downvotes, care to share why?","replies":[{"poster":"AJStarhiker","date":"2015-02-15T23:45:21.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And how do you enforce it?

The main idea is not even to separate it by age but I don't know how else to classify it.  Basically sign up for a playstyle, are you yolo or are you a team player?

It would destroy alot of the rage and arguing and such though.  When I'm pissed off that I'm stuck in a game with 3 yolo que teenagers who only speak in memes trying to get them to organize and do anything as a team for the majority of the game, you know what ends up happening 9 out of 10 times?  Nobody gives a damn, they all just run around playing team deathmatch for the rest of the game, I report them.  They mute me for trying to give them direction and ask people to report me because I continually ask them to do things like grouping up, not focusing tanks, or refraining from chasing.  These kids can't be bothered to read stuff, so they just say stfu and keep doing whatever they want. \n\nThat's a pretty specific sounding occasion, but it's far from rare.
