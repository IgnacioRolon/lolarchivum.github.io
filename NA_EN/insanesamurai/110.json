Since a Lee that plays smart will always have a ward up with green trinket, he always has an escape, whereas without ward hops, he has to position far more intelligently to avoid getting caught. Personally I find his mobility far more annoying than his damage, but Bronze seems to be (blessedly?) devoid of Lee Sin players, so I don't have too much experience with him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nielarken","date":"2014-12-27T11:50:00.053+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Let him keep his mobility they need to nerf his dmg a champ with as much mobility as him shouldnt have that much insane dmg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-12-27T21:38:59.977+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reds actually commented on this a week or two ago; basically Lee is a problem but he isn't the most pressing problem atm (cue the downvote rage). They'll probably look into reworking his and a lot of other jack-of-all-trades bruisers (ie. Irelia) at some point, possibly a year or two from now, I don't know, I think ChampUp is mostly focused of getting Poppy and Tristana updates out right now, after that there are champs that have been long waiting for some love (Yorick Urgot WW Taric etc.) and are honestly further out of whack than Lee Sin is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2014-12-27T21:45:55.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lower the range of his Q (The first cast, not the second)\nMake his first Q cost the full energy cost of both, refunding 20 energy for dealing damage with the recast Q.\n\nMy only real problem with lee is that he gets to throw his Q out at a very long range for a gap closer(skill shot or not) and is not punished for misusing it. \n\nThis would make him have to be closer to gank a lane.
