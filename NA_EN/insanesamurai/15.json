Not only do you get *far* more chests, but the chests are usually much better, containing full items instead of shards that require you to consume others to unlock.  The shard system is still there for rolling duplicate loot rewards, but instead of being a requirement to unlock anything, you can simply save it up as a currency to unlock items of your choosing.  As for the actual loot items, you often receive 3-4 minor cosmetic things such as emojis specific to a character or voice lines, which are admittedly a much smaller reward than a character or skin.  The thing is, you very commonly get these items in addition to a free skin, character, or mount(basically another form of skin).\r\n\r\nRiot has said things along the lines of how they can&#039;t afford to give out more free stuff than this, but Blizzard has mostly proved that wrong with their new system.  You get vastly more chests with better loot that you don&#039;t have to consume other loot to own, and they do not enforce any cap whatsoever on how many chests you can earn during any specific time period.  Any chance the loot over here will get improved now?  Or at least once Heroes runs with this new system long enough to show that it&#039;s not putting them out of business?  :D","replies":[{"poster":"Seth the Green","date":"2017-05-01T02:14:19.849+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riots only source of money is skins, would you work for free?

Let me explain you something.\n\nWhen LoL was a new-ish game, they used to give away a lot of things. Why? because the playerbase was small-ish and they did it to attract more players (is exactly what Heroes is currently doing). When I joined back in season 2, you could get 3 free skins (one for youtube follow, one for email and I think the third was for twiter or something), they also give 2 more free skin for referal and give away a free skin if you were part of season 1 (sadly I wasn't part of it). At the end of season 2,everyone got a free skin and a free champion, also you could get some free skin chest (a gurantee skin not a shard) in a few events they did. IP boost could be earned pretty easily (just be part of a tourney and you had a 10 win IP boost that woudl stack, we used to play 2-3 tourney every weekend)  By the end of Season 3, the playerbase was so big that they didn't need to do this and so they stopped. \n\nThe second issue is sister products, Riot Games has none (you might as well call it LoL games at this point) so all the money must come from LoL. Blizzard on the other hand have far more successful games (granted not all of them are at big as LoL but still successful) so they can afford to cut the earning in a few games if they can recoup them in other.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2017-05-04T03:10:37.456+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Condescending isn't really the way to go.  If they were making money with a smaller playerbase, they're not gonna stop making it now(unless people start flocking to more generous games).  The money they \"lose\" is fraction of a fraction.  With the amount of champions and skins in the game, people aren't going to get the specific things they want very often, and are going to end up buying them anyway in a large number of cases.  A constant trickle of chances to get free things will keep people playing, which is likely to more than make up for the occasional case of someone getting a free item they would have spent cash on.","replies":[{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2017-05-04T05:36:54.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just don't understand, they give away skins to gather players. You would recommend it to your friends and they to their friends and so on and the game will spread. A videogame will nee an extra 30% of new players each year to keep growing, sadly LoL no longer achieve this ratings and the players that do play will continue playing regardless if they get free gifts or not. There is no gain on promoting the game that way anymore, is just an overhang at this point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rain NT","date":"2017-05-04T05:42:31.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"its called get a job and buy RP. which one you rather have, the most popular esport game played for free, or free skins and characters for a monthly payment to play the game.
