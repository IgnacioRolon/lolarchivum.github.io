Don't grab full-health tanks or self-centered AOE champs to grant them free initiations is a REALLY obvious signifier, but also a Blitzcrank needs to know who will most likely immediately die if he does fire a hook. Katarina with Shunpo+Flash+Zhonya's still active? Sure, she's a nice target in that she's squishy and likely to die if hit, but actually hitting her is going to be hard and may turn into a waste of a hook. Half health Garen when your team has a dedicated tank killer? Well why not, he will have trouble escaping and your tank killer can probably destroy Garen fast enough.\n\nSee, the only world where Blitzcrank is really toxic is in low level leagues where everyone thinks 1 successful hook=immediate death omgwtfplznerfrito","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xenohaz","date":"2014-10-29T06:50:27.880+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Explain how Blitz is bad for the game please?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Greedalox","date":"2014-10-29T07:12:36.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's  got an avoidable skillshot, no dashes and an ult that pushes your lane.
