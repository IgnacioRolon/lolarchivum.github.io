If you want a skin, buy one of the many in the store. It's not really a reward for anything though... it just shows you were willing to spend $5 of your well-earned cash on a cosmetic item. For casual players, there are plenty of icons that are attainable by participating in events and such. \n\nThis game will never really be about long term rewards, unless you decide to climb through the ranked ladder. I've never even touched ranked, and I've been playing since season two (okay, I did play one ranked game a while back.) I play because I feel rewarded by the small victories I achieve while in a match, winning a game, improving, or grinding IP for a champion/runes. \n\nIf you find owning skins rewarding, just buy them... if you don't have money, then save some up, cut spending, sell something, wait tables once a week (seriously, just work for like 3 hours and earn $40-$200... plenty of skins to buy with that) If you have an internet connection and time to play a game, I don't really see why you can't get the skin you want. I'll never understand a person's \"need\" for skins though. I have quite a few myself, but I could take 'em or leave 'em.\n\nAnd besides, if you're willing to pay actual money for virtual things, you may not be as casual as you think.

I think what is happening is the influx of new players is drastically overpopulated with the type of people nobody wants to deal with, and very few of the people who can be reasonable and communicated with.
