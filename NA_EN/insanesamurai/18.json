I often see Gnar's boomerang dissapear and reappear at random intervals(as with other skill shots simply being invisible), and the minions and champs will occasionally start moving way faster for a time(minions freeze up before this happens).  \r\n\r\nIs it just me?  Cause invisible Morg Qs do not add anything to the awesomeness of this game lemme tell ya :P","replies":[]}
