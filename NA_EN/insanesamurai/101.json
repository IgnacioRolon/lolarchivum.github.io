You introduce champion mastery which rewards you with... (drum roll) nothing!  Woooo!  Do you not see the connection here?  \n\nIn addition, if you can't just make palette swaps a reward for champ mastery, please explain how they can't be bought with IP?  Someone at Riot said, probably about 2 years ago, that they were constantly looking for new things to give us to spend IP on.  They just found it, then decided to go full greed and charge 5 bucks for about 10 seconds of work :(\n\nWhy?  You can't convince us that it's a grueling, time consuming process to change a guys shirt from blue to green...","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-05-08T18:32:16.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guess you didn't look at the comments on anything involving chroma packs.  Hundreds and hundreds of people were expressing disagreement with charging RP for them.  I didn't say  I didn't like chroma packs, and I didn't say they shouldn't exist.  Don't put words in someone's mouth then insult them for it.   It's a color swap.  The hardest it could possibly be is someone has to go change a few numbers.  It won't kill anyone for it to cost IP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Commit Sudoku","date":"2015-05-08T14:02:03.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"not all champion mastery levels have been unlocked dude only 5 there were 8 or 9 no pbe those are the ones with rewards\n\n>You decide to charge RP for color swaps despite nobody agreeing with the idea.\n\nWhat are you talking about tons of people wanted this and as far as I can tell no one said no riot don't do this. If you don't like chroma here is a simple solution don't buy it duh.\n\nThe one of the reward ideas for Champion Mastery was a Chroma color that you couldn't get any other way. Ofcourse we can't actually know what they will be since they didn't appear on pbe and there aren't even chroma's from every champion yet but this idea was tossed around by Riot.\n\nAlso, and this is in my opinion, you are acting pretty childish saying Riot is screwing up on what is really just cosmetic to the game this stuff doesn't really effect anything. Grow up Riot is a business the ultimate goal is to make money.","replies":[]}]}
