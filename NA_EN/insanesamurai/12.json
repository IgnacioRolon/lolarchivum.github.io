The guy that knows the right time to initate is silver by default and with some game knowledge and mechanics plat is as good as his.\n\nSometimes you might want to take into account that game isnt all about grouping as 5 and going mid. Work around objectives. Ward enemy jungle. Get kills on them. Teammates will join you because none says no to a kill. You will have a huge advantage because many supports in bronze dont ward and when they do, they do it wrong","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-08-29T00:13:10.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, unless the team is never where they need to be.

What is to prevent players from stat padding then? That doesn't promote teamplay. If people like you assumes you can't get anywhere with the team you have, what is to stop you from simply protecting your score instead of contributing to the team?\n\nThe system already takes into account your MMR and opponent MMR when distributing LP. What more do you want? To distribute by role? That's ridiculous. It would artificially change pick rates because no one would want to play certain roles.\n\nIf you have another idea besides stats and role adjustments I'd be happy to hear it.\n\nAlso, the opening post screams teammate blame. At no point do you fault yourself.\n\n> ... teammates trolling, refusing to listen/group/communicate, or just plain feeding ... if your team isn't good you automatically lose? ...  do not see how it's fair to punish someone for getting unlucky teammates ... when you're the support its exceedingly frustrating ... your team is being an average bronze team\n\nThe only thing you say about yourself is you play a low damage support that can't do anything. I'm sorry, but this kind of mentality is exactly the reason why you don't rise in rank.\n\nI got news for you, support carries the bot lane and can impact the map just as much as the jungler when played well. You not knowing how to accomplish that is no fault of your teammates. You are already convinced that support can't carry and expect us to prove you wrong. Bro, the burden of proof isn't on us. It ain't the fault of matchmaking. It's not a problem with LP distribution. The one constant in every one of your games is you.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-08-29T05:36:56.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not arguing with someone who joins conversations just to argue, sorry.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2014-08-29T03:43:00.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty easy to make a big impact as a support, especially at lower Elo when the other support has no idea what they're doing. \nThe support is mostly the play-maker for the lanning phase, and pulling off solid plays puts 2 members of your team ahead and 2 members of the opposition behind.\n\n\nAs far as carrying a loosing team though - Win/Loss tracks how big of an influence you have on a game resulting in a win or a loss.
