Tibbers has a fairly low cd though for an ult :P  Plus if she doesn't have her ult she can just use her w and its practically the same effect.  She also doesn't need flash.  People can have ancient coin or guardians, then thats another free instastun burst engage.  The 4 spell windup is a joke.  Maybe if you actually had to hit a target with her spells, but she can just sit back for a few seconds and recharge her stun whenever she wants, so that's pretty much irrelevant.\n\nAlso, once she uses Tibbers, she can q e w q and hey there's her stun again faster than Veigar's would ever come back.","replies":[{"poster":"John JJ Schmidt","date":"2015-07-17T15:52:20.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=InsaneSamurai,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hbrqEAGB,comment-id=00050001,timestamp=2015-07-17T14:34:28.820+0000)\n>\n> Veigar's E does not have a low cd.

(Not that that's a long time, just more than a few seconds)\n\nOnce she uses Tibbers, if she charges stun again with Q,E,W,Q (which takes four seconds between Qs) she can't use that charged stun for another 4 seconds when W comes off CD.\n\nGod, I feel like I am saying she doesn't need to be tweaked. I totally agree she does. I was just saying not to hold up Veigar E as a comparison.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-07-17T16:36:25.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=John JJ Schmidt,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hbrqEAGB,comment-id=000500010001,timestamp=2015-07-17T15:52:20.819+0000)\n>\n> Veigar's is a low CD compared to 80 seconds max R for Annie, is what I meant, since we're comparing Veigar E to Annie R ;)\n> \n> Her ult has a range and a circular AE versus W being conal PBAoE, requiring her to be right on top of you all instead of a nice safe distance back.\n> \n> Even with a Talisman or Righteous Glory, she shouldn't be able to initiate fast enough to get a good group stun off without Flash.\n> \n> It takes 10 seconds to charge a stun with no targets, W,E,W,E.

I totally agree she does. I was just saying not to hold up Veigar E as a comparison.\n\nWell, my point is she will have another stun, and likely another AOE stun, before Veigar would have his E back(also at times she can do it slightly faster if she last hits with the Q for the CDR).   Sure it takes that long to charge a stun if she cant throw q on a minion or jungle mob, but how often will that really happen?\n\nAlso, yes the W is a pbaoe, but it hits a pretty similar sized area as Tibbers and can serve the exact same purpose under slightly different conditions.  Finally, it's not like Annie has to initiate the fight herself every time, there are plenty of tanks running around to initiate for her when she doesn't have flash and/or some sort of ambush planned.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MAN OF INTELLECT","date":"2015-07-17T15:47:27.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brand also has AOE nuke too, don't forget that.
