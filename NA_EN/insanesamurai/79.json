Let's have that champ get a guaranteed kill as long as he lands the skillshot under a turret or near teammates and hits a predetermined string of buttons after landing it.  This skillshot is not an Ult, it's a normal move.

You can add as much baggage as you want to it, but it will never be balanced if there is no counter play.  Other skillshots of that range have various weaknesses, like keeping the champion who used it from attacking for a short time (Thresh), cleansing (Morgana, Lux), or being blocked by minions (all of the above).\n\nA skillshot that is either a kill or a miss will never be balanced, particularly when the additional baggage to try and balance it is easily done with a macro.","replies":[{"poster":"Xenohaz","date":"2014-10-06T00:59:41.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of this, and it's also very demoralizing when you know with 100% certainty that you can be instakilled, regardless of other details.
