In order to take a game from 'low chance to win' to 'no chance to win' - which is what surrendering does - it should take the entire team making the decision.\n\nI also never said that games where you get slaughtered are one in a million, I specifically said that games where 4 out of 5 players on the other team can kill you in ~1 second are one in a million.\n\nHowever, if they're 'just waiting in the jungle for you' then they're not making money, so you should gradually narrow the gap by farming lanes if they do it for long enough. And if they're farming the jungle, then they can't all be watching all entrances at the same time and you should be able to get vision of a few spots to try to make something happen when they're not all there. Take a bit back here and there. It's not LIKELY, but it's not impossible. If a team's goal isn't to win the game, then you can win it by out-thinking them no matter how far ahead they are.

When the game isnt decided yet but you guys just want to quit instead of trying and i think we can win if we just started to cooperate better then im not caging you, you are caging me. 3 to 2 isnt a good advantage anyways, specially when the game can be won or lost by one person. Besides like i said its possible that its 7 to 3 in wanting to keep playing, so why should 3 people decide the game for the other 7? Your own logic used against you except with a better majority.  \n\nI will agree that the Surrender system has its flaws but not for the same reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-04T22:30:30.926+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Many of the times that this becomes a serious problem, it is because the enemy team is just milking the game and not finishing.  In these cases they would never allow a surrender, because their goal is to stay fed and winning as long as possible at the expense of the other team.\n\nThe other team is not included because it's a surrender vote.  The deciding factors are the people on the team that is losing, determining if they have lost enough to not drag on the game.  In a world where most people didn't care more about themselves than anyone else, sure, allow the enemy team into the vote.   In this world, 9 out of 10 times they're not going to help you out just to be honorable.  They're going to do the same exact thing, trap you in the game cause they have 20 kills and they wanna keep instakilling people who have no chance at all of putting up a fight.  If you want to play this game to get fed and just faceroll the enemy team over and over again without taking objectives, you're not doing it right, and Riot's systems should not cater to that in any way at all.

In your example it is a pain in the ass to deal with that, but its just something you need to accept as part of the community. Even though they are being poor winners their opinion still matters and they are having fun, unfortunately at the expense of others. If you want to have a fair system you need to take both sides into account, thats just how 'fair' works, and a 4/1 vote is the most fair with only 1 team voting.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-04T22:57:14.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"4 to 1 is not even remotely fair.  All the one guy needs is a friend or someone he can easily sway, and he traps the rest of the game.\n\nIt's rarely even worth trying at that point anyway.  The vote comes up, and 2 say no when the other 3 believe there is absolutely no reason to continue.  So you stay and argue about surrendering and whose fault it is and who should have picked what champ for a few minutes, the vote comes back, you click no, and proceed to continue arguing.

You have bad experiences with surrender-system and i actually tend to win most of the game that we fail to surrender.   \n\nThere are two sides to this and both are correct in their own ways.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SexyTaylorSwift","date":"2015-01-04T22:32:10.910+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Surrender should be 5-0.
