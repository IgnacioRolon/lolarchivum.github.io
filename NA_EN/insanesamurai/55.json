As it is he forced J4, the **OTHER** best jungler in the game to run for the hills and easily stole his red buff and came out with about 80% of his HP left with just a hunter's machete.

This is where riot goes full retard.  The early gankers don't really need jungle items.  They aren't hurt so much by needing an extra 100 gp.  Jungle items are crap in PvP until you fully upgrade them... unless you get the devourer and need to AFK farm more.  \n\nJungle items aren't the problem.  Junglers that can gank bot at 2:30 and go 2-0 are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2015-02-06T19:47:01.956+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think what Riot is failing to understand is that if they nerf Lee Sin in the balls, he'll be on par with other junglers, and viewing games with different characters is more exciting than watching cookie cutter match ups.  \nEveryone sees Lee Sin, knows what he does, and its always like \"Whoopee, he kicked someone in the nads again.\" This bores people seeing it game after game. However, if say there were more viable junglers other than Lee/J4/Vi, it might actually be exciting to see things like Elise, Evelyn, Sion, Nautilus who can be equally as entertaining. But because Lee Sin is OP and can nail them into the ground with ease, you don't see them and it creates stagnation.  Ergo, Lee needs the nerf bat to increase #LCSBIGPLAYS and keep the viewer base entertained.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-02-06T16:28:26.373+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"You could delete Lee entirely and we'd still have near zero jungle diversity.\n\nLee is a symptom of the problem.  The problem is that the jungle favors generalists; Riot was hoping to have specialists in ganking, dueling, counterjungling, and farming, but it turns out to be better to bring a versatile jungler that can do everything acceptably well, rather than a Nunu or a Master Yi type.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-02-06T18:48:47.514+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well yes and no. They would like to have specialists in different roles for the jungle. But the problem with Lee is that each of those roles (pick, poke, team fighting, ect...) he is good at. He might not be THE best, but picking him into any team comp does not hurt. So having the junglers who can do everything well are the problem.

It is very funny, because they describe him as a \"ranged, melee, tanky dps, assassin, mage, tank, support, jungler.\" Although, some of this is redundant, he actually can fit a lot of these descriptions to do his kit being so overloaded. Lee has a crap ton of burst making him assassin like, even though he can do this with only one damage item due to retarded scaling. This allows him to build super tanky and use his amazing kit to set up a bunch of kills for his team (support). Then of course due to his crazy mobility it is almost like he isn't even melee, because being melee is supposed to be a weakness to things like ranged; lee sin don't give a shit about ranged opponents because he can immediately reach them with his q or ward hop to them, eliminating the weakness of being melee by, in a way, making him psuedo ranged.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fox Tango","date":"2015-02-07T05:26:21.248+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder why they cant adjust gold values around jungler items according to the champion that uses it.
