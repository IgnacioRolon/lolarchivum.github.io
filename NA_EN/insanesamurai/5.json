you.\n\n\"Lee Sin is overpowered, and overcentralizing, because with a good player, he can land all of his abilities.\"\n\nThat is stupid, and nonsensical, and does not work in reality because it would suggest all of the LCS is bad at the game.\nThey are at a much higher level than yourself first of all, and it is stupid to suggest that anytime Lee sin is successful other people messed up.\nIt can be stated for any champion including those who were horribly broken on release.\n\nWe discuss Champions, not the player, and that is something that Riot and LCS pros recognize.\nLee Sin is a dominant force, because he is Lee Sin, not because the player behind him makes him what he is.\nLCS pros recognize it, RIot recognizes it, high elo players recognize it.\n\nWhen you can actually

It becomes a glaring problem when the balance team refuses to touch a champion but consistently nerf nearly all the others just because he's popular. Sure, some will lament balance changes, but if the changes are subtle and not an overall change to how he plays, then it's not so much a big deal.\nAs a side note, I often wonder how popular he actually is.
