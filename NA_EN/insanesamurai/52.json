You know what will go away faster?

Lee Sin is either going to have to drop out of competitive play or be a rare-ish pick in competitive play otherwise the anti-Lee Sin circlejerk isn't going to be satisfied and demand more nerfs.\n\n2.  These nerfs can't make Lee Sin the worst champion in the game in solo queue in the process or the pro-Lee Sin circlejerk is going to pressure Riot into reverting the nerfs or buffing Lee Sin and we will be back where we started.  Considering his winrate currently is around 46% and just outside the lowest 15 champion winrates, there isn't a lot of room for him to fall.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-25T21:32:00.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed on both counts :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"tkmteam5158","date":"2015-02-25T16:37:17.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Whats wrong with Lee Sin?","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-25T18:19:28.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look around the forums, many people have said it much more eloquently and with more detail than I would.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FHMarshy","date":"2015-02-25T16:45:33.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lee has been at  46.46% win rate for last month and below 50% in win rate a few months consistently already. \n\nMore than half of the game Lee is picked, his team loses. \n\nWhy does he need change? or are you proposing to buff him?","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-25T18:19:01.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You really think the old global winrate proves anything?","replies":[{"poster":"FHMarshy","date":"2015-02-25T19:05:57.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://na.op.gg/statistics/champion/\n\nold? updated monthly = old?\n\nand do you really think Lee sin is OP?  lmao\n\nChecked your stats, you played Lee once in season 4. 0-8-5 Lost.
