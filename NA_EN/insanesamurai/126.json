However, online society has become an integral part of life, from conversations via Snapchat to networking on LinkedIn.","url":"http://recode.net/2015/07/07/doing-something-about-the-impossible-problem-of-abuse-in-online-games/","image":"https://i2.wp.com/recodetech.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/riot-games-feature-copy.png?fit=440%2C330&quality=80&strip=info"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why does he just run around spinning facts like a politician instead of acknowledging how horrible the community is?\r\n\r\nThis is, for good reason, widely known as one of the worst communities in gaming, and has been for years.  \r\n\r\nThat article looks almost exactly like one I saw about a year ago, throwing around similar statistics that look great when he words it like that, but are absolutely not representative of playing this game with random players at all.   Nothing has improved since then.  Riot still refuses to log pregame chat and everyone knows that, so they will troll and/or try to put someone on tilt as hard as they can just to either bait a dodge, or have fun griefing someone.  It is also widely known that they also don't actually look at the gameplay logs, so people can blatantly use the actual game to grief them as well and as long as they don't reveal themselves in chat, Riot will only punish the victim.\r\n\r\nIn 3 years I've seen the normal communication in this game descend from \"kinda annoying\" down to \"quite difficult\" then down to \"complete cesspool\".  Nothing has changed no matter how many raging spoiled trolls I report, and now it's actually best to just mute everyone, every game.  Why?  Because if you say anything at all that might possibly be construed as negative while being skimmed over by a Riot employee in 3 seconds, you might get punished.  Hell, I've even heard of people getting punished for not talking at all.  The report system is nothing more than a tool for griefers, and Riot doesn't seem to care in the least.","replies":[]}
