People get angry when things go wrong. Far more angry when they perceive that the wrongs are not their fault.\nBlaming others allows someone to convince himself he was not at fault, and relieve the anger over thing's not going right.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-08-29T19:19:15.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is true, but shouldn't they be able to realize that it never produces a positive result?","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-08-29T19:47:03.569+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That implies logic, and the unfortunate simple truth is that when you're angry you're not thinking straight.

It **can** be a healthy behavior as long as it's focused in a non-hurtful, non-destructive way (think a stress ball) but that isn't true in any case of League toxicity (because focusing on other players is both hurtful and destructive). It's unlikely they think it will *help* the situation.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-08-29T20:20:29.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you mean, but that's where their logic really contradicts itself.

In other game forums, I might have to spend an hour constructing a feedback thread. The person throwing a two line insult at me might only have to spend 10 minutes. It's really easy to let your emotions take over and dominate the discussion. In the short LOL games themselves, when people are angry, it is much easier to yell than to control your emotions and say something objective. So, basically, it comes down to the amount of effort people want to put into their arguments.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-08-29T19:18:34.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is often true, but it goes beyond this sometimes to the point where it seems like some sort of mental condition.  I've seen ADC's blame top lane for them losing their lane(enemy top stayed top the whole time), mids blame the sup for the jungle getting counterjungled(by the enemy jungler, not bot lane), and all other manner of completely nonsensical blame throwing.  \n\nI think somewhere along the line, many of the random children that play this game came to think it's \"cool\" to attack someone on their team every time something happens that they don't like, because somehow they will seem like some sort of god player if they can convince us all that they never make mistakes.  The part that really confuses me is how people keep doing this over and over again.  Start arguments, the game becomes an argument instead of a league game, and you lose.  Happens almost every single time, so I don't get what it is that makes these people continue to do it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cyrus Blackmoon","date":"2014-08-31T06:35:43.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because people overestimate their own abilities, and can't accept blame for their own mistakes. Lost 2 games where people argued and bickered, and one of them was where I was getting called a noob and the worst player on the team. There were other issues, with mainly people getting caught out and left to die, and starting other engages, but people would rather bitch and whine than actually win the game. Sigh. Now I've lost 7 out of 10 ranked games lately.","replies":[]}]}
