Any duel-centric champs do well with it. Once again, Skarner and Nocturne. Even Rengar to a point, unless you're playing the bursty Rengar instead of the sustained damage one. Reducing the damage dealt to you while increasing the damage you do is extremely helpful for anyone who relies on auto attacks to win trades.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2014-12-05T17:55:16.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's both the item and the champion\nWW has a ult has really has no counterplay in LANE when you are a solo champ.

The part that gives you bonus true damage on hit after smiting a champ is just specifically nuts for WW and not really impressive for anything else i can think of unless lucian starts jungling :)","replies":[{"poster":"Killer X 12","date":"2014-12-05T16:46:33.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Literally any auto attack based jungler can use it.  It works well on Aatrox, fiora, yi, diana (though not my first choice on her), Udyr, xin, and even lee sin. Also since you will be fighting without the smite buff 55 out of every 60 seconds i think the base stats are a bit more important.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MetaCosmos","date":"2014-12-05T16:01:40.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're nerfing WW and the item is overpowered.\n\nUdyr and Xin also deal insane amounts of damage with Devourer.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-12-05T16:03:25.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rejoice :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tsukuy0m1","date":"2014-12-05T15:58:38.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they are nerfing ww....","replies":[]}]}
