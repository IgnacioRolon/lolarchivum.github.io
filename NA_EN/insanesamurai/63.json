She has good dueling ability, everything she does is an AoE attack, good mobility, good utility, takes turrets better than most mages, and most likely has the best teamfight ult in the entire game.  The only thing that isn't above average on her is her slight mana hungriness, but that is easily solved.  So what is she actually bad at?","replies":[{"poster":"Hippy","date":"2014-10-02T23:01:38.781+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

You don't see Ori lose lane very often at all.  I could see Galio beating her due to MR if he's really good, or Syndra just cause she's almost the same thing as Ori(good at everything and almost impossible to catch).  Most of the rest, however, are either not long enough range to have much presence vs her, or way to heavily skillshot based, and at the standard distance an Ori will hang from you, they will have time to get out of the way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zaikyo","date":"2014-10-04T00:06:18.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, I've found that when her hp reaches zero, she dies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"2000boxes","date":"2014-10-02T23:04:01.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"any assassin","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-10-03T21:06:42.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well besides Zed and Akali who need some nerfage themselves, I dont think too many would be able to beat her.","replies":[]}]}]}
