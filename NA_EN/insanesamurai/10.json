I was against Renekton so i chose Garen, i main Garen Top and am confident in my abilities to beat Renekton. I chose Ignite and Zed told me \"Hey stephenwhatever, if you are Top then take tele not ignite. Ignite isnt going to help you.\" to which me and some of my other teammates replied \"Ignite can be better on Garen then Teleport.\" he didnt believe me but whatever i didnt care. The game started and he decided that telling me how to play once wasnt enough and started saying \"Ignite is useless top, i bet Ignite wont help you once.\" To my embarrassment i ended up giving them First Blood, i went to flash Q Renekton but hit a minion instead and died. After that i murdered him over and over again, of course with the help of Ignite cutting down on Renektons ability to heal with his Q. Meanwhile Zed is chain feeding Ziggs and still thinks he has the right to tell me how to play... So after awhile of him rapid fire typing telling us we should all do and how we suck i told him to \"shut up\". See my score was 13/7/0... his score was 1/9/4 and that one kill could have been a double kill but he ulted Morgana instead of Ziggs (both were below 300 hp) then blew all his abilities killing Morg and let Ziggs get away even though Morgana doesnt have an escape (her flash was down and Ziggs Zhonya's was down).  \n\nSo in this kind of situation anyone telling me how to play and yet they are bad, toxic, or dont know what they are talking about i will tell them to stfu, because their terrible commands are why we are losing.","replies":[{"poster":"Quort","date":"2015-02-17T00:33:24.227+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Stephenizgod,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=lopEpvEq,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-16T19:50:03.890+0000)\n i went to flash Q Renekton but hit a minion instead and died\n\nNot the same scenario, but we've all had that one minion destroy us!
