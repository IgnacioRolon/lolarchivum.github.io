It's hard, but possible.\n\nI agree with trying to fit the playstyle.  But what i'm talking about is beyond that.  People decide you're the reason they lost the game before it even started if you break meta, and this happens probably about half the games i play unless i conform to the most popular champs in a role.  Even then people get crazy about it, ie graves jungle or brand support.  These are very effective and roles for the champs and they are even in the meta, but people flip their lid the instant you pick something that isn't widely accepted at the role you're in.   There are jungle adcs on the regular and people still lose it completely if you don't take one bot.  Do we really need 2 every game?  No. But people are so willing to jump on anyone who does anything different that it doesn't matter to them and that's really sad.  There's not too much worse than being trapped for 30-60 mins(cause they never surrender) with a guy who has dedicated the entire game to blaming you and griefing you.","replies":[{"poster":"Tonyob20","date":"2016-02-01T00:25:45.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes you just gotta trust people.

Almost as if this behavior was encouraged.\n\nBut.. breaking the Meta IS encouraged.. in fact it was encouraged directly in an address to the community in one of the previous 5. updates. You should encourage others to break the meta, YOU SHOULD BREAK THE META YOURSELF. You will become a better player by seeing how to manipulate characters in different roles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ada Wong","date":"2016-02-01T00:23:58.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn't much to do so many damn trolls lately.\n\nOne game 4 ADC Players, 3 of them went ADC I just went with it and went ADC too no point.\n\nOther games players who just flat out threw, they actually tried, but always a dumb move or something, but compared to players who Intentionally threw that was a lot worse.","replies":[{"poster":"No flash no life","date":"2016-02-01T02:44:58.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ada Wong,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=IQKl0Tui,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-02-01T00:23:58.546+0000)\n> \n> One game 4 ADC Players, 3 of them went ADC I just went with it and went ADC too no point.\n\nDamit who was the one guy that didnt go adc.
