That says alot about where your priorities are and it&#039;s quite disappointing.   If you don&#039;t do something about the community, the type of players you want will slowly move on to other games who actually have enough control over their players to allow people to play the game instead of fight and argue and pray they don&#039;t get teamed up with spoiled raging 12 year olds again. \r\n\r\nAlso, did Lyte write that section about the Sandbox mode?  It really seems like one of his spin/excuses.  You&#039;re not going to add a mode that would let anyone test things out without a huge hassle because you think people would occasionally be assholes about it?  This also says alot.  You realize you can punish and remove these assholes, right?  You don&#039;t have to let them play this game, and you really shouldn&#039;t.","replies":[{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2015-08-06T19:59:31.321+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still have no Idea what's taking so long with fixing the tribunal. Considering that 3rd party sights can snag several things regarding player stats, and analyze them in detail. It shouldn't be that difficult to make a web function to create the tribunal cases.","replies":[]}]}
