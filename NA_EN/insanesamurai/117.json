If you don't change something seriously impactful about how you police things, it's not going to start improving.  It's gotten so common that you can't even really play ranked and expect to get a real game.

It wasn't meant to be played as a 4v1v5, or a free for all team deathmatch game.  This game was meant to be played with people who are capable of listening to each other and modifying their strategies accordingly, not to realize there's a problem and do everything you can to ignore it or insult the player closest to the problem.

The full discussion in that part of the talk was about this very concept, actually.

It's not a regular thing for them. Rather, it's more commonly the result of a bad day, or retaliatory behavior, or whatever. However, there's rather a lot of them, so in conglomerate, they can create a **lot** of bad experiences.\n\n> Try playing ranked and tell me there are only 8% problem players. \n\nKeep in mind that if 8% of players are problematic, then - statistically speaking - you'll see one a little less than every other game.

They're applying it to cases of extreme verbal toxicity, as well as quickly-detected forms of griefing, trolling, and intentional feeding. Thing is, though, that's been applicable since shortly after the Tribunal went down and they adjusted their approach to more-effectively account for *intensity* of toxic behavior, rather than basing the severity of punishment purely on recidivism.\n\nThe concern, though, is that many forms of griefing and trolling aren't quickly or easily recognizable, so the system is forced to simply follow the \"standard\" method of waiting for sufficient report density.\n\nThough they are getting better with intentional feeding. Last I heard, they were testing and finalizing a system designed to automatically detect and sanction intentional feeders (not unlike Leaverbuster). It's not *quite* ready yet, as far as I understand, but it's heading that way. I expect to see it within the next 3 or 4 patches. Certainly by the end of the season.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ZACKandATTACK","date":"2015-08-01T20:37:23.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot bans people and gives players the opportunity to report other players.
