The meta stops being a metagame at that point and starts being \"you're only allowed to do something if pros do it\".  For example, Lulu mid was awesome, but when you tried to do it before it became a pro thing, people flipped out on you and threw games over it.  At some point, some pro does it, then all the sudden it's a thing, and it's ok, despite the champion being exactly the same as before they did it. \r\n\r\n Wouldn't it make more sense to just play the game and see if the guy had a good reason to pick whatever abnormal thing he did?  I'm pretty convinced that the majority of the time that breaking meta fails, it's because the team implodes, not because it actually performed poorly.  For some reason people will often sit there and not say anything about the pick(even in team builder) until the game is already started, then they try as hard as they can to blame everything on you.  I've seen people go so far as to say they're getting camped by the jungler top because bot didn't have a metagame adc.

The thing is that he he still wants to win as much as possible and he doesn't feel like you're working toward that. Then, you probably label that player as \"just another close-minded/flaming player\".\n\nThis leads to an unwinnable situation where 2 of your players are *tilted* pretty much as the game begins. The support has low faith in his AD carry, since he feels that he's just another player that is stuck on playing meta picks, and probably even muted him, and possibly others, quite a while ago. Meanwhile, the ADC feels like he'S having to carry his lane 1v2 since he's stuck with a troll that doesn't wanna do everything in his power to win the game.\n\nThen, the support performs worse since their coordination is shit. Everyone blames the support since they both are performing similarly, but you're playing an awkward pick. You blame the ADC, since you're tilted and he doesn't perform as well as you would like (because he's not cooperating because he's tilting) and he's tilting because you're not cooperating because you're tilting. Even in other lanes, the situation will often appear again either between jugnler and laner or between both solo laners.\n\nIn a lot of cases, the \"throwing\" player won't be feeding on purpose (even if they say so), they will simply be tilting just like you are, but both are so annoyed that they can't realize how that game was lost since champ select since there were already 2/3 tilting players.\n\n---\n\nStory of a Poppy support main.\n\nP.s.

Maybe you're right and they only claim to be feeding on purpose but I ask because no-one who actually engages in this behavior has ever explained it to me.  \n\n---\n\nAs to the off topic bit, Swain support is weak against hard engage all-in lanes (and Morgana).

However, I've had a shitton of dickheads who would either ban Poppy to make sure I play something else, or flat out take support screwing the entire team over (since now everythign that was called/picked has to be reorganized with little to no time). I know it's ironic that I'm siding against communication, but it's a fact that people are tilting quite easily in the face of non-standard (I hate non-meta as a term, because it isn't used for what it actually means).\n\nWhat you can do... in short, nothing. What you can actually do is not go on tilt, and keep having faith in your close-minded ADC, take on your team's flame without letting it get to you in the slightest, and try to showcase what Support Swain accomplishes, while coping up for what most would expect to be his downfall. In reality, unless you're the most altruistic and optimistic god, that's impossible. Because we both know you and I that it's a serious truckload of hate that comes your way, and it's hard and foolish to try and make a nice play that revolves around an uncooperative player.\n\n---\n\nOnto the off topic bit, what I hated the most about Swain Support is that he doesn't offer Poppy/Mundo/Zyra/Annie/etc.'s level of damage unless he gets pretty far ahead, and he has a pertty hard time counter-initiating. So not only is he weak to all ins on himself, but he's weak to all ins on his carry. In Zyra's base, her poke is a lot safer (plants), and her counter-engage level 6+ is MUCH better. For Janna, your counter-engage is basically godly and among the best. I still consider Janna a situational (to not say bad) pick. Otherwise, I believe we play our support swain differently, because I found Morg to be relatively easier than mosts.","replies":[{"poster":"Thunder Dreamss","date":"2014-08-11T03:55:41.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've found that generally I only get rage from the **team** when someone is throwing on my count.

The key is you only need to get one e off to burn all 3 stacks.  It's not Zyra levels of damage but more reliable than Mundo and safer than Annie.\n\nI think the big key is I play/build support Swain as a tank.  Start off getting gold with Spelltheif and build tanky.  Laning and mid-game I focus on peeling for the adc.  Swain's q is kiting made easy and w is great for catching any melee that jumps on my carry, Leona included.  Unless I'm really ahead I don't worry about damage until I have the mana pool to sustain my ult in mid to late game.

If I lock in Poppy support, I force my team to cope with it. They can choose to flame me or throw the game, but that makes  them griefers, and me the victim in all of that, meaning that they ends up in the tribunal (eventually if they keep at it), and I don't (unless I flame back).\n\n>League needs a meta, and while the meta must be changeable to survive, league cannot survive without it.\n\nI think this is a grave misconception of what the meta truly is. Even they ended up buffing the xp share ratio of all creeps and jungle monsters to 100% it wouldn't really change the meta immediantely, since the meta isn't something that is created, it's something that slowly appears. The meta is basically what you expect to see when entering a game. saying that Summoners Rift is 5v5 is as much part of the meta than going 1-1-1-2, and letting onyl 1 of the 2 takes creeps bot. Whatever you assume will happen in the next game is the meta.\n\nSo basically, even the first day LoL was released there was a meta (Play champions you enjoy, kill your opponents as much as possible, group up for taking down major objectives likes dragon baron and inhibitors/nexus, etc.). Even the first time that a new game mode is played, there's a meta that's based on everyone's experience of other game modes and whatever info is available about that mode. You cannot have no meta, and the meta cannot be static unless the game is terrible (because as knowledge grows, the meta evolves).\n\n>The majority of league players( in my experience) blindly follow the pros, without thought or reason.\n\nThe majority  of the players actually don't even watch pros, and thus have no real reason to follow them. What happens is twofold. First, everyone plays whatever they enjoy and feels help them win, and that automatically escalates toward stronger picks and more efficient strategies. Next, a minority also watches LCS/streams and use whatever knowledge they gain from it to get an advantage over their enemy. If Imaqtpie says that the new Lucian is way broken, and that I can see him getting stomped by Lucian 5 games in a row without much place to gain some ground back in 3 of the 5, I will assume that he's right since he's more knowledgeable about the game than me, and showed me arguments that Lucian is indeed very strong.\n\nThen, all players end up \"communicating\" (*read as shout at each others' face*) about their finds and tips and tricks (the most prominent example is ban phase), and proceeds to work \"together\" toward victory. All those exchanges often ends up siding with what pro does since they often follow safe and consistent strategies.","replies":[{"poster":"Worgslarg","date":"2014-08-10T21:44:07.918+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">Actually, you can.

Tryn Support OP Right? Not really. I'm basing my results off a low-rank environment where the players are by no means professional. Another thing is that an off-meta pick will often require more skill than normal. It's why you'd see things like \"Oh I'ma play Viktor top\" at LCS and absolutely destroy the competition but when someone tries to replicate it they get smashed.\n\nBottom line is that if you think something is good, by all means try it. But just know that it's totally possible what you believe is a top-tier pick is just a hyper pub-stomp choice. \n\n\n(And of course the generic asterisk for the possibility that you actually DO randomly find the next sicknastybrokenOP thing. It's super unlikely but not impossible.)","replies":[{"poster":"Thunder Dreamss","date":"2014-08-11T17:18:28.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Pros breaking the meta isn't a spur of the moment \"Hey let's try something crazy like Tryn Support\".

And it's better to progress by playing as well as you can without gimmicky picks. If you win by abusing the FotM, you're gonna struggle when it's not FotM anymore. (Again, another example but bear with me).\n\nNot to mention the backlash. If you win? \"Oh wow we won despite <xxx>\" (Even if you did good) and be sure to tank every loss. Asides, why would you pick something that makes people argue? Arguing and anger will lose any game 90% more than an awkward pick will.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-08-12T06:52:36.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I guess it makes more sense if people don't think too hard about random picking stuff, but I try to do some theorycrafting beforehand(most of the time :D ) or else I'm really not likely to try it.
