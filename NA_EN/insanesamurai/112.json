You can't just treat someone like shit because they broke meta.  In addition, once champ select is over, you're locked in with this person.  Why exaggerate the problem and try and cause arguments when you are guaranteed to have to deal with this person for at least 20 minutes?\n\nIn general, you guys really need to chill out a bit.

That is at least 11 waves of full waves, and no offense to any lower elo players, but I don't anyone below gold can actually not miss a single CS in 11 waves, so assuming he misses only one per wave, that is a total of 15 waves we are looking at. it takes about 9-10 minutes just for 15 waves to spawn and reach lane. \n\nIt isn't hard to conclude that either he was fighting his ADC for CS, he never grouped to fight but push wave all game long after lane phase, or he went into the jungle to take jungle creeps.

They kept leaving me alone bot.  What am I supposed to not defend the turret?  Is this guy(theres one of these guys in like every other game) supposed to be allowed to treat me like trash?  You people are amazing.  Just go ahead and make bizarre assumptions, so long as they make me at fault, right?
