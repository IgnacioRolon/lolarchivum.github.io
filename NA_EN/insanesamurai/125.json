How can it make sense to increase my ranking when I didn't help my team win in the least?\r\n\r\n    Ok, new scenario, I play a game, win my lane massively, help other lanes successfully, and take several objectives. Everyone else on the team argues, insults each other and feeds the entire game, refusing to listen or to help, and gets the inevitable loss because one man cannot win a 5v5 game under realistic circumstances. If I had a nearly perfect game and tried to stop the in-team fighting as much as I can, why do I lose ranking just as much as the rest of the team?\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded:  Sorry if you posted in my last one, it was deleted and I may have missed it since Riot won't simply move posts where they want them :(","replies":[{"poster":"12tales","date":"2014-08-25T15:44:57.924+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because ranking systems aren't supposed to draw conclusions from single games. The point is to evaluate your skill relative to other players, *using hundreds of games as the data to do so.* Obviously you get some wacky conclusions if your sample size is literally one.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-08-25T15:49:10.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"My sample size of two is to show how the system is flawed without being long winded because long posts get downvoted without being read.

A system tailored to drawing conclusions from extended patterns is not going to yield accurate results from two data points - it's not a flaw, it's simply the nature of the tool you're using.\n\nAnyways, suppose you win 60% of the time when you play extremely well, and win 40% of the time when you play like trash. If you're consistently performing well more often than you're tilting or whatever, your ranking will rise. The opposite will happen if you're consistently under-performing. Which seems fair.\n\nHypothetically, though - would it be better if Riot withheld data on your LP, and only gave you updates every ten games? Nothing would functionally change, but it would presumably mitigate how apparent the effect you describe is.","replies":[{"poster":"bbbbates","date":"2014-08-25T16:12:45.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im with 12Tales here, the idea is that if you are a higher skill than where you are placed, after many many games you will move up, and if you are about at that level you will stay roughly where you are. You always have to keep in mind that the system can never be designed to use single games as data because of the scenarios you described above. The 60-40 thing he brought up is a very good point. The system has no way of going through game data and saying \"Oh this guys had a good KDA and we didnt detect any toxic speech from him so lets boost his LP\" So it has nothing to go off of win loss ratio, which not matter how you look at it will be higher if you are better and lower if you are worse.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-08-25T16:50:47.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not really the case with inconsistent players, such as myself.  I have days where things just aren't working and I fail left and right, I also play way too many different champs, so my familiarity levels are all over the place.  Combine that with the idea that all it takes is a few bad games in placement to get you in Bronze, where losing because of trolls keeps increasing your chance of losing because of trolls.  It seems like after a huge losing streak that dropped me to Bronze 3, even if I make sure to only play ranked on good days, only play my absolute best champs, and try and be as positive as I can, more often than not, there is at least one player on the team who makes the game a waste of time in one way or another.  It really feels like once you get low enough, its a total crap shoot to get out, because you aren't playing the game anymore, you're just wasting 30-60 minutes on a random chance of which team got more trolls.  That is not even close to fun.\n\n The idea that I should play hundreds and hundreds of games with spoiled raging children just because the system isn't designed to accurately place me until then doesn't really justify the process.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosty Tibbers","date":"2014-08-25T17:20:08.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're good enough you don't have to play hundreds of games to rank up.  I've placed this account into Gold 1 with a higher than 80% win rate over 20+ games.  I've had my fair share of trolls and feeders.  If you're truly better than the competition you can carry.  Sure, I can say some of those wins I probably played less than stellar (although I still assisted the team because I understood my place in the team and how to handle it), and that 3/4 of my losses were sadly due to dcs or feeding, but even with those I am still climbing fast.  It's also very possible to win 4v5s.\n\nThe point of the ladder isn't how good you are at killing, roaming, or whatever.  It's about how much you can win a game.  You could be 0/15 everygame but if the enemy team wasn't smart enough to execute and you got their Nexus first it doesn't matter.\n\nFYI: I've climbed pretty much all but the very top of the ladder in the past year.  People act like children at every elo.  Ignore them and focus on improving yourself.\n\nIMO, it sounds to me like you don't know how to translate leads into objectives and close out games, since when your teammates are fed you win but when you're fed you don't.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-08-25T17:58:17.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If one guy is fed and the rest of the team isn't, that generally doesn't mean all that much if the enemies know how to deal with the one fed guy, or if the team refuses to get together for teamfights.  Some champs are much harder to deal with in this case than others, but I don't really play them very often(I also play support more than most do I suppose).  I am trying to practice Nasus alot for this reason, but he's pretty easily countered so I can't go for that all the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Frosty Tibbers","date":"2014-08-25T18:21:18.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is harder to carry with one fed person on your team, but in lower elo it honestly doesn't matter as much because people execute focusing you so badly it's easy to outplay them anyway.\n\nI agree with Nasus getting countered easily.  Once again though, at low elo it's really easy to outplay.  I taught [my friend](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/40600313#ranked-stats) Nasus when he was in Bronze 3 and coached him through every game and he carried himself out of Bronze in one weekend using Nasus, Annie, and Nami.  If your team doesn't group -- that's great as Nasus -- use the chaos to splitpush and get some inhibitors much like Zion did this weekend.  Just remember to ward and farm Q stacks.  Also, don't be afraid to 2v1 if a jungler ganks with low health.  Oftentimes my friend would be getting ganked by a jungler with like 200 health and would kill the jungler with a Q and then kill the enemy laner as well, and that's a HUGE advantage for your team as you can tell everybody else to go to dragon and then take a tower or two top.\n\nEDIT: Also, I'd like to mention that everytime that you lose a ranked game, you should take a 15 minute or greater break.  You can get messed up mentally from losses and not even notice it sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-08-25T19:08:09.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the input!

But honestly, if you approach positively than you can really bring your team up without realizing it. I used to go into every game going, welp gonna get trolled and lose LP again. A friend of mine I duod with once basically switched my mind set by dropping this on me:\n\"Dude just go into every game thinking I will do the bet I can this game and have fun, because really you can blame trolls and feeders all you want but the only common element in all your lost games is you\"\nI took his advice and started playing more positively and I have now almost gone up an entire league from when he said that. Yes there are trolls in league, yes there are feeders. But at the end of the day if it comes down to you, you have to be the level headed guy on the team.

I just realized that the vast majority of my ranked games amount to which team had more people actually trying to play the game properly, not which team worked together better or was more skilled.  Maybe it's not like this for everyone, but to me winning a game because the enemy had a leaver or troll isn't very fun, and since losing for that reason is obviously no fun either, ranked is rarely enjoyable(at least in bronze or low silver, as that's all I've experienced).","replies":[{"poster":"bbbbates","date":"2014-08-25T18:11:35.042+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although this is often true, and games that I win have the enemy team going \"This guy sucks report pls\" I do still enjoy playing ranked, as it brings out more of a will to take the game seriously and improve myself than casuals do. \n\nKeep on trucking and dont be negative in games and you'll get to that group of nice players. \n\nTo be fair, it seems that playing at different times during the day affects this hugely.

Did he go in alone and die?

I don't see how that's even remotely close to acceptable.  I have done nothing to deserve playing on basically \"prisoner's island\".  It doesn't exist in the technical form, but the system is designed so that bronze is basically that.  All the players who do nothing but cause problems gravitate here, and they don't get banned because riot thinks a spoiled raging child can be reformed with chat restrictions  :(\n\nIf the game is full of toxic players, and you don't separate them from the reasonable players who just want to play with mature level headed people, guess who ends up leaving?  The spoiled raging kids sure don't seem to care.  People like me, on the other hand, get fed up being forced to lose LP over and over just to babysit a bunch of horrible trolling kids, and leave.
