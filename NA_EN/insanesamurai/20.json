I'm tired of going into game after game after game where the only things said are taunts, memes, or abbreviations.  I'm tired of these people who have absolutely no respect for anyone whatsoever trying to play a team based game as if it was call of duty.  This would be an amazing game if you split us up, by the way.  As it is, I spend more time wishing I could leave games than actually being able to play this game with teammates capable of communication.  Is that really what you want this game to be?","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2015-07-23T09:29:45.027+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly the main problem with that is all those FPS. Kids come into these types of games (or any other genre) and have that type of mentality. its not healthy, but what can we do? They play all these COD, BF, Halo, etc which the main point of the game is just get X-amount of kills to win. Then come to these games thinking they need all the kills when its much more than that, but act like a baby when they dont get a 10-0 kda. If they actually knew the point of this game and its objectives there will probably be more people who wouldnt act out like that because they actually understand the game!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2015-07-23T07:35:56.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure those are event children?

I'm sure there are plenty of adults who manage to also fit in this category, but the vast majority of these players are children who have absolutely no interest in understanding anything beyond their KDA, and this will destroy the game if nothing is done.","replies":[]}]}]}
