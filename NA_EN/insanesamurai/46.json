There is a huge difference between implementing new mechanics and finding a way to balance the game out and either bring champs up to par or make a way of exploiting new abilities. A great example is how Riot is only releasing high mobility champs lately. All because they have these game designers doesn't mean they know how to balance it. I mean they are game designers not MATHEMATICIANS or STATISTICIANS, since numbers are a variable they aren't going to be able to find a healthy balance.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Centuros","date":"2015-01-11T20:36:18.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least we don't have 5 second point-and-click stuns like Dota 2.\nI may be exaggerating, but not by much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"soliznoel","date":"2015-01-11T18:05:07.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:78}} , look at her passive and her ult.
