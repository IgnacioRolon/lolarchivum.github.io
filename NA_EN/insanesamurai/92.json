Plus if they made you pay they would lose a majority of their market due to the loss of the whole \"free to play\" attitude. Maybe make an option to buy more dedicated servers? You could choose not to, but if you have a lot of time and money in the game it wouldn't be a bad idea to provide something for the more long-term players. Although a downside to this would be that rito would completely ignore all the normal non-pay servers almost forcing you to buy them if you want to have any luck staying in the game. I'm sure there are better ways of achieving this goal. \n\nAnd to the OP, it definitely would not be worth paying for riot to do what they should be doing anyways regardless of whether or not the game is free. The community as a whole is not toxic, but there is a certain percent (probably approximately 30-40%) that feel entitled to things even when they definitely don't deserve them. And also toxic in a way that they blame everyone else on their team instead of taking responsibility for their mistakes; mainly due to a lack of maturity. It may help to put an age limit on the game, I know there's ways around it, but a lot of the trolls and toxic players have that 10 year old call of duty player attitude (mostly because they're 10-15ish years old). Another option could be to make servers dedicated to \"fooling around\" or testing new things; I know this is what bots/customs are for, but you can only test things so far with bots, even intermediate bots are pretty easy to win against, and it doesn't take much skill, PvP is a lot different in a sense that people are way more unpredictable than bots, and through this players would benefit from playing against other people. The only time I play customs, or bots is either when I'm at home with shitty internet connection, or if I'm drunk or something as I would prefer not to ruin other player's experience's due to my own problems. Rito may also benefit from putting a note on the queue of ranked to inform all players that this is a place for serious play, and should be cautious not to screw around too much. It may also be beneficial to include that unless you have a stable internet connection, and a stable amount of time to play (I.E. starting a match if you know you have to leave for class/work/ whatever else in under an hour, you should avoid starting up a match). Obviously things happen in a person's life where they must be drawn away from the game for a few minutes, these are things we have no control over, but if you start a match knowing you may not have time to play through it completely, you deserve any punishment as a result of your actions. It would be smart to teach players that there are better times to start matches.\n\nThis time issue is the main reason why I don't play ranked. I have work just about every day from around noon to past midnight, along with school. I also do not have a stable internet connection at my house, I do, however have perfect internet while I'm in my dorm room.  I could play ranked at school, but I really don't have the time. It feels like ranked is a very big time commitment and I also don't trust the others living in my dorm due to past experiences (the freshmen never know how long to put the fucking popcorn in the microwave for, and end up setting off the damn fire alarm very frequently). I literally don't have time to play everyday, hell I haven't played in about a week due to work and school. Ranked to me feels like I would have to play every day, for a solid portion of each day to advance in it. While I don't believe I would be placed in bronze, I do feel like I may end up there just because I would never really have the opportunity to actually play a ranked match. I hit level 30 last year and my interest in the game increased with my skill and understanding for it (with regard to play style, builds, warding, and also different roles). I would love to play ranked, I just don't want to ruin other people's experiences in the queue's just because I have a busy schedule at this point in my life. \n\nI'm positive a big problem with toxicity in ranked is individuals in situations either identical, or very close to mine, yet ignore these obstacles and play anyways. I've played games with certain players that would get up and leave 10 minutes into a match because \"they had to go eat\". I can guarantee you this person was under the age of 18, as no parent would really force their adult offspring to stop everything they are doing to eat dinner. I've also had people jump into normals with me and proclaim to everyone, including the other team, to make it a quick game as they had to leave for work in 15 minutes...why on earth would you start a match if you had to leave in under 15 minutes? I don't care if it's not ranked, if you have that much of a time restraint I would suggest either not playing at all, or going into a custom match. Just because you've won a game in under 15 minutes before, does not mean it will be that way this time around. And this type of encounter is not a one-time occurrence, as it has happened to me quite frequently. Just because younger players can be good at the game doesn't mean they should be allowed to play it. Besides the fact there are sexual themes and mature references in the game (such as nidalee's dance...or actually most of the female champions mannerisms, along with tryndamere's joke, and many more) that children should not be exposed to. I understand that our younger generations these days have access to much worse things, but this does not give reason to allow them to be exposed to it. At the very least there should be some sort of parental guidance/control in order to allow younger players on this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wonderlands","date":"2014-12-25T18:56:08.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2014-12-25T18:58:19.134+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First...

I went into every game and was nice to people... and shockingly enough(okay it's not really shocking) they returned that attitude for the most part. But a lot of people like yourself go into the game EXPECTING the community to be bad, so they subconsciously treat others worse and bring out the worst in them.\n\nGuess what, everyone... you, me, your mother, Gandhi, etc... is CAPABLE of being a jerk. We all have it in us. But it takes someone else to believe that we can do it for it to come out in a lot of people... and if you go into the game believing everyone around you is a jerk, you're enabling them to let that out. Is it wrong of them to do so? Absolutely... but does that make them 'jerks' in general? No. It just makes them human.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-12-25T19:20:14.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I generally try to be respectful when I play, but there is almost always at least one player in the game who seems to make it a point to be disrespetful regardless.","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2014-12-25T19:27:39.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=InsaneSamurai,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=PEEr6fyK,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2014-12-25T19:20:14.379+0000)\n>\n> I generally try to be respectful when I play, but there is almost always at least one player in the game who seems to make it a point to be disrespetful regardless.\n\nIt's not about whether you're respectful, it's about what you, at your core, think of them. If you think someone's most likely going to be an ass, even if you 'try to be respectful' you're going to treat them differently than you would treat someone who you think is going to be nice.\n\nThe fact that you consider the community horrible is all I need to know to understand why you see so much bad behaviour, and it's not that I'm accusing you of going around insulting people... but it's only natural that if you think someone's a jerk, it'll be harder for you to be REALLY nice to them.

And this has been proven to be the case for the VAST MAJORITY of people. If they expect something bad to happen, or if they expect someone to mistreat them going into a situation, they act differently than they otherwise would.\n\nI even said earlier that I'm not claiming you're going to go in and start insulting them... but subconsciously - and probably without even REALIZING you're doing it - you will treat people differently because you are going into your interaction with them assuming they're going to be a jerk.\n\nAnd as I said a moment ago, the type of experience you're describing is not the norm. It's only the norm for some people... and those tend to be the people who go into the situation assuming people are going to be jerks.\n\nI think I can sum this up in a simple statement:\n\nRegardless of what you go into your games expecting, you'll rarely be surprised.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ChexMex","date":"2014-12-25T22:27:53.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's like saying 'i dont murder them until they start' or 'i dont cheat until they start',\nthat doesnt justify you being rude or mean, it is just an excuse.\n\ncommunity is bad nonetheless","replies":[]}]}
