The same can easily be said for Lee Sin, Fizz, and Zed.  Thresh has too much lockdown to also have as much utility as he has.  One of these should be nerfed, but then we'll see less awesome Thresh videos I guess, so that's a no go.\r\n\r\nFor Fizz/Zed, there's a different issue.  I don't think Riot is comparing damage to mobility properly.  When a champion only needs to go up one kill to be able to safely tower dive and kill you at 80% health, you can't even lane against them anymore, and the lane is over as soon as you die once(or go down x amount of minions, or just be the wrong champ).  Since they're Fizz/Zed, you likely have to be defensive from the start since they are both nuts to try and trade with, which gives them higher odds of going up on you, which instantly loses the lane.  How is it ok for a Zed to get a free kill every time his ult is up?  Are you expecting us to just end the laning phase at level 6?  How is it ok for Fizz to be able to dash 2-4 times per fight and still do enough damage to 3(or 2) shot any squishy he wants?\r\n\r\nLee Sin is just Lee Sin.  Always has been and seemingly always will be the god of the jungle, and there is no way Riot can honestly think his skillset is balanced.  I say keep the mobility and nerf all his damage(especially the Q).  The Q is one of the longest range dashes in the game, it does not also need to be a huge damage hit.  You make Lee do sub-par damage because he is the most mobile guy in the game, and then all the sudden those Lee plays actually mean something(Teamwork?).  Right now the Lee plays are generally him going solo and doing crazy crap that nobody should ever do, and surviving because his W came back in time or because his kit makes it so the entire team can be chasing him and come up empty more often than not.  That's not promoting teamwork at all, you're actually penalizing the team for trying to collapse on a huge threat by allowing him to almost always escape and waste everyone's time.","replies":[{"poster":"Tocosamuri","date":"2015-01-04T22:50:05.660+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree with the first part, disagree with the second part. I agree with the fizz, I find mid lane right now is nothing to do with skill in anyway, its just whoever chooses the better champion. Fizz, Akali, etc. One kill towards them and its over for the whole team. Ive played where bot and top are crushing lanes, but fizz akali zed got a tiny bit fed and just roamed and dominated. Makes it not worth playing because 100% of the time the person playing mid against them isn't that great and feeds no matter how many times you tell him to play safe. \n\nAs for the Lee Sin, I personally don't see too many Lee Sins dominate games, I find Lee a bit squishy and not so hard to kill. I would say since they nerfed WW jungle has become a lot more fair grounds, and truly the better jungler will show.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-05T10:13:21.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lee doesn't get played that much I suppose because not that many people took the time to learn him.  That's all it takes though is to learn him and he's a god, flying over walls, murdering adcs, and counterjungling the hell out of you.  Champs that can go practically wherever they want shouldn't also be able to 1v1 most champs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2015-01-05T00:22:24.957+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.\nEach dash in a kit means the ability to completely avoid the damage of a skillshot ability with 1 click, possibly even an ultimate.\n\nThen you create champions like Yasuo who can dash infinite times AND get the ability to completely block all projectiles for an insanely long in-fight duration.\nYou also create champions like Zed who already have 3 dashes in their kit and add in invincibility. At the same time he gets a high damage AoE skillshot which costs only 55 energy while his natural regen (without runes) already gives him back 50 energy in 5. Allowing him to infitely push. if that wasn't enough his dash also gets a passive which increases his bonus AD by 25% ? But wait! There is more! Why allow his ultimate to increase the damage of active items as well?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aurelius Maximus","date":"2015-01-04T22:45:56.438+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"People's perception of this game is tiring and i want to respond but i don't want to write 40 essays a day explaining why you are off the mark so ill give a very short response.\n\nLee sin isn't broken.
