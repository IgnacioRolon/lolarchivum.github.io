Or are you saying you just don&#039;t care?\n\nEdit: So getting downvoted is somewhat hilarious on this subject.  Do you just hate urf and want it to be the same thing every game?  Or do you want to just go play \"may the best Sona win\"?  Cause that's all it ever is.  One team has a Hec and the other doesn't?  Hec team wins barring complete mental retardation.  Both teams have a Sona?  Whichever Sona gets more fed wins the game.  How is this fun to anyone?  I mean you might as well just play rock paper scissors and save the wasted 20 minutes of trying to kill an immortal Skarner or Swain for the 200th time","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-04-07T22:28:36.000+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because they have better things to do than fiddle with a mode never meant to be balanced.

They did it last year, and unless they haven't been paying attention at all they have to realize it should also be done this year.

You destroyed TT jungle in the beginning of this pre season and all this months after it's still in the same state, at least urf would be a joke mode where you have no meta, in TT you either go dual lane 100% of the time now or lose like a retard in jungle lvl 1 while everyone invades you free all game and get free kills with 0 counterplay, such balance much wow.\n\nPS: Urf even in this current state hilariously enough is way more balanced than fu..... dominion and TT, how sad is that.","replies":[{"poster":"Lime Josh","date":"2015-04-08T23:44:52.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AkabaneKun,realm=EUW,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=KbwIBEBg,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-07T23:03:01.704+0000)\n>\n> Err why would they care, TT and dominion are completely unbalanced for months now and they haven't done anything to change it, i do find it hilarious how they used \"cuz it would be hard to balanced\" on the Q&A for why they don't make urf perma.\n> I mean riot it's not like you balance anything expect SR is it?
