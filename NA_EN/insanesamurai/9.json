Is this really where you want the game to go?  I don&#039;t think everybody really wants to play game after game where only one guy really matters because he happened to get fed first(as long as their team knows how to help them do stuff or distract people while they get a penta).\n\nIf one champ can become unstoppable just for getting a 2 or 3 kill lead across the map from you where you couldn&#039;t have possibly done anything about it, then comes in and destroys both other lanes with a faceroll, where does the team aspect of this game?  There are plenty of champs that can get their lead and start winning 1v3s and 1v4s, and this makes little sense to me in a 10 player game.  If the idea is to end games faster, I don&#039;t think this is the right way to go about it.","replies":[]}
