I've started about a year ago, and I've had nothing but miserable experiences playing Sion. His last two updates before the rework were April 2014 and February 2013 before this, so even Riot didn't seem to interested in including him in the minor balancing of champions.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2014-09-25T20:55:55.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old (technically current) Sion has some very serious issues with kiting.  He can be fed to the point of being able to 1v5 a CCless team, but against two people with CC he can do literally nothing.  His entire kit is designed around sticking to one or more targets and hitting them.\n\nDon't get me wrong the current Sion can still do some work, but it is rather easy to outplay him since he has no play making ability.  Riot could either keep a mostly useless champion around or use it as an idea for something new.  If this new kit was a different champion, with all of current Sion's strengths, but none of his weaknesses Sion would see even less play.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-09-25T22:17:50.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I could see it being problematic at times, but his playstyle was quite fun before, and now it's going to be entirely different.  I feel like a method of playing got killed moreso than the champ himself, you know?  Also, as for being able to 1v5 a CCless team, plenty of champs can do that when fed enough and it doesn't seem like Riot has any intention of changing that.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2014-09-25T22:22:45.807+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fully understand.  I actually got back into playing Sion recently, since he deals with Nidalee so well in lane.  Unfortunately unless newer champions lose some of their mobility older champions like Sion will find it harder and harder to fit in.  Times have changed for better or worse.\n\nI'll never forget Taric/Garen bot lane...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"IAintDarius","date":"2014-09-25T22:24:58.293+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> I really don't feel like anything is that horribly wrong with Sion's current kit\n\nDon't have to read any further.","replies":[]}]}
