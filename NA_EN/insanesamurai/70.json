He's a decent backup pick for if your top pick is banned or picked, but he's not a contested pick anymore. He's been picked... what twice... this season in the lcs?\n\nLee's not the King of the Jungle, he's just a relatively strong backup pick that you can use if y ou're really good with him and the top jungle picks are taken relatively safely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2015-02-26T07:32:15.016+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Likely because his win rate is piss poor and any real amount of nerfs would have him drop even further. Honestly, I don't care about when the opponent picks Lee Sin because statistically, I have a better chance of winning with just about any jungler in the game. Seriously, you statistically have a better chance of winning the game with Olaf then Lee Sin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-28T15:38:00.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well dang, that woulda been an easy 20 bucks for you guys :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-26T11:43:08.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edit:  Oops this was supposed to be a response to Jamaree\n\nGlobal statistics cant help you when he becomes the best duelist in the game just from buying a longsword, and invades your jungle repeatedly with no repercussions since he can hop a wall or 3 if things actually do go sour for him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-02-26T15:01:03.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has been nerf many times already. \n\nA nerf to Lee Sin now would have to be an entire kit change. And that is not a quick thing to do. \n\n\nLee Sin current kit is strong not because of numbers, but because they work off each other so well. QWE all have 2 parts to them that give either damage or some kind of buff while giving him attack speed/energy from his passive. Take one thing away from something and his entire kit fall apart. \n\n\nLower the attack speed of his passive? He can't do damage to jungle anymore. \n\nTake the energy return from passive? he won't be able to link his moves together. \n\nlower the damage of his skills? They have been lowered a lot. it his auto attacks and the second part of Q that his damage happens. \n\n\n\n\nThe only thing that I think that can still be nerf and not break Lee Sin identity as a whole is the % damage on the second part of his Q. \n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I hate Lee Sin too. I hate him so much. But he is not someone that can easily be worked on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir Yamazuki","date":"2015-02-26T13:30:44.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are nerfing him, they nerf him by nerfing the smite upgrade, cost went up, nerfing smite range, and lowering the AD in the machete upgrade. Their way of nerfing Lee and his friends is by nerfing all junglers instead of them as individuals.","replies":[]}]}
