For example, someone can buy the frostfang line because they are pokey, and then enchant it to be a defensive item with HP/cdr or something instead of mana regen/AP.   This could really open up the support slot to be able to really help fill what the team may be lacking elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Zen Fury","date":"2014-12-05T18:08:04.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sightstone should definately be more like the jungling items. The base sightstone should probably remain unchanged, but there should be at least one (and preferably two) additional levels of upgrades, with upgrade paths the provide useful stats and/or auras depending on support type. As it is now, a maxed out sightstone is like an ADC only being able to fill one slot with just a pick-axe.\n\nI'm not saying that the sightsone upgrade should pack the same stats wallop as something like an IE or Deathcap, but having some additional stats or auras would definitely benefit supports and their teams, especially later in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2014-12-05T19:14:19.315+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The sightstone should definately be more like the jungling items.

Riot is probably keeping sightstone super slot inefficient to guard against this.\n\nThat said, something more inspiring than just +health would certainly be welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2014-12-05T19:32:56.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really don't see how that's a problem.
