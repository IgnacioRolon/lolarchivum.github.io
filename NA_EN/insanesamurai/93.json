I'd just like to let you guys know that I'm pretty much positive most people would just rather be able to use the finished content they already downloaded than to wait a week just to see a new couple minute story video first.  \n\nI don't think anyone needs any extra reasons to dislike the story stuff right now :)\n\nEdit: if you're gonna downvote me for not reading surrender@20, thats cool, but you should then upvote the guy who took time to inform me and any others who don't use that site :)  Thanks 12tales!","replies":[{"poster":"12tales","date":"2014-09-14T19:13:18.733+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quote by sixtwo - \n\n>\"Hey guys, not sure where the quote comes from, but Azir isn't out yet because he's not done - bug fixes are being checked in around me as I type this.
