TF can still farm then start up gold card whenever its off cd. Annie cant poke me from 1000 range away. This is common knowledge stuff you didn't seriously need me to list obvious facts did you? BTW TF can cycle cards for 4-5 seconds and lock in gold whenever he wants so its more like a possible 10-11 seconds he can hold this.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Darth Pixy Misa","date":"2015-02-25T22:54:47.494+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annie has a animation that shows you that her stun is up,  if she is walking towards you with her stun online, she is telegraphing the Tibbers stun.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-25T23:41:44.398+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes she does, but she can also recharge that stun much faster than Veigar can.
