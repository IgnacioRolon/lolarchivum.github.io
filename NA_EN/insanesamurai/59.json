All the sudden I was only getting one or two trolls a day instead of one or two games without one.  People were being considerate and willing to try new things and forgive mistakes.  This remained consistent for so long I was completely convinced that Riot had done something amazing and the trolls were finally going away.  Then a couple days ago, all bets were off.  It turned right back into what it used to be, with me getting lucky to even get one troll free game in a day.  \n\nSo what happened?  Was it just that a wave of punishments ran it's course, or Is this just entirely random despite there being such a drastic change that it seemed like a miracle?\n\nEdit: downvotes are hilarious on this, sweet example of the forum crowd.","replies":[{"poster":"Dekker Prime","date":"2015-01-30T08:10:37.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed this too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AJStarhiker","date":"2015-01-30T07:54:46.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe, but if you were in ranked, S5 just started, so you may be up with/against people obsessed with their placements.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-30T08:01:53.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't doing ranked much.
