Does anyone know the actual reason?  My curiosity is getting the best of me :)\n\nEdit:  Whoops!  Just saw they said it was for storyline reasons.  Curiosity slain!  Surprising reason though :D","replies":[{"poster":"Lumus Avatar","date":"2014-09-12T18:50:04.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Random Chance! Also, they're really getting off on the suspense right now.\nHe'll likely release once they finish all of Nasus' audio diaries.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-09-12T19:07:33.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel bad for the new storyline, so many people hate it already, and now it's gonna get extra flak for delaying a champion :D.  Still undecided on it though, I kinda liked the whole summoner/league thing they had going.","replies":[{"poster":"Lumus Avatar","date":"2014-09-12T19:30:59.924+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most people liked the whole summoner/League thing they had going. It explained a lot of the gameplay and showed you there was not only a large world that these Champions hailed from, but several worlds. Some of the stories do beg the question \"just how powerful are the Summoners.\" but in most cases, this wasn't even presented. I reread Nasus' original lore today and it is a bit hard to follow until you realize all of his described actions and feelings take place on his homeworld and he isn't brought to Runeterra until his confrontation with Renekton. The timeline is sketchy as I always thought, from his dialogue in game, that Nasus had lived in Shurima before it was destroyed. Having reread it, it's hard to tell if he was brought to Runeterra before or after that event. But even that pales before my question: What power allowed the Summoners to drag Nasus and Renekton across the stars to Runeterra against their will? What were those summoners trying to accomplish originally? Did they know they were pulling beings from another world? Did they know they would be able to reason with Nasus? What did Nasus seek in Shurima? If it was already destroyed when he arrived, was he simply seeking solitude and the comfort of forgotten knowledge? Isn't Icathia supposed to be accessible via the Shurima Desert? Did not the Void concern him as much as the realization that Renekton had come to Runeterra with him?\n\nI like lore.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-09-13T01:59:33.832+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it too, but i haven't really spent enough time with it to be too familiar.  I think the summoner thing could be explained a little without really going into it too much, and it wouldn't take anything away from what they currently have.  I guess I just like the little extra bits of character it adds, like to Draven and Sona.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
