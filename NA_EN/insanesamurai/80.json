Players that have received these types of bans have shown some of the most egregious behaviors in the game, and we have a zero tolerance policy against things like racism, sexism, homophobia and other kinds of hate speech. &ldquo;\n\nThis is a flat out lie. An automated system banned me for 2 weeks because I used the word fuck in a game where I was being trolled by THREE people. I did not say anything racist, sexist, homophobic, or use any form of hate speech. I have never been punished for any other game, but by what he said I&rsquo;m still excluded, quite hypocritically.  Not to mention with all the talk about player reform, they decided it&#039;s fair to delete all my honors.  Hundreds and hundreds of positive games erased because I lost my cool one time, still tried to play the game and still tried to win, but I said the work fuck to a guy who trolled me from champ select all the way to the end of the game.  The automated system decided this was enough to give me an instant 2 week ban.  No warning.  No chat restriction.  How does this make any sense based on the ask.fm?","replies":[]}
