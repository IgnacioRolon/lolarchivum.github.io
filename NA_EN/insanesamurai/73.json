Only one time in an ARAM have I ever seen a comeback after a team got a lead, they tend to either be dead even until somebody flinches, or they are totally one-sided from the start.

No joke - I asked.\n\nIt's not a mentality thing or a bunch of trolls or people who give up too easy.

At a certain point, it's time to start the next match. If nobody is enjoying themselves (except the team wrecking face) then I fail to see the harm in a 10 minute surrender.

Hell, people rarely vote yes even at 20 mins.\n- It gives teams an out if they have a leaver/AFK. There are TONS of those in ARAM and it's a massive drag losing in slow motion for 20 mins because it's 4 v 5.\n\nIn general people are going to try their hardest to win or to compete. Even 4 v 5.
