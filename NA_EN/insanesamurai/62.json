Sated Devourer doesn't affect the DoT from Tiger Stance at all.  Like Sheen or Jax's Empowered, the DoT will be consumed on the first autoattack and not be available for the second autoattack.\n2. While in Tiger Stance, each autoattack deals 15% of Udyr's AD as on-hit physical damage.

Nobody and I mean nobody who plays Udyr in ranked in any kind of way builds enough damage in tiger stance for this sated to be useful. Everyone follows trick2g's phoenix builds and here it would be useful. Wow you average about 140~ AD and do an extra 15% on auto attacks... whoop dee doo. THE IMPORTANT PART OF TIGER NEVER PROCS AGAIN LIKE I FUCKING SAID, IDIOT.\n\nI'm not going to explain why Tiger is so good because apparently this goes way over your head EndlessSorcerer. However, before you try to be a condescending cunt to someone you think you can talk crazy to, how about you learn a few champions in the game and at least try to comprehend what would be useful or what wouldn't. Which brings me back to my original point, sated devourer on tiger is absolutely useless. If you need more explanation than this Endless, then go do the world a favor and jump off a bridge and I'm sure it will come to you. I hope this made it clearer.","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-07-12T14:09:33.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Let me be as clear as I can since you want to try to talk down to people.

It's annoying to some, like myself, who really don't particularly care for the play style that it encourages but it's definitely easy to counter play and not \"broken.\" \n\nXin Zhao, for example, is my main jungler (currently have a 72% win rate through 40 games on him in Platinum) and a lot of people think that it's broken on him but the reality is that Xin's strength lies in his early ganking power and is wasted on powerfarming. The old devourer was a noob trap on him and the new one, while better, is still kind of eh in an elo where people know how to teamfight  and also know how to counterplay a powerfarming jungler.  I did play it for two games in normals just to YOLO around though. \n\nI guarantee you that once this patch hits the competitive scene you still won't be seeing devourer.\n\nIf you're having difficulties against it, I'd suggest looking online for some resources on learning on how to close games out and capitalize on early advantages, snowballing, and so forth. It can definitely be frustrating to play against but a late game Master Yi was frustrating before to a team that didn't have crowd control, just as a free farmed Nasus was/is frustrating, just as Tryndamere can be, Annie, and countless other champions in the right hands :)\n\nETA: Next time you see the enemy pick a devourer jungler, play Shaco or Eve, rush mobi's after the 450 machete upgrade, spam ganks and enjoy the freelo.
