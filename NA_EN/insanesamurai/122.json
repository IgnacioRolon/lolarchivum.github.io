If you play a bunch of non-op champs and then jump on Nid for a couple games, it's downright sad how easily you can destroy people compared to the vast majority of the roster.  Her dmg is huge, her mana costs are low, most of her cooldowns are low, and she was given a nonsensical bonus to her passive to allow her to take practically no damage while farming the jungle.  It just makes no sense at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ben Sharpio","date":"2015-07-17T16:45:21.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Repent her, she's a no-skill champino and she can do anything she wants. I stomp on her as my zac, but it disgusts me to see what she does to my teammates who try their best to use champinos that aren't so damn overpowered and low-tier. You want to earn your kills? You cant find that satisfaction with using nidalee, because her kit is meant for people who just want to earn easy kills","replies":[]}]}
