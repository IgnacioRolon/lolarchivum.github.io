Unless you police it with an iron fist(as opposed to not caring in the slightest unless someone uses a racial or homophobic slur), it&#039;s _always_ going to be that way.  \n\nIn addition, forcing everyone to dump every bit of feedback here is a nice bit of misdirection to make sure you never have to listen to us.  Say anything about the gameplay to support, they&#039;ll send you here so you can get yelled at by a bunch of angry kids and ignored by Riot.  It&#039;s become increasingly apparent over time that the only opinions that mean anything to you are those of the tiniest fraction of top level players, and the rest of us don&#039;t matter at all.  One day, admittedly maybe way down the line, this game&#039;s magical popularity will wear off, and when everyone apart from that tiny fraction starts quitting, there&#039;s going to be some issues.","replies":[]}
