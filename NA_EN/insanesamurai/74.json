If you play him right, his presence demands attention. Reading other comments, you're exactly right. He's a great split pusher. It's nigh impossible to engage him with only one person and come out on top. This means at least 2 have to go, leaving open the rest of the map for a group of 4 to dominate against at most 3 opponents.\n\nBut there's the other side. If you do decide to group with your team, his damage output is tremendous. If he engages a teamfight first, his natural tankiness helps him survive for at least 5 seconds, giving teammates time to follow up, all the while dealing damage on whoever is in front of him.\n\nBoth of these roles require high amounts of communication.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-09-29T23:26:50.117+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're right, he is extremely powerful when he is coordinating with his team, but my general problem with him is he can still *majorly* impact the game when he just ignores everyone and runs around alone the whole time, which just seems wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2014-09-30T00:36:41.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's actually a good strategy in certain situations.  Say every lane is winning, but your jungler is behind.  If Tryndamere, as a top laner, is ahead he can quite easily start roaming and give up his farm to the jungler.\n\nOr perhaps it's later on in the game and Tryndamere is a large enough threat that it takes multiple people to stop him.  This allows his team to move to objectives that are far away from where Tryndamere is causing pressure while having a fight that will either allow Tryndamere or his team to take an objective, depending on how the enemy team responds.\n\nTeamwork does not always mean grouping.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-09-30T00:50:34.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said split pushing in general or roaming in general is bad, but *never joining your group no matter what happens* is extremely bad.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2014-09-30T00:57:23.733+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Allow me to say my last line again:\n\nTeamwork does not always mean grouping.\n\nSome champions are best used outside of team fights, while some absolutely require a group to be effective.  If a team only picks champions in champion select and does not pick a strategy these differences could cause serious problems.\n\nThat said if you have a split pusher you should not be asking them to group for too many reasons.  Is the enemy team grouping for baron?  That's a good time to ask your split pusher to group.  What about if the enemy team is attempting to rush your nexus?  Depending on how likely they are to succeed that could also be a good time to call your split pusher over.\n\nAsking your split pusher to come mid so you can siege a tower however is a terrible idea, as you will basically be fighting a 4v5 without additional pressure to split the 5 into a more manageable group.\n\nThe few legitimate reasons for a split pusher like Tryndamere to group are large enough reasons that only an idiot would ignore them, and as such it is the players fault.

That said,  it is very satisfying when you kite him,  ignite him,  then walk away and see him die a few seconds later. \n\nfrankly,  I hate tryndamere, but I'm not sure he's unbalanced. He's one of those champions that a good player can use to take a huge advantage against an unsuspecting opponent because he snowballs well and less experienced or less skilled players can't deal with him. my first game against aatrox was equally frustrating,  killed him twice by pulling him in to my turret only to see him magically revive while a teammate stepped in to kill me/take turret shots to save him.

If anything it requires more teamwork so that the enemy team doesn't collapse on you while you split and your team is doing nothing giving the enemy an easy advantage.\n\nSplit pushing requires the same lvl of teamwork as 5v5 fighting. Its just not the same kind of teamwork. Its the not the same strat and honestly most of the time this strat of split pushing works in favor or tryn and how he helps the team. Both strats require communcation and the team being on the same page.

Tryn's split push does not require teamwork as he can escape almost every time the team tries to collapse on him, and if they do catch him, they probably spent so much time doing so that the enemy team just got plenty of free farm or an objective somewhere else. \n\nAlso, you seem pretty experienced with the game, so you know how the average Tryn player acts.  They are so used to being able to free roam alone and do whatever they want with way more success than they should have thanks to his kit, so they completely refuse to group up.  The sad part is it often ends up working, so the players are convinced that it's a good idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Onegarion","date":"2014-09-29T22:22:30.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a big difference in what you describe is the champion and what is the player. While yes his kit does promote split pushing it by no means makes the champion cause the actions of unskilled players. \n\nI've played with tryns that prefer not to split push and group with the team and work well and of course I've met the other side of that argument. In most cases of the latter they are unskilled and usually meet them in lower tiers or rankings. I've also called for split pushes when it is advantageous to the team and had the other 3 members (support main) fail to provide pressure for the split push to work. It doesn't matter if the split pusher was a zed, tryn, vayne, etc. Its on the player and not the champion where these problem lie though. There will be a time where the mindset and actions you describe are not beneficial and will not actually promote anything other than bad play from a player that doesn't understand what they are doing and simply do it to continue to do it because it worked against those unskilled against it.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-09-29T23:24:26.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you, but I think tryn's skillset heavily reinforces the bad decision making players because it can often work out in his favor to do something that would normally be incredibly stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"Onegarion","date":"2014-09-30T00:16:43.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is that not how you learn though?
