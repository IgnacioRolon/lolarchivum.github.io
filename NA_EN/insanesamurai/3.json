(or Ekko, Leblanc,  Kat, etc)\r\n\r\nOnce these champs get a lead, they&#039;re going to get gold faster than anyone on the map.  Even the people on your team who were doing well can&#039;t compare to the snowball, and the strategy of that game almost entirely becomes focused on that one champ.  One guy in a 5 man team becomes so important that everything you do has to be done around them.  That doesn&#039;t sound like a team to me.\r\n\r\nI know you inevitable downvoters like playing the game like it was team deathmatch, so you want this to be a thing.  I have an idea though, since this game isn&#039;t designed to be team deathmatch, and other games are, maybe go play one of them?  This game is designed to be a team game, played with 5 people working together as a unit to take objectives.  When you have some people trying to work as a unit, and some just ignoring everyone and everything and doing whatever they want, one or likely both groups is not going to have a good time.\r\n\r\nIf these champs need to remain how they are, why not at least cap off how fed they can be?  I mean what kind of nonsense is a level 18 max build LB running around in a game where everyone else is 12-14.  What&#039;s the point of that? One guy runs around killing everyone instantly and nobody else matters for the rest of the game.  High level play will never see a champ do this, and that&#039;s what the game is balanced for.  So why not put in mechanics that would stop this nonsense?","replies":[{"poster":"Mat7itan","date":"2015-06-23T00:02:51.023+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":18,"body":"If vayne gets a lead then you failed to stop a late champion who is rather weak early so yeah she is going to destroy you.","replies":[{"poster":"MohawkBird","date":"2015-06-23T00:07:42.637+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Baunjo","date":"2015-06-23T01:16:07.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"her knockback only becomes a stun when you are knocked into terrain.

If things like this couldn't happen, more players would be willing to work as a team to accomplish things as the game is being balanced around.

If you just sit there and ignore her weaknesses, she should, and will, steam roll you.  \n\n1.  She has NO power outside of 550 range.  This is very rare for a carry.  It means she is in range of all sorts of nasty things; some things that other carries completely outrange (or at the very least, have more play room).  \n\n2.  She has *no* waveclear ability whatsoever.  She can build shiv, at the cost of damage (in the form of crit and as), but this doesn't really improve her speed by *that* much.  And she still has the problem of only being able to proc it in 550 range. \n\n3.  Her main defense is countered by 100g or 250g.  If you are playing against a vayne, upgrade red trinket! sure, you might lose a bit of ward potential, but if your job is going to be diving the vayne every game, its worth it!\n\n4.  Outside of a conditional stun, Vayne has very few ways to help allies; she is a very selfish champion who's kit isn't useful for anything except killing enemy champions. Sure, the knockback *might* be useful, but situations arguing both sides of this can easily be thought of.  \n\n5.  She handles multiple people diving her very poorly.  Silverbolts can *only* be applied to one champion at a time.  If she can't commit to a single target due to multiple threats, she basically doesn't have a W; which is, of course, the ability that frustrates people the most.  \n\n6.  The tank meta is where Vayne is strong, and suppose to be strong.  A few seasons ago, where there were nothing but assassins in every lane all the time (jungle, mid, top, etc....the spirit stone days) Vayne was nowhere to be found, and was getting obliterated if she showed up due to her lack of safety.   \n\n\nIn general, one champion getting fed doesn't remove the team aspect of the game.  First of all, it was team effort (for both parties) that resulted in a champion getting fed in the first place.  Similarly, it is team effort that decides what happens next and how you deal with the champion being fed.  If you play into the strengths of a fed champion, you aren't going to succeed.  And that has nothing to do with the game not being a team game. \n\nIf I have a fed top laner, you can be darn sure that I'm going to use that asset to the best of my ability.  If I know he is going to pull multiple people top, I can apply pressure elsewhere on the map.  Having champions fed does not reduce the team aspect of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-06-24T02:40:12.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her main defense is not invisiblity.

You aren't the only ones with a team.\n\nThe real way to beat Vayne is to never get into her range. That requires playing poke mages.
