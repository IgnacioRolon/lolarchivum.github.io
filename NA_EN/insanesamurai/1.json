I haven't felt more worthless in a game in quite some time(compared to before, when jungling with him kinda felt like 'easy mode').  Did the change over to the new stat system and new jungle just punk him, or did he get some nerfs I never paid attention to?  Or is he still plenty strong and I just inexplicably kept dying to a kayle with no damage?  :D","replies":[{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-01-06T01:45:10.877+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never been able to do good with Aatrox, and its nto like he's mechanically challenging or anything either","replies":[{"poster":"NicoNicoREEEEEE","date":"2015-01-07T00:51:13.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"max e rush hydra gg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2015-01-06T23:51:26.208+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungling got a lot harder in 2015 so now it's a tricky place to navigate early on.

Make sure to start Krugs or Gromp to get a combat-relevant buff for your first clear. I'm pretty sure every champion in the game can jungle up until their first jungle upgrade with no issues.\n\nMedium-mobility melee champions' biggest difficulty is gauging engagements. If you're not familiar with the types of fights you can take as Aatrox, you end up Q'ing in and then just dying. On top of that, junglers get a little bit less income than laners, so you'll be on average less farmed than your opponents.

What I see being most successful is one core damage item, either just your jungle enchant, or in addition to the enchant, and then building tanky.

From fighting in the jungle he has practically no risk as he sustains so well, but when you engage with a champ it's a whole different story.  I'd like to give some of this a shot because I really like his design and such, but that last attempt was seriously horrible :D  I also feel like he's outshined by alot of other champs right now(Lee can sustain almost as well and is much more helpful in a gank or skirmish), but that could also be largely due to unfamiliarity.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"stealthfox94","date":"2015-01-06T02:59:56.046+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've heard BORK, Hydra and then any combination of tank items works really well on Aatrox.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-06T05:15:51.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dinkaroo","date":"2015-06-01T18:12:02.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Attack speed goes well with him because of his W. Make sure to land the lift from your Q to land your E or get a free hit for your W. He's good with chasing and closing gaps (Q and E) so make sure you're using that.
