Right now there are a lot of people playing GP who've never played him before and even those that have are having to learn some new stuff given the kit changes. That's making it a bit hard to get a gauge on what his long term power's like, initial reaction though is that it's in roughly the right ballpark.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-07-29T02:24:26.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!

Can't make a real forum post without one of those :P\n\nSo a guy with 2 finished items can take 60-80% of a squishies hp in one unmissable q, and I'm stupid for thinking it might get nerfed?
