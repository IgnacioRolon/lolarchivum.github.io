We change our invite criteria frequently, but sometimes you can be invited if your playstyle matches what we're looking to test. For example, if we were looking to test some changes to Irelia, we'd look to invite a batch of players who main Irelia so we could get some good feedback from players who know her kit well. \n\nYou can find a complete rundown on how the PBE work [in our FAQ.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top) Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"SirSnakeBlack","date":"2016-08-14T18:32:57.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"first of all, thanks for answering my post, I have a question, I did not know I had to send application when it was level 30 and I send application was at level 1, my question was that if he could climb to level 30 that account and would not have any problem to take into account my application I'm still level 21 and I want to raise my own level 30 to see if they can take into account.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-15T15:25:50.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't need to be level 30 to participate in the PBE. The PBE states the following:\n\n> In most cases, we look for highly active level 30 accounts. However, there will be times when we specifically look for lower level players in order to test features for new League of Legends players.\n\nYour level and how fast you have or have not leveled will not have any impact on your PBE invite status. At this point, it comes down to just remaining patient and continuing to play matches while you wait for an invite.\n\nLet me know if this cleared it up for you. :)","replies":[{"poster":"SirSnakeBlack","date":"2016-08-22T15:37:30.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
