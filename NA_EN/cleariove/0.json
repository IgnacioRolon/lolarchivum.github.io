My account is currently at D5 0lp and is very likely to be demoted if I lose one more game. I prefer not to take the risk and just stop endeavoring to get myself demoted lol.  Usually LP declay happens after 28 days of inactivity, and Nov 7th happens to be exactly the 28th day. So I wonder would I be demoted if I just stop playing ranked games from today (Oct.10th). The last ranked game I played was at 1:30 EST Oct. 10th . Any insight into my dilemma? :D","replies":[]}
