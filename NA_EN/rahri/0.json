In a competitive environment, players are expected to actually sit down, take some time out of their day and get their head in the game. It's one of the most stressful and utterly - though only possibly - toxic environments that anyone can enter. It breeds the seething hatred that people harbor for each other... \r\n\r\nUnderstandable that someone might decide they are about to have a panic attack and just leave. AFK. 4v5. GG scrubs. \r\n\r\nWell, personally I've had more 4v5's in ranked lately than I have 5v5's. I'm getting a bit tired of doing really well, trying my hardest and forging toward a win in a 4v5, only to come out with a loss because we get overwhelmed. That extra person makes the biggest difference. \r\n\r\nYes, I realize that I should be able to carry a game to victory if I'm doing well-- the issue is that those three other people might not be. They might feed out a few kills, or they might not be able to get to dragon-- let alone contest it. Same can be said for baron. \r\n\r\nWhat's worse is than four people can't ward as much as five- that's 12 wards as compared to 15. Five pinks compared to four. \r\n\r\nEvery little strategic implement is what counts toward the victory, or the defeat. \r\n\r\nThat said, I would like for there to be a 'loss forgiven' system implemented; that or a DotA-esque \"A player has been disconnected for five minutes. Game is now safe to leave.\"\r\n\r\nThe point is that the AFK gets punished as normal, and everyone else in the game can either choose to continue playing like a good sport, or leave the game and go enjoy a fresh new match with all four team mates present and accounted for. \r\n\r\nThis would prevent unnecessary ELO plummeting and LP loss. \r\n\r\nAnd if none of that is possible, at least implement a 'player activity counter' that utilizes the leaverbusters automatic AFK detection to check if all five players on each team are present; if they are, LP gains/losses should follow the regular formula. If they are not and players are missing, for each player missing the corresponding LP loss for defeat should be lowered by 0.5x per player. \r\n\r\nIt's not a HUGE upset in regards to the way it effects the game; it's not going to make the difference between whether someone advances a League or not because AFK'ing was a less problematic occurrence, but it will lighten the load on a lot of players throughout.\r\n\r\nLastly, yes, I realize that there will be people who go, \"Well, it's not necessary. Go win your next games, scrub. Get positive, scrub.\"\r\n\r\nDon't encourage this volatile, toxic behavior, Riot. I've been banned a few times for it and I know exactly what it's all about.\r\n\r\nSeriously consider this, Reds. \r\n\r\nYou too, community. Try to think of neat, new innovative ways to bring down the AFK penalties for players who actually play.","replies":[{"poster":"mikemil223","date":"2014-12-26T19:21:39.003+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"lots of people have suggested this but riot either doesn't want to copy dota (which is stupid because us paying for others afking is much more serious than wanting to be different than dota) or  they just dont care enough to make something like this happen","replies":[{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2014-12-26T19:31:21.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mikemil223,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qGJJuRZA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2014-12-26T19:21:39.003+0000)\n>\n> lots of people have suggested this but riot either doesn't want to copy dota (which is stupid because us paying for others afking is much more serious than wanting to be different than dota) or  they just dont care enough to make something like this happen\n\nOr they browse the Dota2 forums and see that users of that platform complain about the AFK / Leaver system being ineffective there also.
