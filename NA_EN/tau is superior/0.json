For top it's {{item:3124}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3146}} and then {{item:3748}} or {{item:3153}} late game you can swap boots out for whatever of the last two you didn't get. It gives you a TON of healing, because of all of your AoE from {{item:3124}} / {{item:3748}} combined with {{item:3146}}, and the obv lifesteal from {{item:3153}}. But you need {{item:3111}} until late, unless they have lots of CC then you keep it always, because of the lack of MR built @-@. For jg it'd be similar, but you get {{item:1401}} and choose between {{item:3146}} for more damage or {{item:3748}} for a bit of extra waveclear and HP.\n\nKinda wanna go Devourer Ekko at some point, but not sure how I'd wanna build him @-@. I guess like {{item:3930}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3025}}. I'd wanna be more damage than tank if I went Devourer, and thus attack speed stuff. I should try that soon, when I stop playing MGSV.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2016-01-08T23:27:16.406+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That top lane build sounds really fun.

Currently it's not and it would be awesome if it would. People tend to build Runaan's on Caitlyn to get passive headshot every 3rd hit which is weird considering she's a sniper and not primarly a dueling markman. Encouraging (or rather allowing) her to build even more sniping power would be more natural, don't you think?\n\nSo her aa range is 650 and 1300 against trapped/netted targets. With Rapid Firecannon it should either increase the range to 1450 or 1600 based on whether the bonus range is doubled or not.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2016-01-07T21:20:20.538+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They greater part of {{item:3085}} with her now is when someone is hit by a net or steps on a trap because now she headshots three people at a greater distance.","replies":[{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2016-01-07T21:27:12.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my, didn't know that :D\nBut I'd personally still want to play Cait as much of a sniper as possible with RFC enhancing the range of enhanced headshot :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2016-01-07T19:36:10.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I don't think it's supposed to increase her bonus range, as it has a maximum range increase already which is exceeded by the trap headshot range.","replies":[{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2016-01-07T20:08:12.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically Rapid Firecannon range bonus gets overruled by the enhanced headshot range?

You can play him mid *or* bot, if your team is too AD-heavy.\n\nI go 12-18-0. The 12 includes AS / heal / LS&vamp, the 18 includes pen and thunderlords. Include hybrid pen marks.\n\n{{item:1055}} start, into {{item:1037}} {{item:3006}} {{item:1036}} {{item:1036}}  -- makes your Q hurt like usual, provides enough waveclear, and makes enemies think you're going AD.\nFinish these in whatever order for waveclear / sustain: {{item:3124}} {{item:3146}} or {{item:3115}} for cdr\\*.\n\n\\*Note about Nashors: If you take this item, you're committing to an AP build. Context below:\n\nTbh, most games are decided by the time you get Rageblade, Gunblade, and Zerkers. At this point you have near-marksman-tier dps (you need more AS -- quints might help, I haven't tried them) and near-vlad-tier sustain, combined with near-assassin-tier burst (1v1 any squishy you hit with R).\n\n**You deal almost exactly 50% magic and physical damage up until this point.** However, if you continue to build hybrid, you're going to fall off hard. So now you make a choice, AD or AP?\n\nI've actually never gone the AD path at this point, because (1) I've only ever played this in AD heavy team comps, and (2) I really like the burst damage and dueling power that Void Staff gives you. So, if you want to figure out what AD item path works best, go for it. Here's what I do with AP:\n\n\n{{item:3115}} Usually my 4th item.
