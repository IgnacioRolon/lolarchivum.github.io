I&#039;m toxic. I&#039;ll straight up admit that. Had my account on a 2 week ban for being verbally abusive and I got it back at 5:30 AM on 5/11. Since this was my new main account (after having my first main account permanently banned) I decided &quot;Okay just gonna drag my chat off screen so I can&#039;t see it and wont talk and therefore cant be toxic.&quot;. 4 hours later without getting in any trouble because I didnt talk in chat I que into a game with my friend. In this pre game lobby we encounter a player who instantly asks &quot;can i trade you mid for jg?&quot; I tell him no and hover trundle. Can you all guess what champion the guy decides to ban??? Trundle. We then ask him &quot;wtf why would you ban my champ&quot; he responds with just &quot;lol&quot;. My friend was top lane and had lucian hovered. Troll was above him in pick order. Guess what champ the troll picks???? Lucian. so me and my friend go evelynn and shaco, I take smite, friend takes smite, ahri takes smite hoping this kid will dodge. he doesnt. We get into a game and we are legit trying to win, lucian takes top lane instead of mid, caitlyn goes bot lane solo, ahri goes mid instead of support and me and evelynn jungle and invade like an ordinary game. At this point my chat is still off my screen and out of view. I can still however hear the little &quot;ping&quot; whenever someone types and it is going off like crazy. Decide to see whats going on. Long story short lucian is crying that we have 3 smites and 2 legit junglers and questions why I picked shaco with trundle runes and masteries, and this is where my chat log begins. 4th message in and continuation is all in all chat talking to the enemy team asking who is the troll on our team. Only reason i picked up any reports is because the enemy vlad decided &quot;im just gonna report all of you and let the tribunal (which doesnt even exist anymore) decide. end of the situation is our whole team picks up 4-5 reports from the enemy team, and im assuming lucian reported me and my duo as well as caitlyn. as you can see i tried to keep a positive attitude and win the game and not flame lucian or be toxic to anyone on my team but because i had just been 2 week banned not even 5 hours previous to this encounter I think the system automatically banned me just for picking up those reports. If only chat logs showed everyone&#039;s not just my chat. \r\n\r\nAgamemnonqt: maybe you shouldnt ban our champs in champ select\r\nAgamemnonqt: you said it was\r\nAgamemnonqt: just because rito cant see that chat and can see this dont try and weasle your way out of it\r\nAgamemnonqt: lucian\r\nAgamemnonqt: he banned 1 of our champs in champ select, then took lucian from someone else\r\nAgamemnonqt: and was extremely verbally abusive so we said fuck it\r\nAgamemnonqt: yea i do think he did say the n word a few times\r\nAgamemnonqt: ^\r\nAgamemnonqt: report me ive done nothing wrong\r\nAgamemnonqt: the only jg i have set up he banned because i wouldnt trade him jg for mid\r\nAgamemnonqt: no idea cait. maybe he is just on tilt because he dindt get jg\r\nAgamemnonqt: im streaming though so i can send it to riot and they can see how toxic this guy is and hopefully do something about it\r\nAgamemnonqt: my stream has the pre game chat which tribunal cant normally see so it should work out\r\nAgamemnonqt: because i want to win\r\nAgamemnonqt: not gonna let this lucian spoil my fun. win or lose im gonna enjoy the game\r\nAgamemnonqt: didnt see lucian threaten to shoot up any schools yet\r\nAgamemnonqt: same\r\nAgamemnonqt: cant get reported for explaining the situation to you guys\r\nAgamemnonqt: okay\r\nAgamemnonqt: so i only have trundle set up atm, had him hovered and lucian asked to trade roles\r\nAgamemnonqt: politely said no, so he bans trundle\r\nAgamemnonqt: then he takes lucian top away from jinjo\r\nAgamemnonqt: i had it hovered and told him i didnt want to trade so he rage banned and locked to troll us\r\nAgamemnonqt: probably a duo with cait, just realized she is trash talking us this whole time\r\nAgamemnonqt: because its not your main, if it gets banned you dont care","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-05-13T00:12:31.819+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":2,"body":"You should post all games provided in your in-client reform card for an accurate assessment.\n\nThen the question is really are those games enough to cause a light punishment instead of is it enough for a perma-ban.

The only reason Riot has changed their policy to the *4 step* is because they realized even though these accounts were getting permabanned they knew 9 out of 10 players will be creating new accounts and buying skins/champs etc until the new account was content with the old. \nIf people don't like the way you are talking in chat, why not have them mute you? If someone is  so \"abusive\" to one why not just have that party block communications with them if they are feeling abused, simple as that.\n Riot needs to make the chat bans more suitable. being chat banned for 10 games is irrelevant, Start 25 for first offensive, second offensive 50, third offensive, permaban them from chatting entirely, not the entire game. Riot is too smart though,they don't care about the players at all, they care about the revenue. \n(but what do you mean they don't care about the players, that's why we ban people)\n First of all the \"tribunal\" system is complete dog shit. It is not a tribunal at all, it is clearly bots. And the way it works is very clear to me. I did an experiment to see. I made a new account, with friends and constantly got everyone to report me 9x for strictly verbal abuse, whilst i said nothing offensive in chat, just \"hello, go bot lane, gank mid. etc\" just enough too have chat logs for the bots to pick up. It only took a couple games before my account was chat banned.\n The system is so flawed, as to where if you have a bad game your team can easily gang up on you and  convince the other team you were \"toxic\" or \"int feeding\" and end up getting 9x and getting banned for literally nothing, but hey that's what happens when your \"tribunal system\" is bots.  \nhere is a simple fix to this situation, A) actually look over the logs yourself for people who are constantly getting reported every game, or B) Let the community look at the logs collectively and let them decide whether or not a ban should go through, and send cases where an account would be banned to riot, and let them have the final decision.\nSo don't act like they changed their policy to help players feel more safe in league of legends, or try to help them reform they changed them because they realized it was the right decision and most effective way to make more money.Banning an account is not helping anyone, because said person is going to make a new account and most likely be even more toxic. Look at Tyler 1 for example, it didn't stop him from playing league or being toxic.They're endless amounts of players like Tyler 1.  Just because these players were not high elo they don't  get the same recognition that he did and just fly under the radar. \nSo banning accounts is only going to benefit one person. RIOT.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-05-13T02:03:02.316+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"> The only reason Riot has changed their policy to the 4 step is because they realized even though these accounts were getting permabanned they knew 9 out of 10 players will be creating new accounts and buying skins/champs etc until the new account was content with the old.\n\nActually, they don't want your money if you're ruining the game for other people. They might lose your business by removing you, but they lose more by letting you drive others off.\n\n> First of all the \"tribunal\" system is complete dog shit. It is not a tribunal at all, it is clearly bots.\n\nNobody is pretending that cases are manually reviewed. The [Instant Feedback System](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/reports-how-do-they-work) is public knowledge, and there's been a lot of clarity on how it works, including the [punishment tiers](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Boqd81O0-upcoming-upgrades-to-chat-restrictions).\n\n>  I did an experiment to see.

It only took a couple games before my account was chat banned.\n\n**I'd like to see your reform card for that.** The system does not punished based on report volume, but on finding toxic behavior in a high percent/number of games. This has even been improved by nullifying premade reports to count as 1, so a review can't even be triggered solely by premades (a punishment won't be given regardless if the reports are false).\n\n> A) actually look over the logs yourself for people who are constantly getting reported every game, or B) Let the community look at the logs collectively and let them decide whether or not a ban should go through\n\nThe Tribunal was notoriously slow because of this. You underestimate the size of the League community by an incredible amount. The Instant Feedback System, however, handles cases within 15 minutes of the triggering report, and has a false positive rate of 1:6000. Cases that fall within that infinitesimal margin can request a manual review to get it overturned. The new Tribunal will improve upon this even further.","replies":[{"poster":"Narqt","date":"2016-05-13T02:11:33.991+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":19,"body":"\"Actually, they don't want your money if you're ruining the game for other people.

Also, if what you say is true then you should have known that you were already on thin ice and that the next step was a permaban, so why go through the trouble of being a jerk if you know that you're gonna get a permaban if you get punished again so soon?\n\nYou can keep trying to argue but the facts are the facts, and we PB&M members can only do so much to try to help you. If you wish to discuss your ban further then file a Support Ticket about it. Otherwise you're just gonna keep getting the same responses every time you try to argue about your ban.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-05-13T23:57:44.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=5eLlcXfi,comment-id=00020000000000010000,timestamp=2016-05-13T21:19:29.132+0000)\n>\n> fucking idiot took blue\n> fucking kids dude\n> report cait\n> open mid\n> afk\n\n\n...\n\n>how am i toxic?\n> (Thread title) how was this toxic\n\nhttp://img.pandawhale.com/4y7kOt-heston-laughing-from-planet-of-0gl6.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colgate Gator","date":"2016-05-13T21:39:02.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/RG0BS1U.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rengar Top Lane","date":"2016-05-15T18:43:08.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=5eLlcXfi,comment-id=00020000000000010000,timestamp=2016-05-13T21:19:29.132+0000)\n>\n> lucian flashed forsure when i came\n> charm him out of his ult\n> nvm\n> ult tower\n> nj\n> no smite\n> cait shhh\n> take his\n> DONT TAKE MINEEE\n> i was like wtfffff\n> ahri\n> im the fucking dyr\n> i take my blues\n> if you want one steal his\n> afk\n> open mid\n> report cait\n> fucking idiot took blue\n> how am i toxic?\n> shes just salty because i wont let her have my blues\n> fucking kids dude\n> lmfao im just gonna ignore you before i actually be toxic\n> lol the intent feed\n> idk why she wants to report me\n> tried to carry all game long and now ahri is tilting because i told her she cant have my blues and cait is tilted that i told her not to take \n> literally both are saying im toxic because i said they cant take my blue\n> im the jungler\n> its my blue\n> gg\n\nDon't see why Riot as a company feels the need to PERMANENTLY ban players over vulgar language in-game. You created a MUTE system, so at least use it instead of jumping straight to permanent bans after so and so offenses. Stop banning in general for vulgar language. Use bans for players that are intentionally feeding, hacking the client, ddosing, etc. Actually things that are an unpleasant experience for other players to experience that cannot be stopped. You can stop a toxic player from affecting you by muting them. All you have to do as a company now is make it possible to mute their pings if needed. \n\nYeah, I'm attacking how this company handles it's player punishments because there is a better way to deal with them and still allow them to play the game.\n\nHopefully someone comes along and straightens out this mess that was created.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2016-05-15T22:16:46.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sinister Rengar,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=5eLlcXfi,comment-id=000200000000000100000007,timestamp=2016-05-15T18:43:08.120+0000)\n>\n> Don&#x27;t see why Riot as a company feels the need to PERMANENTLY ban players over vulgar language in-game.

From the [Tribunal FAQ](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2411284): \n\n>**What's the point of having a language filter if I can get banned for 'adult' language?**\nWe aren't out to punish players who use adult language; in fact, very few players are ever banned for saying stuff like \"f***, I missed that skill shot\" or \"damn, f***ing close game!\" However, the language filter is not an excuse to verbally abuse someone in the game. When you verbally abuse or harass someone by calling them \"f***ing ******\" or \"n*gger noob\", that's when you've crossed the line and will be punished by the Tribunal. I've said this before and I'll say it again, we aren't trying to clean online games of adult language; we're trying to reform or get rid of jerks who like to verbally abuse and harass other players.\n\n\n>**Why is verbal abuse punishable if there is a mute button/language filter?**\nPlayers shouldn’t need to rely on features like the mute button or language filter to engage with other players in positive ways. When a player verbally abuses another player and forces him to use the mute button, they have already created a negative experience for that player.\n\nSimply put the mute button does not exist so you can say whatever you want with no consequences. If you can't interact with others without forcing them to use the mute button on you then the problem is you, not them.\n\nAs far as the other issues you brought up people who do those things are punished and banned, but the reason there aren't as many people complaining about getting banned for those things is because verbal toxicity is easier to detect than intentional feeding and the like. This DOESN'T mean that the other stuff isn't tracked, because it is, but verbal abuse is far more common and easily tracked than things like intentional feeding is.\n> Yeah, I&#x27;m attacking how this company handles it&#x27;s player punishments because there is a better way to deal with them and still allow them to play the game.\n\nIf you mean permamute then that won't work for everyone. The more dedicated trolls will just troll and be a jerk via gameplay if they can't use the chat to troll and be a jerk. Besides, allowing someone to continue playing after they have proven time and again that they have no interest in behaving properly is bad for business as they can just drive away potential customers. It's like with any business: if someone is being unruly and refuses to stop then they get removed from the business.\n\n> Hopefully someone comes along and straightens out this mess that was created.\n\nIf you have any ideas of how to reform and/or punish people who continuously act up via chat and/or gameplay while not punishing the innocent ones as well then we'd love to hear it.","replies":[{"poster":"Rengar Top Lane","date":"2016-05-17T19:54:22.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Prandine,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=5eLlcXfi,comment-id=0002000000000001000000070000,timestamp=2016-05-15T22:16:46.875+0000)\n>\n> Here we go with the whole &quot;use the mute button if you don&#x27;t want to listen to me harass you&quot; excuse.

I did not say it was there to allow a person to say whatever they wish to. I believe it is there to prevent having your chat from being flooded with language you feel is inappropriate, useless spamming, or frankly text from an individual that just types too much. They added it to the game, so may as well use it when needed. Report the player after and have the system in place handle the mutes. The punished player can take the issue to Riot if they feel the duration was too long. No automatic responses from the ticket handlers, human-to-human.\n\nIf the player is trolling via gameplay, then upload the evidence. Replay sites and programs are out there, so there is no excuse on not being able to provide some evidence gameplay wise. Modify the rules if needed to clarify what forms of trolling is bannable. \n\nThese players, toxic players in chat, main issue is they are being extremely rude in chat. Take away their ability to chat and they are left getting angry with themselves outside of the chat (pre & post game lobbies, too). Whether it is said out-loud or inside there head. That's there choice, but they will not be able to take out their frustration on teammates via chat anymore.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Phenomenal TKE","date":"2016-05-15T19:14:02.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=5eLlcXfi,comment-id=00020000000000010000,timestamp=2016-05-13T21:19:29.132+0000)\n>\n> lucian flashed forsure when i came\n> charm him out of his ult\n> nvm\n> ult tower\n> nj\n> no smite\n> cait shhh\n> take his\n> DONT TAKE MINEEE\n> i was like wtfffff\n> ahri\n> im the fucking dyr\n> i take my blues\n> if you want one steal his\n> afk\n> open mid\n> report cait\n> fucking idiot took blue\n> how am i toxic?\n> shes just salty because i wont let her have my blues\n> fucking kids dude\n> lmfao im just gonna ignore you before i actually be toxic\n> lol the intent feed\n> idk why she wants to report me\n> tried to carry all game long and now ahri is tilting because i told her she cant have my blues and cait is tilted that i told her not to take \n> literally both are saying im toxic because i said they cant take my blue\n> im the jungler\n> its my blue\n> gg\n\nYea it's not that bad.
