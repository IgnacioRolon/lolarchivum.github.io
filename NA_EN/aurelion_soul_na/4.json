It was banned for another reason. Chat logs would help, unless you were banned for something you said in the lobbies.\n\n> At the end of my game my teammates told the enemy I was \"Extremely Toxic\" and every person in the game filed a report\n\nReports trigger the system to check your logs. It only takes one report. Any additional reports are useless. If the system doesn't find anything bad, then there is no effect on you. False reports are meaningless.\n\n> but no penalty was issued or them. \n\nYou won't necessarily get notified that someone else was punished. If multiple players report someone, only one player is notified.\n\n> I have a troll account where I have done absolutely nothing but int feed for over 50 games now\n\nIt's a lot harder to detect that kind of behavior than it is to detect toxic chat. Riot does need to improve on that, this is true. But thanks for sharing. Hopefully, Riot will get faster at banning you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Butt Ρlug","date":"2018-01-27T22:05:19.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can't be true dude, chat logs are analyzed by a bot to check for certain words...\nEven if everyone reported you, as long as you're not toxic in chat you won't get punished.","replies":[]}]}
