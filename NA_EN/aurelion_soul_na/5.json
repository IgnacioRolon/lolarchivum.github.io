There's always someone who tells me I suck WITH A RANDOM TOON I NEVER PLAY, (and \"sucking\" means getting an A- instead of an S or something) and in the past couple of days they've even gotten threatening, like telling me they're going to hunt me down. I report them but I never see that anything's been done to them. \n\nApparently crap like this is fine with Riot, raking in their billions and who cares if some shit girl player is getting abused? I try not to let it bug me, but it does.

You can play what you want, to an extent. We have so many different Champions, and many of them have different build styles. Maybe the differences are small, like Blue Ezreal and traditional Ezreal, or maybe the differences are huge, like going AD Kennen instead of AP Kennen. Maybe you're going full tank Hecarim because you realized your team has all damage, or maybe you're going full damage Hecarim because everyone actually picked all tanks. Maybe you have a balanced team composition and you can do the traditional bruiser build. We have a decent amount of build diversity, especially since every Champion has roughly different builds, but you're right in that you can't go too crazy. Kayle might be able to do \"anything,\" but going {{item:3102}} {{item:3814}} {{item:1410}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3124}} is ridiculous. Our meta isn't _that_ flexible.\nHowever, it's still flexible enough to accommodate every Champion, and many different build paths on those different Champions. Some build paths are just reorderings of purchases of items, but others can lead to somewhat different or very different builds lategame, as I showed above.\nIf you're talking about playstyle as in \"it's difficult to not do 1:1:2 and 1 in the jungle,\" then that's really just tough. If you can find some other strategy that really works just as well or better, then great, see if you can be the meta changer. It'll be a hard sell, but if you can do it you'll be famous.\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Aurelion Soul NA,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=AlVNyulO,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-04-03T14:58:20.578+0000)\n>\n> Trolls .

A vast majority, I think over 99% of cases of punishment are due to legitimate toxicity, cheating, or leaving. Those cases that were improperly handled, which number extremely few, are normally overturned.\nAs for the players who were just trying to have fun and win, then they shouldn't have been toxic while having fun, or they shouldn't have been cheating to win. While they might be fun for the player, his or her teammates/opponents will not be having fun. The enjoyment of everyone in the game is important for Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"zaire90","date":"2017-04-04T10:18:12.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn dude who's paying you","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2017-04-04T12:48:52.553+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Common fucking sense is paying him","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Support Position","date":"2017-04-09T11:08:58.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"instant report doesn't do anything.
