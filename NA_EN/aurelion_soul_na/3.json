His kit is weird his mechanics are weird. He says little to no play in this game. He isn&#039;t worth more than 450BE and even if he was I would likely not get him. \r\n\r\nSure I get that some people are into him for meme value and I suppose some people main him and don&#039;t wan&#039;t him to change, but lets be realistic. Vastly more players see him as an unfit champion, than one that is playable.  Move swain down on the list of rework and get the Skarner in there.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharp Chedarr","date":"2017-12-18T07:17:08.902+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.

Granted, its mostly just because he's a badass crystal scorpion but there are some elements of his kit that are truly fun and intuitive like his ultimate. \n\nIf he were to get reworked I wouldn't want them to change anything about his lore or character, all of that is fine, and his ultimate is way more fair than Malzahar's for example. I suppose that's the real reason he's not getting changed, he's bad but his kit isn't unhealthy or unfair at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2017-12-18T07:55:08.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Skarner does not have rework priority because his kit is not unhealthy for the state of the game, it's just boring. There isnt anything negative you can say about Skarner's kit that cant also be applied to say, Amumu. His scalings are okay, his kit is straightforward and has counter play and the like. I'm not going to say that his design is good, it does need a rework, but the design is fair which is more than what can be said for Champions like Swain or LeBlanc.","replies":[{"poster":"Aurelion Soul NA","date":"2017-12-18T09:25:33.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you play him often because he is fair?","replies":[{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2017-12-18T09:33:49.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play him at all anymore because he's boring as fuck. Doesn't mean he's in such a state that he needs to be fast-tracked to the top of the rework list.\n\nExplain why Skarner needs a rework more then Swain or even Yi, a champion who is so poorly designed that he's deliberately kept in the dumpster because if he receives even a tiny buff he becomes turbo oppressive cancer.","replies":[{"poster":"Aurelion Soul NA","date":"2017-12-20T00:16:57.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi  and Swain are totally playable viable champions in many Elo's.
