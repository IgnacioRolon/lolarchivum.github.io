This is a big reason why disconnections are all treated equally and why we cannot modify or remove penalties for any reason. Additionally, these penalties don't come up for a single leave, it actually takes a trend of disconnecting before you see this penalty.\n\nI'd recommend addressing your disconnections by working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local network settings are compatible with League. Let me know if they caused any noticeable change for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlphaZero","date":"2016-11-14T19:00:25.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, I'm not trying to start an argument but how are they supposed to fix YOUR internet.. I mean, it's your internet... By to the way, I've had some insane lag spikes aswell. I'm asking, have you downloaded the alpha client? If so, have you used it and then afterwards recieved lag spikes? Have you experienced this situation before the alpha client?\n\nI had some lag spikes after downloading the alpha client so I think thats the problem. (tbh I kinda agree with that 20 minute part, that's seriously bs.. just too much).\n\nYou can check your firewall and internet and see what's the problem. I usually exit all unnecessary application during playing a league of legends match, such as google chrome or spotify et.c. That lowers atleast a little bit of lag. \n\nWilling to hear from you soon!
