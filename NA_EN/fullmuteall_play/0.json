This was first seen in Ranked TFT and was applied to other Ranked Queues going forward.\n\nIt works in TFT since Promo Series aren't a thing in Ranked TFT. In Solo Queue, it feels like you get severely punished if you lose at 0LP since you'll have to play through Promos again.","replies":[{"poster":"FullmuteAll play","date":"2019-08-17T02:01:28.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for heads up though","replies":[]},{"poster":"FullmuteAll play","date":"2019-08-17T02:00:57.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is ridiculous tbh.\nNow I am fucking afraid to even play","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-08-17T01:20:14.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on your MMR, you get safety padding when playing at a rank well below your MMR.","replies":[]}]}
