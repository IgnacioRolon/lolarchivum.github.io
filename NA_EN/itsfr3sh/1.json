Why can&#039;t riot just turn RP into Orange essence like what they did with IP and blue essence. If this is a terrible idea, let me know and tell me why because to me this just makes sense.  I guess they might not combine them because then it would be easy to buy skin shards, but why dont they at least make it possible to buy skins for full price with orange essence without Combining orange essence and RP?","replies":[]}
