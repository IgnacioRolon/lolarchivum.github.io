Does riot have any plans to fix this? I was thinking they could maybe make his w into a dash that applies a shield to allies or something, I just think it isn&rsquo;t healthy for his kit to rely on wards in the first place. Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Darkin Hybrid","date":"2018-02-26T19:33:10.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It wouldn't be the first time that a champ in league was forgotten {{champion:26}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:266}}.\n\nBut I would say don't worry, Lee Sin has too big of a fan base for Riot to leave this champ dead, plus they can't just as you say \"gut him\" like that because Lee Sin is always played in LCS.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-02-26T19:49:49.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lee needs to be forgotten.
