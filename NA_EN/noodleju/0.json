I still remember when I was 14 when I first logged into League and heard Quinn and Valor's login theme music. I still remember how my heart pounded with  genuine excitement and delight. The experience of getting to know a new game was a part of said enthusiasm, but I knew the very thing that instantly drew my into League was its music. Fast-forward 6 years: I am a freshman in college studying for the music composition degree to step closer towards my forever dream of becoming a video game music composer. Getting into League was in a way a mistake because of how much time I spend playing Summoner's Rift rounds, but that will never outweigh the positive influence it had in my life including the people I was blessed to meet and the passion I was able to unravel from my heart. All this may sound cliche and cheesy, but in all seriousness, the music of League of Legends as well as other video game soundtracks are what still drive me forward through my struggles of creation and allow me to break through the walls that I sometimes create on myself. Thank you for all of your hard work. The majestic, filling orchestration of Quinn and Valor's theme; the haunting yet alluring melody of Kindred; the enlightened yet innocent rings from Neeko's theme; and your famous, ensnaring music of K/DA are all what makes me excited and glad to be pursuing the path that I am in right now. Thank you all for your hard work. Thank you for publicly posting your music scores for us to visually and aurally enjoy. I hope I can one day at least come close to being as good as you all are, and I can't wait to hear more from you guys. Cheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Talondor","date":"2019-03-14T17:13:48.005+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for listening to League's music and for this post; we all appreciate it so much! {{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}} \n\nIt's really cool and humbling to hear how League's music helped ignite your passion for creating music so much that you're now studying composition in college. I believe many of our stories were somewhat similar, having various soundtracks from games inspire us to follow this path. I know a personal goal for some of us is to hope that we can one day help spark a passion for writing music in others; just like the games/soundtracks/composers of the past did for us. So, THANK YOU for being a part of League for so long and posting this message. We wish you all the best on your journey!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2019-03-20T13:56:45.209+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"NoodleJu - thanks for sharing your story with us. \n\nWhile we never forget who we do this music thing for (you, the player), it's always a thrill to hear back from you, and read that we are part of what inspires you.

Each piece is spot on and they are the only team at Riot with whom (at least to my knowledge) no one ever had any problems with/ critique over.
