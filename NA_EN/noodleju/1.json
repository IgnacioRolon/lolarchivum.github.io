While there isn't a single set of \"rules\" one can follow to enter the game music world, there are a few things that may help with those first few steps.\n\n1) Education. You're already on top of this one! It could be studying at a university, online, or with a mentor. The most important thing is that you're always improving and continuing to learn.\n\n2) Community. Go to as many game developer conferences, conventions, meet ups, &amp; other events as you possibly can. Join game audio groups and reach out to people in the industry. \n\n3) Persistence. It can be a difficult path at times, but having the tenacity to push through, learn from that experience, and grow as a composer is important.\n\n4) Passion. Love what you do and pour your heart into your music to create something unique for each project. \n\n5) Collaborate. Be a nice person who people want to be around and feel comfortable sharing candid feedback/ideas. Let them be inspired by the passion you bring to the table and have that creative trust be so solid, that you're all excited to explore new/unexpected musical ideas.\n\nEveryone who writes music for games has a different story and their individual paths are unique to them.

It takes a lot of time, work, patience and resilience to break in, and quite a bit of luck as well. It’s important you remain open-minded during the early years of your career. Having too narrow of a focus (writing music for video games for example) may lead you to miss out on opportunities that could sustain you better (sound design work, for example), and you have to remain flexible enough to be able to pivot. Interestingly enough, I was a performance major in college, and was a professional musician for a few years before turning to composition. I did take composition lessons prior to that, but I am mostly self taught in composition (and 100% self taught in production). I seized an opportunity in the composition world that has led to many wonderful things for me, embracing a different path under the greater umbrella of music-making. \n\nDuring your college years, I would encourage you to become as strong a musician as possible, and, if possible, to take on gigs here and there. Remember that what they teach you in school and what you will be expected to produce in a professional environment are, more often than not, very different things. Also, part of what you pay for during college is whatever network you will build during your study years. Build lasting relationships there!\n\nI don't know about your music or what your aspirations are, but here is some general advice (all of which applies to me, and, well, probably most everyone else, too!):\n\n- music for game (or any other media) is a business, not an art. You may think what you do is art, people may think what you do is art, but at the end of the day, you have to sell your music, and, more importantly, sell yourself;\n- be ready, may it be for your next gig, meeting, sending out demos, difficult situations, have your gear stable and ready to operate, etc. Unfortunately, and however far common sense will guide you, you'll never be entirely ready for everything - learn to cultivate how to be a problem solver as well;\n- obviously, having superior music skills is of the essence, and working on your writing is important, but meeting people and making connections is even more important (and that is something I'm still trying to improve upon myself). You should be connecting with as many people as possible (game designers, other composers, players, etc.);\n- professional music composition rewards curiosity. Make sure to always seek out new sounds, techniques, business avenues, etc.;\n- make sure you are VERY good with music production. We live in a world where everyone’s stuff sounds great. You can’t expect to break in if your work doesn’t sound good;\n- it is never too early to start developing and/or listening for your own voice. You will NOT be asked to write in your particular and unique voice early on in your career, but you will NOT be able to develop a long lasting career without having something that specifically identifies you musically (there are a few people who have built careers out of being chameleons, but they're an exception). For instance, while we all write music on League, we all have a unique voice and I can totally tell who writes what. Work towards the goal of having a unique and identifiable voice as a composer. Ideally, you want people to call you for what it is that _you_ do (Cliff Martinez, Thomas Newman, John Williams, hans Zimmer, etc. when you read those names, you can hear their music right away!). \n\nI hope this helps! Good luck in your endeavors.\n\nEd the Conqueror","replies":[{"poster":"NoodleJu","date":"2018-11-02T23:42:55.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh thank you so much for your reply, this is incredibly helpful!

Travel back in time, too - why are Mozart, Miles Davis, Ravel or Jimi Hendrix so recognizable?

Tailor the content to that specific company. I applied to Riot a few years ago as an artist, and got direct feedback from them and learned what they were looking for so I could tailor any future pursuit to their needs (what I showed them was not what they were looking for and didn't really give them a good representation of what I could actually bring to the table as a creative, which was my fault). Knowing what role you could play and how you could use that to help them is good to be aware of also, because then you'll know how to present yourself to show that. Hope that helps! Sometimes badassery and proof you know what you're doing (and work that shows your understanding of their needs) can over ride some gaps in your education/experience history~","replies":[]}]}
