I just started a Youtube series that revolves around me improving at LoL. I think it is a really good way for me and my viewers to get tips on how to improve at League. I will be spotlighting tips i am given from previous games and say how im going to try to focus on that tip in the current game. Let me know what you think  of this idea! I would really appreciate your support on my channel, MrEverReadie, and would love it if you came and checked out my first video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiwobObMtsA feel free to like, comment and subscribe if you think that you might enjoy this series :) \r\n                              Thanks -EverReadie","replies":[{"poster":"Roaranor","date":"2014-02-03T18:32:23.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can promise you that what you're doing will help you improve quite a bit. At the very least, you're going back to see where you made mistakes with recordings of your previous matches, and that by itself will set you on the freelo track. Having other players give feedback just accelerates the process by giving you specific areas to work on.\n\nCan't wait for the series!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noam Braumsky","date":"2014-02-03T18:21:34.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds cool!
