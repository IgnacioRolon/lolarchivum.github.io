When i change my league client to this resolution it gives me a perfect fit. However, my name is off to the left and not above my champions health bar, i also have to click way off to the left to click on anything. i was wondering if anyone has experienced this issue and has a fix or any suggestions for me to try and fix this. At this point in time i have tried all resolutions, none of the others fit. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling league itself which also hasn't fixed anything. This screen resolution also worked in the past and has only stopped working since the most recent windows 10 update.","replies":[{"poster":"Thruebeingcool","date":"2017-01-14T14:51:11.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeh i got the same problem even though my resolution is set on 1280x1024 it is also my native screen resolution so i dont know why my league does not work. the client works fine but when i enter the loading screen it says that the resolution is not the correct one and that i have to put it on 1280x1024 wich already is.. pls help this just occrured a couple days ago and before that laegue worked fine","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-31T18:17:08.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a pretty specific and often considered *custom*, resolution. League was designed to work with the most common resolutions and I can say I've **never** seen that resolution used with League before. I recommend switching your resolution to 1600 x 900 in both your Windows display settings and in League.\n\nLet me know if this helped resolve the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"nortoluss1","date":"2016-08-31T20:01:55.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The resolution is probably so specific as i use a 50\" television as my PC monitor. I've tried doing what you suggested and this is the result i get so unfortunately it didn't work. https://gyazo.com/63b96b45deba30f5a60c2fb0deff6983\nI've been playing league for about a year and i've never had trouble using this 1768x992 resolution before, which is why i'm so puzzled. This resolution however does work with other games. \n\nThanks for the suggestions anyway","replies":[{"poster":"BigDonJohnson","date":"2016-09-01T04:52:41.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add to this I use the exact same resolutions and have played nearly a year with no issues until the past 24 hours. I enjoy my monitor/tv and the size, and I'm not really in the market to purchase another. ):","replies":[{"poster":"nortoluss1","date":"2016-09-01T15:03:10.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it might be due to a new Windows update however I'm unsure. I only think this because my league of legends was working up until I decided to update Windows on my PC and after that it hasn't worked at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-01T15:44:14.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some known issues in the Windows 10 update for some players are the Game DVR feature being enabled that has caused FPS and crashing. It may be a factor here, so I recommend you temporarily [disable the game bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) to see if anything changes.\n\nIf nothing did, this could be a strange interaction with one of your background applications, so [performing a clean boot](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974#wq7) may help.\n\nLet me know if either of those did anything for you.","replies":[{"poster":"nortoluss1","date":"2016-09-01T16:28:07.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the suggestion man, i had given up and was just playing it windowed :D turning off the game bar though has fixed it and now it works with correct resolution!
