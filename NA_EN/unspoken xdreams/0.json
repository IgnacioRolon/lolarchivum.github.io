The point in which Kog&#039;Maw says &quot;Daddy is coming&quot;, is a teaser for when Kog&#039;Maw&#039;s dad becomes available as a champion. This would be great I&#039;d play him, but what about Senna. I say this because Lucian is constantly trying to find a way to get to Thresh&#039;s lantern and find one POSSIBLE any possible way to free Senna. Now there are some problems such as the fact that Lucian takes Senna&#039;s gun and Thresh&#039;s lantern and a bunch of stuff, but in all honesty, we have seen riot do some crazy stuff... Also Creative. I feel as if she could either be a Support or an AD Carry. Either or would fit good. I say support because she is Lucian&#039;s partner so you could make their synergy really well.. Make her almost to the point where her kit is BUILT FOR Lucian.. That&#039;d be a good idea. Also, since she doesn&#039;t have a gun anymore either she could get a new gun.. or she could (as a support) Find a new way to fight. Harnessing energy or souls, since she was engulfed by Thresh the chain warden and keeper of souls I assume she could find another way to fight. If they do make Senna a champion It&#039;d be a great idea, she would see much play, and riot if you can&#039;t make her a champion.. At least make this video a thing. To show the back-story of Lucian. I can tell this young man spent a LOT of time working on this and he would really appreciate it. He didn&#039;t say so but this deserves to be acknowledged.{{champion:236}}  &quot;This isn&#039;t over.

I also agree with CaptainMarvelous on the dialogue except I think Thresh should sound inhuman, but in a way that involves less one-liners.\n\nOn the idea of making Senna a champion:\nI see this idea on the boards a decent amount and no matter how cool the ideas for her appearance are or what her current state is I still think she shouldn't be a champion.  The big reason for me is her lore.  She is already a character whose story is known, which is probably why people like her.  However, the fact that her story is over makes it so adding her to the game wouldn't expand the lore at all, which is something a lot of the new champions have done.  Azir got us the whole new Shurima stuff, Rek'Sai defined Shurima (and a bit of Noxus) more, Bard is a really good tool for showing us different parts of Valoran history (such as the invasion of Ionia).  All I imagine Senna could do would be changing the relationship between Lucian, Thresh, and the Shadow Isles which is a relationship that should probably not be changed.  To everything else she would just be another ghoul to be destroyed.\n\nBasically, Senna's story is over and she couldn't add anything to the lore so I don't think she should be made into a champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Bouffon dAnglais","date":"2015-04-10T14:43:52.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you on Senna as a champion.

The only difference is that the champions aren't aware of it any more - you're not actually plucking them out of their lives.\n\nIt's also implied that \"we're being watched by giants through magic boxes\" is within Valoran's folklore/mythology (the Storyteller says he recognizes those words [summoners] from books; Summoner's Rift is named after and has a carving of the mysterious Summoners; etc). Summoners are basically taking \"it's just a game\" and putting some lore behind it (like Dota's mischievous wizard, who causes \"it's just a game\" bugs - shitty wizard!) - like Planeswalkers in MTG.\n\nP.S. The size difference between a caterpillar and a butterfly isn't always that severe (often the butterfly is actually smaller, not factoring wingspan), and for things like ants it's almost negligible.

Kalista is as well, this can be seen from her death animation, although she is actually a combination of souls whom A: made a pact with her for vengeance and B: Escaped the original catastrophic that resulted in the current shadow isles.\n\nIt is quite likely Thresh plays a huge part in the creation of the monsters of the Shadow Isles, if not THE mastermind of it all.  Some of the souls that make up kalista could very well be the ones who escaped thresh.\n\nI could see a new shadow Isles champion, with her soul being bound to an object. She would most likely have a taunt or joke where she recognizes Lucian, at least, part of her does. Hecarim is hinted as being a good guy once, before his soul was bound (Twisted Treeline Alters). The alters also hint at Mordekaiser being inherently evil. His lore does contain elements of controlling souls, so him and Thresh could actually be the ones responsible for everything. Mordekaiser and Thresh were the harbingers of the destruction of the Shadow Isles, that is how I see it at least. Morde is very interesting to me, as he is also a soul bound to an object. Was he a creation of thresh, whom was given the power to also manipulate souls? Or was did Morde willingly bound himself to his armor? (I find this most likely. You can see a decayed face in his helmet). But if ones soul being bound causes them to forget their formal selves, would Senna even recognize lucian? Not likely. \n\nI could imagine an Arc where Lucian teams up with Vayne, and even Kalista in order to continue the fight against the Shadow Isles.\n\nEdit: (Keep in mind the institute no longer exists currently, so my lore here has nothing of it. I always found Thresh, Hecarim, and Morde being a part of the institute very strange. Removing it did in fact open a lot of things up, such as my story)","replies":[]},{"poster":"L Rayquaza","date":"2015-04-10T13:05:14.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe she is really {{champion:429}}","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-04-10T15:29:04.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Already impossible since its been confirmed that kalista was still alive when the shadow isles became a land of the dead,meaning that kalista is one of the oldest undeads out there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Heckin Support","date":"2015-04-10T23:07:30.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could see her being  a jungler or mid laner maybe. coming from the Shadow Isles a completely new \"being\" transformed into something new.
