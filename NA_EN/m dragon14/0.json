It has been happening since yesterday night. I know riot likes to blame the player's connection, but it is stable, as league is the only game that seems to have this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-01T01:02:20.933+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I definitely don't want it to seem that we sometimes simply point fingers and blame something for lag.  For every situation, we want to do at least a basic level investigation.  If the lag spikes were on the server's end, then every single person in the game would also be having lag spikes since everyone is connected to the same server.  If this isn't the case, then we need to start looking elsewhere for where the root cause is.\n\nThe best way to figure out where these lag spikes are coming from is to run our [Connection Analyzer Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743)!  It will perform a health check on your connection to our game servers and give you some different steps on how it can be improved.\n\nI hope this helps!  Let me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[{"poster":"M Dragon14","date":"2016-06-01T04:11:55.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to your tool, I had about 12% packet loss in one of my games last night, with an average ping of 33 ms (it was stable, I thought the ms counter was broken as it didn't deviate from 33 ms the entire game that I saw). This happened again in my first game of today as well (5/31/16). That game showed about 14% packet loss, and an average ping of 32 ms. Mind you, I was watching a stream on medium quality, but it never stuttered. Typically (like 90% of the time), when I lag in league my ms ping spikes, and the stream I am watching stutters. This did not happen in either game.\n\nEdit: Note that I live in southern Ohio, using TWC with about 35 Mbps up and about 5 Mbps down as my ISP. I run on a \"wired\" connection (the connection is through my power outlets in my house.... Much more stable than Wi-Fi)\n\nEdit 2: Also, thanks for the reply. I'm sorry if my post came off as hostile, was just wanting to state that my connection was indeed stable while I was having these issues in-game.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-01T22:46:52.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Packet Loss can definitely be a tricky thing because there are essentially two different types of it.  You can have general packet loss on your connection (such as your Wifi signal not being the best) which causes your entire internet to lag or you can have packet loss on a specific connection, such as to our game servers. Given you are getting 12-14% Packet Loss on your connection to our servers, this seems to be the root cause for the problems you're experiencing.  Again, this isn't packet loss on the server itself, but on the connection to our servers.  It could be wifi, or a host of other settings causing it.  Make sure to follow the steps presented in the Analyzer Tool which should be able to help steady it a bit to prevent it in the future!","replies":[{"poster":"M Dragon14","date":"2016-06-03T23:43:59.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I thought the issue went away. And then it comes back. More packet loss, same ping of 32-33 ms. None of the troubleshooting guide would really apply to me, and I have tested my packet loss using Pingtest.net and got 0% packet loss, then tested in a custom with still high amounts (~12-13%) of packet loss. This would suggest to me the loss would be from my ISP to your servers or vice versa.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SmokeOne916","date":"2016-06-01T01:37:46.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I understand your response is if it works for 9 out of 10 people the problem is you, I get that ok, I work at a data center that has about 2,000 servers, its easy to say the problem is on your end, its VERY HARD TO FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM, that why people give the response you give, it takes too much time to figure out the problem so you say its on your end, let me be very clear about this:\n\n\"If the lag spikes were on the server's end, then every single person in the game would also be having lag spikes\" \n\nYOU ARE INCORRECT BECAUSE EVERYONE DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME CONNECTION, even if 99% have the same connection that does not mean 100% people have the same connection, you need to accept that fact, period, I work network issues all my life so I am 100% positive about that, I understand its hard to help 1% when 99% is ok but thats your job, TO FIGURE OUT THE ISSUE AND PROVIDE A SOLUTION.\n\nMaybe I am the only guy that understands network issues and can provide a resolution other then \"works for me\"","replies":[{"poster":"M Dragon14","date":"2016-06-01T04:07:23.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In all fairness, they can't do much other than basic troubleshooting without much info.

This has been happening for about a month and I just assumed it was me, but I started looking at my ping when this happens and it has NEVER dropped. It happens about every other game or so.\n\nInstead of huge packet losses throughout the game, I get one HUGE one at the very beginning that is almost guaranteed, and lasts 5-10~ seconds even though my connection and any stream I'm watching doesn't lag, and my logs say my ping has stayed at a steady 25-27~ for the last month or so. I lowered all the graphics settings last month and nothing has changed with this issue. I have complained in damn near every League game I've been in that this has happened and you can check my chat logs for this as well as this is EXTREMELY frustrating to play with.  \n\nAnother thing is the tool says that I have had about 2%~ packet loss on average, because mine are tiny constant ones that happen every 2-5~ minutes in game. I don't care how little this seems, it is still frustrating to play with, and has cost me several team fights, lane trades, and kills as well. I usually don't die from it because once I notice it's happening I play extremely passive (which is also another bad side-effect).\n\nPLEASE. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. FIX THIS.","replies":[]}]}
