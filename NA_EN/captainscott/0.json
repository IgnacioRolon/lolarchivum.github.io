I also have not played the game in over 2 months (I checked my match history from the online account thing) so I am a bit confused as to why I have been banned.\r\nAs far as I can see something went wrong somewhere that shouldn't have and I am a bit unsure as to what to do. I have submitted a ticket but has anyone else had anything like this happen?\r\n\r\nI can't even log into the client to see what the reform card says (even though the support page says you should be able too) it just tells me \"This account has been permanently banned, see the e-mail address attached to the account for more info\" but the email simply said that I had been banned due to actions made by my account. But like I said before its been well over 2 months and I have not done anything to break the summoners code.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any idea's I would appreciate the help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-23T15:27:52.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Due to the nature of sensitive account info, this isn't something we can really discuss on the boards.
