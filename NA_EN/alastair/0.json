I have had, and I know I&#039;m not the only one, who has had a great game ruined by one person. Many people in the community have complained about this issue as well. For example, BrickyOrchid8 brought up a great point. &quot;A 9/1 Riven can very rarely solo carry a game, but a 1/9 Riven can easily lose you the game.&quot; My personal feel on the matter is that though this is a team game, I think players should be judged on how they play as a individual and as a team. There are possibilities like Kill Participation, or Objective Participation, but it would be harder for some roles like ADC and Top to complete these to the same extent as a jungler, mid laner, or support who roam around the map. These are the best two options I could think of in my opinion:\r\n\r\n1- Keep the lose LP for losses and Gain LP for wins, but also reduce LP lost by something like a players KDA. This would encourage not overstaying and also encourage players to now go in 1v5 trying to make a big play. This would also aid the smurf problem in multiple ways. It would get smurfs up the ranks faster, which makes them happy, and also makes players they&#039;re against happy.\r\n\r\n2- Role specific goals. What I mean by this is kind of like missions. You would have to actually complete your duty in a role. For example, one for jungle may be: Secure 3 dragons for your team, or on for support may be: reach 50 vision score. If you complete these tasks, you would gain an extra 10 LP, win or lose. I think this would make players better as they would actually have goals to reach and could make games more enjoyable as you have more to work for that&#039;s not just reach the victory screen.\r\n\r\nOf course there have their flaws, but I think it would help the system a lot, and the game itself too. I have had games where either I do really well or really poorly, and it&#039;s just not fun. If you&#039;re having a bad game, you would still have something too work towards so you don&#039;t lose as much LP. I think this would make the game more enjoyable for players.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t actually know how possible this would be but I would just like to see players get rewarded for playing well and not just as a team. There is probably many ways to do this, but these are just the two best ones I could come up with in a short amount of time.\r\n\r\nFeedback as well as other ideas greatly appreciated ;D","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-04-11T04:07:35.381+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"People should be focused on winning, not completing alternative goals.

For instance if you gave bonus LP to junglers for each neutral objective they get, they may run for an extra dragon rather than end the game on the assumption that they'll still probably win later.\n\nIf you really are good, your team should win more often than the other team (unless you think Riot is specifically setting you individually up to fail).","replies":[{"poster":"Alastair","date":"2018-04-12T21:45:07.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if you think about it more in depth, if that jungler goes to take that dragon, they still lose 20 LP, but would get a small amount back. If they joined the teamfight, they would probably get the dragon anyways and would get the LP for the win, and the LP for objectives. As I did say, these are just brief ideas, not end all be all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alastair","date":"2018-04-12T21:56:28.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point of this is idea, or at least how I thought of it, was to still reward players for playing well. If they secure objectives, or have good vision control, but still lose the game, they wouldn't lose as much. They may lose only 10LP instead of 20LP, and if they won, they might get 25LP instead of 20LP.\n\nAnyways that was kind of my original thoughts when I came up with this. I did try to put some in depth thought into these ideas, but not every single tiny detail as that would take a long time as there will always be the person complaining about it.\n\nEvery system has its flaws. I'm not telling riot to completely trash the system because I don't like it, I'm just trying to cater to the community because many people have been complaining about the game recently. Though this has always been happening, I feel that it has been a lot more in recent times. I personally have been playing League since about September of 2013, so I feel I have some experience with the metas and how they have changed from being easy to 1v9 carry to extremely difficult.\n\nWhat really bothers me is when high elo streamers like imaqtpie or doublelift get a donation asking how to improve so they can get out of low elo, but they reply with something sarcastic or rude, even though someone actually wanted advice and paid for it only to get a response like \"Turn on your monitor\" or \"Ask your mom to loosen your helmet when she puts it on in the morning\" these are specific examples that I have heard from streamers. They act as if anything below challenger is trash. I personally am plat 3 at the time of writing this. Though this may not be high elo, I am in the top 5% of players in NA, which is, in my opinion, significant\n\nAlso I do realize I just said I've been playing this game for 5 years and am only p4, but I didnt actually try to climb until season 6 where I got to gold :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShiniXII","date":"2018-04-11T18:09:43.898+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Votable Jester,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XmKwrAaa,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-04-11T04:07:35.381+0000)\n>\n> People should be focused on winning, not completing alternative goals.

I do believe it is easier to win if you're better, but I'm not just saying that people should get more LP so they can climb, I'm saying this because I feel that since many people feel that most games that are won don't feel super rewarding unless you play super well and show off mechanics, and losses just feel crushing. Especially when you play well but somebody decides to try to 1v3, dies, you lose baron, and then lose the game because of that one person making a dumb play. I feel that players should still be judged on how they play as a team, but I also feel they should be rewarded for individual play. \n\nWhat is the most used excuse for losing games? \"My team...\" though there can be some truth to this excuse, people should be still able to be rewarded for playing well. For example, if you play the game extremely well, but still lose because somebody gets caught in the jungle when  you have 2 inhibitors down and you lose because of that, it doesn't matter if you're 0/20 or 20/0, you still lose 20 LP. If you played well, you should be rewarded for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShiniXII","date":"2018-04-11T20:06:54.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Votable Jester,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XmKwrAaa,comment-id=000200010000,timestamp=2018-04-11T20:00:35.547+0000)\n>\n> Maybe you&#x27;ll lose that game, but if you don&#x27;t do that, your team only has 4 opportunities for that to happen while the enemy has 5.\n> \n> Logically if you are better than the people around you, you should win the majority of your games.

My idea was that the goal would be something like \"Secure the Rift Herald\" and you would get an extra 2 LP. Something that makes sense, but also gets players to play better. For example, a master yi will rarely have the same pressure as a Warwick. S what commonly happens in that matchup, is the warwick gets early ganks (The first one almost always being top lane at 3 minutes), sets the enemy team behind, starts to invade the Yi, he then falls behind, and then because of that, the game was pretty much over at 3 minutes just because the Yi didn't take objectives to make up for deficiency of ganks. If he has some sort of mission to take herald, or take towers, he could see that warwick just ganked bottom, so he has a free herald. This would, in my opinion, make games more enjoyable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrevorAlu","date":"2018-04-11T04:25:15.084+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but what stops a KDA player from just sitting in the back and actually doing nothing while getting carried? Or what about when one team is at the nexus but they camp fountain to get extra kills to bump their LP? Or what about someone who's kills got stolen from them and end up going 0/5/17? In theory it sounds great, and I wish it could be implemented, but there are just way to many issues gameplay, balance, and coding wise for it to happen in the near future.","replies":[{"poster":"Alastair","date":"2018-04-12T21:35:01.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I did say in my original post, these are just ideas I came up with in the span of maybe half an hour. Also, KDA is Kills, Deaths, and Assists. You get your KDA ratio by using Kills + Assists divided by deaths. That's how a support can go 0/2/50 and have a KDA of 25. You are thinking of KDR (Kill death ratio) which is commonly used in games like call of duty where assists aren't very prominent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FutureCreator","date":"2018-04-11T07:13:52.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it might work if it negates LP loss, but doesn't increase LP gain.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2018-04-11T02:43:36.022+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"basing the gain/loss on performance would be great, if it went by an adjusted average for your rank/champ/role (Some ranks have sorta skewed numbers with smurfs and bad placements)\n\nit would effectively get rid of boosting outside of the account share method (Duo boosters)\n\n\nI think they should even partner up with mobalytics to have a more official input system on how to improve\n\n\nThough I had an interesting idea i've never really spoken of\n\nWhat if rank was also determinate of a combination of factors.. namely\n\nyour position: A gold top main might be a silver support main, \n\nYour role: A plat tank main might be a silver bruiser main\n\nand\n\nyour champion: 1tricks might suck at everything else\n\nusing a combination of the three of these would result in better placements, though it would require some sort of review of the match making quo system","replies":[{"poster":"FutureCreator","date":"2018-04-11T07:17:54.617+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a pretty terrible idea.

We still lost because I had 16 of our 27 kills. Our yasuo was 5/11/4 and rumble was 2/9/8. I ended up getting a pentakill and played my heart out, didn't flame or anything. I just focused on trying to carry. The problem was, they had a 13/4/8 kennen and 14/5/9 kha'zixm along with a malphite. It was very annoying to lose this game after all I had put into it.
