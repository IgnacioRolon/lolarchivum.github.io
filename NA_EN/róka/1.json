All the company cares about is making things look pretty and pushing new shit down our throats constantly. Sorry to be the one to burst your bubble riot, that&#039;s now what we want, we want you to take more time to fix the problems with your game and make it more balanced. If you keep ignoring your community then soon you&#039;ll no longer have one. The only reason I personally keep playing this game is in the hopes that one day you&#039;ll get it right, even though everyone knows you won&#039;t. So care to prove me wrong? Or are you going to keep killing your game more and more each year until there is nothing left?","replies":[]}
