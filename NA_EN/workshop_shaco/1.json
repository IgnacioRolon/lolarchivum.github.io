No? Well that&#039;s ok most people forget he even exists, especially Riot apparently. Also, remember how 6 patches ago you suddenly weren&#039;t able to cast summoner spells while he started his E wind up for whatever reason? No? Well it's because he is a buggy mess but Riot completely forgot about him. \n\nAside from general bug fixes he desperately needs some power shifting and QoL buffs, but Riot seems too busy ruining Skarner again. \n\nSome very small proposed changes:\n\n1. Make his W aggro whoever you are auto attacking (Similar to the way Hiemer&#039;s turrets are).\n2. Make his E&#039;s blind apply every 5 auto attacks instead of it being RNG based. \n3. Remove the E passive slow from his auto attacks and make his E's Active slow longer, far more potent, and a decaying slow as opposed to a perma-slow.\n4. Make his ult explode when you die instead of just having do nothing and then explode in the middle of no where after it stood there or walked around aimlessly for a bit. \n5. When his ult snaps back to him after leaving its leash range, make it leave behind the same puff of smoke as his Q. \n6. Just fix all of his stupid little bugs like how if his ult runs into a minion it&#039;ll stop trying to go where it was going and it&#039;ll just stand there. Or how if an enemy pings you before you ult then the ping will stay on you and they will immediately know which is which. It&#039;s seriously infuriating. \n\nI am currently making up his entire \"Champion Update\" and will post it soon. \n\nAll in all if Shaco gets at least the changes posted above I wouldn&#039;t care if goes untouched for another few years, he hasn&#039;t had any meaningful changes since he got nerfed in the beginning of Season 3.\n\nEdit: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Fo05hqVe-workshop-shacos-shaco-workshop-champion-update-proposal I finally finished the rework.

That's the opposite of high, and an entire 10% below where it was about a year ago. \n\nAlso nothing you've said here is valid, there IS a way to play against Shaco. There are A LOT of things you can do about Shaco. Later into the game he is completely useless when someone has {{item:3362}} and knows how to use it. Warding around his ganking routes is easy, it just requires deeper wards. Not to mention the fact that his \"insane mobility\" has a range of 400 units (basically barely as long as Thresh's AA range, and shorter than flash) and it's on an 11 second CD after his 3.5 seconds of stealth.\n\nI understand he is annoying to play against, but there are things you can do against a Shaco that are fairly easy to pull off.

His Q is 50% of the power in his kit, and like I said he needs power shifting to make his Q weaker and the rest of his kit stronger. \n\nThat being said I still don't understand why you **need** to be comparing his Q to Lee Sin's W, or for any other champ's abilities for that matter. It's a blink that's similar to flash, that much is obvious, and it gives him _some_ mobility.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Masalar","date":"2015-08-12T07:46:08.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Depends on how you break his win/loss stats down. Champion.gg is pretty good, but only looks at Plat+ games. Most interesting are his winrates in under 25 minute games and his winrate when played by people who play mainly Shaco. 56% win rate in under 25 minutes and 53-54% win rate on people who play more than 50 ranked games on him. That's pretty high. Not super broken, but getting there. His overall lower win rate probably stems from lower skill tiers (I recognize he's a hard champ to play right) and people who are just trying him out (again, he's not easy).\n\nLater in the game he is less effective, yes. But not because of anything the other team does. But he does become an almost unstoppable split pusher. Which is irritating to go against. And deeper wards, especially in laning, are both harder to place, easier to clear, and STILL not super likely to find him given that he has some of the most unique ganking paths, without losing all the common ones.\n\nLet's look at his kit. \n\nThe Passive is all on Shaco. His opponent's choices are: Be far enough away he can't hit you, or be fighting him face to face. Shaco probably won't pick that second choice unless he knows he can win anyway. So, Passive, no good choices his opponent can make. Stay and fight a bad fight, or run and have him do more damage.\n\nQ. A flash + stealth that makes his next auto do bonus damage. If he's engaging, or running away, his opponents can't do much. Your only hope is that he either STARTS on a ward you have or ends up right next to a pink...but he's still gotten the flash part off, so you don't have much time either to chase or run. It's not that you CAN'T ward for Shaco. But he's harder to ward against than any champ. Eve is the only one who is competition, and I'd argue that if Shaco has competent teammates, he has it easier. So Shaco's Q has little his opponents can do, lots Shaco can do.\n\nW. Jack-in-the-boxes. Really good for initial jungle clear, ok, later. Super irritating. Only way to safely remove them is with the red trinket, which means less pinks, which keeps with the trend of Shaco making his opponents choose between 2 bad choices. But again, there's so little his opponents can do about them. A shaco that uses boxes well can ruin other junglers days, ruin other people ganks or escapes, all without even being around. The fact that they have a large trigger range too is just icing on the cake. Thank god for the drastically shorter duration on them.\n\nE. He can either use it slow his opponents every auto, or slow them from range (can't miss). If he didn't have to use Q to avoid a ward he can end up on top of you. Slowing you. Forcing a flash. Then slowing you. Again, it's not a super strong ability...but there is NOTHING his opponents can do. And when combined with his ability to get TO you, his bonus damage when behind, which is easier to do when you're slowed...no good choices for his opponents.\n\nAnd R. One of the only abilities in the game where I can use it to kill my allies. But seriously, this is the first ability of his where his opponents actually get to use skill...and all it can take is one person messing up to get an ally killed. It's a 35% damage boost in taking towers, or a 75% damage boost in a 1v1. It's only really usesless in a chaotic teamfight as AD shaco.\nOh, and his ult can be used to dodge abilities. Always fun to miss a kill with your Karthus ult. Again, nothing the Karthus can do, all on the Shaco to time it right.\n\nAnd that's the thing. He doesn't HAVE to be over powered to not be fun to play against. Shaco exists to win games by removing his opponents ability to make good choices. It's unique, and can be frighteningly effective, but it's a win at the expense of his opponents having fun. Not the \"I lost so that wasn't fun\", but the \"I won, and that still wasn't fun thanks to Shaco.\" No other champion can make a game less fun to be in than Shaco. That, to me, makes him Toxic.\n\nI don't hold it against the Shaco players though. Just like decks in TCGs that exist to make you discard all your cards...they're effective. They're in the game legally. But they just ruin the whole point of the game for their opponent.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyaldan","date":"2015-08-12T14:29:38.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with this break down, which is actually fairly on point, is that it negates what weaknesses he has early game. They are there, and they are definately early game. If shaco, AD or AP, falls behind, hes always behind unless he falls off the map to farm. Shut him down, early pinks are a must as most shacos will engage on foot early game to save the q for chase, if they are confident, or for running when it goes south. Nothing pisses me off more as a shaco than when they bring a pink to a level 3 gank. Much like yasuo, if you shut him down early it goes bad for him till he can catch up, and if you consistently punish him he will never catch up. Another fun fact that ive only used once, not only does his ult dodge attacks you can semi flash walls with it.

One thing that was intentional was making it so that sated devourer doesn't work with his clone, which is reasonable because that would be completely broken if someone tried to duel either of you. However, Riot made it so that the clone doesn't get _any_ stats from devourer, not even the attack speed. That alone makes it not even worth going devourer Shaco.\n\nShaco is buggy as hell, the devourer bugs that happen with him are just part of it.","replies":[{"poster":"MazeMangler","date":"2015-08-13T13:49:45.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a serious issue then.

It's pretty frustrating watching it try and fail to auto-attack whoever it was last attacking and just standing there RIGHT out of explosion range the entire time.\n\nThere are bugs with his Q (and all stealth I think?) where if you auto-attack and cancel before it lands or the enemy dies before you hit them, it takes you out of stealth anyway, I've had JiTB's die to spells even after they finished priming, they also die in one shot from 7 minutes onward to champions and buff camps, it's be amazing to give them the Zyra-plant/ward treatment with health. Shaco's E needs changes like WSS stated above but also needs to not cancel itself but still throw the shiv if the target enters the fog of war (Shiv is thrown, but stays off cooldown, costs no mana, and deals no damage, but the animation still hits the target).\n\nAnd then his ult is just a pain to use half the time.

Therefore if you use the E's active, you might as well not have the passive slow because it won't be applied. So overall he retains the same amount of power from his E as he has now. I'd rather a 70% Decaying slow on his E active and the removal of his auto attacks slowing than what we have now.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyaldan","date":"2015-08-14T03:55:08.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know slows dont stack anymore, which is great.
