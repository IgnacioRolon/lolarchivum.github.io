I don&#039;t know what runes one would take, what masteries, what skill order, what clear route, or what else to build. \n\nI played her a lot back in Season 3 and a bit in early Season 4. I really liked her but then she got every bone in her body broken by the nerf hammer and fell down to the worst win rate in the game for a bit. Currently her win rate is still relatively low but she seems playable now since she got some changes. \n\nAnyone have any tips/guidelines for playing Elise?\n\nEdit: \n\nI feel like she scales off of magic pen more than straight up AP, sorta like Teemo in a way. But unlike Teemo I feel like she is more of an AP bruiser. \n\nI posted this build below when replying to a comment, tell me what you think!\n\nI was thinking: \n\n{{item:1039}} {{item:2003}} {{item:2003}} -->{{item:3724}} or {{item:3708}}-->{{item:3136}}+{{item:1001}} --{{item:3255}} (I just adore early homeguards)-->{{item:1011}} -->{{item:3151}} -->{{item:3116}}-->Whatever tank items you see fit or a {{item:3001}} (or {{item:3135}} if you prefer it) if you're really fed. \n\nI feel like it's a pretty solid route for a standard game.","replies":[]}
