After a few days this folder mysteriously appears at the very bottom under your normal 'online' friends. This always happens, why has it not been fixed yet? There also is no longer an option where you can move the folder up or down. It gets really annoying having to constantly make a new folder for my friend to appear at the top.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-26T00:58:28.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should be able to click and drag the folder name, and once holding the folder for a second or so each group will collapse so that you can rearrange them. If your friends list keeps resetting itself, it may have something to do with a corrupted config file, in which case you can reset that by following these steps. \n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
