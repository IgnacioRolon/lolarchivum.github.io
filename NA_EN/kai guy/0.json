Because the top 3 champs in each position might be balance vs each other.  (see pro games)  Then once you look at each position/ arch type the champs aren't remotely close to balance.\n\nput a cylinder on the table on its side.  Put one light source from the front and it projects a circle on the wall.  But the light source from the side and it will project a rectangle on the wall.  Half the room yells circle the other half yells rectangle.  But the truth is both are wrong.\n\nSo is the game balanced.... yes by positions but No not by the champs within those position or arch types.\n\nSince riot has yet to define Balance or the power levels of  champs on a quantified scale (relation power on a number scale) it seem to me that this isn't a important issue to you.  Look at the power level of new champs to older ones.  \n\nOften times Balance can relate to having fun or not during the game.  I enjoy watching the academy games 100% over the pro games.  They started with Sion and other things first that made it to the pro scene.  They also play on the current patch rather than older ones that the meta is set already.  They are trying new things and difference champs.  Watch a LCS game and then an academy game (this is to the players not riot) then you will understand that the choking unbalance of positions and champs are the whole issue atm.  Same champs, BS power levels and able to snowball out of control leads to boring game play.  Expression of the play skills through the champs they like leads to exciting, positive and involved game play.\n\nBut first and foremost YOU need to balance position and champs balance.  And is there a difference and how so.  This will also help with moving champs from positions.\n\nrant:  You will get more people watching  all games if Academy games spread them throughout the week.  Heck let them play Mon, Wed, Fri.  They are all at the houses.  But a camera to let use watch them.  Show the games.  Put some of the announcers with them.

I wont punish ya for speaking your piece long as it shows thought and is respectful and will actively encourage others to do the same.\n\nPersonally I think that champions should have a range of viability that differs for skill level. A complex champion should not do well in elos players struggle to make complex plays.  \nI like generalist champions being solid pick when there's low information. if your an early pick, if your teammates don't declare intent. I don't want counters to run the norm of Oh I'm just fucked nothing I can do now, they should make it difficult, put you behind, but not force you out of the game. Lower relevance is ok with me 0 relevance is not.\nI don't mind neich or pocket picks, I don't mind counter picks, I think its fine for a bad strategy to be a winning one, the condition is you need to play that Strat very well. (I consistently made gold/plat elo playing AP nami and BOTRK Bard for my mains. Fun yes, Viable after plat 2... not really, least not at the skill I play them at.)\n\nSo on the whole I think balance for the games health should not be measured globally or in closeness to 50% but rather it should get broken down into different blocks that relate to a champions skill floor and ceiling and the average player in that blocks skill level.  In the end what I want to see is all champion be viable when you look at ever block as a whole, even if not all champions are viable per block. Some may only exists as viable hard counter in low MMR to a semi popular pick, and that is fine to me. Others might only see success in Pro play and its hyper focused teamplay (cough {{champion:13}}  Cough cough)  that's also ok.\n\nI want it to be constantly in flux, I want what's strong to change up, and I never want it to get to a place where your skill is a non factor.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2018-04-06T20:51:25.663+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just as you say that, somebody downvoted me.\n\nrip","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2018-04-06T21:22:39.567+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"fixed it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"THE RlVER KlNG","date":"2018-04-07T13:21:48.325+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Automated Riven,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PyEQ55G5,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2018-04-06T20:23:04.505+0000)\n>\n> I want indeviduals mastery over champions to mean more \n\nThis is hilarious to me because riots seemingly undying goal the last couple of years is to inject artificially high skill ceilings into everything and everyone in order to break every champ past a certain skill level.

This is the only way to actually Solo Carry nowadays.\n\nUnless you have a higher skill cap than your elo, you can't play like this and in the end you are dependant on getting slow leads while hoping your team doesn't screw up.\n\nBased on what he told me, I believe that we need to reduce ways to comeback from the game and/or more ways to get leads.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tik115","date":"2018-04-07T13:30:35.750+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me a balanced game state is one where - Given the right comp of champions on your team - Any champion can do well or at the least more then the current 15% of the roster.\n\nA Balanced game state to me is one where Melees aren't shut down and made useless just because the enemy laner decided to pick a ranged carry.\n\nA Balanced game state to me is one where I can pick an immoble mage and contribute rather then be outdone by mobile champs who use the items meant to make me more mobile to amplify there's.\n\nA Balanced game state for me is one where a ranged champion cannot benefit well from items designed for Melees forcing a risk reward.\n\nA Balanced game state for me is one where Hard counters are down to champion picks and skills, with items being soft counters\n\nA Balanced Game state for me is one where a champion's power is not locked to an item (Looking at you Assassins/Some Ranged champs+Duskblade and Old Vlad + Will of the Ancients when it existed and Zed + Old QSS)\n\nA Balanced Game State to me is one where the focus of victory or defeat isn't so nailed down to the Marksman class, Where I could pick a late game midlaner, or a fighter top laner or a carry jungler and have just - or close to - as much of an opportunity to carry as the Marksman.\n\nThat's some of mine without getting into specifics such as individual champions","replies":[]},{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2018-04-07T10:54:46.671+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the major failures of the adc update is now that almost all of them are relavent throughout the game\n\nReally wish we could bring back the old lane bullies mid game spikers and the true hyper carries","replies":[]},{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2018-04-06T20:50:22.169+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> What do you define as a balance game state and what do you want it to accomplish?\n\nEvery champion, every role, and every strategy has its place in the game. This does not mean they should all be equally strong, this does not mean they can handle any situation equally well, this means that if you identify the situation properly apply the correct champion/strategy/etc. that you should be able to take advantage of that specific situation, just as how your champion/strategy/etc. can falter if faced with a situation its specifically weak in.\n\nTo give an example, Burst Mages vs Tanky champions and Squishy Champions. If you're facing agaisnt a fully loaded Syndra with her R up and you're a full health Tank like Maokai, you should have no fear instantly dying in one rotation. Syndra's job as a Burst Mage allows her to basically destroy any squishy in her reach, with a caveat of being inefficient or even plainly bad at killing Tanks sans radically changing her playstyle. On the other hand, if you're a Lucian and you find it smart enough to walk right up to Syndra to try to trade damage, you deserve to die. You could for example stay out of Syndra's circle of influence and fight from afar, or change your build to suit the situation at the cost of your damage, but if you're a squishy champion walking right up to Syndra, that should be a free win for her. Yes you can argue that strategy and mechanics should play a part in the outcome but the bottom line should be if you play to your champion's strengths and the enemy's weaknesses, you should win. If the enemy plays to their strengths and your weaknesses, they should win. Bullcrap like artificially installing delays on Assassins so that ADCs don't insta die to them is just backwards. Items that counter your champion's weaknesses entirely without trading anything meaningful (like Maw of Malmortious that period when it was waaaaaay too strong) shouldn't exist. Every individual thing in the game must have a specific purpose; areas where they are strong and areas where they are weak.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MirrorU","date":"2018-04-07T04:28:52.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'll sum this up quickly, this game has nothing to do with balance and never will.
