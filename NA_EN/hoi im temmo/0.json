But, with only 3 people, its entirely possible one will get shoved to their secondary position.\r\n\r\nThe issue I am pointing out is, if one of them gets shoved to secondary, say the support, then P2 would now prefer to jung rather than play bot with a support not in our skype/curse/teamspeak/etc call.\r\n\r\nCan we allow two players to queue to &quot;Bot Lane&quot; together, so that if either one doesn&#039;t get that lane, it tries to put both players into the secondary rather than a single player?","replies":[{"poster":"arcDapineapple","date":"2016-07-09T20:45:12.549+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"what they really need to do is make a solo que option so that solo player vs other solo player only this way everyone has a fair advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"Hoi Im Temmo","date":"2016-07-09T20:46:49.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't understand","replies":[{"poster":"arcDapineapple","date":"2016-07-09T20:57:16.089+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"In dynamic queue if you que up by yourself this might happen.\n\n1) You get in a team and everyone else is solo and the enemy team is solo has well= Fair match\n\n2) You get in a team everyone is solo but the enemy team has 4 premade and 1 random. This is unfair because the enemy team probably using a teamspeak program that mean they can communicate better and can coordinate more efficiently to capture objective.","replies":[{"poster":"Hoi Im Temmo","date":"2016-07-09T22:49:11.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, I understand what you mean now - sorry, a bit tired. In my experience it attempts to match multi queues with similarly sized ones, that is, a team of a duo duo solo, will probably face the same or maybe a triple and two solos, or a quad and a solo, or some such. But the longer the wait time, the less that seems to happen.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-07-09T20:50:09.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can't hit vote button, daf0k.\n\nAnd if you want to duo Q bot lane simply do \n\nP1: Adc, Sup\nP2: Sup,ADC\n\nYou'll get adc/support almost certainly this way","replies":[{"poster":"Hoi Im Temmo","date":"2016-07-09T20:51:45.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that works on some cases, but it has given the \"fill more roles\" requirement in some cases","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-09T21:11:18.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just have to have 1 person who doesn't have a guaranteed role.","replies":[{"poster":"Hoi Im Temmo","date":"2016-07-09T22:49:42.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huh - thats good to know.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-07-09T23:05:20.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People may abuse this to get certain roles.
