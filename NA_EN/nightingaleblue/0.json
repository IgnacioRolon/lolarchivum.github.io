All its shows is a book and under it says \"Tutorial\" and under that is says to wait for it to finish downloading before playing the tutorial. At the bottom, it has 2 buttons skip and play and I can't click the play button. \r\nHow long does it usually take to download?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2017-08-24T22:28:14.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm....I can't say I can immediately recall the screen you are talking about.  Do you mind taking a screenshot really quickly and responding back with it?  It should give me a much clearer idea as to what is going on.\n\nLooking forward to your response! ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"NIGHTINGALEBLUE","date":"2017-08-25T02:32:39.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How can I post a picture here?
