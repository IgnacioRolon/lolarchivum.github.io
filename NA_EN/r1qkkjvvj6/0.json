I want to know in what universe is this considered flaming? I&#039;m just trying to improve, meanwhile I&#039;m getting flamed all game by my team and even the enemy team being called a &quot;%%%%%%&quot; and &quot;retard&quot; (surprisingly wasn&#039;t called autistic). I get that there&#039;s a system that looks for specific words that may lead to a ban. I follow the summoner&#039;s code and do not flame even when I&#039;m frustrated at either myself or my team. Why am I getting banned for just not being good at the game. I know I&#039;m not that great but I play to try and improve, how can I do so if I&#039;m being punished for simply typing in chat. \n\nThis was the only chat log they sent me and the only game I had anyone openly say to report me. Someone please bring some attention to this.\nThank you.\n\nUPDATE: No way I'm getting an account retrieval, I'll just have to wait the 14 days. :/ guess i'll be more careful next time.. Thanks to everyone who agreed with my case and supported me, hopefully the toxic teammates I had to deal with suffered a worse consequence.\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/jPkBX\nhttp://imgur.com/a/NQcTw","replies":[{"poster":"RallerenP","date":"2017-04-28T21:17:15.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't post your chatlogs.

As 1 report is enough to flag the system to check for toxicity.
