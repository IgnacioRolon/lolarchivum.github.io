MB3 actually works, but its uncomfortable and that leaves me to bind the other spell on my keyboard. And no, my mouse is not broken because it works on other programs. I know a couple of people have brought this up, but if there's any updates on this that would be great. It's not a huge deal, but it would definitely improve quality of life :D","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-28T20:58:19.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've heard from a few other players that sometimes mouse software like Razr Synapse can interfere with how those keybindings work in League. Check and see if there's any software like that running in the background, and try turning it off to see if those keybinds will work. Also, make sure you're changing the hotkey while in a custom or practice game as that should make sure the changes stick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spare","date":"2017-05-28T19:16:49.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a few solutions I can think of\n\nA: Remap MB4 and MB5 to other keys (forward and back perhaps) and then try it in league.\nB: Try modifying the controls configuration file manually (more advanced).\n\nCheers!","replies":[]}]}
