And I say announced because there's always the chance that he could get a random standalone legendary(like Zed did), but right now we're talking about the skin lines that are coming back this year that he could possibly be involved in.\r\n\r\nHere are the skin possibilities that are out.\r\n\r\n* **Zed's Comic:** While not a skin line, I thought this should be included. Way early on, it was speculated that Jhin and Zed were getting their legendary skins together, and that they were tied in with Zed's upcoming comic. With Galaxy Slayer Zed, though, this theory is now out. He could, however, still get a legendary skin to go along with the comic if it actually is about Zed hunting him.\r\n* **Battle Academia:** Ezreal looks to be the legendary for this skin line, with Yuumi as the principal and Graves as the teacher(?). So, this is out.\r\n\r\nNow, onto the ones we haven't gotten yet.\r\n\r\n* **Arcade/Battle Boss:** I personally think the pixel effects of the Arcade line would be something interesting to see on Jhin. His other skins are either more natural or more mechanical when it comes to effects, and I feel like this would be a nice change for him.\r\n* **Star Guardian:** This could go a few ways. Since its a legendary, they could make him a \"good\" guy. Or, they could make him a villain. I'm only really on board with this skin if he gets a suit, though. I'm also interested in seeing his familiar. However, I also feel like there are champions better suited for this skin than Jhin.\r\n* **\"Male K/DA\":** Apparently Jhin and a few others got killed by the members of K/DA, which was seen as a teaser for a rival music group. Carlos mentioned they wanted to explore the possibility of adding more music groups in the future, but hopefully they focus on other forms of music first instead of just giving us, well, male K/DA.\r\n\r\nI may be forgetting some. I woke up in the middle of all this chaos regarding the BA skins with a horrible headache that I still have. So, if you notice anything is missing, just comment and I'll add it to the list.\r\nPlease keep all discussions civil and respectful to one another. We all have different opinions on the \"best\" legendary skin for Jhin, but lets not fight about it.\r\nAlso, this thread isn't for complaining about X getting a new skin before Y does. Go make your own thread or join in on a preexisting bloodbath if you want to complain about that.","replies":[{"poster":"The Iceborn","date":"2019-04-30T21:42:24.318+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Definitely think that his skin will have something to do with the Zed comic especially in regards to timing and thematic.","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-05-01T03:07:15.712+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its likely, but then again, we don't really know who Zed is actually hunting. Its very likely going to be Jhin, but to my knowledge we haven't gotten any more updates on it, so it could be someone else.\n\nIf Zed is hunting Jhin, though, I don't see why Riot would just give Jhin a legendary tied into the comic. After all, its Zed's comic, not his, and I feel like giving him a legendary tied into it just wouldn't be right.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-04-30T21:25:20.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well we do have the returns of Arcade and Star Guardian, hmm I dunno about Star Guardian but maybe Arcade.\n\nSome kind of male related singer could work as well.  We've got other themes like Pool Party, Harrowing/Tales from the rift and Snowdown that should be around as well.. could always make an interesting Holiday Legendary but I doubt they'd want to do that yet.","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-04-30T21:40:07.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, right. The holiday skin lines.\n\nI think the Harrowing would best fit Jhin's overall theme, but then again, Bad Santa Jhin or something would be amusing. I honestly think Pyke should get a Santa skin, though, cause of his list and all, but this isn't about him so he can piss off for now.\n\nI'm not sure how Pool Party would look, especially if they want to keep Jhin masked. The water effects would be interesting, though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LordRedStone Nr1","date":"2019-04-30T22:19:44.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry, you didn't post about the new Battle Academy Skins, that's a downvote from me.","replies":[{"poster":"CherryBlossomTea","date":"2019-05-06T16:59:38.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they did mention the battle academia skins? >.>","replies":[]}]}]}
