No, they _are_ pests, and I am the exterminator.\"\n\n**Region:** Zaun\n**Resource:** Mana\n**Role:** Marksman\n**Position:** Jungle/ADC\n**Attack Style:** Ranged\n**Attack Type:** Attack Damage\n**Base Health:** 600\n**Health Gained Per Level:** 50\n**Base Mana:** 500\n**Mana Gained Per Level:** 50\n****\n**Passive: Corrosive Chembolts:** 0 seconds\nIzod's chemicals are highly corrosive and eat away at armor. His basic attacks apply a corrosion effect that can stack up to 5 times, reducing armor by 5% with each stack.\n\nThis effect wears off 5 seconds after the enemy leaves combat.\n\n**Q: Pest Poison :** (10/9/8/7/6) seconds | (120/110/100/90/80) mana cost | 2200\nIzod channels for 1 second before firing a powerful shot in a straight line that explodes on impact, dealing (110/120/130/140/150) damage on impact and leaving a cloud of chemicals that lasts for 5 seconds, dealing (10/15/20/25/30) damage per second to all enemy units that stand in it.\n\n**W: Eye of the Viper:** (14/13/12/11/10) seconds | (0) mana cost | 900 degree radius\nIzod equips his gasmask for 5 seconds, becoming camouflaged and immune to poison, blind/nearsighted, and sleep. In addition, he reveals all hidden units within a certain area around him.\n\n**Passive: Unseen Hunter:** Izod's basic attacks and abilities do 5% more damage when hitting targets while he is in the Fog of War or coming out of stealth. The damage is increased to 10% if the enemy has full corrosion stacks.\n\n**E: Baiting the Trap:** (12/11/10/9/8) seconds | (110/100/90/80/70) mana cost | 800\nIzod stores up to 3 chembombs than can be placed on allied minions and neutral monsters. The bombs last for 1 minute after being placed and explode when they expire or when the unit they are placed on dies, dealing (100/110/120/130/140) damage to all enemy units in the blast radius when they detonate.\n\n**R: Mass Extermination:** (120/110/100) seconds | (200/190/180) mana cost | 4000\n**First Cast:** Izod channels for 10 seconds. During that time, he can mark up to 5 enemy units for death.\n\n**Second Cast:** Izod fires off up to 5 empowered shots, dealing (200/250/300) damage to their respective targets and poisoning them for 5 seconds, dealing (10/15/20/25/30) damage per second. If the target is below 10% health when the shot hits, they are executed.\n****\n**Notes:** Chembaron Yamada wanted a Chembaron champion so I came out of champion concept retirement to make Izod here.\n\nIzod was designed to be a far-ranged Marksman like Caitlyn and Jhin. He works under the cover of the Zaun grey, hunting the lower class(mainly pesky kids like Ekko) for sport, so I wanted him to have that \"unseen killer\" feeling to him.\n\nWill probably not make another champion concept again though cause I deleted all my images and such during a mental breakdown, so I lost all my artwork, names, titles, and ideas for over 60 characters. And I don't remember all of them. So yeah, that's a thing. And, while I do really enjoy making champions, sometimes it is extremely difficult for me because I have a hard time maintaining their thematics and making them believable as champions. But, if I'm going to work in the champion development department at Riot someday(that's the plan, at least), iceboxing champions when they don't work out is part of the job and any experience is good experience IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"JanÃºary","date":"2019-09-12T21:43:32.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amazing concept.

And I don't remember all of them.\n\nThat's sad, I think quite some people here always enjoyed your champion concepts. You put alot of effort in them and the art you chose to transport the character fantasy you were aiming for just matches perfectly.\n\nI hope that you will be able to work in character design someday.\n\n_______________________\n\n**Character Design and Lore**\n\nUnfortunately not much information here. We know that he is a chembaron (yay \\o/) and that he is hunting kids for sports.\n\nI can definitely see a chembaron doing stuff like this, considering what young chempunks might tend to do in Zaun. Stealing, vandalism, and so on seem to be fairly common and I could imagine that a gang of kids in Zaun got in his way in the past, hence why he started hunting them and then he started enjoying the hunt so much that he just kept doing it.\n\nThe picture is well chosen, he looks like a grumpy old guy, which matches why he hunts the chempunks. He isn't augmented alot it seems, but considering that every chembaron we have seen until now is **heavily** augmented, I think this is a nice change. Not all of them have to replace their flesh with steel.\n\n________________________\n\n**Kit and Gameplay**\n\nI like the general idea that he is a sniper utilising poisoned traps, this is actually right up my alley. I love chemical thematics and sniper are also one of my favourites. Also like that you have mentioned which lanes he is intended to go: ADC and JNG.\n\nBut let's see through the skills in detail.\n\n**Passive**: Thematically, I like it, but effect and numbers are a bit underwhelming in my opinion. Dedicating the entire passive for 5% armor pen is a bit weak, I guess. Going with the thematic, I could imagine to give the champion an armor debuff on enemy champions hit, which stacks up over time. Basically how Darius' passive is stacking the armor pen from a Black Cleaver, but without the damage ticks.\n\n**Q**: Really like this spell, high range damage skill, but can get bodyblocked it seems. Only thing I would change here is that the ticking poison damage doesn't seem to scale since you just wrote that it deals 25 damage. Thinking about it, I notice that you didn't mention any scalings in the concept at all. Is every spell supposed to scale with AD?\n\n**W**: The only skill that really troubles me.... it seems so extremely situational? The active effect is just useful against specific champions in the game:\n{{champion:84}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:555}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:142}} \nAgainst everyone else, the spell does literally nothing on it's own.... A champion being stronger against specific champions is fine, but I don't think that a spell should literally do nothing if the enemy does not pick specific champions.\n\n**W Passive**: Like the general idea behind it, but you mention that he deals extra damage if he comes out of stealth, but he has no means to stealth himself? Again, seems a bit situational, getting some kind of stealth in his kit would also fit the unseen predator trope you are trying to make here, so maybe camouflage can get added to his W? Would make W useful beyond specific champion interactions and give the passive bonus damage on leaving stealth a true purpose.\n\nAnd another idea: to synergise with the passive, maybe instead of flat 5% damage increase, he could plant delayed damage on the enemy, so the armor shred can apply and then extra damage (similar to a Dark Harvest proc) comes through, empowered by the reduced armor.\n\n**E**: Like it, could give him an interesting playstyle for counterjungling. He could prepare jungle camps with poisoned traps, then wait close by in stealth with W and kill the enemy jungler once they trigger the trap. Nothing to change here.\n\n**R**: Long range execute that can kill all enemies in a teamfight. Love it, together with Q, this definitely gives him the sniper feeling.\n\nI would enjoy playing this champion in the jungle, the general playstyle of placing traps, being able to gank lanes with long ranged snipes from the river and ambushing people out of their vision sounds really fun.\n\n_________________________\n\nI enjoy the character and would like to see something similar added to the game. Some small adjustments could be made to the kit, imo, but the general idea is definitely there and fills a great niche for the game (a jungler with an intended sniping gameplay isn't something we have right now).\n\nThank you for doing this, I really enjoyed the read. And I hope that my feedback didn't come off as too harsh here, I want to encourage you to keep doing champion designs, not discourage you.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-09-10T11:52:16.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I'm not particularly happy about it either, but the decisions I make when I'm severely depressed are the ones I regret the most.\n\nAnd yep. Working in the video game industry has been a dream of mine since I was very little, specifically concept art narrative. League finally gave me the outlet I needed to focus on doing something that I love doing.\n\nHonestly surprised this didn't get downvoted to hell though due to the mere mention of me working at Riot, which I've been personally attacked for in the past. Basically called a greedy asshole that just wants to think up new ideas to take the community's money and never care about anything. Because I'd totally be in a high enough position to make those kinds of decisions.\n****\nI do lore in separate posts now from the actual champion concepts, because some people aren't very interested in the lore of the champion and just want to get to the good parts, that being their kit. So, I'll probably write his bio and color story eventually.\n\nHe definately has relations with other champions(Ekko, Vi, Warwick, Urgot, just to name a few), as well as other unreleased concepts of mine(such as Jiminy, The Hextech Thief, the richest kid in Zaun because he's a little asshole that steals shit and sells it on the black market).\n\nAlso, not to mention that Zaunite youths have the tendency to get their limbs(or sometimes their entire bodies) stuck in the machinery while conducting their shenanigans, which can't be good for anyone, especially business.\n****\nQuick note, I tend to purposefully make certain things too weak or too strong so that I can adjust based on feedback, because I'm never sure what's broken and what's not. That being said...\n\n**Passive:** Purposefully weak, like I said, but I like your suggestion for it.\n\n**Q:** Can be blocked, but only because I wanted it to be viable for farming, and because things that explode tend to just explode on the first thing they hit. I also noted the fact that his main inspirations, Caitlyn and Jhin, both have long range abilities that go through minions, and I wanted him to reward his players for timing and placement instead of just saying \"fuck the minions, you're dying.\"\n\nSometimes I add scaling for the DoTs, sometimes I don't. If you feel like DoTs need it, then I can add it.\n\n**W:** His mask essentially functions like Oracle's in the sense that you can see hidden units around you. They don't necessarily need to be stealthed by an ability, just hidden in general. The jungle is a big place, after all, and he can't ward all of it, so I think it helps to have him have an ability that allows him to scout unwarded territory before he fully dives in.\n\nStealth as in, again, unseen, such as if he is in a bush or something. Though, giving him actual stealth isn't a terrible idea either. And that passive synergy is a good idea too.\n\n**E:** You pretty much guessed exactly why I gave him this ability, so good for you. Its essentially a CS denial ability, since if the enemy attacks those trapped minions/monsters, they risk killing themselves or an ally. I should mention though that you can't stack them all on the same target, and you are encouraged to spread them out.\n\n**R:** This ability can also serve to secure objectives like dragon, Herald, and Baron, and is in all honesty inspired by one particular Jhin game I had where I found myself 1v5ing the enemy over Baron because my team was dead. I stole Baron with my ultimate and ran like a bitch, basically. I essentially wanted Izod to be able to make big plays, be it with his team or by himself.\n****\nNot at all. I enjoy feedback, really.\n\nAnd you're welcome. I specifically remembered Izod when you mentioned Chembarons, as that is what I always intended him to be. His image is one of the few that I can find easily because it was in one of those \"Can you think of a champion kit based on these images?\" posts, so I figured I'd make him, just cause I could.\n\nI'm surprised I managed to make him so quickly, though. Normally my champions take months, but I managed to make him in a few hours. I'd never really done any real kit exploration for him, either, so I'd say the fact that I surprised myself by doing this is a bit of an understatement.\n****\nI might do extra art for him, since the art I used lacks his mask(and I didn't draw the art so I'm not comfortable with editing it). Basically, though, his mask resembles the face of a pit viper and allows him to see in infrared while also protecting his eyes and lungs from Zaun's chemical atmosphere.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-09-10T12:17:53.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooooooh, I completely overlooked his ability to deny vision with his W!\nSo it is a built in Oracle, which lets him ambush and counterjungle enemies even better and makes sure that he didn't get spotted while preparing the enemy camps with poison traps.\n\nYeah, that compliments his intended playstyle quite well.","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-09-10T12:24:50.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep.
