All my friends are also busy and I'd rather not bother them. I have also already brought this up with them before, so there isn't much more to be said other than maybe \"oh I'm sorry to hear that\" or \"you really need to see someone about this\". I just wanted to vent and maybe stir up some discussion on this topic and see if anyone else experiences similar problems.\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, I've been suffering from frequent nightmares that vary in severity and vividness. Some are rather vague and abstract fears that I have, while others are so detailed that you could make an amazing horror game out of them. Some are reoccurring nightmares, such as what I've come to call the \"Horror Game Dream\". Others are one time things. Sometimes I realize I'm having a nightmare and can actually wake myself up, while other times I normally just go through it and the nightmare just stops at a certain part, normally when I die or something. These nightmares have caused me to have severe anxiety and insomnia, since I am actually afraid to sleep. Adding onto it is the recent addition of sleep paralysis to the wonderful roster of \"Fucked Up Shit That Is Wrong With Me\". Both of these make it hard for me to sleep, which is having a very negative effect on my grades and my work.\r\n\r\nLast night I had a nightmare that highlighted a fear of mine, which is looking out my glass door and seeing someone on my front porch. I sleep in a chair in my living room that is angled so that it faces that door, because I like to watch the sunset and I can see it perfectly from inside my living room at this angle. Despite liking to watch the sunset, I've practically been begging my family to cover the fucking door for years because it freaks me out, but they haven't yet. It is an extremely conscious fear that I have, and I purposefully sit in a way so that my laptop covers the door in my field of view, and am paralyzed by fear because I'm afraid that if I move, I'll look out the door and see something standing there. Back to the nightmare, I, for whatever reason, poked my head out from under my blanket and saw the silhouette of a man on my front porch. Just standing there, staring. Then I hid under my blanket again, and that's basically the extent of the nightmare.\r\n\r\nNow onto the Horror Game Dream that I have frequently. Basically, this nightmare is set up exactly like a horror game or horror movie. I am always apparently a scientist at some sort of facility, and there is always some horrible accident happening. The nightmare has several \"enemies\" that I encounter throughout it, all different yet extremely disturbing to me. There are the patrolling enemies, which I guess are soldiers or armed guards or something. To my knowledge, they aren't hostile unless they see me, though I'm not sure since I've never been caught by one. Then, there are the good old shadow people, who just stand there and stare. They do literally nothing besides stare at you. Then, there is a weird enemy that resembles a zombie of some sort. Basically, the nightmare always ends at this part, and I just assume that I always die here. This nightmare is weird in the sense that sometimes it starts at different parts. Sometimes it starts right as everything goes to hell, and I'm running through doors trying to escape a hoard of zombie-like creatures. Sometimes it starts later, and I'm sneaking past guards and shit. I have no idea what the objective in the nightmare is, but I assume I'm trying to escape and ultimately failing to do so.\r\n\r\nThere are other nightmares that I have that I don't really remember. These ones are fresh in my mind, though.\r\n\r\nOnto my sleep paralysis. Its weird and I'm not entirely sure if you could even call it sleep paralysis to be honest. Essentially what happens is this, I am laying in bed and starting to doze off. Then I realize that my body has started to paralyze itself while I'm still awake. I often notice this when I try to roll over and can't because my core is unable to move. I often catch it early enough that I can wake up my body by flailing my arms, legs, and head wildly. I do a similar thing in nightmares sometimes, where I violently shake my head in order to wake myself up. This is actually what lead to my first sleep paralysis experience. I woke myself up from a nightmare and woke up laying on my back, staring up. Since I sleep with my head under my blanket, I couldn't see into the room around me, which is probably a good thing. Essentially what I saw was the shadow of a skeletal hand reaching out over my blanket, as if to snatch me off my chair. Then I fully woke up and it was over. Another time, back in the summer, I was dozing off and the gentle hum of my fan turned into the whirring of a fucking saw blade, which was so jarring that it actually woke me up. Anyway, I often have to pull myself out of sleep paralysis at least 5 times, maybe more, before I actually fall asleep. I don't really know how long it takes me to fall asleep anymore, but I'm going to assume its at least an hour.\r\n\r\nI don't experience nightmares and sleep paralysis every night, but they happen often enough that I'm concerned about it. I'm not sure what is causing them, as they just suddenly started happening one day for seemingly no reason. Maybe its stress, maybe there's something wrong with me. I don't know, and I try not to think about it because I don't want to freak myself out. And to give you an idea of how bad this is, at the time of this post it is currently past 5 am, and I don't plan on going to bed until its light out, which should be in about 2 hours. I am physically unable to move my body so that I can lay down because I'm so afraid, and I want to be up with other human beings because that brings me a small amount of comfort.","replies":[]}
