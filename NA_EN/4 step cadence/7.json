I have several ideas, though I was wondering if anyone had anything better that they&#039;d like to share with me.\r\nI enjoy shows about forensics and serial killers in general, so I would like a name that hints not only towards Jhin, but another famous case/killer as well.\r\nI almost have enough BE to change my name, as I&#039;ve been disenchanting all the champion shards I&#039;ve been getting from leveling up, but I plan on buying Zoe when she is released, so that may set me back a bit. I am open to suggestions for names, though.\r\n\r\n**Cancer/The 4th Zodiac -** Cancer is the 4th Zodiac sign, a nod towards both Jhin&#039;s love for the number and the Zodiac Killer.\r\n**Scorpio/The 8th Zodiac -** Scorpio is the 8th Zodiac sigh, a multiple of 4. An alternative if Cancer is seen as offensive.\r\n**Pisces/The 12th Zodiac -** Pisces is the 12th Zodiac sign, a multiple of 4.\r\n**Dahlia&#039;s Regards -** Referencing the Black Dahlia case.\r\n**Ionian Sniper -** Referencing the DC Sniper.\r\n\r\nI am currently fond of The 4th Zodiac and Dahlia&#039;s Regards.","replies":[]}
