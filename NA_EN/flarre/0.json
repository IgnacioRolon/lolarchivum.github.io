It's been more than a month now that I can't play LoL. My pc forced the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and I can't get into the game without geting a bugsplat.You get into champion select but can't get into the loading screen. I've seen a few posts about it in NA forums with the only solution to be to rollback your pc before the update, which is now not an option since you can only uninstall that update within 10 days. That time has long past and still no solution to this problem and I have sent countless bugsplat reports. Please don't post the bugsplat guide as a solution cause none of what it mentions is the problem. I double checked everything there and the problem persists.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-13T20:19:35.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugsplats are commonly due to outdated driver issues or bad game files, which can certainly happen after a big OS update like that.  I suggest going over each step of our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to make sure everything is configured and working properly.  Even if it doesn't mention the problem doesn't mean it won't have the tools necessary fix this up.  Please go over them to rule out possibilities and resolve this for good.

This update made some changes to the Xbox service and enabled \" DVR (game recording)\" by default. Whether or not players have used this in the past, it would be in their best interest to double check that this is turned off. To turn off the Game DVR feature in the Windows 10, please do the following:\n\nOpen the Xbox app by going to the Search bar on the bottom left of the screen and typing \"Xbox\"\nClick on the Settings (Gear) icon on the left.\nClick on Game DVR at the top.\nClick on the On/Off (switch) under \"Record game clips and screenshots using Game DVR\" to turn it off.
