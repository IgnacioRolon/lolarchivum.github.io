Now, I don&#039;t play many games, but I haven&#039;t seen him much at all this Season.  (Please place emphasis on this - I don&#039;t play much, and I&#039;m not good.  So, I could be totally wrong.)\r\n\r\nIs he in a good spot right now?  I&#039;d like to try him out.  I&#039;ve always wanted to but I was always hesitant because I was avoiding having to choose Shadow vs. Rhaast.  Now that I have some JG experience, I feel like I have a better feel for choosing between the two.\r\n\r\nFinal question - what&#039;s the point of his ULT?  I know it does damage.  I know you can do a full combo, ULT, and then it gives your abilities time to come off CD, and I know it prevents the enemy from getting away.....  but it just seems like it&#039;s a double edged sword.  It can be a death sentence.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Christopher RPh","date":"2018-09-11T17:24:37.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.....................\n\nBased on these responses, I don't know what to think.\n\nRegardless, thank you for your detailed responses.

I remember last season he had such low health when he cleared jungle that I quit out of a practice custom game because I got so low.  I was like, \"Yeah I'll just try something else.\"\n\nThen I played Nidalee for a while recently and figured if I could clear with her, I could clear with anybody.  lol","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2018-09-11T18:12:20.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it is, but champions tend to receive buffs when, or shortly after Legendary skins come out. \n\nIt's a bit of shameless effort for Riot to boost skin sales, but I don't mind. \n\nI don't KNOW that he will get another one, but it wouldn't surprise me at all.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cuoco Diavolo","date":"2018-09-11T17:38:40.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check out the Streamer Karasmai he's a challenger jg main who is also arguably the best kayn player in the game","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Quiet Dude","date":"2018-09-11T18:08:57.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's my go-to when enemy team has Garen or some other cancerous juggernaut.

His jungle clear is very very good, and his unique ganking is at least decent compared to other junglers. He's also adaptable, so if they're tanky you can go rhaast and if all of them are squishy you can go shadow assassin and pop them(but even then rhaast is still good). I think he's a very good jungler, my impression is that he has some of the best jungle clear in the game, but there are certainly people who've played him more and who have played more jungler alternatives than me. But I highly recommend him, not a bad jungler to start with if you understand basic principles of the game that applies to everyone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2018-09-11T17:16:09.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with pretty much all that Vynidus said. \n\nOne thing I would point out is that BASE Kayn, is very strong at levels 2 and 3, but he quickly falls off compared to other junglers, .. You might even say compared to other champions in general. \n\nHe MUST be aggressive early on, and his ganks and/or invades, MUST be successful in order to stay ahead prior to his transformation. \n\nOnce he has achieved his transformation, he tends to level out with respect to other champions in terms of power, so you obviously need to achieve this transformation as soon as possible. \n\nThis puts a lot of pressure on YOUR experience as a jungler. You need to have a good amount of macro knowledge. You need to be able to make good decisions on when and where to gank as well as when and where to invade. \n\nI don't mean for this to discourage you from playing him, but lacking this experience can cause Kayn to feel inconsistent, compared to other junglers who are overpowered or more simple to play in the current state of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dope Solo","date":"2018-09-11T17:13:25.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just started with him, and it's not intuitive how to actually make it work. Seems like you go in, use your two skills, maybe an auto. After doing mediocre damage, you're basically dead waiting for your cool downs to come up. You die in walls, you die while ulting. So you're stuck trying to pick up a KS, or going after targets that are already wounded at 30-40% health. Again,I just started and I've seen some good Kayns, but not lately.

It also does have a *lot* of bonus attached to it in either evolved form: SA gets his passive reset, while Rhaast gets a *lot* of healing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vyntrius","date":"2018-09-11T16:12:01.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Kayn is a very balanced champion, or arguably a slightly above average jungler. He is completely capable of hard carrying if you know what you're doing. By all means try him out, and don't let the choosing forms thing intimidate you. When you get experience with Kayn, it's a painless process. These are the questions I ask myself when deciding which form to go with:\n\nWhich form will be easier to obtain based on the enemy team? If the enemy team has 3 melee or ranged champs, this point isn't too big of a deal. But if they have 4 or more, then you will either have to go out of your way to fight someone or delay a major power spike.\n\nHow much crowd control does the enemy team have? While both forms of Kayn are vulnerable to crowd control, assassin Kayn is especially so. He will just get insta popped before he has a chance to ult. Roots and grounded effects are particularly annoying for Kayn, since they disable his entire kit except for his W. \n\nHow tanky is the enemy team? This is an obvious point. If the enemy team has more than 1 person that builds defensive items, I would consider that a tanky team and a point in Rhaast's favor. \n\nWhat does my own team need? In most cases, a team will value the cc and survivability Rhaast brings. But sometimes, your team already has the frontline department covered and needs an assassin to take care of the backline. \n\nHow fed did I get in the early game? Overall, Rhaast is the safer pick if you fell behind since he's still useful with his cc. But assassin Kayn is better at snowballing an early lead thanks to his great map mobility and burst. \n\nAfter asking myself these 5 questions, I'll only pick shadow assassin if it is favored for at least 4 of the questions. You should honestly consider Rhaast as the default transformation, while shadow assassin is the niche pick. As for Kayn's ult, it's only a death sentence if you used it incorrectly or were going to die anyways. But you are correct, its main use is the un targetability that allows Kayn to wait for cooldowns. Keep it mind that the ult is also a useful tower diving tool. Being Rhaast kinda makes this ult unconditionally amazing from its damage and healing alone. Well, I guess the one condition is that you use it on a tank. The long range in assassin form makes it a reliable chasing tool, but the short range on Rhaast may require you to use it preemptively if you're trying to chase with it. Also remember that the assassin ult resets his passive, which is critically important for extended skirmishes since Kayn's damage is pretty underwhelming without it.","replies":[]}]}
