What has the bug fixing team been doing all this time??","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-12-09T21:49:25.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> > This is a known issue that will be fixed soon!

I don't know what the deal is with the graphical bugs you're describing, since that's not directly related to skins, and the content I'm familiar with. \n\nWe don't have one team dedicated to bug fixing. Each discipline is responsible for bugs pertaining to their content. For example, skins team only fixes skins-related bugs.  When we're not fixing bugs, we're working on new content, which takes up a good portion of the time!","replies":[{"poster":"WinterMage42","date":"2014-12-10T21:43:11.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> > > This is a known issue that will be fixed soon!

I mean, with all the revenue you get from RP cards and the World Championships, would you really be losing money adding another team for that?? The graphical bugs just kind of appear on random things IE: Projectiles not showing up, the summoner spell animations appearing where minion shots or tower shots should be. And they go away and reapear randomly.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Abominate","date":"2014-12-08T20:50:16.335+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sona new master of time\n\nRIP Zilean","replies":[]}]}
