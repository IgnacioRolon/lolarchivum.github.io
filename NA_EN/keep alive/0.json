Probbably no one will care but. Born 2009 - Died 2018.\r\nIt was a fun road until season 4 .. then league started to be like this.An overused stinky socket on some old ass muddy Jordans.\r\nI trully believe there is no more FUN and there are no more reasons to play this game since this community is like this and to be honest .. my biggest concern is that ranks are never HARD RESETED but SOFT because I would like to see how a challenger player will face a game with 4 bronze teammates vs full of Diamonds &amp; Plats ... since there are better games and less frustrating out than wasting 50 minutes of your life for 13+Lp and also 60 minutes for -25 lp so you could be frustrated and kill your parents because of it..
