Every game I play I have sudden and rather frequent spikes of lag when I play. I don't have this issue with other games and find myself at a loss. I make sure I'm not downloading anything, no one else is using the internet and still find myself lagging pretty heavily. I don't think it's an issue on my end as I have said I usually don't lag when playing other games, MOBA or otherwise. I was wondering if there were any others that found a way to fix this issue if they have experienced similar difficulties. Any advice is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"OptimumSlinky","date":"2017-04-30T21:39:12.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"League is basically unplayable for me at this point.  33ms ping that skyrockets to 750ms+ every time there's a team fight.  I've uninstalled, forced repair, switched from HDD to SSD.  On a Verizon FiOS connection; no other game has issues like this (no lag in Titanfall 2, Rocket League, Gears 4).  Never had issues until patch 7.6.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-20T23:37:22.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes your network can be in tip top shape but still have issues reaching very specific servers due to bad ISP routing or just some weird network settings. It really sounds like this might be the case, since you're only having these issues when trying to play League.

It is extremely frustrating. I almost think it is just my charter internet though. For a while when my brother would watch hulu while i tried to play league it would lag. and i found that understandable ya know, but just today he was watching hulu and i experienced no lag. then he gets off to go take a nap and im the only one using the internet and i start disconnecting from my game. Like how is that logical at all?","replies":[]}]}
