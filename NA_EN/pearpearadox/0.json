If you spam ping their items, they&#039;ll never know it&#039;s you. Even if they mute everyone&#039;s pings and chat on the team, it doesn&#039;t matter, it&#039;ll still go through. This technique cannot be muted, and they will never know it&#039;s you so they can&#039;t report you. IT&#039;s a win win situation to piss them off easy.\r\n\r\nThis is a shitpost. Please let us see who is pinging our items and let us mute it.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-11-26T04:50:30.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doubly good when your ADC has a firecannon and no sources of AD at all, at 15 minutes.","replies":[]}]}
