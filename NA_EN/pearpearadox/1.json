When you play a game and get countered, you automatically lose lane. This is because even if you don&#039;t die, the other person will overpush you and make you CS under turret, which makes them significantly stronger than you are. The enemy laner could also get so ahead in CS that they will be 2 levels ahead of your whole entire team, and be able to towerdive you which then grants them kills. If the enemy laner also decides to freeze lane, then you will have not much CS and levels, since you have to stay under turret because they are zoning you. **This completely blows the argument, that their minions will be higher leveled so you get more experience from them**. They will zone you so you get no CS at all.\n\n**[READ MY CONCLUSION IF YOU DON&#039;T WANT TO READ THE PARAGRAPH]\n**\n\n_**MY CONCLUSION**_\nMy conclusion for this paragraph is that if you&#039;re losing lane, Riot has made no way that you can come back from losing lane at all. This game is made so that if you lose lane you lose it hard no matter what.\n\nSo then that brings me to your main and only argument, **Jungler ganks**.\n\nYes, it is true that ganks from your jungler can change your lane. I know very well that you will say that ganks from your jungler will help you win lane, and probably **already went to post that reply right now.**\n\n**[READ MY CONCLUSION IF YOU DON&#039;T WANT TO READ THE PARAGRAPH]\n**\n\n_**2nd Argument**_\nThe problem with this is that the state of your game doesn&#039;t become reliant on you anymore. What if your Jungler vowed to never gank you because he&#039;s mad at you, or your jungler just doesn&#039;t gank at all? Then you have no power. Riot&#039;s made the system this twisted, that if your Jungler does not gank your losing lane, you have no power to fix it, and no power to come back at all.\n\n**This is why you never see even lanes, only losing/winning lanes that stomp their opponents**\n\n**[READ MY CONCLUSION IF YOU DON&#039;T WANT TO READ THE PARAGRAPH]\n**\n\n_**MY 2ND CONCLUSION**_\nMy 2nd conclusion is that your lane is not reliant on you anymore once you start losing lane. If your jungler decides to not gank you, or doesn&#039;t gank, then you&#039;re screwed since Riot never implemented a system that you can come back from lane by yourself. You&#039;re powerless.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-11-12T14:11:44.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What? \n\nWhen you play a lane where you are countered yeah you have a much harder time.  Doesn't mean you lose lane.  That's the point of maining champions so you can learn to adapt to any situation and beat your counters.  \n\nAs long as you dont die you should be able to keep up in exp pretty easily as the range to get minion exp is massive and out of range of engage for most champs. \n\nSo the jungler doesn't gank your lane.  Deal with it.  If they are half decent then they are helping other lanes or getting objectives.  Its a basic tradeoff. \n\nI don't understand what your argument is here.  People shouldn't be punished for playing badly and losing lane?","replies":[{"poster":"PearPearadox","date":"2016-11-12T21:29:26.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, the enemy laner will counter you and force you under tower.\n\nSecond of all, if the enemy doesn't zone you, then he will force you to CS under tower which will make a huge CS disadvantage for you even if you are the same level.\n\nAnd third,\n\nIf the JG doesn't gank a losing lane, then why would he gank any other lanes except for yours?\n\nFourth of all\n\nMy Argument is that once you lose lane, there's no way to comeback from it while you're still in your laning phase and your JG doesn't gank. This scenario is seen too commonly, which I why I stated that lanes either are a stomp or get stomped, and there's no in between.\n\nMy Argument is that Riot has made laning phase so that if you lose lane and your jungler doesn't gank, you can't win lane at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Quil Evrything","date":"2016-11-13T03:01:48.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes, thats true.\nand that will never change.\nYou need a sane jungler to win.\n\nIf you really dont like that, and you dont want to lane any more.. then great. learn how to be a jungler yourself.

And yes every champ has powerspikes before level 11.  We aren't talking big powerspikes here.  We are talking lvl 1 and 2 jax beats darius in a 1v1 easy.  then again usually at 6 if he can play it right. then again at trinity.  These kinds of small powerspikes are knowing when and how to use them is how you beat counters and losing lanes.\n\nMy answer that you replied to with this:\n\n> What did this even have to do with my last statement again?\n\nIt has to do with your main point here:\n\n> Riot never implemented a system that you can come back from lane by yourself. You're powerless.  \n\nThey HAVE implemented systems where you can come back but ultimately if you do everything perfect then you will never give your opponent a chance to come back from lane.  That is how it should be as its based on skill.\n\n> Yeah but what if your opponent is not stupid?\n\nAre you kidding me with this?  Everyone makes mistakes. Unless you are playing in challenger most players make at least 3-4 game throwing mistakes a game and tons of mistakes in laning phase.  All you have to be able to do is have the knowledge to recognize when and where they are making the mistakes. \n\nThis goes back to practice and maining a small pool of champs giving you lots of experience fighting a variety of champions thus refining when and where you should engage with your champion to win back the lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-11-12T22:33:22.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Roam = They get turret\n\nBig whoop, they got tower.  Even if it was tower fb unless you have some way to defend it (if you are mid then yeah you want it up but if you are mid then your jungler can defend while you back) then you are just wasting your time.  Once it is down you can push up to their tower and proceed to roam as you will have enough time to get back before it hits the second tower.\n\nAssuming you roam at the proper time and you know how to roam to make it successful you will come back to lane either back in the game or have helped your team get ahead.\n\n> If the JG doesn't gank a losing lane, then why would he gank any other lanes except for yours?\n\nMaybe he knows you just whining and he can't help anymore due to the enemy being fed off you.  In that case every jungler SHOULD HELP THE OTHER LANES.  Camping winning lanes will totally destroy people and can easily lead to a couple of towers or a dragon if not more kills.\n\n> First of all, the enemy laner will counter you and force you under tower. ...I got news for you buddy, the enemy laner has powerspikes too. Bet you never knew that.\n\nThese two points are just iritating as they are such blanket statements.  Every matchup is different and neither of these are valid arguments.
