Anything worse WOULD get you punished more (and can get you punished faster, as you can skip steps in punishment), but the \"lowest\" level is already deemed unacceptable, so all the punishments after that have the same effect since Riot can't issue a stricter one.\n\nIt's sort of like how your job can fire you for poor performance, or they can fire you for poor performance, stealing office supplies, and harassing other employees. You're just as fired in both situations, even though one is technically worse, because the poor performance ALONE was sufficient to earn the punishment.\n\nOr, to use your example, let's say I spell both that way on a spelling test. CAT is worth 1 point. Whether I spell it KAT or PXY, I'm still losing a point for spelling it wrong, even though one of them is, yes, further from correct than the other. The problem is that the system was checking if I spelled it right, and they people running the test aren't interested in \"acceptable amounts of wrongness.\"\n\nThat said, the system does allow the occasional slip-up, and truly toxic players ARE punished more severely sooner than players who are not AS toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"KlydeFrog","date":"2017-09-25T05:00:55.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"umm your wrong 100% of the community is toxic, let me explain further.

I was a toxic player, i admit that, but i stopped after a 14 day ban, stopped even mostly talking at all in game. But then a single game, where i had a support that inted 3 times in bot lane then went afk, where the jungler literally decided it was better to finish the enemy raptors instead of help me and counter gank, when i was running right to him, then say \"I was there dude\", and later int for the rest of the game, and trap us in the game after our top laner went afk as well. Like literally run into 5 people every time he spawned, and refuse to surrender. Where the other team responded to me asking them to just push mid and end because of our 2 afk players, and our inting jungler, by hunting me down anywhere i went for the rest of the game, and refusing to end. This ridiculous game, i got reported by the other team for just wanting the game to end, and i got an instant permanent ban, From One SIngle game, when i had literally stopped talking to people because it wasnt worth losing my account. Riot only cared about their automatic system and takes it as gospel, when more likely than not, now in todays community you are going to get reported more likely for playing bad than actual toxicity. I have submitted a ticket and sent response after response, my ticket has been pushed to a second person now and all i get is a cut and paste response from someone who refusus to actually watch the game and see what was going on. Riot really doesnt care about what their system is doing, how bad it is, the way it enables toxic players who know how to bend the system. They are in it for the money and nothing else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tace36","date":"2017-09-24T21:26:50.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Everyone knows the report system and ban system sucks ass its just a money too.
