It only happens with League that I'm noticing. Here's what happening:\r\n\r\nI will click to move, and I'll see the arrows at the click zone. However, I do not move. I check my fps and my ping, and neither are out of the norm. It'll continue anywhere from .25 seconds to 2 seconds, then I'll start moving to the most recent destination. This issue wasn't a problem until shortly after I downloaded the client a few weeks ago. It happens very sporadically, sometimes as often as 3 times in a single minute, then never again all game. Doesn't happen every game, but usually happens at least once.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound familiar at all?\r\n\r\nI'm using a Logitech G602, which is wireless. The adapter is inches away from the mouse, pointing straight at it. Brand new batteries, replaced the moment I started getting the issue. Haven't had problems until the past two weeks or so.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-11T04:58:56.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like what you're experiencing is more along the lines of a network connection issue such as *Packet Loss* than it does a mouse problem. These issues happen if there's something between your PC and our servers that causes an *instability* between the two. Our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) will run you through the most common network configurations that end up causing issues for League.\n\nIf you happen to still have issues in-game after you've worked through the guide, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"TigStripe","date":"2017-01-11T23:16:14.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried to use the Netalyzer suggested under Packet Loss, but Java says it has an outdated certificate and won't start it.\n\nI did the IP renew and DNS flush.
