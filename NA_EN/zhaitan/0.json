I know there is a way to disable the camera snap on respawn, but that is something different. I am confident there is a way, because I used to have it disabled, but then I reset to the default settings, and I the map now pans to the spawn whenever I finish a recall. Is there some file I could change that would disable this feature?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-27T22:06:01.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this, but it looks like that feature doesn't appear to be currently available.  You may see suggestions on how to modify it, but it doesn't currently work.  I recommend posting any feedback on that over at the [gameplay](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards for consideration.  Sorry!","replies":[]}]}
