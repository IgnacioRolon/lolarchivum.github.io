Aatrox is kinda deceiving, you thought that you caught him with his pant down but it is exactly the opposite. He can then go on a Pentakill because his kit scale on how many people he land his skill shot on. If you can't kill him before he negate your dmg with his insane healing, then your team is toasted.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Larriet","date":"2019-07-13T21:17:23.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A champ can be defined by more than literally one mechanic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jack Eron","date":"2019-07-13T18:47:53.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always thought that his revive gave him identity....","replies":[]},{"poster":"RadeticDraws","date":"2019-07-13T06:54:15.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The theme of darkins is lifesteal\nbut since Aatrox had the revive since he was made many people just think it's what his kit revolves around","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2019-07-13T17:27:00.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it IS what his kit revolves around...his blood well was ONLY there for it, unless you think it had something to do with the attack speed it granted (at most 50 - 60 %)\n\nhis healing is powerful, but it was never what made him a threat.

An Aatrox in a teamfight right now is basically a damage check: you either focus him down fast enough that he can't get an assist and therefore the reset and revive, or you can't kill him fast enough and now if your team does manage to kill him, they have to wait around while his 5 second Zhonya's plays not being able to do anything.\n\nNow his ult is being buffed in the tangible strengths it has in cooldown and sustain while his team utility is being cut in the form of the amount of time he can potentially waste the other team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2019-07-13T11:51:53.607+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Attack speed** was more his identity that his lifesteal, that just made him harder to kill.

Not it's all loaded into silly abilities and healing more than anyone else in the game. Old Aatrox never did that unless he spent time stacking passive, getting his bonus attack speed and optimising his heal part of his W, his ult never gave healing bonus. It gave attack speed. Now what do we have? \n\nI played an ARAM yesterday where I saw an Aatrox in ult do one passive auto and heal 50% of his HP, 1 auto, 50% HP... and I'd ignited him just before. Vlad has to hit like 4 people do to that with his ult.\n\nLifesteal wasn't his thing, attack speed was, not this healing is increased by 70% crap we have.

You are talking about that 10% at rank 1 (which matters even less when you consider that his healing is tied to damage when his damage isnt that high at early levels unless he goes full ad) and that 5% at rank 2 (which doesnt matter that much because 5% is 5 fucking %, instead of healing 150 it will be 155  M U C H  H E A L). \n\nAnd do you guys forget he is melee or something? The revive is quite important for a melee caster. Once he blows his q he cant q for the next 3 seconds. No q no damage. No damage no heal. No heal no survivability.  This changes will just make the enemy focus him almost always (unless he is super behind) and aatrox cant endure such focused fire when his enemies have GW and he hits armoured targets (the higher armour, the less damage he deals the less he heals).  He needs real compensations if riot wants him to be playable. And these changes better be quite interesting because otherwise there is no reason to pick him over the rest of the juggernaut roaster. \n\nDarius brings awesome clean up potential, high damage and sustain (not tied to his damage). \nIllaoi brings awesome raid boss feel, extremely high yet avoidable damage and high sustain (not tied to her damage).\nUdyr brings extremely high single target sustained damage, good sustain, strong dueling potential and high non dash mobility.\nMordekaiser brings good raid boss feel, high aoe damage and one of the biggest shields in the game. \nMundo boosts the biggest sustain in the game (not tied to his damage), can go whenever he pleases (thanks to his tenacity in w) and deals surprisingly high single target damage. \nGaren a mediocre out of combat sustain that scales rather well into the late game, brings good aoe and single target damage while being able to reduce a lot of damage if timed correctly. Also the villain mechanic although it is extremely unreliable, it should be mentioned that slaying the villain with your ulti is awesome and thematically fitting. \nNasus extremely high single target damage, good sustain, strong dueling potential and a very potent slow and cripple ability. Also stacks so he can deal that high damage even with 1 damage item.  \nShyvana, shit idk jack shit about her actually.\nTrundle good single target damage, strong dueling potential, good sustain (some tied to his damage),  can steal stats to empower himself and can even cancel dashes if he times his e correctly. \nUrgot the only ranged juggernaut, very high damage,  can cancel dashes with his e if timed correctly and an execute below 25% hp that upon completion will fear everyone around him. \nVolibear surprisingly good dueling potential, good non dash mobility, can cancel dashes with his e if timed correctly and has an okeish sustain (not tied to his damage). \nAnd finally yorick, good dueling potential, high damage (depends on how many ghouls are helping him) and okeish sustain (not tied to his damage).\n\nAnd then there is aatrox, extremely high yet avoidable damage, good mobility (late game), good clean up potential and very high sustain (tied to his damage).  Like why pick him over darius or illaoi? Both of them fill more or less the criteria of damage and sustain, excluding mobility ofc. But we dont play juggernauts for their mobility now do we?
