I still tagged him with my E, but I backed off after seeing the enemy jungler approaching. Instead of walking normally. Something weird happened.\r\n\r\nWhile having the speed buff from my E, instead of running in the direction I was pointing to, I would go to the location, but stayed the same direction as when I E&#039;d in the first place.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s just a visual bug, but it looks really weird.","replies":[{"poster":"jmp231","date":"2017-07-03T01:34:15.989+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of champions have been able to moonwalk recently.
