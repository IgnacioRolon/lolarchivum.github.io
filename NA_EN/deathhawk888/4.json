Here's a link to his wiki page, as well an excerpt from it.\n\nhttps://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Soldier\n\n\"Though he wanted desperately to fight in World War 2, the Soldier was rejected from every branch of the U.S. military. Undaunted, he bought his own ticket to Europe. After arriving and finally locating Poland, the Soldier taught himself how to load and fire a variety of weapons before embarking on a Nazi killing spree for which he was awarded several medals that he designed and made himself. His rampage ended immediately upon hearing about the end of the war in 1949.\"\n\nNow in Team Fortress 2, killing the same person 3 times in a row leads to a Domination with an associated trash-talk quote. This is what the Soldier would say if he dominated LoL characters.\n\n{{champion:266}} \"I DON'T DRINK MY ENEMIES' BLOOD.
