The easiest being camille though. I would advise against aurelion sol due to his requirement of high mastery on the champ to do pretty much anything in games. But in the end you will need to give each one of these champs a solid amount of practice, time and research to use them properly! Good luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-26T21:18:14.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aurelion Sol is really fun, but Camille is a really fun one too! If you don't mind getting all up in the enemies face then she's a great choice! Plus she has those saber legs that. You could always wait for the free rotation to roll around and give each one a try. It's likely they will all go through the rotation for you to play :)","replies":[]}]}
