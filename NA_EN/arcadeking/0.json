My most recent problem is after I finish playing league, I will close it and if I try to re open it without restarting my whole mac, it won't re open. I click the icon and it bounces for a split second and nothing happens. I'm using the new client if anyone has any solutions please lmk. After I restart the launcher opens regularly its only after i close it and try re open is when it doesnt open","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-29T00:43:16.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this only happen when you're using the Beta Client, or does this happen if you play from the *Legacy Client* after launching from the login screen?\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/215576628/Launch-Legacy-Client.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"OokamiNoke","date":"2016-12-28T06:16:00.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just reinstall the client, and try the old one before witching back to the new one","replies":[]}]}
