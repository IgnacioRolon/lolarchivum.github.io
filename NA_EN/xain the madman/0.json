This file was faster than updating from the old client which took two days for a 1.2GB file. But, mostly I'm just curious if there was a proper download I could do for all of the files, rather than using the patcher as I barely have 80KB of download speed. Which equates to 3.4 days to download, if no one uses their laptops, as well if the client doesn't decide to go black screen during the middle of an installation. Possibly a torrent of the game even from a few month ago would be better, as it still wouldn't be near the 16GB download from a patcher that resets every time you have no internet, or black screens in the middle of downloading.

Wake the PC from sleep come the morning, and the DL stands at exactly the same state as I left it in, minus the ~3 hours it'd take before the sleep-mode kicks in. \nThen the DL would have to re-assign all its connections, and then try to continue, sometimes start over due to corrupt files thanks to the abrupt network cut because of the sleep mode or some such nonsense.\n\nShouldn't happen, but it had.

I always have those off, as for the comment, my ping is normally 20 in game, so staying connected during a match isn't an issue. But when it comes to downloading massive files that aren't torrents. That's when it irks me, there's a reason torrents beat traditional DL's, even through clients. It's impossible to lose your progress unless you reformat your PC.\n\nThing is, I'm paying $41.00 for my AT&T garbage DSL, and with the hidden cost of other ISP's with limited usage a month to add even more charges, not all of us can afford $100.00+ a month ISP, and my desktop isn't anywhere near my 2wire modem.\n\nThe problem, is the file size, nothing else, IF LoL had actually given people options for torrent downloads, such as 6 years ago when people were asking for it, reinstalling the game itself wouldn't be an issue at all. Because one last time, staying connected isn't the issue, it's the speed at which its downloading locked at 50-80KB's a second in the client. My own speed is 680KBPS, it's the client here. The client is fine, for shorter files, for a full reinstall of a game that keeps getting files added with nothing removed? A torrent would be better by far.","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2017-08-03T23:11:29.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I never said anything about having power save options on. \n\nI know, but they are on by default.

(power save options) You're trying your best, and I can't fault you for that. To do so, would be hypocritical, and dickish. If Rito itself did bother to make this a torrent DL, it would be pretty simple to do, even with the excuses some people give, a five year old could make a torrent download that's far faster than the client patcher.\n\nAs one is only peer-to-peer, this the other one is a full powered torrent that allows for seeders. More seeders = faster download speed = far less reinstall/fresh reinstall issues. All of this, can be provided on the website itself. It's literally a simple matter of converting your folder to a torrent file, a copy preferably, and provide this in the downloads section of the main website. This would open up in any torrent program you have, and run/download the file. Yes, it would still be 16GB, but it would be downloaded through a proper torrent program.\n\nI'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, but even 30 seconds of searching found this information out. Even the fabled \"background files\" which would still be saved to your god damn PC, wouldn't be an issue, and even if they were? Run a file check, and get the rest of the tiny amount of files you would need. But the thing is, the magical invisible files people say are only on Rito's end aren't a thing, you need all the files installed on your own PC in order to even play League, again, look at any other MMORPG and you'll see they provide torrent downloads.\n\nAs a note for the development staff themselves: https://torrentfreak.com/how-to-create-a-torrent/ This literally took me 30 seconds to find, and takes less than 5 minutes to do, I tested it myself.","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2017-08-03T23:46:04.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regarding .torrents, I actually called out the Red on that myself just now in this very thread.\nI haven't tried making and sharing a .torrent myself, because my UL speed sucks (~110 KBps max).
