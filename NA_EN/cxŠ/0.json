I'm here to whine about how Leaverbuster is unfair. Just kidding, though I believe it should be changed. I recently got out of my Low Priority Queue and went into a match. I was doing well at around 3-5 minutes until my League crashed. It took me about 6-7 minutes to even GET IN the game. Turns out my wifi is trashed on and I couldn't do anything since Comcast has terrible wifi. I was leaverbusted, AGAIN, even though I just got out of one. I thought Leaverbuster activated if you leave/dodge 5 games, not after when you just got out of one.","replies":[{"poster":"Lew","date":"2017-09-05T00:15:21.721+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are always getting afks or leaves then you'll keep getting low priority queues especially if you just came off one already and it doesn't happen after 5 leaves/dodges.
