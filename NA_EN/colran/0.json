Every once in a while, the game will not connect after champ select. Client works without problems. I close out the game re-log back in and it still says I cant connect. I did what the help center told me, I uninstalled third party programs it didn't work. I even reinstalled league and that didn't help.  The most recent time it put me in the low priority que because it keeps happening. Anyone know what else i could do to fix the problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-06T16:22:31.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might be having a network problem specifically with connecting to the game server, so reinstalling league may not necessarily fix this.  Instead, go over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to strengthen your connection and settings to resolve that.
