During this match i got angry and got reported by several people for negative attitude. Riot sent me a message on my next login telling me i had a penalty and i lost my honor and the access to rewards, however soon later i got out of the penalty box and started getting rewards again but wasn't getting my honor level back. I have a question and want to know if there is a solution to being able to get my honor level back after being banned in a way... just because i have tried and i am stuck at honor level 1.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-14T22:08:27.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congrats on having that lock removed first off! That does mean you're on the way, but I did notice that some of the language/behavior in recent games could be viewed as almost borderline toxic/punishable. Instead of actually swinging the 'banhammer' if you will, the system threw you a bone perse and just slowed your honor gain. \n\nYou're more than welcome to reach out in a ticket for more context about what's being said and why it could be holding you back.","replies":[]}]}
