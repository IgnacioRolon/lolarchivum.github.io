As soon as champion select ended it would not launch the actual game, though it would say I was in a game and did not give me a reconnect option in the client. I have tried repairing the client which didn't work. I completely wiped league off my computer and reinstalled it, which seemed to work for only 2 games and then it went back to the same problem. The game and client show up running in task manager but only the client shows up on my screen locked on the \"Game already in progress\" screen. I have no idea what the problem is, would anyone have any idea as to how to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-16T04:08:51.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It sounds like you may be having issues reaching our gameservers.

The game remaked because I could not load in as the client didn't even load me in. When I closed it and try to re-open it, it didn't even open properly. I then restarted my computer and a message popped up telling me to \"alt + enter\" which never appeared to me until now. Anyways, I load up the game but the remake already happened.\n\nI lost LP and the ability to earn loot.","replies":[{"poster":"Véîgãř","date":"2017-10-23T20:56:58.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i am having the same issue right now... i am currently i an low priority queue of 10 min for 10 gamen... have you been able to fix your problem? i would like to know how to fix this. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
