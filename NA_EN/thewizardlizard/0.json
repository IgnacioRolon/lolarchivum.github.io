Sometimes it goes to 124 but mostly 128-133\n\nDid something new happen with the servers? I really dont wanna switch to oceania, I play in hawaii thats why.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I tried flush DNS and idk what happened didnt test right after, I updated my drivers thing where it says in the troubleshooting thing, and I woke up the next morning and my ping was stuck at 108! So I guess it's pretty good now, so please try this and see what happens. Then again it could still be a problem on their servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Femtó","date":"2017-07-21T00:06:09.662+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"same shit happened today also for me my ping was at like 66 yesterday now its in the 80s and its bugging me","replies":[{"poster":"AramDZH","date":"2017-07-21T00:10:09.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same, Do you guys live in the Pacific region?","replies":[{"poster":"Ben Shapenis","date":"2017-07-21T06:26:23.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do and im having the same problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"Femtó","date":"2017-07-21T00:12:49.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im in california rn and damn ive been looking for a fix all day and it seems like other ppl are having this problem also i hope riot can jump on  this because in every other game my ping is fine","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Oh Sorry Eh","date":"2017-07-21T08:10:49.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was hard enough when Hawaii players got shafted by the server move.
