These dont have to be 1350 or 1820 skins and could be of just 750 if needed . Just need to make 2 teams of 5 put some colour and gear on them , champions that can pull it off can be-\n\nThe Badass team (neon green and black-caus that would look amazing on the gear) \n1) {{champion:17}} - a yordle wid a helmet nothing can be cuter. His shrooms would be black and green footballs revolving and the green on it glowing. W could be him sprinting wid the football in his hand. Q could be a football thrown at someones face.. that could blind someone in real life. Poison is green which is his team colour so no problems there.\n2) {{champion:90}} - well malzahar would look amazing in an American football gear , you just need to put on the pads and the helmet would look amazing and it fits his other skins too as his whole face . Plus put helmets on voidlings and the follow his e which could show a revolving football which passes frm person to person and ur little voidlings with helmets on them follow to tackle the ball , w and q could have to do somthing as blocks or could be normal(just change the color).U can also make a recall for malz where he throws the ball and the voidlings jump to catch is like dogs.(i knw this recall is somewhat far fetched ) we could work on it.make malzahar&#039;s ult and q and w green.\n3) {{champion:12}} - wouldnt Alistar look just amazing in a padded gear and a helmet with horns. He has everything to do with tackling and blocking.An alistar black and green skin with a sexy helmet on. That would be amazing\n4) {{champion:429}} - black and green sexy bikini with some shoulder pads and her throwing footballs and dodging would be amazing plus alistar would be her blocker which would look nice. They make a good duo bot too. Change her blue animations to green it will look nice for designing her we can look at  women&#039;s american football gear. \n5) {{champion:19}}  - well you guys proved how good warwick looks in a armor and a headgear in marauder warwick. just make it into a cool black helmet and shoulder pads and some more gear. Black and green will suit him well. \nSo we cover all 5 position top mid jg adc supp plus they make an amazing team.\n\nThe Superstar team (blue and white or red and yellow - not very sure about these colors.) \n1) {{champion:222}}  - well because who would be bttr to be on ur team where u get to hurt people. Her rockets can be american footballs. Her q and ult would be different colour footballs. Dont make her wear a helmet caus she dosent need it she is crazy , she dosent need one . Her e can be helmets banging on the floor. Plus her personality fits so gud into american foodball. \n2) {{champion:115}}  - the way ziggs moves is so unique and u ad a helmet on this yordle i don&#039;t think anything would look more awesome. His bombs will be footballs his q will be a tumbling football. His ult would be a big football. His e could be small little hurdles or drill equipments or explosives little footballs half burried under the ground. The w would be a helmet that would blowup and lightup like his other skins w does. \n3){{champion:64}}  - you gave lee sin a coconut now give him a football. Give him a bit of padding and a helmet( i think he can pull it off ). His q would be a football thrown at the opponent and we all know we need to tackle the opponent aid the ball. Thats what lee does best ( this reminds me of a scene from the jet lee movie - romeo must die... that was pretty awesome XD). \n4){{champion:76}}  - no one has a better arm then nidalee. Her traps can be small hurdles. Her long q would be like a football or if u want smthing like a spear let the spearhead be a revolving football. When she marks a target a golden football can appear on top of their heads and looking at headhunters nidalee i know she can pull of the look with shoulder pads. Her cougar for can be in the team colours and we have our mascot too ! XD\n5) {{champion:201}}  - You need a blocker and who would be better than braum. His shield could be those huge tackle sleds used for training. He would look good in a padded gear and a helmet. He is a team player and we all know it ! \nSo what do you guys think and please give your suggestions and help me make this reach to the riot people. I know this skins would be amazing and tell me which skins would u like to have.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuzja1","date":"2016-03-01T07:12:47.511+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about {{champion:14}} ?

Handegg skins would have abysmal sales on servers that weren't NA unless they were super generic, if they had anything too related to the sport people outside of America just wouldn't care.\n\nFootball skins are an easy win however since it's the most popular sport globally. Football's international popularity is similar to what Handegg's is in America except on a global scale. When you consider that EUW is somewhere around twice as large as NA as a server it's just a more logical sport. It would sell far better on 2 of the 3 large servers.\n\nFootball skins are just always going to sell better even if they already exist when you consider this.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2s84x.png","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-03-02T05:23:03.327+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah yeah yeah.

It's simple to see that there would be an overall preference towards Football skins when 2 of the big 3 servers are located in regions where Football is popular as well as several of the smaller servers. (BR, TR, RU ect.)\n\n>There are already two NA skins in statue of liberty Karthas and Uncle Sam Ryze.\n\nWhen those two skins were made the majority of the playerbase was American. Both skins were released on 4/7/2010, the EUW server wasn't released until [13/7/2010.](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Servers) You are comparing a completely different time here, at that time a larger portion of players would have been interested in these skins.\n\nNow we've reashed the point where people expect more from skins and NA is no longer the largest server with both EUW and KR being bigger than it. It makes far less sense to invest resources into skins for just NA now than it did in 2010.","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-03-02T22:16:02.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yep and Riot also does Chinese New Years skins every year as well.

Secondly Chinese new-year is an event that is celebrated outside of China. In addition the skins are usually generic. The Lunar reveal skins normally just look Chinese inspired.

I can honestly say that Chinese New Year is far more interesting than American crap-sports to me.\n\n>Tell me how big of a holiday that is on all the other major regions. \n\nProbably 5-10x bigger than the Superbowl when you consider Asian migrant populations.","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-03-02T22:50:22.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lol you're way to salty to be taken serious.

Football skins are already around and you dont see many of them around being used. The reason is on the football or soccer theme you dont get to do much with the skins appearance. And believe me i am an indian from kolkata and anyone who knows about these to places can tell you football is kolkata's religion and cricket is india's religion. These 2 sports are what dominate my country. But the thing is you cant do much about the appearance of the skins of these sports. But with american football .... just look at the gear man and the balls shape things that are completely distinct from other sports and the look awesome.

Football skins are already around and you dont see many of them around being used. \n\nFor the most part I'd say that's because they're all limited skins that are at least two years old and honestly none of them are that good. You're also playing on the NA server, which is something to keep in mind. Personally I actually see Goalkeeper Maokai and Red Card TF quite a bit and I'd say I see the others about an average amount for limited skins and I'm not playing in a region where Football's super popular.\n\nI just think that there's much less selling power behind Handegg than there is behind Football. If I had to take a bet about the next set of sport(ish) based skins coming up I'd say it will probably be something to do with the 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\nIt also probably doesn't matter if there's already ~10 Football skins, the potential profit margin for creating another is probably still way higher than a Handegg Skin.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonLord95","date":"2016-03-02T04:08:59.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i own red card tf  XD my favorite skin in the 750 range and i like goalkeeper maokai but and that is because of the diversity and goalkeeper gears are awesome . and with tf u get to use the red and yellow card which means something in football i love these 2 skins . these skins dont sell caus they are related to football but because the look amazing and are well portrayed. i am just asking you to consider the american football gear caus it looks amazing... i dont know about american football that much either i am playing from india XD . but i like how the gear looks ... they look like sports warriors :P \np.s. i really love red card tf amazing skin love the hat and the cards","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Camel Flipper","date":"2016-03-02T08:40:59.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iron man {{champion:112}}  /    Hulk {{champion:12}}   /    Captain America   {{champion:44}}    /    Thor      {{champion:2}}     /     Loki    {{champion:17}} \n\nAnd Deadpool!    {{champion:98}}","replies":[{"poster":"brandonf131","date":"2016-03-02T20:40:56.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:36}}  hulk/ {{champion:80}}  cap/ {{champion:78}}  thor/  {{champion:154}}  mr. fantastic/ {{champion:54}}  the thing/ {{champion:28}} invisible woman/ {{champion:63}} already the torch/ {{champion:412}} ghost rider/ {{champion:4}} gambit/ {{champion:107}} wolverine/ {{champion:40}} storm/ {{champion:57}} groot/ {{champion:17}} rocket/ {{champion:236}} punisher","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bıg UwU Energy","date":"2016-03-02T05:09:19.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the {{champion:64}}  skin, I'd think it'd be pretty funny if his ult was like a punt/field goal kick. xD","replies":[{"poster":"DragonLord95","date":"2016-03-02T05:15:50.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree , it would awesome !
