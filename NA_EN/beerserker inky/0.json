Or when you ult under tower, it keeps focusing you? Or the clone? 50% 50% maybe?

Targeted missiles inbound for Shaco are destroyed at time of cast, so it's possible to dodge a spell cast. From memory towers will focus the actual Shaco if their options are the clone or Shaco.

It's possible I juxtaposed that, and it spawns on his left, but we're going on the assumption I remember.  This actually lets you jump walls with your clone, if you stand right next to a thin wall.  It takes some practice, and isn't incredibly consistent, but a good trick.  \n\nWhen you ult, you drop tower aggro, since you technically go untargetable for a period of time.  Just watch DoT's like corrupting potion / red buff, since those will re-aggro the tower on you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Basic Island","date":"2016-03-01T19:05:34.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not 100% cus i haven't been playing shaco much lately\n\nbut i believe\n\nit'll focus shaco first, because shaco will spawn first (not 100% sure, but one of them spawns 1st)\n\nthe clone and shaco are always in the same positions, depending on which way shaco is facing \n\nIn other words, the clone will always be on the right (or left, no idea which it is)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheMinez","date":"2016-03-01T19:03:57.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have once used shaco ult to go over drag pit wall, they only saw 1 so they focused the clone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zarkkast","date":"2016-03-01T16:31:00.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://youtu.be/ZyG_7Wf8ouk?t=334","replies":[]},{"poster":"burritomomo","date":"2016-03-01T16:17:20.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think there is a way to control where your clone spawns, but I think if you are under tower and you ult before you get hit by the tower the tower will got for your clone.
