My computer ends up freezing and I have to restart it, at that point I am not able to even join the game. I have tried smashing the enter and space bar, nothing has worked, i have read countless forums and found nothing that helps. Now I am in a lower priority queu and have to wait 10 min to join a game. NOW ALL MY FRIENDS HATE ME AND WONT PLAY WITH ME :(. I am a new player and it super hard to join the community when I can't even play and then have to wait! Hope someone from Riot can help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-01T23:17:15.230+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man that sounds really frustrating, especially if your friends are starting to make comments about it now =(. I might need a little more context, like if this is on a Mac or not, but in the meantime try changing your video settings to windowed and check it in a custom/practice game to see if that helps at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Incomplet","date":"2018-02-13T12:36:16.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nI totally get the same thing except I join in a ranked game.  What happens is that I am alt-tabbed , working on other things, and the game starts. As a result, then the client launches the game and then all I get is a white screen, where I desperately spam spacebar and enter. This happens somewhat frequently and it's very frustrating to lose a game that you weren't able to play. \n\nI try closing the client and reopening but to no avail does it ever work. By then, I have already been qualified as leaver OR my team simply loses the game because I tried to join but I am not actually in. Please fix this so this helps not only me but everyone on my team.","replies":[]}]}
