It only does this with League (also the PBE). I have a Logitech gaming mouse, and I am not quite sure how to fix this. My Windows mouse speed is the only speed that changes whenever I enter a game, not my actual mouse dpi or League of Legends mouse speed. Any help/info on this is appreciated!\r\n\r\nMy mouse is a Logitech G700s if that is needed","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-06T21:38:50.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your in-game mouse settings are exclusive to the game, and won't be the same outside of that.
