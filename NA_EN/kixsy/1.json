I have tried all the connection fixes on the help site, and none have worked for me. The part that leaves me most stuck is the fact that I don't have high ping on any other game when playing. I have tested it with having Overwatch open, and then League of Legends while at 150 ping, Overwatch is at a normal 58 ping. I really can't understand as to why it does this. I have tried restarting my internet, a ton of connection fixes, all of which have not worked. I should also mention my ping will juggle between 56 and 150 in some games. All help is appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-21T17:45:41.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your network could be having issues specifically keeping a strong connection with our game servers, or your ISP could even be taking a long route to reach us.
