I think I played her once. This guy deleted me on lvl 2 and he just walked spamming the spikes. I couldn&#039;t record that video, but I spectated a few mins of his next game & this is what I took from there. \nIs this normal Cassiopeia or scripting? I will try to spectate his early lvls next time, because that is when he has it on for sure, because this could be doable without scripts I think.\nThanks\nEdit: Specifically focusing on the fangs spam, not skillshots.","replies":[{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2015-06-27T23:26:16.241+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well who knows... you could make a ticked to RITO support anyways and let them look if there's something fishy going on. \n\nUsually you don't just spam that fast, even with smart cast.
