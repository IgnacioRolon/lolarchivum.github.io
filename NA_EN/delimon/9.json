Just do what he says in the video. Buy the ap gp5 item first Farm until you hit level 6. Afk. If your team needs help tele to them and help them. If you can just ult then ult. If a lane is pushed to your tower just go press E and farm it instantly. Buy Morello's first, then Rab , then void, then rylai, and DFG last. Sell your GP5 for a Zhonyas to have 900 ap and a 70 sec cd. Now just keep on pushing lanes and doing whatever until you win the game. \n\nThere you have just learned how to play spawn point karthus. Have fun. No effort required. Also do not upgrade your gp5 beyond the second stage. \n\nEdit: Also never take blue because you're going to be suiciding quite a bit here. If your allies die just go to the lane the enemies are pushing and keep them off the tower. If you have to die then die and push them back to keep the game going as long as possible.","replies":[]}
