Now before you go batshit crazy on me she's getting this for a reason and the next step is why,\n\nNerf that fucking bull shit passive and rework it into something that doesn't allow her to sneeze at shit and then get away cuz \"I'm immobile so I need dis passive\" bull shit. I already have an idea for it. Lets say that it increases her move speed per auto attack while in combat to a max of 12% extra move speed for 10 seconds accumulating 2% extra move speed per auto attack (similar to miss fortunes passive but the opposite. Instead of being out of combat not getting hit she needs to be in combat to use it). Bam now she's more balanced and less frustrating to deal with.\n\nLastly, nerf her ult damage. It's a global Riven/Garen ult. It should not have as much damage being a global execute UNLESS they increase the CD on it by at LEAST 20-30 seconds at ALL ranks. As if of right now that Low CD global execute is r%%%%%ed and makes no sense at all. No other global ability in the game has that kind of CD and does that kind of damage with the exception of Ezreal but the difference is his CD comes from landing skill shots and it also is NOT AN EXECUTE!\n\nThose are my ideas on what to do with her. If you have better ideas you can post them here too and I'll move them up to the OP.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Grimspeake,realm=NA,application-id=mNBeEEkI,discussion-id=AOnE9g91,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-25T05:03:57.083+0000)\n>\n> orrr... nerf her q rocket range so she cant just play like caitlyn during laning\n\n","replies":[]}
