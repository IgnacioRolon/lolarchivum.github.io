Let me tell you about this Dota Hero named Faceless Void","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"This is him right here\r\n\r\nhttp://dota2.gamepedia.com/Faceless_Void\r\n\r\nThis guy teleports all over the fucking place and if he lands on you your move speed AND attack speed are lowered by up to 50% at rank 5. \r\n\r\nHe has up to a 25% chance to dodge both your autos AND your spells (yes your spells included) and it stacks with evasive items (it does not add like 25+25= 50 but multiplicity such as each having its own 25% chance to dodge)\r\n\r\nHe also gets up to a 25% chance to stun you just for autoing your face and it lasts for a second and it can hit multiple times. \r\n\r\nAnd his ult? A fuckin space time rift that stops ANYTHING that enters it for 4-6 seconds. That's 4-6 seconds of free dps he gets to smack your face with.\r\n\r\nSo unless you have BKB and/or BMB you're fucked. So in other words if you feed this thing the game is over. \r\n\r\nOh and he can solo roshan btw by perma stunning it and just simply killing it. Good luck dealing with this bitch.","replies":[]}
