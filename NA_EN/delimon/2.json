The reason people looked to ADCs for more or less the same type of play (and only the few who did that specific thing best in any given patch were played) is because those other types of power did not exist to a meaningful degree in the marksman class before now. We needed a marksman, and while there wasn't only one thing any given marksman did, there was basically only one thing a marksman did well.\n\nThey reworked those champions partly with the explicit purpose of challenging that meta. The reasoning behind it being, of course, that the first step toward breaking the monotony of marksman and support duo bot lanes is to give them the power to enter other roles and bring a marksman's particular power into those roles. This is because, like it or not, the way the game is designed, having an ADC _somewhere_ on your team will be desirable for taking objectives efficiently. If it exists somewhere outside of bot lane, it stands to reason that bot lane will no longer necessarily demand it (especially with a more balanced map in terms of contested objectives, with the addition of Rift Herald). In order to make team configurations less dependent on feeding an ADC, we just needed to make ADCs as a whole less dependent on the duo lane to get fed. A team still needs an ADC. If that ADC no longer needs a babysitter (at least, not to any greater extent than anyone on the team needs teamwork to succeed), they can pull their weight from the start, and the whole team is better off.\n\nI saw someone say that if we start seeing ADCs go top, mid, and jungle more often, they'll quit until it's \"fixed\". But the only way that the class's stranglehold on the meta will be broken is if it stops being so much more needy than the other roles. This is the first step. And yes, it required making ADCs (some of them, at least) stronger.","replies":[{"poster":"JSTIN8","date":"2015-11-10T10:53:10.408+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, great reply, good info all about. Second, I think we need to try and find a way that melees can do good damage to towers without running into the problem when rengar Q worked on towers. (Even as a person who likes rengar that shit was just silly). You make a good point about needing adcs to go to other lanes as a way to break the monotany, but there still remains two problems that haven't even been recognized seemingly. One problem is as stated above, that melees cannot properly damage towers safely without getting shit on if the enemy team is nearby. We cant just give them a straight number buff because that just makes split pushers like trynd and yi and nasus more painful to deal with, without really getting to the core of the issue. The second problem is that normally whenever an adc pops up in another lane, it is because they can utterly shitstomp their lane opponent and offer very little counterplay when they do. (Heres looking at you Vayne and Quinn top). Finally, the part that really rustles my jimmies is how they went about the ADC itemization. Between that new damage DOT item they have and Phantom dancer, along with just how plain strong lord dominiks regard is even against champs that are not tanks, it feels like there will be no point really being a full tank atm such as rammus or naut or sion. And those champs have it bad enough as it stands.

I don't think the inherent advantages of range in terms of safe positioning and reliable attacks can be erased so easily, and I'm not sure they should be. I think it's unavoidable that melee champions place themselves in greater danger when they attack, and they receive considerable mobility and survivability advantages for doing so. As for general tools to attack turrets, Spellblade has been a powerful one. AP Bruisers make great use of Lich Bane, and AP tower damage from basic attacks has been buffed. The AD side gets tricky, though, because Trinity Force lost a lot of its attack speed and gained crit. The new tower-cracking item, Rapid Firecannon, is also a crit item, but melees CAN use it. Crit builds may be the de facto turret busters, even on melee, because the best tools for the job basically force you into it. AD bruisers who don't prefer crit builds may have a tougher time.\n\nRegarding ADCs being toxic in other lanes, that's been true in the top lane, which leans heavily towards melee champions. There is possibly some work to be done, looking at solo lanes between melee and ranged champions. But I do think the new Quinn is suited for mid lane because it's the best place (aside from the jungle) to make use of her map-wide strengths, and not because she's particularly punishing to common mid laners.\n\nAD itemization has been mixed up considerably, but it's really not so bad. Death's Dance is weaker in terms of burst mitigation than Bloodthirster's shield, unless you have a high health total (at least around 3k at level 18). Its main draw will be in providing physical spell vamp for champions who don't build AP. These two facts make it really more of a bruiser item. The new Phantom Dancer? Its movement speed and unique passive now only work within 500 units of an enemy champion. Again, this favors bruisers. Certainly, a splitpusher like Quinn looking for more dueling power could make use of the single-target damage reduction, but I think most ADCs would find more value in one of the other three 30% crit items.\n\nGiant Slayer, Last Whisper, and Lord Dominik's Regards are really not as overwhelmingly strong as many people seem to think. For starters, the Giant Slayer passive caps at 500 health difference. Even when you have exactly the same health as an ADC, building more health is always a net gain against it, and more so once you hit that cap. Health is also easier to build in larger quantities, and BoRK's passive was nerfed, so stacking health is also more attractive. In addition, that 15% boost approximately compensates for the loss in raw AD from items. The changes overall produce ADCs who do similar damage per hit, attack slower, and crit more often, giving Randuin's Omen a sizable stealth buff. As for the Last Whisper passive, it's weaker than on live. The version on LDR is less effective unless the target has more than 7 times as much bonus armor as base armor, which basically never happens unless you're Thresh (yes, it's a slight nerf to Thresh). It's also FAR less effective against targets who have already been debuffed by The Black Cleaver. Overall, I think tanks and bruisers will actually be in a fairly _good_ position in the coming season.\n\nNow, mages and caster supports... Well, we'll see where the new masteries and gold income changes put them. In any case, while many of the Season 6 changes focus on ADCs and AD itemization, it certainly hasn't been about simply buffing them like so many are saying, and everyone will be affected in various ways, both positive and negative.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Delimon","date":"2015-11-10T06:12:14.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Totalis,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=isH9GrEU,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-11-10T03:22:19.696+0000)\n>\n> Maybe if you played ranked or even summoner's rift you'd know why ;) The reason why the changes are hated is because people hate adc's without even looking at how they've been doing (they're WEAK).
