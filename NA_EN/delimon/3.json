It's actually all in the old GD forums.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that you have to not like Riot but if you're new here and you're defending them you really should not be without having all the information about who they are and what they have been doing. I've never seen a company as bad as Riot. Every other online game I've ever played the companies listen to their players and get things done faster than Riot does. A hell of a lot faster. Meanwhile Riot does what ever the hell they want and they completely ignore the player base more than half the time.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry but after playing League for so long and getting to know Riot and what they stand for I just don't like them at all as a company. It's just my opinion and everyone is entitled to have their own opinions but you should know the facts first before you start praising something.","replies":[]}
