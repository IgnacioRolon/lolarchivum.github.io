Like have another tab open watching twitch/RiotGames? I heard that there is basically no delay on the spectating mode and the actual game itself. Or is like the computers not letting the pros go on the internet or something blocking it","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Commish","date":"2018-06-20T20:15:03.560+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no internet on stage at LCS (or MSI or Worlds, etc) - so they couldn't even if they wanted to. Players also can't take phones or other electronic devices on stage, so no risk there either!\n\nChris","replies":[]},{"poster":"EyesOfTheFox","date":"2018-06-21T17:40:36.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um, I'd definitely imagine not, as that would blatantly be cheating. Which would ruin the integrity of the game, not to mention surround Riot with controversy on how or why players were given the tools to enable such cheating in the first place. Also if you have to ghost someone, you are obviously trash at the game and lack the confidence and self worth to even be on that stage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"anonymous119","date":"2018-06-20T09:56:12.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was a fairly big scandal when the players could see the broadcast monitor at worlds a couple years ago.  Multiple players were caught turning around to look at it which would be considered ghosting.  Riot is a pretty good company at realizing its own mistakes and nothing like that has happened again as far as I'm aware.\n\nPro players have some one standing ~3 feet behind them at all times during matches.  I would imagine it would be very hard to cheat with a referee literally looking over your shoulder at what is on your screen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gear Jammer","date":"2018-06-19T03:36:41.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They only got one screen at tournaments...
