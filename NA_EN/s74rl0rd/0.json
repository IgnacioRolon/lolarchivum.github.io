I did pull up your ticket and noticed that you weren't able to provide enough information to verify you as the original creator. I know you sent some screenshots of conversations, but those are things that can easily be found while the hacker was on your account.\n\nI absolutely want you to get back into the game, but we do take account security incredibly serious, and we can only give access to the account back when we have 100% certainty that it's going to the right hands. My only suggestion is to look over the questions they asked and do your best to answer as many as you can. We ask those specific questions because they are very hard to find out unless you were the one who physically did what the questions are asking.","replies":[{"poster":"S74RL0RD","date":"2017-05-08T04:31:22.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you look at my latest open ticket you will see that I have also provided over 60 R3D Game Logs. Who else but the original owner would have logs dating back so far on their computer? The hacker took my account in the evening of August 28, 2017. I also provided screen shots dating back to Aug 21,2015 when I verified the account to my email for SO CALLED SECURITY, as well as screenshots of every RP purchase I have ever made on the account. I understand that Rito takes security seriously, but to limit account verification to your own level of verification when I am providing proof beyond your security questions is erroneous.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-08T04:42:44.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the issue with those R3D logs is that if someone had access to your account, they could play a game and would have R3D logs as well, every person playing the game will have access to those logs. \n\nScreenshots of previous recovery attempts can also be found by logging into your account (which they have access to at this point) and searching for your past tickets. Also screenshots of transaction history can easily be found as well if they have ever had access to your account. Screenshots will most likely not be able to single you out as the account creator. \n\nIn essence, the questions we ask are very precise and are not able to be found anywhere on your profile or transaction history. If some kind of information is readily available to someone who has access to your account, that information will not help us realize you're the one who made the account. \n\nDo you best to answer the questions they ask, as those are the types of questions that a **hacker** would not be able to find out. Essentially, you're going to have to think back and remember the things you did with your account, and you won't be able to look up that information. We need the original creator to give information only they would know, hence the difficult questions.","replies":[{"poster":"S74RL0RD","date":"2017-05-08T04:48:43.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you kidding me? No one can pull up my R3D Logs from 2016! The hacker could only gain access to the games he plays on his/her computer under his/her client. You have got to be joking? No? \n\nThis what I call laziness. I have provided accurate information. I have not been told specifically what question/s I \"did not provide enough information\" on. No direction at all except some typical premade email messages.","replies":[{"poster":"S74RL0RD","date":"2017-05-08T04:58:49.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another thing. This account has MY Credit Card info on it!!!!!! How about if Riot really wants to verify an account they go by a persons billing and payment information, which I also provided and was told that proves nothing. Please tell me me how providing the billing and payment information for every single transaction on this is not owner verification? I have spent a total of $330.00 on RP on this account. You know if my personal information wasn't linked to the account I would get over this easily, but to lose $330.00 and have some hacker with access to my credit information is an uncomfortable feeling.\n\nBecause Riot doesn't want to verify me by my payment methods I now have to cancel my credit cards for no reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2017-05-10T08:40:21.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not certain you've thought this through. You want to use your billing and payment information to ID yourself as the original owner. You're also worried that the hacker now has access to your billing and payment information. \n\nEven if Riot decided to give the account to you, that would not go back in time to make it so the hacker was unable to acquire said information. You would be wise to contact your card's fraud department anyway, and see what steps you should take.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CaptDux","date":"2017-05-08T18:42:37.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is me helping out @Broporo but the sheer fact that the date you have of the hacker taking over is quite disturbing and tends for me to call out bullshit on you because last time I checked the date was only may 2017 unless you are a time traveler playing jokes on people then I would highly recommend you just get in and verify your actual computer log entries and ensure you have not had more personal information stolen as you could very likely be a victim of identity theft and not even know about it.","replies":[{"poster":"S74RL0RD","date":"2017-05-10T01:33:05.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about you use the empty space between your ears and try to think for a second before you attempt to call bullshit my friend!
