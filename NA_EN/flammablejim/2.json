Heimerdinger isn't meta. Urgot is fairly strong, I'll give you that. But Udyr is pathetically and laughably weak. \n\nPlay some more and I think your perspective will change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gabetheguy","date":"2017-11-03T20:21:52.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"udyr is utterly pathetic. urgot is pretty strong, but just don't throw yourself at him repeatedly (which you obviously do) and you won't have a problem. heimer is mediocre.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-11-03T18:20:20.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have any issues against those champs, but I don't really keep up with what is considered strong since I consider the game to be pretty well balanced. It is definitely better than it was when I started.\n\nAgainst Heimer you can't catch yourself being somewhere where his turrets are all hitting you, take them out first or catch him away from them. Make sure to dodge the rockets too, they can hurt.\n\nAgainst Urgot, make sure to dodge his Q's, since they are the primary thing that let him lock onto you with his W, and try to fight him in a minion wave so he is stuck targetting them. It gets kinda rough when he dashes to you, but if you can play around that you are basically golden. If he gets you low you are basically dead to his ult though.\n\nFor Udyr, just don't be near him. He can't exactly get to you if you are trying to avoid being near him, all he can do is run at you. Burst him and back off or poke him from range. He is a very good fighter, so not many champs are going to win a duel against him, but it takes two for a duel and you can choose not to be the second.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OurLestrade","date":"2017-11-03T18:18:21.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been much worse in the past.","replies":[]}]}
