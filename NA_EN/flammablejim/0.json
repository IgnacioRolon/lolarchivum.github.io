Get Excited raises Jinx's Move speed by 175%. From her meta build, before Soft Cap scaling, that's 1250 or so move speed. Turns out to be close to 925 Move speed considering soft Speed caps. That means her move speed bonus is stronger than any dash, knock backs, etc. If excited, she will pass 3 attacks per second, and will be able to move twice as fast as you. This is why Jinxes who got takedowns pre patch become monsters. Now, her attack speed is back to being part of her Q, so she will always have it. Once she has Rapid Fire Cannon, she's going to literally own your games.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-23T23:55:13.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may be waiting a long time.","replies":[]}]}
