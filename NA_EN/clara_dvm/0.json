How and why did i not get the border? I worked very hard to achieve this rank. Hope it can be resolved{{champion:89}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-25T03:53:08.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you hit that rank before the season ended or during preseason? Preseason won't count towards overall rank for the season, since that season had already ended. It looks like you were able to hit B2 in the solo q before the season ended, so you should have the bronze border.","replies":[]}]}
