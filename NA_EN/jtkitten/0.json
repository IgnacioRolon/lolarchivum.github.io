{"poster":"jtkitten","date":"2020-02-29T02:46:51.369+0000","title":"I got falsely reported and received an automated 10-game chat ban","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would post this in ask the community but this isn't really a bug rather than just a bad automated system on riot's end.\nI logged in to see that I am receiving a 10-game chat ban for bad behavior? \nChat Log: \nGame 1\nIn-Game\njtkitten: I don't know how to play graves (//this was in response to someone saying I didn't know how to play jungle or something related. I obviously know how to play jungle and I have 30k mastery points from playing graves over a period of time. I know how he functions and I know how the jungle works. this was a sarcastic comment I made in response to players flaming me for, what I can only assume, is not going bot lane \"enough\". I was obviously farming or doing something else trying to catch up.)\njtkitten: for what? (// this is in response to sivir saying \"report graves\". I always ask for a response whenever someone tries to get someone in game reported when I don't see any cause for it. I feel that anything I said afterwards is justified since I am not instigating any harassment or negative behavior here and my behavior is not very extreme through out this game)\njtkitten: I also want to know why (this is after someone on the enemy team typed \"/all why?\". \njtkitten: I am not trolling (this is in response to sivir saying I am trolling again)\njtkitten: ? (I think this may have been in response to one of veigar's spam pings. the question mark represents that I am confused about why he would be spam pinging me)\njtkitten: did I feed rengar? (rengar was fed at this point and I don't think a single person was responsible for this. He was ulting and triple q'ing all game so he was clearly a smurf on an alternate account. I was being blamed for this by bot lane because he is jungle and I am jungle so guilty by association. )\njtkitten: no\njtkitten: giving up is a reportable offense (veigar or sivir was trying to forfeit after harassing me. I don't like to forfeit matches when there is still a glimmer of hope)\njtkitten: I decided to play with my second hand now (this was a joke comment I made after I got a comeback kill. I can't believe I have to say that I was playing with both of my hands this whole game. This looks like an obvious joke comment to me)\njtkitten: LMAO \njtkitten: IM MASTERY 30k (both of these were in response to sivir or veigar saying this was my first game as graves and I shouldn't be playing new champions in ranked. I agree that it isn't a good idea to try new champions in ranked, but I wasn't and my comment earlier was an obvious sarcastic joke comment in response to comments earlier by sivir. Anyone who looked at the loading screen would see that I have 30k mastery on graves. Loading screens usually take over a minute which is plenty of time to view all character cards. \njtkitten: sivir is really blaming me for all of this (sivir is still trying to blame me for the whole game and all problems)\njtkitten: why are you spam pinging me?  (veigar has been spam pinging me the whole game. I am asking why)\njtkitten: why do you have warmog's as ap support? (veigar built warmog's armor as second item on a support mage. While trying new metas is not a crime, I find that the combination of his spam pinging all game and his warmog's armor on a mage support is enough evidence to show that he trolling. )\njtkitten: are you griefing my game? (this was said because sivir and veigar were saying I was trolling all game and so I responded by calling them out for rules they actually were breaking)\njtkitten: LOL\njtkitten: your support is trolling\njtkitten: are you two a premade? (they both were acting very strange together. no club tags but I have never seen a support and adc act this way together before. usually it is just one player not understanding that junglers have to farm their lane also and cannot be everywhere at once, but even then you only get those players once in a while)\njtkitten: I have not been toxic at all lol\njtkitten: you aren't worth getting chat banned over (sivir and veigar were obviously trying to gaslight me into saying profane things in chat, which I did not do. I do not find my behavior to be wrong in the slightest and a chat restriction will not change my view on the situation. \njtkitten: sorry\njtkitten: alright\njtkitten: enjoy getting banned for false reports (sivir and veigar pushing reporting me for trolling)\njtkitten: report me for what? \njtkitten: no\njtkitten: how was I griefing? (sivir or veigar said I was griefing and I believe it is because rengar had such a high kda)\njtkitten: you have 6 kills and jhin has 1 ( sivir was complaining about being behind in gold when she had 6 kills and jhin had 1. no normal player acts like this. I am fully convinced they were acting this way to get me to say naughty things in chat. )\njtkitten: you have more total gold\njtkitten: what?\njtkitten: I never afked in jungle (this is the part where our top laner got frustrated over the game and came to the conclusion that I was afk in jungle at some point in the game, which never happened. The replay which is still available shows that I was moving around and doing things the entire time)\njtkitten: this veigar is feeding (veigar is walking into them at this point)\njtkitten: I can't escape rengar's triple q (rengar instant kills me at this point after he ults)\njtkitten: I never afkd (responding to top laner who has things mixed up)\njtkitten: if I didn't go intoa  fight then it was because I figured I couldn't win it (response to top laner because of the ornn fight we had over rift herald. he chose to continue fighting ornn while I got rift herald and moved on because ornn was out of the fight already. I think this is the part where he believes I was afk, but I never afked, I just chose the smarter play)\njtkitten: I never afked wtf is this team (response to top laner and spam pings by veigar. \njtkitten: clown school up in here (heat of the moment response to the whole situation at hand. This was said late in the game and I do not believe this response breaks any of the summoner's code)\njtkitten: honoring yasuo because although he died a lot he isn't dumb (heat of the moment response at the end of the game. This response was made right before our nexus was destroyed and I 100% believe that calling others \"dumb\" in a single last second response is not breaking any of the summoner's code. \n\nContext: I was playing graves. the enemy jungler was a rengar who was likely smurfing using triple q method. all game I am getting harrased by bot lane for things that didn't make sense to me. top laner claims I afked at some point in the game which is not true at all and the replay shows this (I think he was referring to a point in the match where I didn't join a fight to save him because I saw 2 separate enemies coming towards that area. I wish I had the full chat log so things could make more sense in context as to what is going on. If this was manually reviewed by someone at riot then this 10-game chat ban would have never went through and it would have been obvious that my top laner just didn't understand the context of me not joining that fight and it would also show that my bot lane were griefing and trying to get me to say something worse than anything I did say with the intention of reporting me for toxicity. I have been in situations like this where teamates are obviously griefing and telling all chat to false report without giving any grounds for why to report, but I have never been banned before. I have also had some bad games in the past where I have said some regrettable things, but this match was not one of them. with context to the situation you would see that some of my chat is sarcastic because bot lane was clearly gas lighting me. \n\nTo sum this up: I was falsely reported by at least two individuals who were trolling and this is my appeal\nediting this to add that I only got banned over this single game which I find unusual\n\nhttps://imgur.com/vQIeWWi\nedit: adding scoreboard at end to show that I was not trolling etc. the veigar was spam pinging me all game and he built a warmogers as second item ? https://imgur.com/a/63TyYmj\nedit: rewatched parts of the game and it becomes clear to me that nocturne was saying I was afk because he ulted ornn while we were fighting rift herald and I chose to claim rift herald over fighting ornn. ornn already left the fight so I saw no reason to continue fighting him over rift herald\n\nEdit 11:11PM EST: I am editing this to say I filed a support ticket. I originally made this post because I could not figure out how to file a support ticket for appealing bans but hopefully this will all get sorted out soon. ","replies":[]}
