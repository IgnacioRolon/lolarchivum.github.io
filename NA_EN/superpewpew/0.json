I had logged on it with my username and password, played around for a bit with the buttons, and queued for a... minute or two on Draft Queue, however I had decided to just close the client because It was going to take too long (Well, It isn&#039;t like the server is _too_ populated at 8:00 A.M., I suppose)\n\n*ahem* \n\nAnyways, about one hour later, I had tried to use the client. Regretfully, I couldn&#039;t. \n\nThe usual loading screen didn&#039;t show up, and clicking doesn&#039;t seem to work on any part but the minimize/settings &amp; about screen/quit buttons, which are fully functional. I can&#039;t click on the Username &amp; Password fields, nor the region/language (Wasn&#039;t planning on changing it anyway :-|)\n\nSo far I&#039;ve tried Signing off on my computer and signing on again, Running the Alpha Client as Admin, and neither of those have worked. I might test with restarting the PC But I am not sure It&#039;ll work :x.\n\n(That&#039;s it, lol)\n\nEDIT: It seems to be working again, going to try a few games and see how it behaves.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-09-23T16:58:12.494+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have a fix for this, it should be included in the next patch, thanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zurkrem","date":"2016-09-21T14:18:16.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried logging on to the AIR client?","replies":[{"poster":"SuperPewPew","date":"2016-09-21T22:08:19.493+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, the AIR Client does work like usual. :o","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Emestie","date":"2016-09-21T16:11:34.695+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the same for me (pbe alpha).
