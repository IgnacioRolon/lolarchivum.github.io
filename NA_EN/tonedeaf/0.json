Back in the Que, Game has been found, Accept.\r\n\r\nGet in again, find out you are NOW placed on the team that you WERE about to play against... and the NOW enemy team **BANS THE CHAMPION YOU HAD AS YOUR PICK INTENT**, simply because they saw before hand.\r\n\r\nIt doesn&#039;t seem like much but it gives the other team an advantage and that sucks balls.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-09T16:11:28.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why you should definitely exit the queue when somebody dodges. There's also an issue that you are more likely to get autofilled/autofills, as well as poor matchups in this scenario than when getting on a fresh queue. The way the system works is that it weights getting everyone their intended roles and everyone being equally matched against how long you've been waiting in queue. So if you wait say 3 mins, get in champ selection, then get back on queue due to a dodge, your waiting timer will start from 3 mins from the get-go. In order to prevent you from waiting too much time the matchmaking will loosen the parameters on roles and skill matchups, so you'll be more likely to get people who were autofilled (or get autofilled yourself) in addition to getting unbalanced matchups.\n\nSo it's best to exit the queue and wait some 20 seconds or so before hopping back in if you care about match quality.","replies":[]}]}
