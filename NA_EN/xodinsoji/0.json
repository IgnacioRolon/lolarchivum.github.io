We both disconnected, and suddenly we could play again. And I got to the 2nd tower on mid and froze, apparently, I could ping, type in chat, try to surrender, but could not play, or see the things that happened. So Chat froze as well. I had to read responses off my roommates screen. It also caused me to run down lane endlessly trying to get me to where I was nonstop. I'd really like a loss prevention on that seeing as that obviously was something out of my control. I guess, I won't play til they fix these issues. It's terrible because we had a chance to comeback, and lost because I couldn't play and kept running to the team. \r\n\r\nIf it weren't for my roommate being able to play afterwards, I would have assumed it to be my network or something, but he continued to play after reconnecting. We both are hardwired to the same modem, and another roommate never lost internet service. It seems it would have to be server/client related.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-05T21:02:35.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind that if this was on the server side, then every single player in the game would have experienced issues given that everyone is connected to the same game server.  To be perfectly honest, I can't say definitively why you were the only one to experience this issue off the top of my head.  While I understand how much it sucks, Loss Prevented is only activated when there are server wide issues affecting thousands of players.\n\nTo dig a little deeper into this issue however, was this the only game that this seemed to have happened?  Or has this been occurring consistently game to game?
