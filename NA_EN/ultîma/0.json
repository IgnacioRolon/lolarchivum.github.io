In one instance it was Minuteman Gangplank (which I don&#039;t even own) and Nightraven Fiora even though I had clearly locked in the Project skin in queue. This seems to happen randomly. \r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-20T00:40:23.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This should now be resolved - feel free to ping me if you're still seeing this.","replies":[]}]}
