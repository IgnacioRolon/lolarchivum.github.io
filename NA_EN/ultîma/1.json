The Void is a fascinating and terrifying thing, and with Kai&#039;sa&#039;s release I imagined we would be getting a lot more lore not only about Malzahar and Kassadin, but also the dark things that crept from the Void and into the world. We got some really cool art, but not much in terms of the tales surrounding the Void creatures themselves. Is Kai&#039;Sa actively hunting any of them? Are Rengar or Nami? Is Vel&#039;Koz still on a mission to analyze Runeterran lifeforms? There still seems to be a lot of untapped territory from a narrative standpoint, and with no Void champion planned to be released any time soon one has to wonder when we&#039;ll next hear about any of the characters related to it. Anything to look forward to in the near-future Riot?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-04-06T19:02:25.086+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.","replies":[{"poster":"Leopardo144","date":"2018-04-11T03:04:00.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Bq60WTRU,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-04-06T19:02:25.086+0000)\n>\n> Yes.\n\nIs there an estimate here?
