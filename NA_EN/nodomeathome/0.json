I am not raging about an elo hell or because I feel like I belong elsewhere. (I am S3 currently) \nI do, but that's not why I am posting this. \nThe solo ranked queue system... is without a doubt the poorest ranking system and match making system I have experienced since I started gaming. And that is before match making systems even existed. \nThere are many reasons for this... \n#1 - Elo\nAn elo system is a system that was created for chess. A 1 vs 1 player game, where you are not forced to rely on strangers to advance in a ranked tier. That is not only unfair, its just plain stupid. They don't do that with sports teams. If they did, Jesus Christ. People would get murdered. \n#2 - You have to carry\nBecause of the last bit... you often are stuck with players who honestly appear as if they let their 5 year old little sister play for a game on their account. At that point you are forced to carry games. Which yes, if you are good you can. But in a ranked system it should not be based on \"who can carry the hardest\". It should have 5 people of equal skill levels, against 5 other people of the same skill level. MMR does not judge that closely enough, because win / loss is a huge factor in that, not performance.  I am currently gaining between 23 and 26 LP a game, and lose at the most 18. But that doesn't matter when we come to my next point.\n#3 - Win streaks required for promotion despite MMR\nYeah... MMR is great and all. You can get LP at a quicker rate than you lose it all day, it doesn't matter when you have to not only win 3 or 4 games to get to 100 lp, you then have to continue that streak for two games. Then people often get trolls, dcs, and people who don't understand basics of the game like deep warding or when not to push or what over extending is. . . then boom. Back to 70 80 lp, gotta win 3 more games. Put back an hour or three just because of that. A new system that takes into account members of a players team having disconnected, had extraordinarily bad scores or anything like that and not punishing them for that (which we are, we lose MMR, Elo, LP, and promo's because of that all the time) should be set up for the solo queues.  Also, when your MMR is so much higher than the league that you gain that much LP. Promos should be wavered. \n#4 - Mismatches\nI play LAN with people ranging from B4 to D5. The guy who is B4 consistently carries his weight... he doesn't make stupid mistakes, he even makes good push / baron calls, and often beats plat players in lane. The way this ranked system works in the solo queue needs to be fixed. I don't care who disagrees. If you are high diamond or challenger and are able to carry yourself up in a timely manner, then this doesn't apply to you. It applies to the other 99.9% of players. The fact that all the ranked latter is a matter of time, not a matter of skill. That's the issue. \nAnd it is. It is a matter of time, and matter of hoping and praying you don't get some kid who makes games nearly unwinnable no matter how hard you carry or how many plays you make. When people don't react to made plays. Therese nothing you can do. \nI am not getting gold this season, not because of me, but because of strangers who troll worse than 4chan losers. I consistently play well, I LAN I roll over many friends in plat left and right. When players in the lowest of ranks can play better than many players all the way up to plat... that is the extreme sign of an issue that you are to lazy to fix. \nYou're system only works with pre-made ranked teams. It needs to be repaired, stop with the champion updates, and fix the solo ranked queue for what is likely 90%+ of your player base. If you do this the endless train of reports of toxicity and whatever else will end. (I am typically not toxic) But there will be very little toxicity in general. You facilitate bad attitudes when you mismatch players, then you ban people for those bad attitudes because of your idiotic \"summoners code\", yet leave people who consistently in ranked hold 1:1 kda's and stuff untouched. Its inhuman not to get mad at someone when they prevent you from reaching your goals just because they enjoy getting reactions out of people. Your horrible community that you have created will not be so implosive if you just create a better match making system. \nThat's all.","replies":[{"poster":"Llanite","date":"2014-11-08T21:05:23.777+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":9,"body":"Welcome to the world.\n\nNot just Lol, in the future, you will have college, work and social activities where you have to carry the rest of the team.

Balanced teams.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MidEvilKnight3k","date":"2014-11-09T14:52:33.632+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like more people need to understand how the current system works.  If you have managed to get your MMR above your current division, then you will earn more LP for a win than you will lose for a loss.  You apparently have a higher MMR then your division so this is true for you.  If you get into promotions, there is no greater chance than before to get trolls, dc, or toxic players.  You have a 50% chance of getting promoted if you win about half your games.  As far as I can tell, the system keeps track of your LP during promotions the same way as before.  So even though you have to win against people in a higher MMR than the division you are in to get promoted, you will get more chances to get promoted because your LP gains are greater than your LP losses.\n\nAt the beginning of this season I spent a lot of time at silver 5 and I couldn't advance because my MMR was much lower than the division I was in.  Eventually I improved my MMR to above my rank.  It took a little time for my rank to begin to follow my MMR, but once it did, it started improving quickly until I was bouncing from Silver 2 to Silver 1.  Even though I  had to compete against people in Silver 1 and Gold to promote from Silver 3 to Silver 2, I was still able to do it because I was earning so much more LP for wins than I lost for losses and I could get into the promotion easily if I didn't get promoted the first time.  MMR can sway easily depending on how well you are playing and if you got unlucky with trolls or dc recently.  The divisions don't sway as easily and are honestly a better representation of how good you are on average than MMR is.\n\nSecond point\nToxicity does not happen because of mismatched games.  Toxicity happens more in this game as opposed to FPS, RTS, or a racing games, because LOL is a game that requires teamwork.  FPS and RTS games have teams, but you do not need your teammate to cooperate in order for you to do well.  In the case of most FPS games, you can usually forget you have a team and do pretty well.  In LOL, when your teammate does not do what you expect (often times it's what you consider the obvious thing to do), it can have a large impact on your own performance.  As a result people will be very toxic to other people for sucking when in reality they are about the same skill.  Remember, sometimes you don't do things that are obvious to other people that can have a poor result for the team.  Also, a lot of people will just not accept that their own performance was bad and will try to blame other.  In FPS, Racing, and RTS games there isn't much excuse for having low kills, being slower, or not producing an army.  Because LOL requires teamwork, many people think they can blame others for everything.  May I suggest the jungler?\n\nP.S. comments like the one about stopping champion updates to work on matchmaking are silly.  Do you really think that the artists, gameplay mechanics team, and other members working on champion updates would be able to help develop a matchmaking system?  Should they just stop all other projects until they get the most important one finished?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grimspeake","date":"2014-11-08T22:29:06.023+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> #3 - Win streaks required for promotion despite MMR\n> Yeah...

If you want to get higher on the ladder *you* need to make it so.  Yes some games may be unwinnable but for every game you run into like that statistically you will have an equal or greater amount of games that are unloseable.\n\nAnother point that is often ignored is that even though someone is at X rank, it does not mean they play at X level on very champion in every roll.  Due to this it is unlikely you will ever experience perfectly even games.  Every player is uneven in skill across their champion pool and lane.

Actually most of the games are quite balanced, but people generally don't know how to deal with being behind. They don't know how to avoid trades, where to ward when their turret is destroyed and when to roam. In lower leagues it's better to play champions who can be useful even if your team is bad.

Ranked teams is significantly easier as you can actually communicate with your team, making these decisions WHILE playing.  In normal games you do it on the fly, which takes a lot more \"effort\" as it isn't a unanimous call you can easily make over a voice chat.  Teams is easy mode as you can basically guarantee that you are all committed to the same thing/goal, something you can't do as easily when alone.  \n\nI don't know why you bring up KDA as it has really nothing to do with what ranking you are.  Yes, usually better players have a better KDA, but if you having a negative KDA results in your team winning, you will still rise.\n\nIn regards to carrying yourself, I always thought that was the point of playing the game.  There isn't much of a reason for you to rise in the game if you YOURSELF can't even deliver yourself to the level of play you want to be at.    Solo Q is all about gauging YOUR skill, not the ability of others to carry you.  You can occasionally get carried in a game or two, but you need to have at least a decent proficiency in the game to be able to go upwards in divisions.  If you don't, you'll stay where you are because you can't carry yourself.  Also if your counter is you like playing tanky/supportive champions, well then you'll either need to transition to playing an actual carry role or you need to improve your current playstyle to a level where you CAN carry.  Don't get me wrong, it is great that you want to support/tank and do roles that a lot of players don't like to do, but if you ACTUALLY want to carry yourself, you need to actually play something that can do damage and carry yourself out of your slump or \"elo hell\".\n\nMismatches don't mean much except at the highest level of play where queue times are too long and pulls from too many divisions (masters playing with plat 1) and high level players (diamond +) who are smurfing on unranked accounts.

Just got out of a 50 minute game where everyone performed reasonably well, and it's really sad that you can look at that incredibly rare occasion and say \"wow, that's really what this game is supposed to be like\", and then brace for another couple weeks of one of the teams ff20","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pilot Dog","date":"2014-11-08T20:48:31.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Do you have any suggestions to make it better?\n\nI agree with some of your points but in my opinion everyone gets to the level they should be within like 200 games. \n\nThere aren't any players with 300+ games played that should be in Diamond but are still in Silver or Gold due to feeders. \n\nIn only like 5 or 6 % of games is there feeding that makes the game impossible to win. People just tend to remember bad games more than good ones.\n\nAnd in the 5 out of 100 games that your team feeds 0-30 you'll get 5 out of 100 games where the other team feeds 0-30.

You DON'T just prance around in the enemies jungle without wards, and you sure as hell don't start fighting baron when their team is still up in the mid lane.\n\nI know all of this. I make good calls on the team, but there is always those 1 - 2 players that will say \" screw you, I do whatever I want\". Aside from playing in 5 on 5 pre-mades, I have no idea how you can turn this around. The  only other way, sadly, might be to make it pay to play, but only for ranked. If you want to play normals and ARAM, go right ahead. If you want to take this game seriously in the ranked division, pay for a subscription. This will hopefully attract the serious players, and will also help Riot with a cash revenue to target toxic behaviours.\n\nMost people are against the above idea, but for me..... time is money. If I have to waste 5 hours to get to a promotion just to lose due to people that don't give a shit... hell...... I could of made $200 dollars in that time I just wasted. That's enough money for a 3 year subscription to League in just 5 hours. People need to realize the time is money concept, because free to play is nice..... but when you realize any 12 year old who just want's to be an asshat can join ranked and ruin it for everyone, the whole idea of free goes out the window.","replies":[{"poster":"Diljic","date":"2014-11-09T16:06:43.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I agree with this.

If you are ahead of your lane opponent and you have that person on your team who is doing whatever they want and ramboing around use it to your advantage.  You know what ill advised plays they are going to make.  Follow them around and use them as bait.  The enemy can't help seeing them being what looks like a free kill, but when you pop out and turn a free kill into a trade or an advantage you have increased your lead making the next bait even better and turned a liability (your teammate) into a positive.\n\nIn most cases it is better to follow your teammate(s) into what you know is a bad situation and just fight it out as full team commitment is stronger than a good spit play when neither team is truly coordinated.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NoDomeAtHome","date":"2014-11-09T04:29:18.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"But tbh idc about rank.

It's a game, guys.\n\nI just think they need to rework the MMR system and compare your KDA to those on your team and make that a larger part of the system than just win/lose. There are certain things that bronze and silver players do that lose them games, but are they really inferior to gold players in other ways? For example, I know a gold 3 whos more mechanically skilled than a plat 5 that I know, yet the gold 3 is gold 3 because he has a desire to play non-carry champions and a tendency to get caught out at the WORST possible moment. Even when he's carrying as Urgot with a 12/1 KDA, he'll lose cuz of that one death and take an MMR hit for the smallest mistake. He can get better, but a 12/1 KDA should never drop your MMR.\n\nPromos could probably be reworked too. Instead of promo series, rework the MMR system so that placement is almost entirely based on MMR and your KDA from each game matters more, especially when compared to teammates because their feeding directly affects your success. For example, if lucian for some reason decides that dashing forward into blitz pulls is a good idea and does it 8 times giving Draven legendary, and you are mid and go 3/5 because he can kill you in 2 crits, then you don't suffer as much.\n\nI agree you should have to carry your way out of \"elo hell\" though. It's how you prove you actually are better than everyone in \"elo hell\". I just don't agree that the current system measures carrying in the best way.","replies":[]}]}
