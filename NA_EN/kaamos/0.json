It's a matter of the utmost importance, and I fear that handling this subject without finesse would bear cataclysmic repercussions. I speak-- of course-- about the Singed laugh, the integrity of which must be upheld. Some champions' laughs do not merely offer a distinctive chuckle, but also contribute heavily to their overall aesthetic. Some might even evoke strong emotions, for both the player laughing and the opponent hearing such laughter (e.g. the rage inducing Teemo giggles, the bizarre and spam-friendly craze of Lulu, the triumphant, cool, and evil Zed laugh, and the despair-inducing, nigh-unending trollfest that is Nunu Bot's laugh). One of the first things I picked up on when Jinx was released was how awesome it was that she rolled on the floor laughing and would just keep going until interrupted. I think it fit the personality Riot created for her to a T. \r\n\r\nBut for as awesome, soul-crushing, or spammable as some champions' laughs can be, none of them hold a candle to Singed's /L. It is truly the cadence of insanity. Nothing in the rift is more satisfying to me than dancing around opponents and their skillshots, laughing like a madman as they breathe in the toxic fumes. So Riot, I beseech you, when that fateful day arrives in which Singed's VO is redone, do what you can to preserve this iconic gem that you've created.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Eno","date":"2014-11-14T01:57:31.194+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noted. =)","replies":[]},{"poster":"NitroPan","date":"2014-11-14T02:24:45.101+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"(cries) That post... was... so... touching.
