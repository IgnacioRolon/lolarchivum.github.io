Those who are already logged in can still stay online, chat, and play matches if the login service is down. If they had closed League, they would then not be able to log back in. If everything was run off one **BIG** server, things would work very badly if it went down.\n\nI hope this clarified how things work for you. Btw, the login service is back up, so you can log on now. Let me know if you still have issues logging on.","replies":[{"poster":"K4YN","date":"2016-08-23T22:06:26.592+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes i know that but what i meant is everyone at the same time opened their league client cause we were all in a skype call and theres was up\n mine was down for another 2 hours","replies":[]}]}]}
