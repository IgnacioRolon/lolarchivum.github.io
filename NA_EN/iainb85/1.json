His power is shifted inconsistently in his abilities, and his theme of \"drain-tank God of War\" is muddied by balance issues. His passive GA is so strong an ability that if they gave him power elsewhere he'd be OP as hell. Even if he's meant to be a drain tank, constantly trading around health in order to survive a fight, the only way he can do this is to AA people, so basically kite him and he becomes useless, unlike all the other drain tanks in this game that can actually benefit from the different sources of healing they have. His skillshots are extremely tough to land and have horrible cooldowns, even though he relies on them incredibly in order to be effective. His Blood Well encourages tankiness but his health costs discourage it, he has the kit of a fighter needing defenses to survive but the ratios of a carry that needs a lot of late game stats to do damage (AD, crit, armor penetration) yet he doesn't scale super well with any of it. On top of it all his kit is just... bland. Q jumps on people, W heals/extra damage every 3rd hit, E damages and slows, R gives a bunch of buffs, and if you die your passive saves you (if it's up). All of this pooled together creates a clusterfuck of ideas with no direction. That is Aatrox.","replies":[{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2015-09-13T07:07:01.667+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree.

Things I could see staying mostly untouched on him are his passive and his Q.  After that, they should take a long look at his lore and modify the rest of his kit based upon that.  Aatrox is supposed to be an avatar of war who inspires army to fight back from the brink of defeat.  He cuts down mortal men by 10 at once.  If such is the case, why is the only thing that Aatrox is strong at is dueling?  \n\nHe should be a lot like Jarvan, a team-centric bruiser who dives into a fight.  He would protect his allies or slaughter his foes.  He should thrive right in the center of a fight where he can make the most use of his abilities.  That's not to say he would be a tank (far from it).  Aatrox still has an identity as a DPS fighter with potent healing.  What he needs to make use of it is proper durability and sticking power (both which he lacks currently) while still dealing reasonable damage.\n\nAatrox's current problems?  The impact of his attack speed steroids is diminished by the fact that he has two of them (and one is his R, the other is attached to Blood Well).  When he's strong he is immensely frustrating because he has no limit to his sustain on W.  He'll max E, poke you down in lane with it.  If you trade, he'll disengage with E and sustain with his W healing just by CS'ing.  What he needs is more interactivity, inherent counter-play, and in turn he gains the tools he needs to thrive.  Basically, the whole \"heal from auto-attacking\" idea is an archaic design that results in binary gameplay.  Putting a potentially huge heal onto a reasonable cooldown and adding requirements for it's usage is much healthier.\n\nI've actually theory-crafted an Aatrox rework which could solve a lot of issues with him, which I posted [here](http://www.reignofgaming.net/forums/rog-user-content/written-work/123799-concept-for-aatrox-rework).  Basically it makes him a much stronger team-fighter (and healthier drain-tank) in concept.  I left damage and healing numbers out just in the case of poorly thought-out math.","replies":[{"poster":"Balmor0","date":"2015-09-13T16:35:53.389+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is it just me or am i missing sth. but i don't get the vibe of Aatrox being a team fighting oriented.

I still think his q needs a change because 1/10 of you hp for an engage/disengage is crap. ESPECIALLY the fact that it can be inturrupted by knockup or stun, high risk, little reward.  Flat health costs are better imho than % like his w states. Secondly, his passive is still lack luster in late game, it just comes up earlier but still you die thanks to your entire team sacrificing you for the good of the team. Thirdly, he has 2 AS steroids passive and ult... which is kinda meh, because this means he can't have damage because he naturally attacks fast and that would be broken. \n\nPersonally I love Aatrox as a champ, but he needs ways to SURVIVE fights with people with pure stuns, knockups, dashes slows that are prevalent in the top lane. but changing any little thing makes him too op or not enough to make him relevent. because as is he either builds raw damage and dies in seconds, or builds tanky and can't fight anyone because the lack of damage. \n\nI say give him the Mordekaiser treatment and make him a hybrid ad bot laner, buff up his base ad, change his ratios and abilities to assist duo lanes (COUGH COUGH ULT INSPIRING like his lore ), and change his sustain.\n\nI see him more as a vlad fighter. So off the bat, SCREW the AP scalings, he needs to be AD or AP, and he really seems to dig into the AD side because Aatrox suffers from this because his ult does respectable damage, but it is just meh damage wasted unless you throw ap on him which normally gets shifty eyes all around.\n\nI propose making him with a passive that gives his blood well and ties it to an ability W. so with every hit (skill or AA) builds the bloodwell up, and like{{champion:223}}, out of combat it eats up the bloodwell for passive health regen. and w empowers the next AA and deals X damage on the next AA and only that one AA, and has 30% armor penetration for that Attack only. does not have a time limit you have to hit within x secs, but is a pure empowered hit guaranteed. Giving Aatrox a way to use his bloodwell 2 different ways, sustain while sacrificing csing or combat, or damage, giving up on the only sustain he would have now minus items. W no longer is what it was.\n\nQ, change it so that upon cast you become invincible .5 sec after cast until landing, knocking up enemies in the center and slowing on the outer edge. making it Actually reliable as an escape or engage, and if not too much to ask, make it reset on kill. because he has 0 mobilty other than it {{champion:121}}{{champion:18}}  has it, why not a top laner for once.\n\nE, i think is fairly good in all respects and doesn't need too much change, its a farm tool i always find, and poke for a melee champ.\n\nUlt HOOOO boy does it work decently at times, but in others it's just meh, instantaneous damage upon cast (AP), change to a lower ad value, Range increase fine, AS buff fine, but i would like to see if they can buff it to give him the ability to buff an ally too, jungler/support(if that were to work) through giving allies and only allies some aura that can increase either defenses, or crit chance, or something that ties into his lore inspiring people to fight on against all odds, becoming more than they normally are. Even buffing minions would be an awesome help. buffing minions isn't something that has been done really.\n\nBut Aatrox I find always seems gimped in every matchup because he is an all in champ that hurts himself to do damage, and has no survivabilty in large cc comps that are everywhere right now that easily shut him down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FluxBound","date":"2015-09-13T21:53:49.425+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aatrox at the moment is all on snowballing.

Oh and Aatrox also has another CC, which is also on a non-ult CD.\n\nThere are plenty of other differences too, but Aatrox definitely has more CC.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DirkTarTar","date":"2015-09-13T15:11:11.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aatrox has some huge glaring flaws, much of it having to do with how his kit doesn't really reflect his lore, and how his abilities are not very synergistic.\n\nWith that being said, a good player on Aatrox can do some pretty amazing things ESPECIALLY when the enemy team feels that he is a handicap champion. Aatrox is a niche pick for dive and knock-up comps and he deals a surprising amount of damage in the early part of the game. Despite his early damage, he falls off pretty hard, pretty fast due to polarized itemization requirements. \n\nHe honestly only needs a couple of small tweaks to get him into decent shape. \nOne of the big tweaks is that he needs some form of hard CC on top of his R, commonly accepted as a .5 second AoE fear (which honestly just gives him the opportunity to Q + R + AA without getting instagibbed... providing his Q actually lands)\n\nAnother tweak is that his Q animation needs to be much smoother, mostly because it doesn't have that great of range, it doesn't have great knockup or damage, and it is extremely predictable and can be countered by SOOOOO many abilities. Just simply making the animation more fluid will give him a decent boost in power because he wouldn't have that stupid \"I'M GOING TO JUMP NOW\" wind up that you can see a mile off\n\nAs for a large adjustment that needs made, his R needs to have a \"Massacre\" feel that goes in with his Lore, about him leading troops into battle. Something that benefits the TEAM as a whole like added Attack Speed, Life Steal, or Movement Speed, or when he uses his E it explodes in a burst instead of a reverse cone, basically just anything creative that makes his ult advantageous to use in a team fight because right now it is really only used to drop towers (relatively fast with your wet noodle sword) or hit your enemies super fast with your wet noodle sword.\n\n\nSpeaking of the wet noodle sword... When Aatrox drops off it is noticed as him attacking super fast but appearing to do no damage which is called \"The Wet Noodle\" effect :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shénzhì","date":"2015-09-13T09:47:28.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've made some good plays against some good players.

Seems like they just want to add more chaos to chaos making their game unmanageable, which it is already, and that's fucking stupid. **If we knew we'd be reassured** at the least and would love to contribute.\n\nOne thing in particular is the inconsistencies that this game is built upon. Many do not realize and when you do you _will_ see an absolute mess. This inconsistency, I believe is what dilutes the community and segregates 'pro players' from 'real players' creating an atmosphere of intolerance and doubt; an atmosphere of toxicity, and then they recently enforce this behavioral curfew.\n \n#What are they _not_ thinking? http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/saintsrow/images/4/44/FailFish.png/revision/latest?cb=20130820134712\n\n> While all that is happening, an updated Aatrox may be another result of failure possibly just like new Ryze (I assume).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Borbland","date":"2015-09-13T09:11:02.276+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aatrox is the guy that either feeds alot or carries alone.\n\nI saw a devourer + BotrK + Hydra + spirit visage with some tanking, he was a monster:\n\nTanky with lots of damage and so much sustain you cant imagine.
