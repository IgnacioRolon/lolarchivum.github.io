Basically I think AP Nidalee jungle is going to fall off in a few weeks time even if she doesn't get nerfed. Maybe I'll eat my words, I don't know, her win rates have gone up in the past week or so. If they do \"nerf\" anything though, ~~I think they'll just change her hunt reset passive so she can't reset her pounce multiple times in a jungle camp (killing units is probably fair game, but IIRC she can reset the pounce on hunted monsters multiple times, instead of just once per monster), since that's just abusive and I'm pretty sure isn't working as intended~~ (Edit: Either I recalled incorrectly or they stealth fixed it; tested it in a custom, it doesn't work. Watching some more videos on jungle Nidalee, the root actually prevents her from taking a lot of damage in jungle because she is ranged in her human form; basically it's a Nidalee-specific work-around to the soft-leash change they made that killed all the other ranged junglers). I honestly don't think they'll take any damage off of her, because, as you saw, her damage isn't that threatening coming from a jungle Nidalee in the mid game (early game she's got a lot of burst, but that's kind of the only window she has to snowball herself), since she's behind in gold compared to a solo laner.\n\nSven got *4 early kills* to snowball him and then what? He was basically just healing people the rest of the game. That's all AP Nidalee provides; damage, heals, and a bit of 'vision' with her traps. She's not building tanky so your team is down a traditional front liner in their jungle; even an assassin like Kha'Zix or Rengar builds tank after like two damage items, sometimes earlier. She's naturally down in gold because she's in the jungle, so her damage in the mid game isn't fantastic unless she gets insanely fed. She doesn't have any CC to set up kills for anyone other than herself. You basically have to build a team around an under-fed mid laner, because she's not going to be donating many resources (kills, farm) to her team the way other junglers can afford to, since she *needs* the gold for items to be relevant. Maybe you stall for late game for her to get full build, but then everyone on the enemy team has a Banshee's Veil and your spears are practically useless unless someone else on your team is bringing poke or something to pop the Banshee's.\n\nCouple that with the fact that she's innately difficult to play from the jungle even for pro players. Yeah, she's probably the most mobile champion in jungle in the game just because of her dash and her passive through brush, but landing a spear from the jungle into lane for a gank is one of the most difficult spears to hit (jungle -> jungle isn't bad since pathways are a bit more narrow, and if you're in lane, lane -> lane isn't bad either since you can afford to wait for a good opening, as well minions form barriers that make it easier to funnel spears around); it's traveling as slow as like a Morgana binding with like 1/5th of the hitbox; player movements are much more difficult to judge when you're coming from the side rather than coming from lane, and if you miss or you have to wait around for a good spear to line up, you're wasting a ton of time as a jungler where other junglers can just force a gank much more easily.\n\nI watch a lot of Nightblue3, and it's been annoying me lately how high he's rating Nidalee jungle because I really disagree with him; heck I've seen him play games where he gets insanely fed in the early game, and then can't do anything for the rest of the game; basically the same thing that happened to Sven in SK's game.\n\nAgain, maybe I'll eat my words, I don't know, but in my mind coming from what I understand about AP Nidalee, knowing what a mid-lane AP Nidalee is capable of and seeing what a jungle Nidalee can do, I don't see jungle Nidalee being more than a passing fad just because of how she works as a champion and how the jungle works. Sure you can probably get away with her in solo-q, but you can get away with *a lot* of things in solo q, lol.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-02-06T18:17:02.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree 100%, the only thing I will say is that this isn't entirely about Jungle Nid vs Lane Nid, it is more about Jungle Nid vs other Junglers.

I agree that right now Nid jungle isn't OP, but she is still good. She would probably become much more popular if more tank top laners were popular and more tank supports (to make up for her trying to be a carry type jungler), but for now, since that isn't the case she will just be a good pick, not an amazing pick.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-02-06T19:15:58.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I might be off on this but I honestly feel like AD jungle Nidalee is a much more long term (*not* top tier or anything, but more stable if at all) pick than AP jungle Nidalee; squishy AP junglers not named Fiddlesticks (who builds Zhonyas, can silence your entire team, and drain-tanks for days) or *maybe* Karthus (where it doesn't *really* matter if he gets blown up cause he can still cast spells when he's dead) generally have a rough time (besides them it's like, Diana, who's more of a bruiser/fighter, and like, Kayle, who's more about attack speed and on-hit damage in the current meta, and also makes a teammate invincible for a few seconds). There are some other odd ball picks (jungle Teemo, Heimerdinger), and your AP off-builds for tanky junglers (Amumu, Rammus, Zac, etc) but it's very rare for a reason I'd say. It's just awkward since AD Nidalee is much weaker than AP Nidalee overall right now.\n\n> I've seen some top notch Nid players (like RF Legendary for example) who are experienced with her already take her jungle and roflstomp everything because they do better than the other jungler.\n\nI think that's more about just being a top notch Nidalee than Nidalee actually being *especially* good in jungle. It's like bringing Lee Sin mid lane; it's a weird pick that is difficult to pull off, but if you're like, inSec or Faker (yes I've seen Faker play Lee Sin mid), you'll still crush faces. Looking at the two games we saw yesterday, we saw Sven, who's a very good player, play some pretty good Nidalee, was landing his spears, etc. and we saw Kikis, also a good player who's used to bringing out odd picks like TF or Kayle or Wukong, and I hardly saw him hit anything. To me it's like, sure, if Bischu (or again, Faker) have to fill in jungle, they can bring Nidalee now since she's playable, but I'm not going to be recommending people pick up AP jungle Nidalee as the next freelo 420 Weedwick pick, lol.\n\nLike, I've seen Faker play a lot of jungle Riven; it's not because Riven is an especially good jungler, it's because Faker is an insane Riven player that enables her to be played in jungle. Sure Nidalee has some stuff to compliment a jungle playstyle over some of these other picks (like how she can hunt monsters), but imo that doesn't suddenly make up for all the other cons in playing Nidalee in jungle.\n\nEDIT: In my mind the only thing that makes jungle Nidalee marginally better than picks like Yasuo, Zed, Riven, etc. is the fact that she has this somewhat abusive ~~reset~~ mechanic on hunted monsters, ~~which I'm pretty sure isn't working as intended (on champions you only reset once per hunted debuff); once that gets removed (which I'd be surprised if they didn't because again, doesn't seem like it's intentional)~~ (edit: I'll explain in EDIT2, lol), ~~she'll probably be just as niche if not worse than the aforementioned champions because she's innately a situational pick.~~ (edit: I'll explain in EDIT3 lmao)\n\nEDIT2: Just tested my own assumption; either I remembered incorrectly or they stealth fixed it, lol, pounce reset only works once per monster per debuff. Watching some other videos about jungle Nidalee, the root actually helps prevent her from taking too much early damage in jungle, which I just realized is basically a Nidalee-specific work around to the soft-leash changes that killed all the other ranged junglers, which I also think is unintended; I saw the root more as something to make it easier for Nidalee to pounce to jungle camps (ie they don't run out of range when you toss a max range spear from behind a wall) or just something nice that makes it easier to hit skillshots when she's clearing. I'd expect a change here if anything; assuming I'm right about my guesses for intended use, maybe make it so her spears only root monsters at \"max range\" (1300-1500, where the spears are doing max damage), so she's well outside of auto attack range and can't use it to pseudo-soft-leash, but can still run towards and pounce to a monster over a larger wall.\n\nEDIT3: While I still think she'll only really be a niche pick, I still think this AP jungle Nidalee is more a result of an abusive mechanic, and AD jungle Nidalee will be the more consistent pick if people still play her in jungle (especially if AD Nidalee gets some buffs that don't automatically make her a terror in top lane). A lot of people talk about AP Nidalee as a sleeper pick, which I'll agree with; she's situational, but can be very powerful *in the right hands*, which again, goes into the main point of this comment; I think champions like Riven or Nidalee will always be \"sleeper OP\" *in the right hands* just because they have so much outplay potential. Lord Master King just reached #1 in KR solo q as a Riven one trick pony, where Riven right now isn't exactly a high priority pick; he has a montage featuring *two* 1v1 kills on Faker's Yasuo (admittedly not his best champion, but considering how well he knows Riven and how to play against her, still very impressive). Sure they have metas where they struggle; Nidalee gets destroyed by mobile champions (ie. Fizz) since it's so difficult to hit a spear, and most other assassins, since again, mobility to dodge spears and also she's relatively weak at melee range if she can't get poke/Hunt debuff down first (if she can get poke down/Hunt debuff, she's very strong at melee range), for example. But overall point is that I think there are certain champions that, in the hands of a master, almost transcend a lot of metas because they're very dynamic as champions, and/or people who master them are just able adapt or play around different metas.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-02-05T19:35:16.083+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The main flaw in that thinking is that solo queue is dominated by singular powerful champions that don't need to work as a team.

I thought clearing 5 camps before recalling was great (most junglers only manage 3),  but seeing her do the same,  faster,  and with health leftover to gank (and get a kill) was shocking.  \n\nSo I can't say first hand if it's op as I haven't played it,  but playing against it,  she seems to be over tuned for the jungle.  Not to mention her Spears coming out of no where,  she killed me from over half health at level 5 or 6 with a spear from a Bush when I was freezing a Lane outside turret range for a teammate... and I never even saw the spear hit me, didn't get vision of it until I was dead. \n\nMight take time but seems strong","replies":[{"poster":"Futa NA Riv","date":"2015-02-06T15:17:30.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played it once, and I did pretty ok even though I'm terrible at both jungling and hitting spears, and had not played the reworked nidalee a single time before that. The sustain on first clear is ridiculous, and the speed is good as well. Ganks are meh, but if top lane is overextended just a little there's no real escape from her, and on any lane if she hits a spear the laner is practically dead. The only thing that stops her from being terribly broken is that she kind of sucks in teamfights.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dehorn","date":"2015-02-06T20:25:56.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"jungle nid 4-0 in the lcs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Killer X 12","date":"2015-02-06T19:23:30.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"J4 and Lee can kill her pretty easier if they catch her in jungle.
