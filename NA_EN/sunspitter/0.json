Why not introduce a separate ranked queue for people that will confirm there real life identity privately to you (facebook, cell phone).  Have acceptance  based on the honor system so low honor people are not allowed on.  Then allow people to build honour in normals to escape the prisoners island of a created anonymous ranked.\r\n\r\nPeople will also be wary of typing things that can come back and get them later in life.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-30T23:35:19.016+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be dead on arrival (nobody wants to go through that effort), not to mention spoofing facebook or a cellphone is incredibly easy.\n\nIncidentally LoL accounts already _do_ link to facebook.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2018-01-31T00:54:07.107+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lose lane, get stalked.

Hackers who create breaches do so to profit, so they will be looking for financial data, not social media and email accounts.\n\n2. Riot could also simply store whether or not each account is verified with a boolean rather than storing the account's identifying info.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheEvilQueen135","date":"2018-01-31T00:51:36.052+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i could see this going wrong in so many ways...","replies":[]},{"poster":"MasterDClone","date":"2018-01-31T00:08:54.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would create a lot of problems irl which would ruin league as a game with all the bad press\ncould you people knowing where someguy who trolled you lived how badly that would turn out","replies":[]},{"poster":"EL HAMSTERO","date":"2018-01-31T11:54:36.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and then punish people in game for things they say on facebook!  we can ~~ censor ~~  save the world riot!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2018-01-31T11:39:58.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an opt-in like CSGO sure.\n\nNot as a requirement though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2018-01-31T11:29:24.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But I can get a new phone or use a fake Facebook account...","replies":[]},{"poster":"greekvandaL","date":"2018-01-30T23:52:05.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"What makes you think i wouldnt troll you if you had my real ID?\n\nYou gonna come to my house and do what?
