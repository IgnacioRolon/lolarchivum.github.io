She&#039;s already really good at kiting melee champions, especially ones reliant on auto-attacks to succeed, and she&#039;s self-sufficient enough to thrive in solo-lanes better than any adc in the game, removing all her weaknesses would break her. And then she&#039;d become permaban and everyone would be crying to nerf her into oblivion and every Quinn player would receive the whole &quot;you&#039;re only playing her because she&#039;s OP!&quot; shit no matter how long we&#039;ve been playing the champion...\r\n\r\nI&#039;m hoping it&#039;ll be fine, and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll like it regardless because it&#039;s Quinn, I love Quinn, but man, a bit of the fear is still there.","replies":[]}
