Right now, many of the really powerful URF picks (with the exception of Fuckstick Ezreal) are champions with the ability to solidly shred you from long range before you can close the gap; due to the CQB nature of the Crystal Scar; those guys can't just blow you up from range as reliably as you have more bushes to take advantage of to get close without being seen. In order to really abuse those amped-up kits they NEED others nearby to defend them.\n\nIn addition, assuming the \"constant stream of gold/XP\" carries over as well, that eliminates another huge URF issue: people with solid poke comps seizing and abusing an early game lead. You can be behind a few kills without completely losing the ability to duel due to being behind.\n\nLastly (everyone's favorite aspect of Ascension) marksmen lose their mandatory status, as there aren't any objectives to worry about.\n\nThe only issue I see with URFscension is that Nunu and Ivern will be even more worthless than they already are in URF.","replies":[{"poster":"XeroKimo","date":"2018-01-03T16:11:20.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"5 tanks in urf ascension\n\nNot like this","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"YuGiHo","date":"2018-01-03T00:23:16.688+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"that actually sounds fun, so long as they disable warmong.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2018-01-03T02:14:25.472+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the most balanced game mode was dominion.

Get a small lead, snowball off of that because damage is overtuned, then activate full freight train mode to crush the opponents' base in one fell swoop. Well, yes, objectives do matter, but not in the right way. \n\n- Earth and water dragon are almost irrelevant because winning through methodically gaining small advantages/ sustained siege and attrition is not viable. \n\n- Blue only matters in the first 5 minutes of the game. Beyond 2nd blue it might as well not exist for about 90% of the champion roster. \n\n- Baron is now routinely taken at <25 minutes while that should be a massively risky proposition because teams should lack the raw dps to down it quickly enough for the other team not to notice combined with the still relatively short death timers at that point in the game. Taking Baron that easily that early in the game should only be realistically feasible if you have at least 2 earth dragons IMO.\n\n- Rift Herald is too strong. I like the concept of an earlygame toplane objective but it probably should give some different and less powerful bonus.\n\n- Smart wave/ lane management is greatly reduced in value once you get a kill advantage because having a kill advantage is too impactful.","replies":[{"poster":"nice table","date":"2018-01-03T23:24:45.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"xding intensifies, you have a point on why SR is in a shitty state right now but all of the things still require strategy. the part about earth, water dragons and blue buff are just bullshit though.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lakega","date":"2018-01-03T09:16:21.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=nice table,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9srwILEU,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2018-01-02T20:53:57.320+0000)\n>\n> i&#x27;d very much like to see someone that&#x27;s actually good at the game claim this so i could take it a little bit more seriously.\n> \n> let me get this straight, a game with 4 objectives requires more strategy than a game with 17 main objectives, multiple more smaller objectives, lane control, pathing choices, lane matchup choices ... well i could go on with this list forever.\n\nWhy you can't think for yourself? need your high elo masters to think for you?","replies":[{"poster":"nice table","date":"2018-01-03T11:20:13.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"uhhhh ... what?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Andrey0345","date":"2018-01-03T12:40:46.173+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> put SR into RGM queue\n\nThis sounds interesting","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2018-01-03T06:57:13.177+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The day Ascension becomes a regular game mode is the day SR loses 30% of its population.
