Just tried to play as AP rammus. It&#039;s always been more of fun build for RGM queue, something faster, like URF or Dominion. But i never felt so worthless in normals before. And i&#039;m sad. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m also here to share one fun fact with you. You know, before 7.10 Rammus had an 0.2 AP scaling on damage of his W? It was mentioned to be removed long time ago, but wasn&#039;t actually removed until mini rework. \r\n\r\nYou see, i really like Heimer CD changes on his spells. I like Rammus, even though his W slow is pretty stupid, and 200% turret damage when turrets are shit already is not worth it at all, i would rather have his old damage back, or at least a bit bigger. What saddens me the most is that Riot slowly removes all the thing that attracted millions of players to their game: champions that had versality and big exploration factor. Game is slowly going to the state in which 1 champion = 1 build, with really minor changes from game to game. Even more, champions share same builds so often that we might as well remove half of the items.\r\n\r\nSorry /gd/, just had to get this out of my head.","replies":[{"poster":"Colgate Gator","date":"2017-05-22T20:06:58.101+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose ~~the victims ~~ your teammates will be glad these builds died.","replies":[{"poster":"DemoGuide","date":"2017-05-22T20:23:36.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play with my friends 90% of the time, and they are fine with that.
