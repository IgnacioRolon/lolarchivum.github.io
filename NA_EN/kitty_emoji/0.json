I know it's not the best, but it hasn't failed me much so far, until just recently. The past two weeks, I've been spiking from 100, to 300, to 600 or even 900 ping consistently. I've never had that problem before. I've been using Razor's game booster for a good while now too, and yet this problem still continues for days. I've tried uninstalling things, customizing the boosting process Razor takes, etc etc. Nothing.

It says 4 packets were sent, 4 received, and 0% packetloss, so I guess that's out of the question. It also says my ping is in the 28-38ms range at the moment, so I guess it really may just be Razor after all. That's strange, it did good for me a couple months ago... oh well! \n\nI went ahead and tested avoiding using Razor through a custom and things seemed well, so I went ahead and jumped into ranked, and they were all fine for the most part. Thanks! I'll definitely be uninstalling Razor now.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}
