Sometime When I want to use the slow of {{item:3092}} a ward would come out. I am like fuck wrong number (I click the {{item:2049}}  ). Another thing is everytime i get sightstone i always forget to switch my {{item:3361}} to {{item:3364}}. I place sightstone on #5 slot so I would have situation on my third ward I would sometime accidently click #4 slot which is the trinket. So now I am stuck and if I click again with #5 my first ward would disappear. So I would go somewhere then come all the way back and place the right ward.    The shield of {{item:3190}} and the heal of  {{item:3222}}  is something I always forget to put on my adc because I am to busy using my own skills to try to save him or her. Then when I die I am like fuck I had a shield and heal. {{item:3060}} is somethign I started getting for support lulu and sometime I would forget to promote a mininion so I literally have to speed myself all the way up a lane then promote a mininon. Then go all the way back down to base to help ally. Another item I started getting is {{item:3056}} and I would have situation where my ally is diving in kills the enemy and starts running because turret is attacking him or her. I used my shield already so all I can do is watch the ally die by the turret shot. Then I just remember I had {{item:3056}}  I could of stop the turret.
