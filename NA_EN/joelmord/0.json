Both of my accounts were banned due to other people reporting me for seemingly no reason. Whether it be just a bad game and they think I am inting or due to something else. I understand the idea behind banning people for typing toxic things, but has some of these people never been on the internet?\r\n\r\n If you can't handle being called something from someone in a video game, you should stay off the internet. The internet is always going to have toxic people and people are always going to tell each other to go KTS, its just how it is. Instead of taking everything anyone says to you to heart, people need to learn to just ignore it. Banning people for things such as \"inting\" based on what other people have said about you or being banned due to someone didn't like what you said to them is just absurd.","replies":[{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2019-08-22T11:11:10.608+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JoelMord,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=XrAdrMEr,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-08-22T08:52:56.765+0000)\n>  If you can't handle being called something from someone in a video game, you should stay off the internet.\n\nThis \"argument\" works both ways.

The main difference between the internet and real life is the extra anonymity that the internet can offer. The internet is what we decide to make it; and I think people have decided they want more guidelines/social norms in place.\n\nInternet is composed or various businesses and users; and each one has authority over the domain they control. If I host a server on a game, I am absolutely allowed to control what is allowed on that server. If I decide that flipping a coin with it landing on its side means you have to leave, then I can make you leave. If I decide that I don't want people joking about rape and somebody jokes about it, I can make them leave.\n\n\"It is the Internet\" is becoming less of a valid argument to be an ass. More and more places seem to be taking the route of \"if you wouldn't do/say it to a stranger in front of a crowd; don't do it\".

When someone attacks them or someone/something they care about they feel the need to defend themselves by lashing out. While there are some merits to defending what you believe in, most people just end to take it too far and wind up in worse situations than they were before. Well there's that, and I think it's also because at times it's hard to simply just ignore the hecklers and move on, and eventually they just get fed up enough where they retaliate when they normally wouldn't.\n\nThat's just how I see it anyways, though I do have to admit that I'm sure we're all guilty of having done one or more of the things I highlighted here at some point or another (I know I am).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Gray Wind","date":"2019-08-22T16:18:32.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are the person you are talking about in your OP dude, you can't handle having people say things so you freak out.

Too many bad experiences can drive customers and players away, so it's actually in Riots best interest to remove those who are more interested in harassing others and being unsportsmanlike than they are in actually playing the game itself and being sportsmanlike.\n\nSimply put if you feel Riot doesn't care simply because they won't let you verbally abuse and harass others and get away with it then you need a reality check as more and more game companies and communities are following Riot's example.","replies":[{"poster":"The Gray Wind","date":"2019-08-22T16:02:47.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Truth.
