Someone tell me why Zed starts with higher hp 584 as opposed to Sions 542.64 and has a higher hp stat growth of 85 over Sion 73. His armor growth is also higher at 3.5. Sion has higher starting Attack damage at 68 growth is 4 as opposed to Zeds 63 and +3.4. Should we be building Tank Zed with Titanic Hydra? Instead of all of the armor pen items? Should it be hydra gage the pen. Item with hp that 800hp item and the deadman plate? Or what?\n* {{item:3814}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3083}} ","replies":[]}
