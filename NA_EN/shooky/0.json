My ping is fine, internet all fine and dandy. All of a sudden, I DC. So I assumed my internet just spazzed out at that moment. So I went to restart the client to get back into the game. But on the client there is NO reconnect button. It looked normal, I mean, as if I were never in a game. I check OP.GG and it says I'm still in the match. I don't know how to get back into my current game... so I just.. now I'm in champ select for a new game.\r\n\r\nTHIS ISN'T EVEN A LIE. I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS EVEN HAPPENED. I JUST CAN'T GET BACK INTO MY FIRST GAME SO now I'm in a new one.

It's hard to tell, though, without more info about the match itself.  If you're specifically getting your info from a third party site, just be cautious.  The information on there might be inaccurate or out of sync, and not something we support.  Hope that helps clear things up.","replies":[]}]}
