I have been experiencing problems with the game. The HUD won't stop constantly flickering. What I mean by that is that it keeps disappearing and reappearing every 0.5 seconds. Not only is it annoying, but it drops my frames from 60 to 14 at times, and the health bars of every champion flicker too, so I cannot determine their health accurately. I am using a Lenovo Y500 gaming laptop and I looked up other situations out there and apparently the issue was that there were two graphics cards running. I have SLI off and one graphics card running only, so that can't be the problem. I tried every setting on the game, V-Sync, borderless, windowed, and every quality between lowest and highest... still nothing seems to work. It is very annoying and it ruins my performance on the game. I don't think this is a laptop issue because everything was perfect until the new windows update.\r\n\r\nI am currently running on a Nvidia GeForce GT 650M processor.\r\n\r\nHopefully there's a fix without replacing something in my laptop.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n{{champion:103}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-15T18:32:19.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a very strange issue that might be caused by bad game files or even a driver issue.
