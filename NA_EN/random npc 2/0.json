I m not a really good player but i m not that bad, so i said to myself \r\n\r\n\"There is no way i can lose vs someone in the same elo as me like that!\"\r\n\r\nI checked his profile, he wasn't used to win that much, he barely played Vlad too... and his recent matches were crazy good... also, he is lower elo, while I m Plat V he was Gold 3... so i guess, this is Elo Boosting, someone, not the original owner of that account is playing for him...\r\n\r\nI dont care smurfs that beats me, but if someone scales into high elo, when the original owner comes back, we know what will happen... so, can someone tell me what to do against those kind of people ?\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-24T00:39:19.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you ever feel like someone is boosting/boosted, feel free to hit that report button and just fill out the bottom letting us know what you're thinking and why.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Man In Sky","date":"2017-10-23T19:08:24.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"admit u got rekt lmfao","replies":[]}]}
