It's just as big as any other game out there. I have a terrabyte of hard-drive, I thought you could never use that much in your life as I lived before floppy discs.

It really sucks that it's been taking so long for it to download, but if you're trying to download 5GB of data with only 100kb/s download speed then it will probably take quite awhile. I definitely don't want you using up all of your own data *just* trying to download the game, so (if you're on a laptop) maybe you could use something like a pc cafe or a library to get the game downloaded first.","replies":[]}]}
