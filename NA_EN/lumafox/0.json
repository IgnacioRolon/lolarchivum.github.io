As an ekko main, it threw me off the entire game because I wasn&#039;t sure if I was hitting something at all. I feel like since he is a popular enough pick (for the most part) that you guys could fix the bug easily/quickly. it&#039;s not a huge bug, but still extremely annoying especially for such a heavily used ability.","replies":[{"poster":"blessthekellen","date":"2016-03-28T02:30:38.535+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Been reported a few days ago along with many other 6.6 bugs. It feels like Riot took the weekend off because no issues major or minor have been paid attention to.\n\nUs mac users are still being told \"just disable all sounds\" to stop our FPS from dropping down to 1 frame per second.","replies":[{"poster":"Lumafox","date":"2016-03-28T03:48:39.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"got it. Thanks! I wasn't sure if someone reported it, but I didn't want to go back and look through so many threads to check. \nBut that's crazy! It's understandable today though considering that it's Easter but this weekend definitely feels ignored. I'm not too sure if they are releasing Urf on the 1st, but let's hope that they fix all the bugs when that comes out","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-28T17:16:00.418+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I've mentioned above, a lot of Rioters have the weekend off, especially those in the creative space (skins, champions, etc.). That's usually why you see a lack of red posts, unless something blows up! \n\nWe won't be releasing URF on April 1st, as a heads up.
