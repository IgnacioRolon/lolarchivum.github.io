Ten minutes later the game goes back to the client and I end up losing 7 lp because of this. Is this a bug?

If the game continued on without you joining, it would have marked you AFK which will still make you lose LP regardless of if your team won or lost. \n\nIf this is happening more than just that one time, I want to go ahead and try troubleshooting this to help you make sure it doesn't happen again, or at least not as often.
