I don't have any news on when it will make an appearance, but you can stay up to date through the [client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards.  In the meantime, you can play rotating game mode through the legacy client:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nHope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
