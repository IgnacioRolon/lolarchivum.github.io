Those recovery agents will be able to verify you as the creator with a few questions regarding activity on the account, and after they'll help you get back in and correct any damage the hacker might have done.","replies":[{"poster":"Crippled Satan","date":"2017-11-28T04:34:39.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, I signed into my second account since I can’t access the other now, literally happened yesterday some time.

Hopefully it won’t actually take that long. I dunno if the ticket I’ve submited will be addressed at the “my tickets section” or the email I used to get the confirmation for the ticket being submitted.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wulfjob","date":"2017-11-28T02:54:08.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It’s this wulfjob account, I’m using my phone because it has automatic access somehow","replies":[]}]}
