MS is a disease that damages the coating around your nerves and spinal cord and it sort of short circuits them. I won't go greatly into detail about it but if you want to learn more about it just go to Wikipedia. Now Josh was one of the players that got me into LOL but his condition has since worsened and he is no longer able to really play LOL. Mentally he is unaffected by his disease and physically he appears to be capable of playing almost any game out there; LOL offers some unique challenges that I hope can be addressed so he can continue to play a game he loves.\r\n\r\n     The key problems of LOL for Josh are threefold and all of them really deal with his eyes ( these are ordered from least important to most )\r\n1) it is too sparkly. Josh's eyes have been ruined a good bit by his MS and he has trouble tracking things on screen with all the flashy things going around.\r\n2) the cursor is too small. Josh loses track of his cursor during anything hectic\r\n3) the game is, in general, too fast. this is the most important and honestly (i am not a programmer so i could be horribly wrong) i think it would be the easiest to fix.\r\n\r\n     To be clear i am not asking for changes to all of league of legends for one guy. I was hoping that there could be something in the options or custom match setup that could be altered to be MS friendly.\r\n\r\n-fferritt","replies":[{"poster":"DeClawd","date":"2016-02-09T18:08:33.036+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello! I have Primary Progressive MS, and am having more & more difficulty playing LoL myself, but for a different reason; my hand dexterity and mobility are most affected. I have no vision problems yet (knock on {{champion:57}}  )  but can attest to the compassion and unity of the League of Legends community and Riot Games. We'll find a way to play the game we love! Feel free to add me in game (have Josh do so too) if you like, but I will reach out to the Trinity Force Network and see if anyone has any ideas.

I occasionally suffer from eye strain, nothing to the level of what your friend may go through I'm sure, during game play. There is a program that has become pretty popular among gamers called F.Lux which allows your monitors color settings to adapt to the time of day. This has been suggested as a free, program alternative to Gunnar's glasses. Not sure if it will help you, but it's worth a try. Good luck mate! Here's the link: https://justgetflux.com/\n\nAlso: May want to check this out as well.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2uh8pc/change_your_in_game_cursor_solved/","replies":[]},{"poster":"fferritt","date":"2016-02-10T02:24:23.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey guys thanks a lot for the responses, this is honestly a lot more than i thought i would get. gives me hope for the LOL community.","replies":[{"poster":"DeClawd","date":"2016-02-10T13:56:29.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope the suggestions help.

I hear the semi-locked camera doesn't really work, but It could help narrow down the information your friend needs to see by keeping the focus on his champion. \n\nFor the cursor, there aren't any settings or variables that allow you to change the cursor AFAIK. I think you can still edit your cursor appearance if you have the right cursor editing tools. \n\nThere is also the possibility if you disable the League of Legends cursor and use just the pointer, and then in the OS cursor options make the cursor itself bigger. I don't know if the size will carry over to League though. \n\nThe cursor can be made visible on Mac from (system preferences -> accessibility -> display -> cursor size)\non windows I think if you just go to the mouse settings in control panel there should be a size slider. \n\nAgain, I dont know if the cursor size transfers over to league.\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Doomspikinator","date":"2016-02-09T19:30:25.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually have a lot of issues with blurriness due to my astigmatism, so I have mine setup use semi-locked. What I did was change the camera lock toggle to space and then I lock/unlock the camera as needed. If I'm just roaming through jungle or in a teamfight, it helps me a ton personally.

First off, I do not have any vision issues, but i find color blind mode much easier on the eyes for making distinctions. So recommend starting with that.\n\nDisabling shadows and the advanced effects from the in game settings may help with the 'sparkly' too flashy thing. I imagine the less going on, the better. \n\nI don't know if enabling \"character inking\" would help or hurt. In theory it may since it creates a black outline on champions [if I am not mistaken]. So maybe would help with distinctions or losing track of champion.\n\nAlso: I wonder if there are any settings on the GRAPHICS CARD level. I know on all the nVida/ATI cards their control center has a litany of settings I have never touched. Adjusting hue and interlacing things may help. But it may be a slow trial & error task to see what helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Adminymous","date":"2016-02-09T14:53:18.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you adjusted the HUE/BRIGHTNESS? specificly for league in video card options. NOt globably \"which means everything\"? THat should dull down some things. As far as the mouse goes. Ill take a look inside my league installation to see if i can find the .INI for the mouse. Maybe I can pinpoint it and write a batch file to replace it with a bigger version of the same thing. My father was disabled. He watchs me play. Ill see what I can do.
