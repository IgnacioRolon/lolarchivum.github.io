There isn't much school clothing that has that much detail from the sailor outfit. I get that's what the school clothing is based on but they don't really put so much of it at least as far as I can tell. I don't see those sailor's shoulder pads in school outfits (No, not the golden shoulder pad on Riven's left shoulder. I mean the shoulder pad on her right shoulder). And I don't think the average school girl would where those types of heels and have a sailor hat with an anchor design on it. Riven looks more like a young adult, and magical girls are typically teenage looking (Not to mention 14 years old according to Doug Walker's research on Sailor Moon).\n\nPlus the background makes her look like a Naval Commander. Unless you could add some school elements into the background. The naval ship alone just brings the whole idea out of place. Maybe lean the background design towards the magical girl theme and maybe it will look more like a magical girl. Japanese School Background? Sparkling dust patterns? Femalish coloring? Maybe one of those.","replies":[{"poster":"Neamean","date":"2015-07-14T08:15:33.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes this art is not Star Guardian but it is close that why i posted as Star Guardian and if Riot create this they never just straight up copy one art they would gather other resource that have Magical Girl theme so if it where to be made it would look very different. \n\nThe first time i saw this fan art i instantly thought of Star Guardian but I know that its not exactly Star Guardian level but with a few changes like you said remove the hat or change the background it might resemble it more. Also I do not think the original artist wanted to implied that this is Star Guardian but Naval Commander it even says at the bottom Navy Riven \n\nTo sum thing up, yes, the are does not resemble Star Guardian Riven but it is close enough that i wanted to share this art which is good on its own as Navy Riven but close enough that thought that with a few tweak it can become Star Guardian Riven","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-07-14T08:02:30.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By this we can add to Star Guardian even the new GP.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Luckyghost91","date":"2015-07-14T13:25:46.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone got a bucket i'm drooling puddles over here!
