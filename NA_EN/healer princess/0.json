Soraka literally fits the Star Guardian theme more than anyone because she's the starchild anyway.\n\nThe only reasons why I see why this happened is because of the typical Ahri favouritism or just for the Ahri fanbase, the amount of skins Ahri has is more than any other champion at this point. Looking at fan bases Yasuo's and Riven's for example they both have only 4-5 skins yet Ahri has 7.","replies":[{"poster":"JAGL Aqua","date":"2017-09-12T19:36:15.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apparently if someone gets an 1820 skin, they need to have an unexpected or new theme that doesn't rely on their base theme.
