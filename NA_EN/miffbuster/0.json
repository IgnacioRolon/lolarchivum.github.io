In custom queues it is fine but in normal's queue the base skin is called \"Desperada Cassiopeia\". However when i was testing it in a custom game it worked and i got to use one of the Chroma's colours in game. During the normals game i did not have the option to select a chroma but in-game i was using the chroma i had selected during my custom game test. Also i can't figure out how to put captures onto this comment sorry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miffbuster","date":"2016-03-26T00:40:59.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem appears to have fixed itself, but thank you anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-24T18:33:57.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Miffbuster - \n\nThanks for the report! \n\nWhich queue are you in?
