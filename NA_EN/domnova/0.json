So ad sion is better than ap sion and nerf his ap scaling and make it really bad so people cant go ap sion any more and make him ad sion only. If that would be dont then sion would just be a weaker version of riven because u could just go damage.","replies":[{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2014-05-29T06:57:53.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, that's what we're doing! We're also giving him all new abilities because, to be frank, \"click and dude and he gets stunned\" isn't the most exciting thing in the world.","replies":[{"poster":"Morningbell","date":"2014-05-29T07:07:45.030+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sure you can't really talk at length, but are there ANY aspects of the kit you plan on keeping?

Will he actually feel like Sion anymore or just look like him. Not actually complaining as his current kit is extremely flat in terms of interesting interactions. The issue is that it has been around for such a long time that any big changes are likely not going to go over very well with his playerbase.\n\nI am rather surprised that this rework is so incredibly hush hush as well for that very reason. With how some of the reworks have been accepted I would think that getting it right would be important this time around. Only getting feedback from your internal resources (which I imagine is more than just fellow Riot employees) with regard to potential changes has not had the best track record. It is about time some light gets shed on Sions progress so that his players can be ready for what is to come. Otherwise the likelyhood they will rise up in revolt is going to be pretty high if it gets sprung on them without warning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garentheon","date":"2014-05-29T07:13:03.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you don't have t go into but can you tell us your personal opinion  on the new look","replies":[]},{"poster":"KSHarrison","date":"2014-05-29T07:10:14.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Zenon, if you get time, I'd be super flattered if you took a gander at my thread [here](http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/yNwYu7qu-sion-kit-and-lore-reconceptwarning-lore-is-appropriately-dark).
