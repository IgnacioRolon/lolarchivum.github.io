Yes some of this was in response to what other people I won't say what they said cause it doesn't matter just want to know what anyone thinks what was banned this game. (I did not int this game and didn't give up).\nThank you for your time.\nSincerely a banned jungler\n\nEdit:So maybe could somebody say what was the trigger word was because that is how the in-client report system works cause none of these words would be picked up by the system. i.e calling somebody bad isn't ban able nor is calling someone a troll ","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2019-09-20T22:53:42.294+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was going to start quoting, but I see support did it for you.
