What happens if you try another keyboard entirely?  There could also be drivers for your keyboard, that could potentially contribute.  See if there are any that can be updated, and run through our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide as well to help rule out other possibilities.  Test it in a custom game and let me know if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Kurrionser","date":"2017-10-12T16:21:23.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When i use my integrated keyboard on laptop i get barely get any fps drops it works fine, but when i use mechanical keyboard it just drops insanely fast.
