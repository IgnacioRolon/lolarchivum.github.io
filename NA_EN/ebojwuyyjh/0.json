I am really sorry and I think I should be fully responsible for that.  I am a foreigner who came to United States three years ago, and English is not my language. I have been trying very hard to learn this language. Yet I didn't understand the homophobic word I was using is that offensive and untolerable  until now as I have seen and heard people using that word in my daily life. I didn't intent to use that word to targeting anybody for their sexual orientation. I feel responsible for my behavior and I would gladly accept and any other punishments other than permanently ban. I like this game. I have invested a lot of time and money into this game (I know this does not justify what I did).   I have been a good player for most part of my past three years. I have never received any punishment in league of legends prior to this one, not even chat/ranked restriction. I found this post written by one of the riot employee \"punishments for negative behavior in League should accomplish three things: Encourage moderately or occasionally negative players to reform,Shield players from negative experiences, and Remove players who wonâ€™t reform from League.\" . I think myself as a \"occasionally negative players,\" and I don't think I am hopeless. I promise you that I will reform. I am usually very good at restrain myself, but I had a terrible day that day and was drunk and sleepless at 8 AM when I played that Game. Now I look back, I find my chat logs for that game was very disturbing and bad, filled with constant insult and repetitive usage of aforementioned homophobic words. I do understand my behavior in that  game is punishable/up to the standard by permanently banned, but I just hope I could have another chance to redeem myself. Now I have looked through a lot of posts online and had a better understanding of the tribunal system.  I just wish someone from Riot can take another look into my case, and take the clean record of my past games into consideration, so I can learn from my mistakes and improve from there. Don't abandon me riot please! \r\n\r\nI am truly sorry!\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nCasterly Rock (Go Lannisters!)","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2018-05-01T18:35:04.190+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in video games, it's not the case for old forum threads.

The other is the belief that a race is inferior. \n\nNothing about the word misogynist is explicitly applied towards men. The only type of person misogynist applies to is, well.. someone who believes one gender (women in this case. Misandry is the other version) is inferior to the other.\n\nNothing about the word racist is explicitly applied towards one race. The only type of person racist applies to is, well... someone who believes one race is superior to the others.\n\nNow, these are the textbook definitions of the words. There's no debate about who they apply to. \nIf you want to see the difference, lets glance at the history of the word f!@#$%.\n\nIt originally meant a bundle of sticks, typically used to light a pyre when burning witches back in ye olde days. Back then, homosexuals where seen as soo inferior that they didnt even deserve their own pyre. They were simply tossed in with the kindling, or f!@#$%s, as it was called back then. Which is, oddly enough, where we get the term flaming f!@#$%. \n\nSo, one word is used to describe a person who is so worthless that they should be burned with kindling, while the other two words are used to describe someone who has a superiority complex and believes themselves better than (insert race, gender, etc). \n\nSo, to sum it all up for you. Misogynist is some one who engages in hate speech/actions towards women, misandrist is someone who engages in hate speech/actions towards men, and homophobe is someone who engages in hate speech/actions towards lgbtq+ people.\n\nNone of these words are bannable, because they aren't inherently linked to hateful actions or words. They are words used to describe someone who hates someone.\n\nF!@#$%, on the other hand, is used to describe someone so base, so lesser than you, that they deserve nothing more than to be added to the kindling pile and burned.\n\nNow, make sense?","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-03-10T14:49:41.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BA Tetsuo,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=HZAhPr6E,comment-id=00070000000000040000000000000001,timestamp=2016-03-10T13:10:20.105+0000)\n>\n> Now one of those is the belief that a gender is inferior.

The rest of your post was strawman and fluff nonsense.\n\nBut let me present my argument again since you seem to have been unable to understand in previous instances; The word \"Misogyny\" is an slur used almost exclusively against men fueled by actual hatred (Misandry, often by feminists), it should be punished just as severely as other slurs against large swaths of people (Ex: The \"N\" word or [**Bundle of sticks**] ).\n\nYour argument, which is pure garbage, is that \"Misogyny\" can be used on women. By your incredibly [**Insert bad word here**] logic ; The \"N\" isn't hatred because sometimes its used on non-black people. That is not an excuse nor is it a defense. \n\nIt's really not that complicated. All slurs against large swaths of people fueled by hatred = Hate speech, all hate speech should be punished equally because, and stay with me here, the rules should apply equally to all. Whether it's a homosexual man saying \"Catholicism is for idiots\" , a feminist saying \"Kill all men\" , a black man saying \"You are a [**Bundle of sticks**]\", or even people like me (Hispanic men) that say , I don't know \"All people who use strawman arguments are [**Insert forbidden word here**]\".... point being everyone is subject to the rule of law, no one is above the law.\n\nOnce again; The rules should apply evenly to everyone. \nNo exceptions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Myrmiron","date":"2016-03-09T20:56:56.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Does the system differentiate between simply saying \"fggot\", and saying for example \"all fggots should an hero\"?\nWhat's the difference you may ask?

Saying \"you act like a gay person and that's a bad thing!\" isn't much better than \"you are a gay person and that's a bad thing!\".\n\nUsing minority slurs in contexts like that is something that developed from hate. Every time you use the word \"fggot\" as an insult, you're using a homophobic slur.

The words are functionally very different as insults. \"Bitch\" is an insult exclusively targeted at women but it's used for specific women (i.e. ones you find unpleasant), whereas \"%%%got\" is used for... any gay person, regardless of any other traits they have. To clarify, if you're calling someone a \"bitch\" you're saying that they're a woman and that they're an unpleasant person for some other reason (i.e. maybe they're very aggressive or rude). When you call someone a \"%%%got\" you're saying that they're unpleasant simply because they're gay, or in the \"stop being a %%%got and running away!\" sense, that they're unpleasant because they're similar to a gay person.\n\nTo be a \"%%%got\", you only have to be gay. To be a \"bitch\", you (usually) need to have actual negative characteristics outside of your gender. Do you see the difference?","replies":[{"poster":"Myrmiron","date":"2016-03-10T20:34:34.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you're saying but for me \"btch\" and \"fggot\" both don't imply \"annoying woman\" and \"gay person\" but the traits associated with the 2 words.\nI don't care about a words origin when using it.

I see people calling others the N-Word or using homophobic slurs all the time.  I always report it and I know for a fact these people never got banned.
