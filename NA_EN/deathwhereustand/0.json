My computer is also fine because I can play high intensity games and max them out without an issue (I'm getting a good 500 frames in league still even though I obviously don't need it.) To shorten or simplify this post, I'm wondering if the servers have changed at all, and if there's a way, whether or not the severs have changed, to fix my predicament. \r\nThank you for any insight towards this problem!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-21T15:57:25.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rineyy provided some good steps to start with. I'll also mention that inconsistencies in latency (ping) are generally caused by changes in ISP routing that create longer paths to the server. Because servers are in different geolocations, it's possible to have a great connection to one server but not another. If the basic troubleshooting guide Rineyy linked doesn't cause any noticeable change for you, I strongly recommend [reaching out to our tech specialists](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) as Rineyy had suggested. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-21T08:29:55.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The servers were upgraded yesterday, which can be a possible cause in the increase but you stated this has been happening for the past few days so that probably isn't the case for you.\n\nFirstly; [Troubleshoot your connectivity issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj\n\nIf you continue to experience an increased ping;\n\n\nDrop a line with Riot’s [Technical Support Centre](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=34190)\n\n\n* The primary category has already been chosen. \n\n\n* For the secondary category, select **I’m lagging more than normal**\n\n\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HCCc9VGLMBs/VvGim_HT2MI/AAAAAAAA5EU/CQi6aIgFrm0rtxw5hZl4Al3mMP3k3JAyg/s1600/Lissandra_Splash_3.jpg\n\n\n\n[Need help obtaining logs?
