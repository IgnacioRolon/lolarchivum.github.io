I can download patches, enter the client, the store, and even enter matchmaking and go through all of champ select with no issues. Strangely though, when the client goes away and the game starts to load (right when the League of Legends logo appears on screen then your screen fades to black to enter the loading screen), right after the screen goes to black, the game kicks me from the loading screen and I get a bugsplat message. I'm still able to use the client as normal, it doesn't crash. I'm only not able to connect to a match.\r\n\r\nI think it most likely has something to do with my school's wireless settings. First I tried disabling my firewall, then loading into a custom game. No luck. Then I tried using a VPN, then a custom game. Same result. I used a wired ethernet connection (in my room) afterwards, and that worked fine. I loaded into a game normally, and had great ping. Any idea what could be the cause? I can provide more information as needed.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n- Gator Raid","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-09T16:46:15.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In general, you can have issues with your connection due to the volume of people on your network as well as being on wireless.  Your campus may also have security blocks that can slow you down, in which case you may want to talk to your campus IT about.  Regardless, it actually sounds like your issue might possibly be with outdated drivers or bad game files.
