I can open up the patcher just fine, but when I click the orange launch button the beta client refuses to launch. It won't crash, but after I hit launch it will take the patcher away like normal and I will be left waiting for the client itself to launch. I have waited upwards of two hours before. Unfortunately the client never launches and I have to end through task manager and go back to legacy. What's going wrong?\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-06T23:07:05.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be a change in your settings that's not allowing the updated client to launch.
