If you're looking for people to play with I highly recommend the Chaos Vanguard.\n\nEssentially the Chaos Vanguard (CV) is a multi-gaming community for Europe and NA that aims to provide a fun and safe environment for players. We have a large website and teamspeak, and we try to host daily events for you to be able to play with people such as aram inhouses, hide and seek, defend soraka bot etc. We've also got tournaments with giveaways as well as organized ranked teams. If you ever get bored of league you could just jump down to one of our different sections for games such as counter strike, heroes of the storm, warframe and smite. Competitive teams also get their own channels on our teamspeak.\n\nLemme know what you think :D\n\nYou can find us at:\n\nWebsite: http://thechaosvanguard.co.uk/ \nTeamSpeak: ts3.thechaosvanguard.co.uk","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrIEnzy","date":"2015-05-13T20:42:27.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summoner Name: Mrienzy\nTimezone: EST\nBest Contact Method: Skype\nRank: Plat 3\nMost Proficient champions: Kalista Lucian Urgot Corki Sivir Jinx","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Longest Lamp","date":"2015-05-13T19:30:26.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zergling x3","date":"2015-05-13T15:05:33.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"s4rry\nEST\nSkype or CV\nDiamond V\nAll Adcs except urgot","replies":[]},{"poster":"1KxExq0z4a","date":"2015-05-13T12:29:19.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summoner Name: Ashkani PH\nTimezone: 3am - 8am PDT weekdays/ all day weekends\nBest Contact Method: Skype\nRank: Plat V\nMost Proficient champions: {{champion:429}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:18}}","replies":[]}]}
