Of course, it still takes time for players to figure out how to play him most efficiently.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I have noticed has to do with his ultimate. More specifically, when you swipe minions using it, but they don't hit a wall, the damage seems lagged. They fly towards the direction, hit nothing, move for a second, and THEN take the damage. I have had situations where I use my ultimate on before I run out of rage, they fly the specific direction, and then my teammate uses an AoE and kills all of them. I believe that this damage should be immediate, and it almost ALWAYS throws me off. It seems like a desync, like something is wrong with my game. I know this isn't a severe issue, but it is noticeable for me, especially since I only play Gnar.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for listening, and if you'd like I can take a video or something to detail the precise issue I am referring to.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2014-09-25T21:58:25.854+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would very much love a video of this. A Rioter on my team has played Gnar pretty much exclusively as well, but hasn't noticed the issue you are mentioning. I would very much like to see more information to see if this is actually an issue, or if this is a symptoms of connection issues on your end.\n\nThanks again for the report!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gnargles","date":"2014-09-26T01:00:19.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've created the video, not sure how to share it with you. I can screencap it though to show a frame by frame explanation :)\nAfter looking at it, I believe the issue here is \"fluidity\". I feel like the damage should apply as soon as they hit impact- the damage is immediately applied for targets that hit a wall. But when they hit nothing but the ground, there is a little halt in the damage application.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/7Z9CO1k.jpg - Here is the first image, it is right before I am going to ult.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bJ5xXni.jpg - Ulting!\nhttp://i.imgur.com/N8HbxlX.jpg - Damage particles are gone, they've already hit impact and moved as far as they're going to, still no damage\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ISLTbO9.jpg - Still no damage\nhttp://i.imgur.com/hFs5Jmn.jpg - Yay damage! ..Awkwardly a second after the impact and cooldown has already started.\n\nThat's all, it just seems like the damage should apply the same as it should when you hit a wall, instantly, and satisfying like that.

I think one highlighting success of these new boards is how active Riot is on them :) And I'd love to meet the Rioter who plays Gnar pretty much exclusively!! \n\nTo be honest, I feel like there has to be something not accounted for, maybe the direction path the minions were going and how it has to redirect them? Whatever it is, it doesn't happen all the time. It seems to happen only to minions, with champions the damage is always applied immediately. Since I'm home now, I'll take a video right away :) Thanks again for the reply!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gnargles","date":"2014-10-22T03:45:19.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why must Gnar be in such a sad state??\n-Trying to do your Q while doing Hop will give you a 50-50 chance of the boomerang flying off in a random direction\n-Gnar's ultimate isn't consistent with hitting walls vs. hitting nothing\n-Gnar's Hop seems pointless in general, no avoiding damage even though it seems like you'd totally get away, and you'll still run into things like Rammus while jumping over him\n\nToo many concerns with Gnar, Riot.\n\nToo many concerns.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gnargles","date":"2014-10-21T06:45:18.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Still nothing..Still clunky","replies":[]}]}
