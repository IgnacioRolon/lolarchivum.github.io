Given how slow and fragile she is I don't think it would be too much. But I'm not nearly clever enough to know anything about champ balancing, I just thought I'd chime in since Zyra is one of my favourite champs.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AdanChristo","date":"2015-08-31T19:27:42.426+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sona is love, Sona is life, when is she going to be fixed?","replies":[]},{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2015-08-31T15:19:56.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Her plant AI for sure needs to be updated and a tweak to her passive because of the long delay.
