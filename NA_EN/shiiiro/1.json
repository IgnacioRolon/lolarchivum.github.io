Her damaging spells can be mantra'd to let her heal, her defensive spells can be mantra'd to let her deal damage. I also think she needs to be able to store at least two mantra charges at a time, since right now her choices are kinda boring (are you in a teamfight with a lot of AoE damage or need a lot of speed, E. If you're dueling, W. Otherwise, Q) and extra charges would allow for 'do I want to wait for my cooldown to use a single mantra twice, or choose a suboptimal mantra just so I can get it off before I die?'\n\nThe next bit is pretty thematic over gameplay, but I really think her passive should be moved to a passive on her ultimate, and she could get a new passive. Focused on the idea of 'what goes around comes around', I think she should be the AP version of Olaf or something, gaining extra effects on her abilities at lower amounts of health, encouraging her to play a risky game instead of just sit back and poke all day.\n\nHer Q is also pretty boring, too. Maybe make it a cone? Aren't enough cones in the game, in my opinion. And maybe let her W be cast on allies, too, so that they could get a speed boost or something.\n\nYes I'm aware this joke took way too much time.

She had a lot of unique mechanics — a tethered AOE, a %missing heal, charges on her ult, and of course her power gain as her health got lower — and they came together to create a playstyle that was very different from other supports and mages. Getting pushed more in that direction could only help, because the current Karma feels kind of bland.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-08-13T18:09:54.198+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss the duality old karma had on her mantra's pre-rework. I think karma worked well as an ult-less champ that had solid normal spells.\n\nHer mantra's didn't simply add power to her mantra'd ability, but rather changed how you used it. Mantra Q went from pure offense to offense/defense with the added heal. Mantra E went from pure defense to offense/defense with the added sheild bomb (one of my most favorite aspects of her kit btw. It's so satisfying to nuke an entire team fight for 800 dmg while providing an ally with an 800 hp shield)\n\nThe way old AP karma mid worked felt like that of an army general. She'd sit in the middle of the fight, but she **controlled** the fight by chosing who lived, who died, who your team focused, who your team proected etc. Old karma's kit was great for that because of the slow on her W, the general purpose dps on her Q, and the strong shield on her E. (with max cdr all of these had great cd's) But new karma is more 'meh' at it. Sure she can do the job, but there are other champs that are better in slot than her atm. And new karma just doesn't really direct the flow of battle nearly as much due to her weak shields and very squishy nature of mage build. Sure you could play support and build utility, but then your shields are even weaker and you have no appreciable damage.\n\nSo I guess in short, to make karma better doesn't mean \"revert rework\" but bring what made old karma good **into** the reworked karma. Focus on her ability to dictate a battle as a leader, not someone that supports from the back lines or does nothing but contribute damage from mid-range, rather consistently micromanages both her team and the enemy to exploit ever advantage possible.\n\nFor example, I think Mantra Q needs help. Going from damage -> MOAR DAMAGEZ just doesn't fit her duality concept. Likewise, her current E does the same. It goes from defense -> MOAR DEFENSE! by the way of multiple shields and a haste. I feel that out of all her spells, Karma's W is the only one that really fits this thematic, going from damage -> damage + heal. Sadly, her W is very niche, and with only 1 mantra to use at any given time, she's forced to choose something else because the situation demands more damage or more defense, and very rarely needs the duality that her W provides. (that's not to say her W is bad, it's actually very good and great for baiting the enemy in skirmishes)\n\nSadly, I do not have a suggestion on how to solve her Q, but I do have some thoughts about karma's E. Presently, her E feels very lacking in defense due to the raw shield being limited due to how super powerful the haste aspect is. And mantra E is held back even further by the fact that it provides AoE shields.\n\nStrike that, I have a great idea for her Q. Remove the delay'd damage aspect, and have the AoE explosion size increase greatly, the explosion leaves behind an area that increases all ally movespeed while slowing all enemies in that area. This way karma can more effectively peel for allies that out range her snare and heals.\n\nNow that Karma has a team haste on her Mantra Q, we can remove the haste from her shield and beef up that raw shield value. And Mantra E can now have it's 1:1 shield to damage nuke back.\n\nI'm aware that I'm lacking a lot of the internal data reguarding Old and New karma, and I'm not a game designer by any stretch, but I'd say this would be a good starting point if one were to seriously take a swing at improving how karma functions atm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shiiiro","date":"2015-08-13T17:09:09.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lgNZBkKv,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-13T05:53:36.581+0000)\n>\n> I don't know that there's currently a plan to look at Karma again, but really that just means she's not scheduled for a big update, and something smaller is possible.

But missing a R+Q because you get minion blocked can be very annoying, it would be cool if R+Q changed the skill into a area of effect you could simply place somewhere. Still with the same travel time and such but just not blocked by anything. That would work much nicer. Would also keep the enemy on their toes more as long as your ult is up knowing you can get to them throe their minions. Plus you can still farm minions with it, probably even better.\n\nThe second is just cosmetic, I can't stand her half pants thing, one leg has clothes and the other is naked. It just looks stupid, other then that she looks very nice. So yeah whatever, thats just personal.\n\nStill love the new Karma, playing her is fun. (Lulu is still the best!! XD)\n\nShe's not much of a support though, she only has a shield/move speed and a root. If you play her as a Mage rather then Support she ends up supporting better.

I play support mages more than anything and (relevant to this thread), Karma is the only one who I think has nothing she excels at above anyone else. Lulu is the anti-assassin support, even moreso than Janna in my opinion because Whimsy is such a strong counter to assassins. She's the queen of disengage among the pokey supports and unlike Janna, she doesn't just save her ADC but can also do a good job of getting that assassin killed. Nami is the opposite, she's got amazing engage. This is being tuned up to 11 in the new patch, where Tidal Wave will give a mini Sivir ult to all allied champions it hits (seriously, it's over 30% MS). She is the hard engage/kill lane mage support. Sona is THE poke support, who you pick if you desire to push the enemy out of lane for whatever reason. Outside of lane I would say sieging is her niche, thanks to the AOE shield on her W and the ability to keep whoever has gotten poked down topped up.\n\nKarma IMO is the only one who doesn't have a niche, which brings me to the main topic here. Really I can't think of anything that she does better than anyone else. Single target picks, maybe, with her W? But that ability isn't that great at its job anyway. Really her niche until the upcoming patch is being the support Sivir but Nami's gonna steal her thunder on that when her ult buff goes through, leaving Karma closest to Sona in being insanely pokey, but lacking in comparable sustain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2015-08-13T08:36:21.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"To me, the big problem with Karma was removing her fans.

If the generalist support is good, and most supports are generalists, then the best generalist crowds them all out (like Thresh is doing right now). Every support should have a niche that defines them, even if it reduces their viability in every team comp. At least if they have a strength and a weakness then you feel good when you play them in the right circumstances.\n\nFor Thresh, his playmaking potential with amazing saves and great gank setup with Dark Lantern (as well as rescuing a jungler who flashes for dragon or baron) is unique and awesome. His Death Sentence, on the other hand, removes some of Blitzcrank's spotlight, and should be scrapped. Thresh should be a support that centers around his soul collection and the unique, short bursts of mobility he grants his team. His lantern and his souls should be changed to be the center of his kit, his Q should just be dropped and changed to be something less aggressive (Thresh's aggressive plays should be about smart positioning by him and his allies, not by catching someone with a skill shot). His E works just fine, it can be used both aggressively and defensively, and his ultimate is unique and slightly boring. Scrap his Q, buff his W to make it more versatile for initiation (maybe have someone able to enter the lantern and then let Thresh throw it a second time?) and give his ultimate some type of bonus for how many souls he has collected, other than just an AP scaling.\n\nFor Karma, she has an interesting potential as being the AOE nuke support. One thing I think would be interesting to fit her laning pattern, as well as buff her slightly, would be to give any target of her E % magic penetration. This way, if Karma E's herself in lane before she runs up for a Mantra'd Q, she can deal some serious damage and players will be able to quickly understand and feel rewarded for using her shield to nullify counter harass. While this might make her a bit strong, you really need to buff poke supports because they aren't doing their job of punishing all-in supports like Leona, Braum and Alistar right now.\n\nFor Sona, she is supposed to be the premier utility support, but her damaging ability gets in the way of that. Players are conflicted about her identity, some people prefer to use her as a sustain bot in lane and others try to poke with her and deal lots of damage with Lich Bane (which is part of the problem created by the changes to utility scalings back in Season 3). Undodgeable poke is unhealthy, it results in Sona being constantly nerfed because when she's not weak, she's basically cancer. No one wants Sona's Q to be turned into a skill shot though, so instead let's just completely nerf the damage and give her some power to her heal again. If Riot is worried about Sona becoming a passive laner...well, that's their fault. She's far too squishy to take risks in lane, even if those risks are occasionally rewarded. Her base stats are far too low and if she makes a single mistake she not only loses her lane, but sets herself up to be dived along with her carry because of her low base damage and lack of hard cc. \n\nFor Nami, well, you seem to be pushing her towards \"tons of speed\", which is Janna's thing, but hey, Janna doesn't have a stun, so I guess it's okay.\n\nFor Lulu, she should be the best in class single target poker. Get rid of Lulu's solo lane potential once and for all, just like you did with Soraka, and have Glitterlance only able to damage champions. Remove the interaction with Help, Pix! and make Glitterlance only fire one beam in a solid line, and stop on the first champion it hits. In exchange, you can give the slow its immense scaling again and buff the damage, then increase the power of her shield as well. If Lulu is unable to farm with her Q, then she can go back to nuking enemies in lane with it safely, and then we can see some diversity in bot lane again.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PowHammer","date":"2015-08-14T02:57:33.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even as I loved the old Karma, I'm pretty grateful for her rework. _Thank you._ We got to keep the fans though her dance, the Shield BOMB (for a while) and even a dress for her Traditional Skin - I preferred the first proposal tho. I'm faaar from a pro, but I got a lot of games as Karma under my belt and she is my favourite champ/main.\n\nDo not think you got the idea from me, but I actually mentioned that hitting other champs with spells should decrease the CD on her R, when Riot asked for our opinions/ideas on how to improve her some years ago.
