Although her plants can be quite clunky and strange in their targeting mechanics, her zone control in mid is by far among the best in the lane. If you're going to make her stronger in some aspects then maybe reduce the duration of the plants in lane and have them scale by mid-late game to last longer in teamfights. \n\nPeople may not realize but her thorn spitters have 750 attack range meaning her plants can zone and harass champions quite easily.  Most, if not all mid laners will have to use a spell or two to even kill them, and if not then they have to sit back and out of the range for up to 10 seconds, which is a long time. You either waste spell cooldowns and mana to kill them, auto them and take free harass in return, or wait a full ten seconds for them to die off. I understand that she's super immobile and  extremely squishy, but her laning can be quite strong against many mid laners, even oppressive against some.

As a Zyra main, she doesnt need a rework at ALL, she's really fun to play, but she still feels slightly underwhelming compared to other mages (I mostly play her mid, she gets the job done, but she still needs some help)\n\nI think she needs:\n\n1) Better plant AI. Please. Plants starts focusing champs when they spawn, but they take so long to start AA, so the enemy can just walk out, then back in. The plant then changed its focus to a minion and the enemy champ takes no damage. Also, when you spawn a plant, the time she starts to AA is random, sometimes she AA's directly after she spawned, sometimes she needs 2 seconds, that is really annoying.\n\n2) Her W CDR. I played Zyra from the beggining, she was the only champ I bought instantly after her release (July 2012), so I saw how all nerfs hitted her. The first nerf wasnt that bad actually, she lost some damage, but she still was very powerful. What really hitted her hard was 2 things: The passive, which was gutted, and mostly, in her last nerf, the CDR nerf of W from 20 % CDR to only 10 %. Earlier, I could hit 40% CDR with the passive + masteries and runes, but now, it doesnt work anymore. Reverting this nerf would make her alot stronger again\n\n3) Her passive. I mentioned it above, but it got gutted. It doesnt do any damage, it's so hard to hit due to the ridiculously small hitbox and the 2 hours Zyra needs to turn and shoot her missile. Also, the damage got reduced so Zyra cant kill anything now. \n\nTo that 2 solutions: Buff the passives damage/width/whatever you want, or add a 2nd passive that works when Zyra lives, like for examples, enemy units in brushes near Zyra are slowed and takes some damage. If they stay like 5 seconds in one brush close to Zyra, he gets revealed. Just an idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-08-29T04:45:57.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey RiotRepertoir\n\nI have a question that could be either fun or helpful.\n\nHow about you guys would let us conest with balancing/reworking ideas. Winning ones would go to Riots lab to try them.\n\nHere's how I see that:\n\nCreate new board section for rework concepts. Allow players to post their reworks. 2-3 reworks with hugest number of upvotes goes to round 2. In here rework owners talk with Rioter(s) about their idea. And out of 2 or 3 reworks Rioters pick 1 to try.\n\nTo make this more popular you could add information in LoL client. Like in \"news\" or where we have information of champion being disabled. Just for clarity change colour from red/yellow/blue (from basic infos) to purple.\n\nIt'll take alot of resources, but there's good side: players will shape the game they want. Nothing can beat that feeling.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2015-08-29T01:27:45.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just recently picked up Zyra. She is actually a really fun champion to play in my opinion both midlane and support. The only thing that I don't really like about her is her plant targeting. Now I understand that its hard to balance a champion with both sustain damage and burst damage but I think that the targeting on the plants is really bad. \n\nI think that if an enemy champion were to get within a certain proximity of the plant that it should auto target the champion instead of only shooting the target champion once upon summon. I am aware that if you auto an enemy within the range of the plant it will target that enemy, but in my experience it has been really glitchy and will forgo targeting the selected enemy for an entire auto.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PopCorn Chick3n","date":"2015-08-28T20:52:20.248+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe her changes will be on patch 5.18.
