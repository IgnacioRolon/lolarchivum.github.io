So why not implementing a rune, thats a little different than just cooldown reduction?\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#Please keep in mind that it does not simply allow you to double cast things. There are still seconds between re-casting.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> # Rune: In times of need \n> https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/4/41/ProfileIcon0978_Rift_Duck.png \n> **[Update2]** (When you or an ally within range is below a %health threshold(?)) you can cast an ability, which is on cooldown and has either utility or CC on it (slows excluded) for as long its remaining cooldown is (0.5 plus 10% of the abilities cooldown) seconds or less. When you do this, this ability goes normally on cooldown, but the time you lent to pre-cast it will be added to it, doubled.\n> Cooldown of the rune: X seconds.(?)\n\nUpdate1: Less burst abuse through specified abilities.\nUpdate2: I tried to make the rune more defensively (when you/ally is about to die) and less abusable by low cd champions. \n\nNumbers to be determined.\n(Utility = shields, heals, movementspeed buff and other ally buffs.)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> ----------------------------------------------------------------------- **Example**-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou are Nami and your adc is dying. You desperately wait for your heal (w) to come off cooldown (has a 10 second cooldown). Thanks to this rune you were able to cast it 1.5 seconds earlier, saving the life of your adc, which would have died otherwise. Your heal gets an additional cooldown of 3 seconds this time (13 seconds).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>---------------------------------------------------- **Ways the rune could be tweaked**-------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* The rune might only activate when you or an ally within X range fall below a certain %health.\n* Increased cooldown of the ability might be higher (e.g. a multiple of it)\n* The maximum cooldown at which this rune triggers can be higher or lower \n* Ultimates might be kept out\n* Most likely inspire path\n* Other tweaks that stop Assassins from abusing it\n* This rune could have a cooldown\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> ------------------------------------------------------------------ **For clarification** ---------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis should be more of a defensive rune. The intended use for this rune is to have access to an ability (which is currently on cooldown), which has the potential to change the situation, allowing a turn around. It is not intended to allow heavy burst, simply double cast abilities. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> ------------------------------------------------------------------ **Thanks for reading :)**  ---------------------------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT: Original Idea: You can cast an ability, which is on cooldown for as long this cooldown is 2 seconds or less. The next time this ability goes on cooldown, it gains higher cooldown corresponding to the cooldown that was shortened before.\n\nEDIT2: Changed wording and made some tweaks.

With 45% cdr thats 6.6 seconds.\nThe rune might reduce it by 2 more seconds. So you would still need to wait for 4.6 seconds, which means its not double cast.\n\nPeople always try to abuse things.

But this also means that initiators can help trigger it as well as divers and assasins. \n\nThis might not be too much of a problem though because as you say it's gonna get back twice the time shaved off on the next cooldown. This means that it would be something that needs real time communication to really use offensively. Then this brings up a whole new layer of balancing for proplay. \n\nIts a _very_ interesting rune but it opens a whole lot o' questions.

I think there are two good ways you could implement it:\n\nOne would be to make it rather niche and hone-in on what made you think of this rune to begin with, and that's allowing it to be used only when a spell has, say, 10 sec before it's back up. This would be more useful in the case of a summoner spell or ultimate ability. So it could be something like:\n\nCan't Wait -- \"You may use your ultimate or a summoner spell when it's within 10 seconds of coming off cooldown. Doing so grants a temporary effect based on what spell you used and puts this rune on cooldown.\" (This is since it'd be a rather weak rune otherwise and it also brings back the oldschool effects for using summoners, tho these effects could be different from the old of course)\n\nThe other way to implement something like this would be to have it only apply to basic abilities (Q, W, E). So that way you don't necessarily have to worry about a time window, just the fact the spell's on cooldown:\n\nRewind -- \"You may use one of your basic abilities while it's on cooldown, but doing so puts your other basic spells on cooldown.\"\n\nI obviously chose the name for the latter example since the effect is straight out of Zillean's kit. I think this version could prove to be a very interesting rune and by putting all your spells on cooldown after using it, I don't think the rune itself would need a cooldown and it could be an interesting way to balance the effect. The big thing would be how a player would actually SEE or experience this effect in-game. Zillean has a dedicated spell for this, the visuals are clear for him. But if there're no visual cues, a player may even forget they have this rune equipped... not sure what I'd do. Maybe have your abilities semi-highlighted when this rune is applicable WITH the timer on it still?","replies":[{"poster":"Warden Karma","date":"2017-10-07T08:56:38.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Can&#x27;t Wait -- &quot;You may use your ultimate or a summoner spell when it&#x27;s within 10 seconds of coming off cooldown.

Even if other abilities are put on cd they still can use their burst twice. There are also some who get their escape/burst back (like {{champion:55}} , {{champion:18}} ...) when they kill...\n\nThe other thing is with the 10 seconds flat ultimate/summoner, which will be very problematic on low cd ult champs like {{champion:99}} {{champion:43}}.

Kat already has her escape/engage essentially up 24/7 so she would really use this kind of thing for another instance of Q or W to do more damage or just get another blade on the ground. But since her other abilities will go on cd when she does so, she'll need to kind of waste that blade to get the shunpo reset anyway. If we take this sort of rune as a keystone, champs like kat will be giving up quite a bit for something that would be niche for them since their cd's are already so low. So I don't agree that would be too strong on them. \n\nFor Trist, it's kind of the reverse of the above argument since she's either giving up ALL her atk spd enhancement on Q or the majority of her dmg on E in order to jump again. So she's either going in pretty deep or making one heck of an escape, but she won't be doing anything game-breaking imo. And if she uses this for her E to do more damage, she immediately loses the ability to get out should she find she's overstayed the attack. Of course in either case for Trist or Kat, their escape will be granted again due to the reset mechanic of their own kit, but still not game-breaking as that's intended for these champs and they're still giving up other keystones for these situations.\n\nIf you still think that might be a problem, though, we could reword it to be more like:\n\nOne-Trick -- \"You may cast a basic ability while it's on cooldown. However, doing so prevents the use of other basic spells until that spell comes off cooldown again.\"\n\n\nThe flat 10 sec thing I'll agree with, though. Perhaps we could change it to be within 5% of that spell coming off cooldown? It'd still be 15 seconds for summoners like Flash, but only a split second or so for low-cooldown ultimate champs.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tis a nice day","date":"2017-10-06T16:12:43.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you activate this ability though?","replies":[{"poster":"Warden Karma","date":"2017-10-07T08:43:48.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most likely ist will auto-trigger when the conditions are fulfilled and you try to cast an ability on cd.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xxxMadLionxxx","date":"2017-10-06T18:07:29.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"really cool idea for supports. riot wont do it tho as they already filled all there  runes slots","replies":[{"poster":"Warden Karma","date":"2017-10-07T08:42:45.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot said, that they will likely implement more runes over time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Malcha","date":"2017-10-06T17:12:29.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That tumble spam tho","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cowseed","date":"2017-10-06T16:11:26.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it's like for supports and tanks.

See what you think:\n\n- Affects ults only\n- Allows ults to be cast if their cooldown is below x% of the base cooldown (before cdr is applied)\n- Adds the remaining cooldown back on top of the normal cooldown after the ult is used\n- Has an internal cooldown that is longer than the ult's cooldown (perhaps by 2x%)\n\nSo basically, this can be taken on everyone except transformation champions (Nid, Jayce, etc) and Udyr (no ult).  The reason I targeted ults is because they are typically a high point for a champion's kit.  It's probably the most impactful ability that could turn the fight in your favor, so it fits into the general idea of the OP.  Ults also typically have longer than normal cooldowns, which reduces the low cooldown abuse cases mentioned.\n\nThe function of the rune is basically unchanged - you can cast your ult if it is on cooldown as long as it is close to being off cooldown.  I think a percentage of the base cooldown is generally equally fair to everyone - let's use 10% as an example:  An ult with 60s cooldown can be cast if it has less than 6 seconds remaining on cooldown.  If that champ has built a lot of CDR this game, the 6 second window doesn't change because it's a percentage of the base cooldown - thus not directly punishing you for building cooldown.\n\nHowever, the next two points help prevent CDR abuse cases - The first adds the siphoned time back onto the cooldown, preventing this rune from creating psudo-cooldown reduction through use.  In the above example, you would still only get 2 ults in 2 minutes (or 2 ults in 72 seconds with 40% CDR). \n\nThe final point prevents the rune from being used every time your ult is close to being up.  I suggest the rune's cooldown be twice the siphon percentage of the base cooldown (or 20% for a cooldown of 72 (60 + 12) seconds in the example)  Essentially, this ensures the cooldown debt gets paid before being able to use the rune again.\n\nI like the original concept that this rune would be most useful for support type abilities.  Indeed, I think it could be a very cool \"niche\" rune for certain champions.  But as I was reading this I was struck by how interesting it might be to open it up more to other champs without making any of them too crazy.  There might be some issues with reset champs (yi, kat) that I haven't thought through.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2017-10-06T00:30:30.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To fix a lot of problems I would suggest editing the wording to \n\nas long the remaining cooldown is 2 seconds or less.\n\nAnd add that the full cool down must exceed 8ish sec.","replies":[]},{"poster":"invisiblecat1","date":"2017-10-05T22:19:49.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it didn't need CC to apply imagine how OP double ball syndra would be","replies":[]},{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-10-05T21:14:15.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cooldowns and threat range are a huge part of counterplay, so I'm pretty against a rune which makes certain spells' cds flexible.\n\nI do appreciate you exploring that niche and communicating it nicely though.^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mogarl","date":"2017-10-05T20:01:28.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could do something like\n\nAbilities can be cast while up to .5 + 5%-10% of their cooldown is remaining.\n\nI personally prefer the abilities taking on the left over cooldown, but I would also put the rune on cooldown for [flat amount + 50% of spells cooldown] the flat amount ensures it won't be abused by short cooldowns and the percent ensures that long spells don't get off too easily.","replies":[]}]}
