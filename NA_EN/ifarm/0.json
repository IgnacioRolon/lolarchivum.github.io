If you willfully or through neglect or negligence allow someone to play games on your account, you become responsible for any actions they take while on your account. If you did not have a strong password that would have prevented him from guessing it, that's your fault.\n\n>considering I've improved greatly since my 2 eek ban and theirs nothing to show for it on their part.\n\nIf you had improved, you would've been increasing in honor progress. \n\n----\nYour 14 day ban was about 2 months ago - a time frame in which most players would've advanced an honor level if they had been improving their behavior. This is what leads me to believe that your behavior was likely not improved since your 14 day ban. Keep in mind that all valid reports will count against your honor progress - even if you aren't punished for them or notified of them.","replies":[{"poster":"FÃ¡ke News At 11","date":"2018-01-06T22:20:10.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you link me the site in riot where you got this I just got out of a 14 day ban and now I'm scared shitless that anyone who reports me even if I dont say a singlr word will result in a ban","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-06T22:22:23.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as you're not using chat to cause negative experiences towards others, reports won't mean anything.
