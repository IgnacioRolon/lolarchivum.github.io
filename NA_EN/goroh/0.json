I&#039;m talking about the actual players up in D5 who are legitimately boosted and its not hard to tell whatsoever. Having a boosted player on your team is like playing a 4v5, because the player that is boosted is basically a bot on intermediate difficulty, and the players that do know what they&#039;re doing will abuse them to get uncontrollably fed, making it essentially a 4v6. 7 or 8 games almost in a row i&#039;ve played now where a lot of the teammates i get are incredibly questionable, if not you CAN tell their boosted, one person even admitted to being boosted.  All in all its really not hard at all to weed out the players who have been boosted and remove them from the ladder so the players that actually take the climb seriously can start having fun again, and for me right now games feel decided on 50/50 luck, either you have the adc that dies 10 times pre 6 or the enemy team has it. It just ruins the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-03-15T22:58:15.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Explain your method to discovering a boosted account","replies":[{"poster":"Goroh","date":"2017-03-15T23:26:40.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can start off by looking at no-brainer giveaways, such as having the key flash is used on switched around, insane kda's on commonly used boosting champs while sinking in MMR as MsBehave showed, and riot can always just check which ip you're playing from like all other games can, start at the obvious..
