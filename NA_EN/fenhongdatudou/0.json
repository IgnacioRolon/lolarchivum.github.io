When i&#039;m playing her, music is working just fine but when someone else is playing her i hear just music from the game. \r\n\r\n1. Start your officjal League of Legends Mac OS client.\r\n2. Create a custom game with your friend and make him pick {{champion:37}}  with a DJ skin.\r\n3. Press tab at the beginning of the game and try to find the damn button.\r\n4. Cry because RIOT forgot about Mac users.\r\n\r\n100% reproduction.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-06T17:35:40.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey LEAVEmyMOMalone! \n\nThe button isn't located on the scoreboard itself, but to the far left of the screen when you're holding tab.
