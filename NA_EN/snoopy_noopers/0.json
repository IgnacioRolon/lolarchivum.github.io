Also, he needs some sustain, you&#039;re really squishy, even with your passive, and you&#039;re not mobile at all. Your ulti can only have you mobile for so long. I just think he needs a small bit more base health or magic resist, and a little bit more damage with his ulti.","replies":[{"poster":"Ghetto Orb Walk","date":"2015-07-21T18:46:42.865+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:38}}  Rift limp nerf was the death of kass.. smh","replies":[]},{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2015-07-21T07:45:49.098+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> and you&#039;re not mobile at all.\n\n{{champion:38}} \n\nKassadin.\n\nNot mobile at all.\n\nDidn't think I'd see someone complain about that.\n\nKassadin arguably is not in a great spot ATM, but with all your wishes - I'm getting the strong sense you:\nA) have never been around when Kassadin was 100% pick/ban (lasted over 2 years)\nB) are starting to learn him and just aren't that great with him yet, trying to blame some of that learning curve failure on his kit.\n\nKassadin was 100% pick/ban for over 2 years - the tiniest push could potentially put him back. He's weathered nerf after nerf, to the point Riot had to take pretty drastic measures with him.\nA small push for him isn't that far removed to where he was still widely played.\n\nFinally - look up some strategy guides for him. Kassadin isn't exactly squishy with most of his builds. Or lacking in mana sustain for that matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-07-21T16:17:38.962+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like a certain monkey from a certain Disney movie had said, \"It doesn't matter, its in the past.\" When I see Kassadin, and then I here all this \"100% pick/ban\" stuff, I think to myself, \"is he still a 100% pick/ban? is he even at 50% pick/ban anymore?\" since then, its been about 2 and half years. His win rate dropped to almost bellow 40%. And his kit feels underwhelming. He doesn't even get a stronger shield on Q. His E doesn't do much damage. His R costs a lot of mana after 4 uses. The dude isn't even getting another rework, he could use a buff.","replies":[{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2015-07-21T19:18:42.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It hasn't been 2 1/2 years.\n\nAlso - the major issue with this sentiment is this:\nThe general consensus was that Kassadin was useless and weak. Until he exploded out of nowhere into 100% pick/ban after seeing some good play on the pro circuit, and then stuck their nerf after nerf.\nPeople also thought the same thing about Orianna, Lee-Sin, and Lucian. Before they exploded into being the single best champion for their lane.\n\nAs far as GD is concerned, champions only fit into 1 of 2 categories:\n1) The worst champion ever that's never played.\n2) Completely broken and OP, see them in every game, should be gutted completely, Q_Q\n\nAnd again - when Kassadin was far stronger than he was during most of his pro-scene run, people thought he was useless and weak.\n\nIf you don't have 30 games on a champion, you're probably going to suck with them. \nEspecially if there not currently dominating the meta - your allies are going to be much less aware of your strengths and weaknesses, they're not going to work as well with your specific champion, you aren't going to get rapid iteration on what works and what doesn't by also facing the same champion you're trying to learn and seeing what works for them, and your optimal build/level-up pattern isn't going to be common knowledge. You mostly have to figure out a lot of the movements and footwork yourself.\n\nAnd with a small buff - Kassadin could easily be pushed into a place were the pros feel solid about using him, he become meta, and everybody suddenly knows how to obliterate things with him again.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Snoopy Noopers","date":"2015-07-21T08:07:55.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe kassadin is just a useless champ ATM, relying on your ulti that screws you over later and prevents you from engaging when dodging unnecessary damage isn't that great. Your mobility makes you dodge less skill shots, and you can take a lot of harass, especially fighting a ranged champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QuincyFalcon","date":"2015-07-21T16:29:41.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"From the general discussion around this topic, I am getting a feeling that many of the players here have not actually put the necessary games into learning Kassadin (Or do not remember quite how broken he really was during his 100% pick/ban era).  67CHROME is correct in saying that Kassadin is in a very good spot right now and is, in my opinion, balanced very well.  He's not going to steamroll every match up like he used to back in the day, Riot introduced counter play by giving him more weaknesses to make the player (i.e. you) have to think carefully about your engages and trades.  He takes more time to learn, has relatively reasonable power spikes during the game and has counter/outplay potential.  Not sure about you, but that all sounds like a balanced champion to me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rain NT","date":"2015-07-21T13:06:00.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact I can say that Riven is more mobile than Kass is a problem. Kass was meant to have something that he does better than ANYONE else, and they took it to the ground. I say revert damage somewhere, cause they nerfed everything about kass before noticing his R was the problem. SMALL damage buff on W and E at max rank. Lower the mana cost to (45) of R and remove the damage from it completely (since some of the damage is being moved to W and E at max). Lower the reset mana stack by CDR instead, and reset the base Reset timer to 12. Like lets be frank here, we dont use Kass R for damage 85% of the time because if anything it will get you killed or they are just clearly not in range for it ANYMORE zz rito, so might as well use it to get away more often 12(-40% CDR = 7). \n\nNow maybe his full damage output might be lower (but thats saying if he has 2+ stacks of R and is in range to R ontop of something AND be safe doing it), now he has more consistent damage and he will be able to rift walk more without all of a sudden having no mana or simply cant riftwalk cause of the stacks, it already has such a short range that is that even that good anymore.

If they made his R's stack duration down to 10s or made it scale with CDR, he might actually be playable. His damage already requires him to be in melee range because a lot of his power has been loaded into his W much like Gragas's power was loaded into his W during his own rework. Both were safe melee champions that had good poke and could kill at range, both nerfed because they were melee killing at range. Gragas is still playable as AP and will still one-shot any squishy with a W+E+Q combo when you have a Lichbane and another big AP item. Kassadin has more mobility, but doesn't have the CC Gragas does nor does he have the damage Gragas does. His mobility is gimped because short CD dashes are considered too strong, though it's okay if it's on a relatively short CD if there's CDR, like Gragas's E with CDR or Lucian/Graves/Riven/Nidalee/Ez if he lands a Q or two/Kha'Zix (Who also gets resets if evolved)... There's lots who can jump very often without punishment and some do it over notably longer ranges, like Zix who has a base CD of 12s on his max rank E, going down to 7.2s with maxed CDR, Lucian's is based on his passive chaining but sometimes can be completely ignored CD-wise with the right ability/AA combos, Graves just has to AA to reduce his own CD and with 40% CDR, it goes from a 14s CD to a 8.4s CD...\n\nAll of this and Kass's R is a 2s Flash, but its mana cost doubles each time its used within the last 15s. Changing the CD to 15s or making the 15s be reduced by CDR could definitely put Kassadin back into the game without overloading him since his combo ratio still only totals, at max ranks for all, 610 BASE damage with 2.0x AP ratio and 2% of his max mana, which without mana items is 2% of about 1600, which is 32. With RoA and Seraph's, it's 2% of 3400, which is still only 68 damage. The mana ratio is near useless. Even with stacks, at max, it only does 6% of his mana which would cost a fortune of your mana (800) to do about 204 damage. Mana items on him are only to make his R spammable. Make the CD lower and he can build mana regen and CDR instead and he won't be OP, but at the same time, he also won't be so bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bad manner kid","date":"2015-07-21T08:00:48.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just think about Urgot.
