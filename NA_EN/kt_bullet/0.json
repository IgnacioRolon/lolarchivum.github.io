Now be gentle as this is my first idea or general concept of a game change that I think would help aid and or balance out a champion a little more.\n\nThe Champion in context is : Annie {{champion:1}} \n\nQ : What change am I proposing, and why am I making it/discussing it.\n\nA : Well the change is to her ultimate (Tibbers). Where she is able instantly cast a AOE Spell 600 units from her that does 425 ap damage and 80% of her total ap. As well if her passive is at 4 stacks it is now a AOE stun that does that total amount of damage to all the targets hit.\n\nNow the reason why I want to change this ability is because I find it doesn&#039;t really have any counter play at least in the early game.\n\nWAIT Before you all get your pitchforks out and down-vote me to H**L. Hear me out for a second, now I know a whole bunch of you are going to say \"Just buy QSS or a banshee&#039;s veil\" Now while I do agree this does counter her ultimate fairly well and most of her damage. I also think that being forced to itemize 1 item to counter play 1 champ as a champion is pretty lame. Especially when you are playing a low hp jungler/mid/adc/support. I won&#039;t add top lane since most top lane champions can survive annie&#039;s burst.\n\nNow the change I&#039;m proposing, is the same thing as to what you have done for teemo. Literally 99% the same.\n\nAs you can see in this gif\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/43a9189e017dff1f709578303e9636c5.gif\n\nAnd this youtube video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vitUUTYJXu4\n\n\nBasically the concept is that instead of tibbers just blowing you up and your team. Lets add a little more counter play to it as well as give Annie a nice little buff.\nLets make it so she has to throw her stuff bear tibbers, and as soon as it lands it explodes into the monstrous champion eating teemo bear that we all know and love.\n\nNow with this change I also think that the range of which she is able to throw it should be increased in the early levels. So that way it gives her some more power, but also allows you to go \"OMG Flash, hourglass...etc\"\n\n\nIf you guys have any feedback or your own suggestions you would like to leave I would love to hear it!\n\nAlso I have heard of the concept of making her passive stacks slowly decrease over time, I personally don&#039;t believe that is a fair balance change. Because you are basically cutting one of her rolls. She couldn&#039;t be played as a support as well.... >.> At least thats what I think.\n\nEDIT----------------------------------\n\n1. A lot of people are assuming that this is just to gut her. It is not.\n\n2. If she did have to throw tibbers, of course we would increase the total range early and late to compensate for the time it takes for it to be thrown.\n\n3. I also believe that the distance of which the tibbers is thrown should also change the time of how long it takes for the whole animation to occur.\n\nExample. Say she throws it 100 units away from her. Total cast time of animation to tibbers exploding and doing damage is like 0.8 seconds.\n\nWhere if she throws it like 700 units away it takes like 1.5 seconds for the total cast time of the animation to the damage occuring.\n\nAgain, obviously this would need more tweaking like what distance she can throw and the damage. But I believe that this idea is one of the better ones for annie! Lets make it happen!\n\nAny more idea's or thoughts? \n\nEDIT 2 ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. I love the feedback you guys are awesome!\n\n2. It would be really cool if a rioter replied with his/her thoughts on the idea. Like this is legitimate change, that not only the community but a few players whom play annie would like to see occur!\n\n3. If anyone could forward this to someone like anniebot! Or get it more noticed that would be awesome!\n\nLets see if we can make a change for the better with annie!","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2015-08-04T05:04:29.940+0000","up_votes":69,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, like how she threw out tibbers in a Twist of Fate animation? :D\nhttps://nygamecritics.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/giphy-6.gif","replies":[{"poster":"General Keith","date":"2015-08-04T17:24:49.466+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tibbers, I choose you!","replies":[]},{"poster":"HighH1","date":"2015-08-04T05:41:51.338+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"THIS","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frost Hellfire","date":"2015-08-04T16:10:57.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Purrfect.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dustinhihi2","date":"2015-08-04T02:37:56.139+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"This, is one of the best idea's ive read in a while... lol","replies":[{"poster":"RIP Tahm Kench","date":"2015-08-04T03:34:07.892+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"I don't really see how different it is from all of those \"give Annie ult an animation/travel time!\" that get down voted to hell aside from the increased range compensation.\n\nIt's more long winded I guess.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-08-04T10:52:19.602+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Downvoted by who?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fadedpf","date":"2015-08-04T02:45:36.684+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same mechanics as new teemo shrooms?","replies":[{"poster":"Yosuke Apperu","date":"2015-08-04T17:10:21.529+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then she can throw another tibbers at that tibbers and it bounces :D","replies":[{"poster":"Tilt Thru Time","date":"2015-08-04T22:18:24.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just picturing a lulu walking past a bush when 5 flaming bears landing on her.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-08-04T04:21:23.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":14,"body":"If you remove her ability to insta-burst you from 100%...what does she have left?

She can still just flash-W and then ult and we're back to the same problem.

You would have to buff Tibbers or the rest of her kit in such an insane way to compensate for the loss of reliability, in much the same way that Veigar's reworked kit needed an absurd number of buffs to become somewhat effective again.\n\nI think a better idea is to make it so she can't hold her stun permanently. This gives more, er, \"windows of opportunity\", because once she has her stun up she only has so long to make a play with it. If you see her with her stun, you aren't permanently zoned, and it gives good counterplay to Tibbers because of her limited engagement range without flash.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tactical Seppuku","date":"2015-08-04T15:25:16.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't hate me, but I changed the upvotes on this from 69 to 70.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2015-08-04T15:06:31.959+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they do this, she needs some pretty heavy buffs to compensate, which wasn't the case with Teemo.
