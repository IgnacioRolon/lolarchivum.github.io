He said there is a site that gives you free RP if you enter in your username and password,----------------------------------- I was dumb enough to enter in my user name and password and it said that I would get free RP in 6 hours. I told this to my friend and he says that its possible a big scam and that I should change my passcode immidently. So I changed my passcode to a different one in a few minutes. As I was starting my regular day of League of legends I noticed that I wasn't getting IP on my account and I did a few more games to make sure, When I knew I wasn't getting anymore IP and it automatically stopped at 1500IP and didn't go up I got worried so I'm asking for some help to make sure if this is normal or if this is a scam or if I could get help.
