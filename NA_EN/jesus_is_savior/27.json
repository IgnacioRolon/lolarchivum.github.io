This company fucking sucks, and has no idea how to develop a game.\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/announcements/riot-pls\n\n> Sandbox Mode\n> We&rsquo;ve heard a number of player requests for a Sandbox Mode, with two main reasons: the first is trying out new content &ndash; which is something we value too. We want players to know what they&rsquo;re getting and to be happy with the things they&rsquo;re unlocking (we may investigate other ways to do this). The second is that players want to practice very specific skills without the constraints of a regular game. For this point, our stance is that sandbox mode is not the way to go. We want to make sure we&rsquo;re clear: playing games of League of Legends should be the unequivocal best way for a player to improve. While there are very real skills one can develop in a hyperbolic time chamber, we never want that to be an expectation added onto an already high barrier to entry. On an individual level, we know this isn&rsquo;t always true &ndash; some just want a space to practice flashing over walls without having to wait at least 3.6 minutes in between &ndash; but when that benefit is weighed against the risk of Sandbox mode &lsquo;grinding&rsquo; becoming an expectation, we just can&rsquo;t accept the tradeoff. We never want to see a day when a player wants to improve at League and their first obligation is to hop into a Sandbox. We do want to support your ability to grow in mastery, and there may be other avenues to do so, but not this.\n\nGD cross-post: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/VOV7pmtq-we-dont-want-a-sandbox-mode-because-we-dont-want-players-to-be-expected-to-grind-it\n\nReddit cross-post: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3fx88z/we_dont_want_a_sandbox_mode_because_we_dont_want/\n\n[](http://i.imgur.com/GNLwiPY.jpg)","replies":[{"poster":"46104328_DEL","date":"2015-08-05T21:02:33.587+0000","up_votes":159,"down_votes":5,"body":"It sounds like an excuse to me.\nAnd we all know how Riot feels about telling the truth, so...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rozzeta","date":"2015-08-05T23:59:47.707+0000","up_votes":130,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"In order to improve in the game, players should be exposed to our toxic playerbase, who will insult them for every single mistake made in the learning phase\" - Riot Games.","replies":[{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2015-08-06T00:21:26.849+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rozzeta,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BWvBv7ET,comment-id=0014,timestamp=2015-08-05T23:59:47.707+0000)\n>\n> \"In order to improve in the game, players should be exposed to our toxic playerbase, who will insult them for every single mistake made in the learning phase\" - Riot Games.\n\n^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SgtCrispy","date":"2015-08-05T22:51:36.097+0000","up_votes":97,"down_votes":1,"body":"But the 1-30 grind and the absurd cost of runes is perfectly okay?","replies":[{"poster":"Mauro","date":"2015-08-06T00:12:59.688+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"They might can make it so Sandbox unlocks at level 30 so players wont abuse it to level their accounts","replies":[{"poster":"Diananmen Square","date":"2015-08-06T01:09:37.942+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's not what they meant.

They don't want people to improve because if they become satisfied with their game performance, they're going to move on and play something else. The game may be balanced around the highest tier of players, but the survivability of the game is 100% dependent on the lower classes. 30% of the game populations spending RP is not going to be enough to carry Riot. IRL Bronze/Silver are the real carries. Give them an avenue to succeed and Riot fears they will simply get tired of the game.\n\n - Riot does not want to reveal coding or damage mechanics.\n\nWhy is MMR a hidden algorithm? I remember back in the vanilla WoW days where knowing how statistics applied to various classes was common knowledge and the result rendered a ton of items in game useless -- where as if the damage system was kept secret people would have spent a long time playing around with different items trying to maximize their damage. Instead it was clear what items at what level you should have as a certain character. Blizzard started ruining WoW before the first expansion catering to all these different stat needs -- a mistake I've seen Riot being very cautious about making. \n\nRiot is afraid that a sandbox would give some very smart players an avenue to reverse calculate the inner workings of the game -- doesn't have to be specifically damage, or even anything having to do with stats, it could be anything from an unknown bug or exploit to knowing that a certain 5 characters combined are completely unbeatable at level 5 against all comps except X...etc. Remember how SS White would base team comps around their level 1? Imagine if that was the norm. \n\nWhile I can understand the second reason a bit -- it's a development issue at heart. Riot doesn't want to have to rework half the cast when people figure out just how paper thin the game might be. And it really is with certain match-ups. The first theory, however, is pretty sinister at heart. Riot is rooting against the success of its own players, rather than finding an alternative means of keeping the cash machines going, they want to keep the lower classes ignorant and naive enough to buy the next Vayne skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Anrui","date":"2015-08-06T08:42:20.420+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, I think it is #2 that is the real reason.

One jungle route practice takes 2 minutes + load screen + 30 seconds just to run. I already have to grind this because I WANT TO BE GOOD AT THIS GAME and despite the time requirements, practicing these routes in a real game takes 20 minutes before the team can surrender. How does providing a sandbox mode and shortening the already required grind force me to grind? It doesn't. I wanted to learn Rumble. It takes an hour to practice his ult 50 times. I used that entire hour. I was forced to do it because I didn't want to lose 5 games in order to get that practice.\n\nSo, allowing me to more efficiently practice is NOT making me grind. It would remove the grind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Finalreqy","date":"2015-08-06T01:03:12.712+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urf mode is already like a thing, and has been done, its been coded, let players make it in a custom game.

No we don't want you to practice by yourself and get good then go played ranked. We want you to just play ranked and fail. WTF! Sandbox Mode is an excellent idea. I should be able to go on this game and buy a few items and pick my level and practice what I want to do, instead of waiting 30mins to do exactly what i want, Like testing out different item combos. But nooo they want me to wait around 20 mins. to get the items just to spend a few mins. trying them and then wait another 10mins to save up enough to test out the next combos.

That really makes no sense to me. If they consider players practicing specific mechanics (examples: insec play, wall jumps, Azir's shuffle) then they are really way out of their minds. Practicing mechanics is **NOT** grinding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2015-08-05T21:53:31.840+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":7,"body":"While I disagree with them, I do see their point.\n\nIn a world where you can effectively train your skills by doing it over and over again, people will do this instead of just playing games. If EVERYONE ELSE does it this way, except you, well... You're at a disadvantage because it's the more effective way to get better.\n\nHowever, I think a large portion of the player base isn't really competitive enough to spend their time doing boring exercises instead of playing games. It will probably hit the higher tier players way more than the low tier ones. Becoming diamond or master will become more difficult without doing some sandbox training yourself, but probably not for gold, atleast, not significantly.","replies":[]}]}
