It&#x27;s not worth, imo!\n\nI've been doing it for months with the old client.\n\nI run league from a RAM-disk and I like it to be as small as possible.\n\nThe only reason I opted into the new client was so I could delete the old one (and I did it in a way that will HOPEFULLY not trigger the files as corrupt as far as the patcher is concerned - by replacing every file with a 0 byte file with the same name):\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8OqbRw3.png/img\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/w0C4Vcn.png/img\n\nNow with my \"legacy client\" completely deleted, I would like to also shrink my beta client (by replacing jpeg images with super lossy pixelated compressed versions of themselves, and muting/shrinking the sounds by replacing them with 1 second of silence - which is what I had been doing with the old client for months).\n\nI don't care if it's \"not supported\" - I just want to know how to do it. It won't crash or cause issues. I know what I'm doing.","replies":[]}]}]}
