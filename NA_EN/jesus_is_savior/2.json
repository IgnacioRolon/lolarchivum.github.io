Can you fix it so \"jpeg\" is valid on these new boards too? So I don't have to switch it to \"jpg\"?\r\n\r\n(inb4 someone says \"jpg\" works on the old forums too. Yes, it does, but it has unrealistic file size, length, and width requirements - it basically only works if you're posting a thumbnail lol - so it is essentially broken, and \"jpeg\" must be used)","replies":[{"poster":"MaliceCity","date":"2014-08-07T20:10:22.839+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We just enabled this functionality!!","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2014-08-25T01:17:43.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the fix :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2014-08-12T20:07:21.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you fix it properly?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2014-08-09T04:02:39.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it appears \"jpeg\" isn't doing the same thumbnail/preview that \"jpg\" allows on this site.
