Now I will never play support again. I have entirely removed myself from the potential support pool of players.\r\n\r\nAnd in the long run, as more and more people follow suit, that means longer queue times for everyone on average (due to Riot&#039;s attempt to shorten them in the short-term).","replies":[]}
