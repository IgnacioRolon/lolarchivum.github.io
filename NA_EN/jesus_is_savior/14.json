Can you help me?","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"With the anti-cheat changes on the live server now, I can no longer use sound mods. I have been playing with the HUD muted for years now (around the same time you introduced the ping volume slider). I like spamming buttons, and some of the sounds hurt my ears (and give me a headache), which is why I originally muted it. Examples of sounds that hurt my ears and/or annoy me: the &quot;cannot cast that skill right now&quot; noise and the &quot;not enough mana to cast that&quot; noise. I also have minor ear damage, which may be why those sounds bug me so much (I have permanent high pitched tinnitus that I can no longer drown out, not even with a fan.... I hear a high pitched &quot;EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE&quot; and will continue to hear it for the rest of my life - silence does not exist). My only option now is to almost mute the entire game and play music while I play League. I have never done this in a video game in my entire life - sound and music is part of the game. So how could you fix this for me?\r\n\r\nIn this folder:\r\nRiot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_game_client\\releases\\&lt;LEAGUE VERSION NUMBER&gt;\\deploy\\DATA\\FINAL\\Maps\\Shipping\r\n\r\nThere is a file called: Common.wad.client\r\n\r\nAnd in this file, if you use a program that can read WAD files, there is another file called: HUD_Global_audio.bnk\r\n\r\nIs there a chance you could add a volume slider for HUD_Global_audio.bnk?\r\n\r\nSounds to exclude from this slider (the slider would not affect them): \r\n\r\n1) Pings (they already have their own slider)\r\n\r\n2) The turret aggro noise, or as it is known in the soundbank file, &quot;509359922&quot; (because muting this makes no sense - it&#039;s more of a &quot;battle&quot; noise, and not an HUD noise, and actually conveys very important information - so it should be controlled by the regular SFX volume slider, and not an HUD volume slider). Soundcloud link:\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-956579527/509359922a\r\n\r\nIf everything else inside &quot;HUD_Global_audio.bnk&quot; could be affected by the volume slider (allowing me to mute them) that would be great. However, if you&#039;re doing this change JUST for me, then I&#039;d be fine if everything except &quot;509359922&quot; was muted since I play with pings muted anyway. But I thought other people might appreciate the functionality too, which is why I mentioned pings should be excluded.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading this. Hopefully someone will reach out so I can enjoy League and immerse myself fully into the game again, instead of immersing myself into my music player and not really enjoying the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Raykay","date":"2018-06-15T03:17:33.142+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know that there is an easy solution here but I'll follow up with some people internally to see what we can do.","replies":[]}]}
