State laws can override this and make it legal in their state.\r\n\r\nDoes this mean the \"supreme court\" could \"declare marijuana illegal in all 50 states\" and every state that has declared it legal would have to stop selling it? How is this different from it already being illegal in the entire USA, but overruled by individual state laws?\r\n\r\nSomeone pls explain.","replies":[]}
