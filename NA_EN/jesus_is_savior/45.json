All I can say is \"wow\"","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"I was setting up a windows 10 machine for someone else.\r\n\r\n1) According to websites I have read, you can&#039;t disable Windows Update unless you have the professional edition with group policy (as such, I didn&#039;t even check for an option). The only way to disable Windows from automatically updating is to set a connection as metered. Okay, so I set it to metered. I plug in the printer. Printer driver doesn&#039;t download because the connection is metered. LOOKS LIKE THAT ISN&#039;T A VIABLE OPTION, so I set it back to unmetered.\r\n\r\n2) Can no longer view data usage by simply clicking on your wireless network like you could in Windows 8.1. You must go into the advanced settings. And it shows usage per 30 days, with no way to actually reset it without doing some really weird shit (Google required). So if you like to reset your usage on a daily basis (like I do), nope. Not unless you wanna do some really strange shit every day, and reboot your machine every time. And at that point it&#039;s simply easier to just track it in a fucking spreadsheet. No more one-button click to reset it.\r\n\r\n3) Laptop &quot;power plans&quot; can only be changed in the advanced settings, and no longer by just clicking the battery icon and then clicking the plan. You have to click the battery icon, click a thing to open an advanced menu, and then CLICK ANOTHER THING in that menu to bring up the actual &quot;select your power plan&quot; menu. Wtf?\r\n\r\nIs there a reason people are saying this operating system is good? Overall, just by spending 30 minutes on Windows 10, I have absolutely no desire to upgrade my Windows 8.1 machine. Even if I double check with my laptop vendor to make sure there are no driver issues (I have a gaming laptop with an Nvidia card that uses Optimus), it seems the actual OS itself is worse than Windows 8.1. It gives you less control of your machine, and it takes more clicks to do things.","replies":[]}
