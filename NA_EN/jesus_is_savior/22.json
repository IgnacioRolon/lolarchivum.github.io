He posted on General Discussion and said he never flamed, never trolled, and won more often than not. But every time his team lost, he'd get 4-man reported (or 9-man reported) and it kept getting him banned.\nRiot responsed by saying, \"Well, your teammates clearly don't want you to pick Eve, but you picked her anyway. And that's refusal to communicate, which is a bannable offense.\"\n>It was bullshit then and it's bullshit now. Picking something off-meta that you genuinely enjoy playing, and trying your damnedest to win while playing that off-meta pick, should not be a bannable offense.","replies":[{"poster":"Risk of Fate","date":"2016-11-14T14:40:54.999+0000","up_votes":59,"down_votes":6,"body":"I agree and that is one of the reasons I started to get bored of League. Things became so standardized, the meta was enforced to the point where your team will flame you if you pull off-meta things even if it were in normal draft.\n\nLeague of Legends is, I'm going to say this again and again, a video game. What does that mean? It means have fun and/or win if that is your goal. People should not be afraid to try something new and, if it works, more power to them. In order for the game to survive, it's people like him to show there are other ways to play a game.\n\nBy the logic of this argument, that means I can report the following because it will create a negative experience for me as they are off-meta picks: Lux (Support), Miss Fortune (Support), Brand (Support), Annie (Support), Nautilus (Top/Jungle), Graves (Jungle), Vayne (Top), Quinn (Top), Yasuo (Tank), Akali (Tank), Ekko (Tank), Master Yi (Tank). \n\nIf this is how people react to new metas, I'm honestly surprised with how North America made it into Worlds by sticking to things that were established and throwing a fit over some new strategy. ROX Tigers won against SKT using the Support Miss Fortune and look what happened? However, Miss Fortune's not a support so that means if I see you either on my team or the enemy team, I would be in full right to report you for it.\n\nThe idea that Support is just a ward bot absolutely bothers me to no end. This is a team game, I have 3 stealth wards and 1 control ward. If you want map coverage, help me. I see you with that yellow trinket. No matter what role I'm playing, I'm usually at 20+ wards placed across the board.

You have no business queueing up as Support. That is the point Riot is making here. \n\nHave no idea what your beef with Bard is. I've never heard of a Bard leaving lane to counter jungle. They collect a couple chimes, ward and journey their way back before falling too far behind in experience. Often they leave a couple health pools behind before wandering off. You're not going to be able to sell me that Singed and Bard offer the same support capabilities. \n\nI'm on the fence as to whether or not Duo Jungle should be bannable. I get Riot's stance based on how they assign roles. It's clear that they don't want Duo Top, Duo Jungle or Duo Mid. If you pick Fill, you get Support. There's no \"non support\" option. \n\nLastly... this isn't Riot vs a Singed \"Support\" player. This is a Singed \"Support\" player vs multiple players that filed so many complaints that Riot took action.
