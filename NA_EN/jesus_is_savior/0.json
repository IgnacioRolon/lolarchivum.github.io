(eg: saying it will take 6 hours when it only takes 1 or 2).\n\nIt shouldn't really be an issue if you stick with that. With no ETA at all, and the server still down 4 hours later.... For all we know it coulda been a 12 hour maintenance at that point.\n\nAnd yes, SG1 is the best. The only reason Atlantis is good is because.... It continued to have new episodes after SG1 got cancelled :(","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-22T20:58:47.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I definitely get where you are coming from.  12 hour maintenance's are incredibly rare and if we had one, it means we seriously fucked up a lot of other things leading up to this point.  Albeit, point noted.  We don't try to over-estimate too terribly much (6 hours for 1-2 is a little extreme), but similar to battle plans, the moment a maintenance start, all ETA's can sometimes be immediately tossed out a window.  We need to figure out a good solution for this though!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rew","date":"2016-06-22T14:03:47.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wilsonson Jr","date":"2016-06-22T13:53:55.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Red tracker says 3 pdt? that's 5 pm central time.. 12 hours of downtime for maintenance? is this real life?","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2016-06-22T14:00:27.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=420Drew,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=LlakgdB9,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-06-22T13:53:55.019+0000)\n>\n> Red tracker says 3 pdt? that&#x27;s 5 pm central time.. 12 hours of downtime for maintenance? is this real life?\n\nThat's when it STARTED. 3am.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rew","date":"2016-06-22T13:58:42.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=420Drew,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=LlakgdB9,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-06-22T13:53:55.019+0000)\n>\n> Red tracker says 3 pdt? that&#x27;s 5 pm central time.. 12 hours of downtime for maintenance? is this real life?\n\nI believe that was the beginning time of the maintenance. 3am PDT, 5am Central.
