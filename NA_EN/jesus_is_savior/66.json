The 2 biggest most noticeable things were &quot;dragging items in your inventory&quot; and &quot;dragging portraits on the scoreboard.&quot; This single action alone felt 1000x better, and the game in general also felt a lot better. And then of course, when I bring this up on Reddit (not entirely sure why I went there, but I did) they shit on me and say &quot;it&#039;s probably a placebo lol.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo since I needed to change the setting on my clean un-modded League folder, I decided to test it today.\r\n\r\nEnable v-sync -&gt; buy item (hunter&#039;s talisman) -&gt; click item and drag it really fast on the screen (really large circles on a 1080p screen). Item will lag behind the mouse pointer. Like a quarter of a screen behind the mouse pointer if you drag really fast. Disable v-sync -&gt; item won&#039;t lag behind the pointer at all.\r\n\r\nLeague is a horribly coded game holy shit.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5rU65Dc.png/img","replies":[]}
