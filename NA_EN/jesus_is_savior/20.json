If you get a report with days of delay, that probably that only means it took that long for the ban to happen for some reason and they haven't been reported by anyone afterwards. I'm 100% sure of that because I remember Lyte using saying something along the lines of \"just like you only get the kill if you make the last hit\" when explaining it, that was quite memorable.
