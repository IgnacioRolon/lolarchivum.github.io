The tribunal was judged by an unbiased sample of players who weren&#039;t in a high stress ranked environment. They looked at the behavior, unbiased, without the win or loss affecting them, and determined if it was okay or not. **_This is exactly what is happening on the forums right now._** People who play with the Nunu support are obviously going to report him. But despite this, a majority of players actually think his behavior is okay and shouldn&#039;t be punishable.\n\nMaking the system based on &quot;reports&quot; to determine bad behavior instead of an unbiased jury like the old tribunal system is reshaping the &quot;rules&quot; in a bad way. To use a law/court example, **_this is like if you let the plaintiff also be the jury and judge in a trial._**\n\nThis is not okay. So what if Nunu got reported in 50% of his games? Most of the community agrees he shouldn&#039;t be banned, and the system is flawed.\n\nI&#039;m also going to put my original reply to your thread here (in case you ever decide to respond to it):\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=WookieeCookie,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=FrILlWp7,comment-id=00f0,timestamp=2017-02-28T04:43:04.612+0000)\n>\n> We want players to have fun but not at the expense of teammates. Ideally this means players will coordinate among themselves in a given match and react to the unique circumstances they end up in. If a player is consistently forcing “their vision” on the rest of the team **and **refusing to adapt to their needs we reserve the right to intervene. That’s what happened here (and before with the Singed case); players cried out how terrible the experience was for them and we intervened.\n\nOkay, but lets say he caves in. &quot;Oh okay, you&#039;re not okay with my strategy, I guess I have to play a normal support&quot; -&gt; this will happen 99% of the time. His teams will **_NOT_** be okay with his strategy. So his team is holding **_HIM_** hostage, and he has to conform.\n\nNot to mention: he&#039;s diamond. You&#039;re basically telling him to &quot;go play something he sucks at&quot; and derank to gold. FYI: this will literally get him reported in 90% of his games, and will be worse than the ~50% figure you quoted for his &quot;off-meta strategy.&quot;\n\nIt sounds like you need to bring back the tribunal, because Riot employees deciding arbitrary rules does not work. **_You are enforcing the meta, because his teams will NEVER be okay with his strategy, so he will NEVER be allowed to play it without getting banned._**\n\nAnd no, premades are not an option.
