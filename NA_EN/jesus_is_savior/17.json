I have to play in the next few days to not decay from plat. But I haven&#039;t been playing League at all, so I will be playing at a high silver/low gold level.\r\n\r\nAnd no, I&#039;m not going to play 10-50 normal games just to get back some of my skill so I don&#039;t ruin the ranked game. If I have played a total of 3 games (1 ranked 2 normals) since August 26... Why would I want to do that? Obviously I&#039;m playing better, funner games run by people who actually give a shit about their players.\r\n\r\nSo one of 3 things will happen as I play my last game of the season:\r\n\r\n1) I will get lucky\r\n\r\n2) I will get carried\r\n\r\n3) I will ruin 4 other people&#039;s day\r\n\r\nAnd number 3 is the most likely.\r\n\r\nAnd no, I&#039;m not just going to let myself decay, either. I earned my rewards, and I&#039;m damn well gonna get them.","replies":[]}
