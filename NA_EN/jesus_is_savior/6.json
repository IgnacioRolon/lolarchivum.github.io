Sometimes I need to change a couple buttons around to force a re-sync (eg: swapping 2 and 3 and then swapping them back to get the server to re-sync my backup settings file I had copied to the folder).\n\nBut other times the server re-syncs automatically. eg: when I was forcing all 3 of my accounts to have the same settings file, I just copied the one I wanted to the folder, denied write-access so League couldn't over-write it, and then logged into a custom on all 3 accounts and the server seemed to update all 3 with the file. (I re-enabled write-access and tested it afterward and the server-side file was updated).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LordofEntropy","date":"2016-11-04T20:29:52.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=qkxye0H2,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-11-04T15:37:40.236+0000)\n>\n> Is this issue still happening for anyone?

I have a similiar setup attack-move-click on mouse 1 and the old mouse 1 select on mouse 3. Here is my persistedsettings.json that has the attack-move-click on mouse 1 and the old mouse 1 select on mouse 3.
