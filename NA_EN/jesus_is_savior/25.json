So I have to smite champions (not monsters) for it to be gold efficient. If my smite is ever not up for a fight, then I am handicapped greatly.\n\nInfinity Edge is 107% gold efficient, and is always available in fights.\n\nPhantom Dancer is 97% gold efficient without both its passives. It could almost be arguable that this is a better item than warrior (or bloodrazor) outright in almost all situations, and both cost about the same and have similar effects.\n\nBerserker Greaves is 128% gold efficient (!?!?)\n\nWarrior also doesn't scale properly into a crit build. It only gives one of the desired stats (AD). All other items give 2 of the desired stats (crit+AD or crit+attack speed). So warrior will delay powerspikes because other items scale together with each other (similar to how a deathcap scales with all your other AP items - in a crit build, every crit item you buy makes all your previous purchases that much more powerful). So finishing my jungle item might be a nice early game spike, but only for a small window of time. After that window of time it'll just be handicapping me, and other items would have been better purchases. (And that \"window of time\" is pretty much \"until next back\").\n\nFinishing the jungle item will also hurt you even more if you need to counter-build anyone (eg: finishing your lifesteal item early to counter a Rammus). Now your crit items aren't just being delayed by your lifesteal item which is required to counter the fed Rammus, but they're also being delayed by your jungle item.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and saving my smite for monsters and only monsters also helps me farm faster and get items quicker.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2018-02-23T15:25:09.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah for IMO jungle items are only worth for:\n\nTanks, or bruiser that want to finish cinderhulk after getting some damage\nAP champs because you need the mana sustain and movement speed is nice\nSome hyper ealy burst AD champs like Vi, Panth, Lee and Kha.

Something like AP Ezreal isn't going to boost your rank unless it becomes meta. Usually these builds can be replaced by another item, multiple items or champion.\n\nMost off-meta builds are found at a lower rank, you can usually find evidence by looking at the top of the ladder in major servers. Granted, there are exceptions (for example rat irl is known for his Twitch, and jungles with him too. Pink Ward, while usually found lower on the ladder, one tricks Shaco top) but usually they are uncommon. On the opposite side of challenger is bronze, which is where weird builds are more common.

A Sona with lich bane can make a game much more different than a game in which the Sona has ardent censer. The same can happen when a tank jungler has an adaptive helm instead of a locket, or a Vayne against 2 reliable CCs who buys a zeal instead of a QSS during mid game. Ninja tabi, arguably one of the most broken items is able to completely warp the state of a lane, an assassin's power level, etc. If a Yasuo is able to buy an early ninja tabi against Zed, the lane is over, and this can turn the game into a win if Yasuo is good at the game. An ADC with a ninja tabi against something like Camille Kha'Zix reduces a ton of their damage, and if the support has one too then they lose a lot of their threat. A RoA at 10 minutes is far more different than a RoA at 20 minutes on Amumu or for any AP character in the game.
