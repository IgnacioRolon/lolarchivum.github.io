This time it's MAJOR sound issues.","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"How to reproduce:\n\nStep 1) Get phoenix stance to maximum rank by levelling up\n\nStep 2) Die while in phoenix stance\n\nStep 3) Respawn\n\nStep 4) Now EVERY stance will make the phoenix noise upon activation.\n\nStep 5) To fix the bug, die while in another stance. But if you die in pheonix stance again, it will happen again.\n\nSomething that is probably not relevant, but that I should mention anyway (in case a programmer with a different playstyle than me can't reproduce it): I always bear out of the base after respawning.\n\nAnother thing to note: I'm pretty sure I died in bear stance once, but still had the bugged \"phoenix every stance\" noise, which I'm mentioning in case it helps find an elusive piece of bugged code. I have also died other times in bear stance, and NOT had the bugged noise. It seems to reproduce 100% of the time if you die in max ranked phoenix stance though.\n\nAnd, lastly: This DOES make the skin UNPLAYABLE. A lot of Udyr players rely heavily on sound cues to play the champion properly. I am personally not using this skin until it gets fixed (which also means I hope there is a service status announcement, so I can know when it is fixed, because it takes a long time to level up in a custom game just to see if my skin is working properly)\n\nPlease fix ASAP. I haven't been able to use my $30 skin in a long time now :(.\n\nAlso relevant, are other stances doing the same thing? I haven't tested it. See below for relevant forum posts:\n\n>**Vacus:**\n> *\"One other thing that's worth testing is if this happens with other stances.  If you die while in max rank tiger, for example, does every stance make the tiger sound?  Or is it only phoenix?\"*\n>\n>**UdyrWwYi Jg ONLY:**\n> *\"This is hard because phoenix is the loudest and most noticeable. For all I know, the phoenix bug is making BOTH stance noises (eg: phoenix and turtle) at the same time. But I can't hear the turtle because phoenix is fricken loud.\"*\n\nMy GD thread: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/UUW6MiBY-spirit-guard-udyr-skin-broken-again-after-the-new-fix-need-help-reproducing-consistently-gd\n\n\n\nhttp://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130628134800/leagueoflegends/images/b/b4/Udyr_SpiritGuardSkin.jpg\n\nEDIT: Can confirm that this is happening with other max rank stances. I died in max rank turtle style, and then every stance made the shield echo noise, along with their regular sound (so its doing double sound effects every stance while active, with phoenix being the most obnoxious when it triggers the bug, because it's the loudest)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-05T18:31:24.665+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much for the detailed report!

It was doing it for ALL stances before, and not just phoenix (it would glitch and play the noise of whatever stance you died in).

Once I have properly edited and/or compressed it, and have enough extra monthly bandwidth, I will upload them for you.\n\nHow I triggered it: died in max rank turtle stance (not sure if other stances will trigger it too).\n\nWhen I respawned, every stance made the turtle shield echo noise. When I died in NON-maxed bear stance it did not remove the bug, stances kept making turtle shield noises (I don't know if dying in a different, maxed stance will turn it off - untested).\n\nEDIT: tried dying in max phoenix twice in a new game and nothing happened.
