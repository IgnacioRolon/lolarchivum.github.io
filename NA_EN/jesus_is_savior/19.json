No one wants ping spammers or flamers in your game, it has nothing to do with being weak.\n\n\n**Actual Solution that has been denied because it 'eliminates communication altogether**': Muting a player should mute their pings, Riot won't allow this because it gives muted players no option of communication. If a guy is flaming all game and ping spamming, it's extremely unlikely I want to see what he's going to say as he's already shown he's not interested in communication.\n\n**BUT WHAT IF SOMEONE JUST MUTES ALL:** They already do this, these players are not going to change just because muting now works on pings, in fact they might abuse it less now because they can't abuse ping spamming when they're muted.\n\nPeople that deny this is a problem have not been a victim of a true ping spammer. A true ping spammer can EASILY ruin your game. Of course they're not going to do well themselves because they're wasting all their attention on pinging, but that doesn't make it any better. It's akin to trying to play baseball, you're the batter, and some guy is standing around next to you dancing and screaming in your face while you're trying to hit the ball.","replies":[{"poster":"Hawckey","date":"2017-03-30T23:43:40.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I laughed so hard reading this holy fuck","replies":[{"poster":"Forced Feed","date":"2017-04-03T01:36:46.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is it so funny? you've seen each of these responses I'm guessing?","replies":[{"poster":"Hawckey","date":"2017-04-03T02:12:34.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To see just how mad some people get over shit like this","replies":[{"poster":"pokomontis","date":"2017-04-10T05:14:56.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah... the ten year old humor of 'HAHA NOT TOUCHING YOU' through a game by ping spamming.
