While there's bound to be work done on existing skins during the full rework (I'm hoping Dragon Knight and/or Infernal become actual skins and not just recolor chromas), new skins are still another matter. I can see them waiting until after the rework for a number of reasons, especially for a Legendary tier or better, because...\n\n1. Reasons of time and effort needed to make one.\n\n2. Being a rather low played champion right now, it's probably a harder sell to justify from Riot's perspective (doesn't count out chances entirely as we saw with {{champion:77}} though, and this would actually further help interest with a champion during a time Riot is putting other work into it, so it could go either way).\n\n3. I think {{champion:50}} and {{champion:20}} didn't get new skins with their updates right away either?\n\nI can see (and do hope!) that at least one skin, hopefully higher tier, will come with the rework, if not then hopefully not too long after. Right now, there's not even a 1350 or above tier skin for him (his most recent, which is anything but recent, wasn't even 975), and his skin count for his age is really low, especially considering two are essentially chromas right now.\n\nAll in all, I'd be not only disappointed but surprised if there isn't at least one new (not reworked existing) skin for {{champion:82}} by like a year from whenever his VGU lands public. It miiiiight not be that Ultimate (here's to hoping), but I would be surprised if by that point he still lacks a 1350 or above offering entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2019-02-21T17:31:26.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will remind you Morde is  getting to the Top of the list of Champions who hasn't recieved a skin in X years.

A friend's brother introduced me to this in 2012 and the free rotation that week included Morde and Jarvan IV. I started grinding IP to get Morde as my first champion and never looked back. Between friends leaving, getting tired from having played a few years (started late season 2, left sometime season... 4 or 5?), and Mordekaiser's pseudo rework that came with the juggernaut update, I sort of stopped playing for some years except for the rare game here or there until I came back late last year.\n\nI only have like ~130k mastery on him since mastery points weren't a thing the majority of the time I played him. My one friend was always heckling me that \"you don't always play Morde, but when you do, it's all the freak'n time\" and \"you don't play League of Legends, you play League of Morde versus others\". Never was really good at the game and mostly stuck to normals and playing casually, but with a friend playing again now, I'm having some fun, and this rework news is a treat so I guess I'm just praying for the best to come of it. I see Morde so infrequently that I always get excited to see another, especially a main. Hopefully the rework doesn't make him pick or ban level broken meta though.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rose Muffins","date":"2019-02-21T16:47:39.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mordepool,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=rXgqBi8w,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-02-21T08:15:19.788+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:82}} if it doesn't happen this year i don't think it ever will\n\nBut he's getting a rework.

You want a rework AND a legendary? You greedy noise.\n\nTo be fair, the rework is loooooooooong overdue, as is more skin offerings. Name a champion that...\n\n1. Is almost as old as the game...\n\n2. Yet only has three skins besides his basic (actually five, but two are chromas/recolors)...\n\n3. Doesn't even have an offering that is considered worthy of 1350 or above quality.\n\n4. Newest skin was in 2015 and was only 750 quality, not even 975.\n\nYes, there's champions without Legendary skins, and yes, there's champions with only one or two skins, sure (Rek'Sai, Ivern, and some others, the latter is getting one finally), but how many OLD, nearly original, champions only have essentially three skins, none even 1350, and the last one like almost four years ago? That list is very, very short. I wonder who else is even on it. I'm sure someone is but I'm drawing blanks, the list is that short.\n\nA rework is nice, but no new skins would be a disappointment, and the needed rework is precisely WHY no new skins were made in the last many years. NOW that the rework is happening, maybe it can happen (even if not right away).","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2019-02-21T18:12:42.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"An ultimate/Legendary would go far by way of an apology for the 2 years of  torture  riot put us through.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2019-02-21T17:23:55.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"140 champions  Chogath has 2 Legendarys \n no one likes Morde or his mains apparently.

They're already going to have his voice actor on hand for the VGU, so it's simply a matter of having that actor spit out another set of dialogue for a new skin while they have him in the studio. Granted, I don't think he's remotely worthy of an ultimate skin, but I'm just saying they could do it since they had the actor already scheduled.
