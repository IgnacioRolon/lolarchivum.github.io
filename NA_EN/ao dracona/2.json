Basically he just didn't want a new player messing up his games as much as I would have in other roles. It is easier to not feed when you aren't focusing on csing and have the poor judgment to now when to back off from doing so. \nI don't blame him, but this did send me into a state of only playing support for a long time(which wasn't that bad). Eventually I found thresh and decided he was the only fun one to play. As I learned about the champions and the game it started bothering I didn't really know what they were doing in their roles, just their abilities and combos. So have been trying to diversify my experience to other parts of the game. \nOh boy had this changed my perspective and understanding of the other roles relative to what I know best. Early jungle is broken, good jungling sends ripples throughout the whole game. A well executed lead from jungling in the first 15-20 minutes while securing objectives is so strong. Mid lane is a pain in the ass unless you use an assassin. Top, I hate and don't understand as of yet... ADC is a fight to get every last cs and get your third item as soon as possible so you can start having fun. \nOverall point being with every other roles it seems that there is a big struggle for big rewards personally, whilst the best reward for a support is getting your teammates fed and their deaths low. You do well as a support and you yourself aren't really that much better off personally then you would be if you didn't try hard at all. Worst of all even if you carry your team it wont look like or show you are carrying your team. Doing well on support at best gets you personally a win, that's it. Even if your ADC is a brain dead clot of a player you spoon fed every kill to and lead around, they will get the honor cause they had the damage and the good looking stats. \nWith support a player has to be selfless, and this is a game that in every other regard promotes selfishness to have fun.
