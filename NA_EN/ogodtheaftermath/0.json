Especially when you can buy an accoutn in literally 10 seconds for 10 bucks. Fuck you riot! make a game where you can lose because the rest of your team are literal chimps? and offer no solution to that . well my mid went 0-18 so i guess i should lose all my LP with his inbred ass. Oh, and i literally cant tell him hes being bad or ill get banned. I have to say, hey good try buddy going into that 1v4. Next time my handicapped friend! oh, you have 20 CS in a 40 min match? why does riot not restrict you to bots till you grasp the concept of this game. Or at least normals? nah, its way easier to just let peopel get triggered after dealign with this shit for 10 matches straight till they finally snap and flame. Then poof. Perma ban hammer.

Player Support will be able to look up your account, check out any games that may not have made it onto your reform card (you do not necessarily get every reported chat sent to you), and find out if there has been any error on their end. It's possible you received a glitched reform card that didn't contain all the chat logs it should have, it's possible (but unlikely) there was an error on Riot's end, and it's possible that you simply had a large number of games with minor toxicity immediately after coming off a 14-day ban, which would be sufficient to get you banned permanently. They'll be able to help you figure out which it is, although if you want to get results I'd recommend being a little more polite to the support specialist than you were in, say, the opening post of this thread.","replies":[{"poster":"OGODTheAftermath","date":"2017-03-26T23:25:59.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i played literally 1 game after my suspension, and i posted the chat log.

To me that one log is reportable (negativity and a bit of what appears to be counter-insulting the Janna), but not terribly so compared to stuff I've seen, so it's a little surprising that one game would push you over in the permanent ban. But I don't know how tolerant the system is after a 14-day ban.\n\nAgain, this is where Player Support will be able to help you more than the boards, and why I recommend that course of action. They have all the information that we on the boards lack.\n\nAnyway, just trying to help, and suggesting that is about the best anyone here will be able to do. :)","replies":[{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-03-27T00:30:05.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system becomes less tolerant the higher your punishment tier is.

Even if your team actually was made up of handicapped inbred chimpanzees, it doesn't give you the right to violate the Terms of Use and flame them.  You knew what not to do, you had only been off the temporary suspension for one game, and you chose to flame again.  You have nobody else to blame but yourself.  And while you are free to make another account, and to play on it, if you continue to act in this manner, you will probably get it banned as well.","replies":[{"poster":"OGODTheAftermath","date":"2017-03-26T23:21:48.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Wheres the flame here violating the ToS?

Calling someone outright bad for no other reason than to insult them is flaming and is against the rules.  It's also just plain bad sportsmanship.  No one wants to have to deal with someone who acts like that in a match.  If Janna starts trashtalking you, mute her, report her, and move on.  There's no reason to lower yourself to her level, especially when you are the one who was in danger of losing your account. \n\n> OGODTheAftermath: all that shit talking janna\n> OGODTheAftermath: feels bad man\n\nAnd this is not flaming, but it's bad form to taunt someone for losing, no matter what they said.\n\nAs to why do they allow cross team chat during a match?  Not all players use it to taunt or flame the other team.  Quite a few players use it to talk to friends they have on the other side, or to compliment plays made by the enemy.  It's used much more often for positive chat than it is for negative.  Individual players have the option to disable all chat if they are worried about responding to taunts.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Astrovert","date":"2017-03-26T21:45:31.867+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"chat logs or it didn't happen","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-03-26T21:53:17.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"_after they sold to a chinese company_\nLol what.
