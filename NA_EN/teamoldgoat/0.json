I clicked play again and guess who I am matched up with again on my team? The three stooges once again. \r\n\r\nRiot, when I report a person I would expect your algorithm to not match me with them the next damn game.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-08-26T08:02:34.788+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they made it so that you were not matched with the people you reported then it could be abused. Like if someone carried the enemy team and you don't want to play against them again you could report them.\n\nThis would mostly affect higher levels of play where there aren't as many people though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-08-26T15:02:59.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try waiting a few minutes next time.
