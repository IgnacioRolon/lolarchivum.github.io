With the newest windows update, I get an Pvp.net stopped working error that prevents me from launching the game.  I run the game as an admin, it launches, but once player models log into the game, it freezes and the sound is stuck.  It forces me to hard restart the computer and jump back in.  Once there,  I have some frame issue (drops to around 30, normally at 60) and the sound is digitized badly.  Once the game ends it will freeze again as the victory/defeat screen comes up or the nexus explodes.  It is unplayable like this.  I wiped all trace of league from my computer and reinstalled, I re-downloaded the latest patch.  I have tried basically everything listed as options @ https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues and https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues.  I have been playing the game for two years and never had a problem, my comp isn't the best but is only a year old.  So basically I still can't launch normally, nor play as an admin.  I also tried playing other games (Heroes of the Storm) with no freezing issues","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-06T15:18:04.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to help, but I'm a little bit confused.  If you are unable to launch a game, how are you able to join and finish a match?  The error you mentioned is likely due your network having trouble maintaining a connection to our servers.  Where exactly are you receiving the error messages, and when?  For example, when you say launching the game do you mean logging in, or loading a match?  Let me know with some more details, and we can go from there!","replies":[{"poster":"WildHawk41","date":"2016-08-06T15:50:10.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean booting up the client. I get a pvp.net error that refuses to launch the client.  So I run as an admin, and the client opens, allows me to jump into a game.  At which point I get freezes, low frames, and sound issues.  I am concerned that running as an admin may have some effect on my performance somehow.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
