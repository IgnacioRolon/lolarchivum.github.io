I was as reserved as one could possibly be given the stress the situation induced, and yet my account has been permanently banned anyway. One of the following 3 things is going to happen, im posting on this message board so you can decide.\r\n\r\na) lift the wrongful ban on my account, the syndra is the one who should be permanently banned, not myself ( i did everything i could to carry that game and had no negative comments towards teammates sans 1 mildly offensive comment to syndra when she was int feeding our lane)\r\n\r\nb) refund me the money i spent on skins for this account, its not much but if youre going to close my account that has items i paid for on it then c is going to happen\r\n\r\n\r\nc) i will file a lawsuit against RIOT, i have the message logs saved from the game and the transaction reciepts from my skin purchases, and it doesnt bother me in the slightest to pursue this in court. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nawaiting your response, cheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2018-11-07T00:32:28.575+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"d) you'll keep your punishment for breaking riot's ToS and get nothing back. \n\nYou're not the first person to make an empty threat of a lawsuit, which literally no lawyer would take.
