They don't care about what food you took a picture of. They don't care if your mother is sick or if your brother died in an accident.\r\n\r\nNobody cares.\r\n\r\nYou think that what you'll do will make an impact on the world....guess what....it won't. Not unless you're a wealthy philanthropist or a great world leader. but even then....you're still nothing.\r\n\r\nNo amount of arguing or lobbying or bribing can get the whole world to remember you. When you die, you die. There is nothing to live for. You don't get \"immortality\" through what you've done or what legacy you've left.\r\n\r\nTo the world, you're a number. A mouth to feed, a body to bury. So what do you thing you are on the internet? A somebody? \r\n\r\nWell, I can tell you right now.....you're nobody.\r\n\r\nAnd to think that even if the world *did* care about you....if the world *did* remember you, do you think the universe cares? Do you think that if an asteroid hit the Earth and wiped out everything that anyone would come for your rescue?\r\n\r\nNope. Not one single organism out there would care. Your world would be just another one lost to the chaos of nature. A statistic of the stars.\r\n\r\nNobody would care.\r\n\r\nNot even you.","replies":[]}
