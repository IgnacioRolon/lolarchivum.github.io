At night. Over the ocean. Beside a fat person. In the middle of two seats. In the middle row of the plane. With an old woman talking about her cat at home sitting to your left. And she also has bladder problems.\r\n\r\nFun.\r\n\r\nTo me, this place is boring because lurkers don't post. Circlejerks don't jerk right. Everything not League is hated. Violent sh*tposting is absent. And everyone hates everything.\r\n\r\nGreat place to be.","replies":[]}
