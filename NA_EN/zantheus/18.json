Then Darius fed Vlad. Then our support Teemo dc'd.\n\nIt was us against Vlad, Kha, Ahri(who I skillfully stopped from snowballing), Varus and Braum.\n\nHorrible game it seemed.\n\nBut we made it through.\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1599956399/34331088\n\nWe played as a team and went for objectives. But the surprising thing was....we actually won the teamfights.\n\nPlus, the 1st mid tower didn't go down until late game....Varus had ragequit by that time.\n\n\"But Zantheus, it's just a normal game.\"\n\nI don't give a shit.","replies":[]}
