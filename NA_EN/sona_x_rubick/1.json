Base damage hit skims some power off her laning phase, and the reversion of the AP ratio buff puts the W back into a more stable position powerwise. \n\nNot too sure how its changes are considered a late game nerf, unless that perception is in context of her W multigrab passive, rather than the true damage one. In relation to pre-6.9 Syndra, the W true damage is a pretty shiny upgrade, but for those who care about post 6.9 Syndra, it is a massive drop (and one I'm personally fine with).\n\nOverall, looks like there'd be easier levers to tune up and down as the number of spheres manipulated by the multigrab is ... difficult to work with, to put lightly.

I'm very happy with this approach. Thank you.\n\nShe suddenly started gaining popularity, and is now disproportionately complained about relative to her actual threat. These complaints always revolve around her ultimate, burst, and its ease of execution. Her ultimate is the last reason I enjoy playing her.\n\nThe reason I love Syndra, and the way I play her revolve around her consistent damage. It's also why I like champions like Cassiopeia, even though they play very differently. It's a play-style where you're continuously doing something and it's powerful. For Cassiopeia, the focus of this is purely on damage, while on Syndra, the focus of this is on unmatched control. Both of these feel like a better Karthus with more tools. \n\n* Q - Good range, potential to be AoE in team-fights, good damage, short cooldown.   \n* W - Great range, almost always AoE in team-fights + utility, good damage, reasonably short cooldown: can be used once per skirmish in lane.  \n* E - Great ranged utility, AoE, enough damage to kill someone escaping with low HP, reasonably short cooldown, safety from engage. \n\nWith these things, combined with the fact that you can use skills while moving, you are always in control of a situation. Her skills can't be blocked by minions, and q even makes Yasuo's windwall useless. You really have the control-tools of a support champion, with very respectable damage. All three skills work perfectly together. Please never mess with this aspect of her. Her ultimate is what doesn't fit with this control style kit, but it's become her identity, both in terms of burst, her lore, and her lane-wide stun. I (a dedicated Syndra player) wouldn't mind even if the ultimate is replaced. Of course many people would, since they associate Syndra mainly with her ultimate. That's where you dudes make decisions to make everyone happy. This is just my perspective, where I strongly don't want q,w,e changed in terms of range, damage, or cool-down. The changes I'm seeing are actually a buff to how I play her because of the true-damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prince Demand","date":"2016-12-10T01:43:18.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PVXbtNoB,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2016-12-08T02:28:11.325+0000)\n>\n> Current thinking:\n> \n> * Syndra&#x27;s ult being on a lower than average CD early leaves insufficient windows to play against her, especially if she gets ahead in lane.

How can protect herself when her movement speed is so low when Garen with mercury's tread's  is unstoppable and cant take any cc?\n2.

I have yet to see it in use, of course, but I think it's an interesting unique trait that sets her apart from say, Annie or Lux or some other mage who sets up a combo and then melts you with little to zero reaction aside from staying out of range or blocking the set up.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Coballz","date":"2016-12-08T10:14:38.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"How come champions as dominant as Syndra (ever since the MYMU touchup changes) are left untouched for so long, and when they get touched, it's this kind of half-assed nerf (because she does, quite simply, need a nerf), but a champion with no visible playtime (e.g. Kog'Maw) can get obliterated within the span of a single patch, and have it written off as a \"tradeoff\"?","replies":[{"poster":"Syndracising","date":"2016-12-08T11:25:47.817+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair they didnt care for Syndra for a LONG time before she was in MYMU where she was really bad.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PykedYoGirl","date":"2016-12-08T02:37:17.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Honestly I think this is fine.

It worked very well with the with the current W passive, but since the current W passive is gonna take a hike and get a 20% bonus true damage passive you should might as well change her Q to 15% true damage ALMOST as same as her old Q where it used to do 15% bonus magic damage to champions.
