Let&#039;s balance the game around plat and above, and here &quot;top win rate are mostly melees and not ranged&quot;, while making it unplayable for those playing in master+above. Unplayable unless you play a ranged champ top/mage mid and enjoy the fun of getting bullied+being almost useless in teamfight due to how behind you were. \nWow, i mean why isn&#039;t it fun? to be forced to play riven/irelia/poppy because {{champion:10}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:126}}  are going to destroy the shit out of you.

Time travel also already exists but isn't bent by sheer human will. So in its basic form, we can't manipulate time travel. God may not exist but higher universal powers are in effect which is why unexplainable things that defy all logic and laws happen more frequently than one cares to admit. We are but specs of dirt in a habitat in a dome called Earth. The world economy is garbage because of the presence of greed, deception and selfishness (also fixable). Global warming will never be fixed. We generate too much heat as humans as does everything we create. The Earth has to adapt to its new and ever-growing occupants & It only has 2 choices; maintain us or exterminate us.

A huge chunk of the community is either bots or perma banned rich boys who buy the bots when they hit level 30... The game isn't balanced over plat +, it's balanced around Bronze - Silver, because the majority of Gold-Diamond 5, are boosted by ppl in masters/challengers or Dia 1-2... If the Account buyers and bots are removed perma... the really really high elo might even turn out to be a good solid 10-15% of the community... \n\nIncoming comments like \"Give proof of your claims\"... Why should  I give you proof? Are you too small to just make a new account and try playing bot games for 1-2 days? You'll see old AI bots vs new AI bots... And no that aint newbies, newbies got a brain this thing doesn't... You want proof about account buyers? Ebay FTW, go check it... There's other websites and forums who do the same... Don't believe me? Then you never tried to find some... Now you'll go claiming I buy accs right? Nah... Every time I level it up on my own, no matter how annoyed I am from the meaningless perma ban... And I know that scripts and accounts are sold because I had to sell me Lineage 2 account, the same forum I did that literally sells LoL scripts for 20-30 bucks a month fee and accounts from Gold 5 to  diamond 5., with prices from 20 to 200 bucks... I reported that website to riot support over 100 times and it's still doing it... \n\nSo do enjoy.. The balancing will never be based on the actual players, it's going to stay on the majority of the community, the rich boys buying new shiny plat ect accounts... \n\nCheers.
