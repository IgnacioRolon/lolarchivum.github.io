Justice!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n I wasn't flaming or insulting anyone or having a negative attitude and I got permanently banned\n\nThis is the only game that shows when I log in can post screenshots for proof but the point of this post is to get a Rioters attention who should be able to see I'm not omitting anything\n\n\n\nMost of the typing was to my duo (zyra supp) and none of it was complaining \n-I didn't have a negative attitude, \n-the random jungler and top laner were joking around with me and my duo\n\n-when i say \"this is why you dont gank losing lanes \" its because the enemy team is  dying to us bot while trying to gank us when we're winning lane, I'm not berating anyone on my team, and it's in ally chat to my friend, im not berating anyone  all chat\n\n-my 0/8/4 fizz flames me for collecting my own wave bot lane swears at me  and i just tell him that he's trolling and he's useless (because he was, he was intentionally avoiding fights trying to cause us to lose because he spam pinged for ganks agains the enemy vlad, and our rengar didnt want to gank mid)\n\nI don't understand why I would be permanently banned for this\n\n Please enlighten me \n\nI didn''t use a single insult, I wasn't complaining, I wasn't raging,  I didn't troll, so what did I do or say that infringed on the  safe space that is summoners rift ?\n\nWhat is it that made me among the 0.0006% of players toxic enough to receive a permanent ban since my 14 day ban ?\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nGame

chat)   (we killed them when they tried to gank us)\ninyourdreamskid: that right there\ninyourdreamskid: is why you dont gank losing lanes  \ninyourdreamskid: lol\n\n(my jungle thought I was talking to him for some reason)\ninyourdreamskid: if you cant read english then i cant help you\n\n(they come again and we kill them again) (again ally chat)\ninyourdreamskid: they dont learn\ninyourdreamskid: they keep coming here\ninyourdreamskid: lmao\n\n(still ally chat)  (they came bot AGAIN, this time it worked and they got us XD )\ninyourdreamskid: damn i really thought theyd stop coming bot at this point lmao\ninyourdreamskid: how come I never get baby sat like that\n\n(i dont remember what chat or what this was about tbh )\ninyourdreamskid: wtf is he doing lol\n\n(this was all chat tho )\ninyourdreamskid: pretty sure you had this game in the bag until you all decided to fista in the lost bot lane lol\ninyourdreamskid: fiesta*\ninyourdreamskid: shoulda camped winning lanes lol\n\n(ally chat)\ninyourdreamskid: damn\ninyourdreamskid: did you see that 1 shot on tlaiyah LMAO\ninyourdreamskid: I Q'd the minion and 1 shot her with my ult\ninyourdreamskid: lol yeah\ninyourdreamskid: 2nd time mf btw lmao\ninyourdreamskid: irelia used e\n\nI was doing golems botside , as bot wave pushed to me, fizz comes from base to run bot then rages / flames when i take the wave bot)\n\n(to fizz ally chat after he rages about the cs )\ninyourdreamskid: look at your map\ninyourdreamskid: rotate properly\n\n\"complains he has no farm or kills\"\n\ninyourdreamskid: because you're garbage\n\n(all chat)\ninyourdreamskid: See we're stomping you and fizz is tilting and trolling XD imagine if instead of inting bot with your bot lane you camped him\n\n(fizz continues to rage and says hes not trolling even ho he has 4 kill participation in a stomp, and is actively avoiding fights intentionally )\n\ninyourdreamskid: your raging and trolling lol\ninyourdreamskid: yeah i took farm as a useful player from aa useless player\ninyourdreamskid: you have 4 kp you're intentionally not  showing in fights to try and lose lol\ninyourdreamskid: thats not trolling ?\ninyourdreamskid: what is your arguement here\ninyourdreamskid: when we are ahead tremendously as a team\ninyourdreamskid: you dont  need to catch up as an individual\n\n* he keeps raging but i just ignore him and continue to push our win*\n\n\ninyourdreamskid: group and end\n\n(which is exactly what everyone except fizz did, we won the game without him , game literally ends right there while he's \"catching up\" and raging/flaming)\n \nPost-Game\n\n(someone on enemy team asks how their fed eve ended up feeding)\n\ninyourdreamskid: she camped her losing bot  with her lead\ninyourdreamskid: fizz you need to learn when you're tremendously ahead as a team, you being behind as an individual is irrleveant\ninyourdreamskid: get over yourself and get out of your own way\ninyourdreamskid:

Helping players reform\n2.) Shielding others from the behavior, at a cost.\n\nWe used to issue chat restrictions that **essentially scaled indefinitely**.\n\nWe were able to determine that after a certain point the penalty no longer helped with reform. The 10-game and 25-game counts for chat restrictions are based on data that they were both light enough, and felt strict enough to encourage people to understand their behavior is unacceptable in game and change it.\n\nWe also saw that the players in this 'large restriction' category defaulted to gameplay altering means of harassing their team. It caused an increase in feeding and trolling.\n\nThe sample size of this population and time frame is huge. Essentially the time spanning from the introduction of chat restrictions to the introduction of IFS.\"\n\n\nwhat are you basing your claim on?","replies":[{"poster":"jYxQcdO9O4","date":"2018-08-28T14:19:46.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why would he even need a permamute? did you even read OP's chat log ?","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-08-29T02:34:28.326+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Char was replying to this post.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Veralion,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7Vt0eNj4,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-08-26T10:39:55.458+0000)\n>\n> Time to make a new account and be hella toxic to new players, thus driving them off and helping to kill the game.
