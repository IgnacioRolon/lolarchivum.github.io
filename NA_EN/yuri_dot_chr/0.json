I haven&#039;t touched it when I downloaded it because my computer can&#039;t handle all of the visual quality it has. Just today I tried it because I was curious on how it&#039;s doing. I tried Draft Mode and I wasn&#039;t even able to pick my Champion or change my Masteries. So i was forced to dodge cause I didn&#039;t want to be at a disadvantage or waste the other players time. The client lags so much that it costs me 10 seconds for each click I do. Champion, Mastery, Rune, etc. That gives me VERY little time to figure out what/how I&#039;m going to play.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t have the best computer there is. I feel like players that have top-notch computers can only play on the Alpha Client. I Hope soon that the client doesn&#039;t use so much resources in order to run smoothly. I even checked the &quot;Disable Animation&quot; box to see if that would help, but the animations are still there and it didn&#039;t do much to help.\r\n\r\nI love the client. I really do. But I just can&#039;t play it until it works very well for, not only for me, ALL players that don&#039;t have top-notch computers. Continue on making the Client better and I hope I can play on it soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Credo","date":"2016-08-31T02:35:24.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We know that performance is an important issue and we're continually trying to improve it as we go along to get better and better.
