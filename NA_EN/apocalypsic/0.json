Can't play the game like that at all, it's too risky and feels horrible because it's totally out of our hands :/","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-23T20:44:52.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've been seeing some issues with players in the Texas area experiencing issues along their route to the server. It's likely that you'll need to reach out to your ISP tier 2 support for them to investigate and resolve the issue. If you'd like, you can run a set of traceroutes and post their results here so I can take a look and point out where any issues may lie.\n\nIf you'd like to do this, I recommend grabbing the [WinMTR application](http://winmtr.net/), then running a trace with the IP address 104.160.131.1 for 5 minutes. After you've passed 5 minutes, simply export the results as text and paste them in a reply to this post. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
