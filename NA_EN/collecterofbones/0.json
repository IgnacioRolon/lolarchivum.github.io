It’s the fact they are told “Don't TAKE THE KILL” don’t take farm. Just poke and ward like what are you gonna make them do st the point where ether the support player is now gonna do what your saying and not enjoy it thus not being effective enough or they are going to break the rules so they can enjoy the role. In better terms it’s what the adcs want the supports to do but this isn’t really a job it’s littlery being a slave, thus you see it in front as not so many people play support b/c they don’t want to do boring things such as warding and going out of their way to get an adc a lead.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-05-23T02:26:29.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Picking Kayle support isnt trolling.
