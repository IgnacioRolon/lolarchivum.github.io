While attempting to play any game(I've attempted with ARAM, 5's, 3's, and bot games) after i attempt to enter champion select there is a black screen. The launcher is still responding because i can still view friends list, messages, and notifications without issue but there is no champion select sounds or well anything but while exiting i still get the message you get for leaving at the screen. Is there a fix for this? Is it on my end? I've attempted to uninstall/ reinstall twice.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-14T22:37:19.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Black screens in the client, especially when trying to hop into champ select, are often caused by your client not being able to establish a good connection to the servers. There are a lot of factors that could be causing this, but by far the most likely are incompatible network configurations that don't play well with League. I recommend working through the steps in our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step to resolving this.\n\nLet me know if those steps resolved the issue.","replies":[]}]}
