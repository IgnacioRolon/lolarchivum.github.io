Fortunately this only happens once per game and within the first 15 minutes of the game.  Still, this is all kinds of annoying and need a definitive solution here.  Strangely enough when I go do a custom game to practice cs, I never get disconnected.\n\nI've tried the following already:\nRan the Hextech Tool\nUsed a WiFi extender\nDirectly connect to WiFi extender via ethernet cable\nRelease/Renew IP and Flush DNS\n\nThings I can't/will not do:\nMove my entire setup upstairs to where the router is.  I much prefer it staying in my room.\nPort Forwarding: My router is one supplied by Optimum.  Going into the port forwarding section of the routing screen only allows inputting of individual ports and not port ranges.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-07T04:22:03.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While WiFi is convenient, it's problematic for games like League that rely **heavily** on a steady stream of packets with consistent latency. You may need to temporarily move your setup to confirm whether or not this is an issue with your network adapter or with the router itself.\n\nRegardless, working through the steps in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) is a good start in troubleshooting this. Let me know if they caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
