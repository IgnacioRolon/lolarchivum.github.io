I have frequently done premade 4 and 5 man team builders with friends and the queues have been almost near instant.

When you have a 5 man you wait to be  matched with another 5 man with a comparable team MMR (average mmr of teammates). TB knows if you are in a premade or not (since you had to invite them instead of wait for players) and its unfair to match a 5 man premade against 5 solo queue players.
