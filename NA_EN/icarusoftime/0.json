This is based on me playing mid and not being able to do much but use my E to hit them and speed boost someone to attack. Thank you for taking this into consideration! I also would like for a visual update on Nunu and also Nathan, because they don't look that good in game","replies":[{"poster":"Rustling Bush","date":"2016-04-12T03:51:49.334+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot decides what champions they want where.
