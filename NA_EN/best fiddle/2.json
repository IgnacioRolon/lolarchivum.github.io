Some players will abuse champions abilities but with bad timing. \r\n\r\nExample: \r\n\r\nScenario 1: Fizz dodged 1 ability, but the opponent has an ultimate waiting. Gz! you were able to easily dodge an ability, but still got baited. (Possibly dead)\r\n\r\nScenario 2: Fizz takes an ability, but dodge&#039;s an ultimate.. (Possible kill and leaves a larger window for counter) \r\n\r\nPressing abilities is easy, but to tie them together to make the champion work, is an entirely new struggle.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-09-09T05:08:19.893+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"True, but what about champions that are EASY?\n\nChampions with little to no skillshots, Garen?\n\nchampions with no hard mechanics, Pantheon?\n\ntelling people to stop existing, MORE GAREN?\n\nThere are champions easy to use, but require hard mechanics, but on the other hand, there are champions that are easy, and are devoid of any brain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zed Boss","date":"2018-09-09T05:06:45.503+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"perfect example is when a Yasuo is E'ing through everyone like Sephiroth and ends up with a clap","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sex With Annie","date":"2018-09-09T16:52:58.493+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"being able to use your abilities incorrectly doesn't mean a champion isn't easy, they're still easy lmao","replies":[{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2018-09-09T17:39:39.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are no hard champions in the game then.

Yea a bad Zed is going to feed, doesn't mean he won't still be difficult to lane against because of how free a lot of his damage is.","replies":[{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2018-09-09T17:38:50.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are no \"hard\" mechanical champions in this game. Even Azir or Kalista basic mechanics can be learned after 5 games. OP brought a very fair point, that nearly every champion have small nuances which can make them hard. \n\nI have seen a lot of terrible Azirs who still managed to do a lot due to how hit basics work. Boards are basically easy-shaming assassins lately, but they do truly believe that mages/adcs are harder than rest of the champions, and that's plain out stupid","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2018-09-09T18:35:11.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again you are misunderstanding what people are saying when they say easy... Its not easy to effectively play most assassins, its easy however to do a shit ton of damage with them. You may die because you don't know how to play the champion, but you also just killed 2 people instantly with barely any counterplay.  \n\nAdc champions themselves are relatively simple in design, however the mechanics of playing markmen is what makes it difficult for most. Mages are not hard and I have never seen anyone say they are.","replies":[{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2018-09-09T20:27:10.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that's the point really. It's easy to do a lot of damage as assassins and then die. But it's easy to do a lot of damage with mages and die too. With ADCs it maybe isn't as easy as with mages, but doing damage to enemy tanks isn't really hard too. \n\nAlso let's be fair. Assassins don't go in 2 vs 1 and win these unless they're named Akali/LeBlanc. Zed can go in, kill one person and then die, but bad Zeds usually will blow entire kit on one person. I understand a lot of players don't like assassins, and i could agree that braindead Zed can kill one guy at one dive. But two or more? No chance.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ratpie","date":"2018-09-09T18:20:56.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it matters which game mode you are talking about.\nPremade with organization is very different play for champs like Zed or AD burst champs.\n\nSince most people are not playing in the LCS and are solo q (ranked or unranked), Zed is a pretty easy champ to melt people with, especially in solo q.   Most AD burst champs right now are so strong that  you can pretty much ignore the macro play of the game because you can just melt people.  Solo q has so little cooperation between players that their damage (which in an organized game can be countered) is a bit out of control.\n\nSo he really is easy, unless he is in higher ranks where things get more organized.","replies":[]},{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-09-09T07:22:01.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Similar goes in the opposite way to champs like {{champion:22}} who has really easy mechanics but is far from easy to play because you have to deal with all the enemy threads with low resources in terms of peel.\n\nHowever I agree that champs with more tools like Zed are also hard to play and to maximaze the use of these \"tricks\"","replies":[]}]}
