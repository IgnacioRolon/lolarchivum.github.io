Im playing a game , not going too well , my top laner is flaming my mid laner and my mid laner is flaming my support and top laner. Later on in the middle of our bad game I say &#039;The flame goes round and round&#039; Now i&#039;m getting picked on by my top laner &#039;Lee ur 3/6&#039; &#039;WHY DO YOU AND ZIGGS KEEP DOING STUPID STUFF&#039;. At the end of the game i say a report for you! and a report for you! I click my home button , You have been Reported for harrassment and verbal abuse. Really? I have not said much all game. Most of the things i said were ayyy after we killed some1. If somebody False reports me, why show it infront of my face. Just let it happen so i dont have anxiety of getting banned in the next 10 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"UmJtuVyqrg","date":"2016-01-31T15:11:09.241+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes apparently saying in chat that you are reporting is against the rules from what I gather.

We tell you first, then we check the validity of reports. I understand this can be confusing at times, but if you didn't do anything wrong you have nothing to worry about. If the reports weren't valid, then you can disregard the message.","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2016-01-31T22:55:56.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you should update the message.
