At the end of the game i did not say anything at all , while our swain was still yelling at end game chat. I reported the swain, and added him , i told him that he actually should stop because he could get banned , trying to help out someone here because i know how it feels to be banned. And turns out he and corki reported me for flaming , maybe even the enemy team because swain was telling them i was crying and im a troll in all chat for a while. Everything i said was just defending myself and blitz , I know i can just mute people , but it isn&#039;t as easy as it sounds when you dont just want to take the hate and you want to defend urself from being made fun of. Hopefully i can get some help , because this just seems unfair , how someone can flame you so badly and just in defence of yourself you get banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Malhammers","date":"2016-02-08T23:56:45.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would you include yourself in their argument.
