After champion select, when the summoner so are preparing to begin the game, I can&#039;t see the borders and splash art of any of the champions. It is just a black square. I can see their summoner names, summoner spells, but not the picture. I get into a game, we all select our champions and when the game says, &quot;Prepare Yourselves. The game is about to begin,&quot; the loading screen where you see your ping and the percentage everyone is loading at, my game shows black boxes at where the champion splash art is suppose to be. Please help!","replies":[{"poster":"BarbieQ246","date":"2015-11-15T22:34:54.890+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry.

I have the same issue, and it's extremely annoying because you can't see the beautiful splash art, skins, and borders! I hope Riot will fix this soon.
