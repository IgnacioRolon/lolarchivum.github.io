I didn't play tanks because of the tank meta, it's because I simply prefer playing them to most damage-focused top laners.

They have the inherent weakness of getting kited. Unfortunately these items exist {{item:3742}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3053}} Juggernauts are not bad, it is their synergy with items that make them terror. These items effectively remove their weaknesses and lets them scale well into late game which is the meta right now. Though realistically it is rather nice to have items and champions synergize so well, it would be nice if other types of champions should synergize with their items too.\n\nReason #3: 99% of tanks have been constantly nerfed AND their items. Again this was to make sure there would be no late game tanks, not even the infinite stacking {{champion:14}} Or the ADC hating {{champion:113}} This doesn't make sense to have these two mid game champions, and these two got the brunt of it. In a meta where late game is key, there are almost no tanks. The item {{item:3709}} {{item:3717}} {{item:3721}} {{item:3725}} was constantly nerfed to beyond the point of \"better nerf Irelia\" joke. Granted as a tank player I agree that released Cinderhulk was just plain STUPID! But it was nerfed to a good spot, then nerfed again for ... worlds? I don't know. Top that off at patch 5.16 the same patch where Juggernauts and their items came out, {{item:3143}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3110}} were also nerfed. The reason behind the nerfs were more than likely to make sure Juggernauts do not abuse them. Can you imagine {{champion:122}} running around with pre-nerfed {{item:3075}} ? I dare not.\n\nDespite all of these the sleeper op only late game tank {{champion:54}} is seeing play. This is the tank that all other tanks want to be like. A tank that was buffed up instead of nerfed, and even with the items nerf, he and {{champion:33}} were the only ones who loves the new {{item:3075}} . A weak early game but with a rewarding late game who's kit make it so that he laughs off a 6 item {{champion:67}} as he drinks her tears. He is also a top lane tank, reason you're seeing a lot of him now. He's the only arguable real tank left, though probably not for long so if ya love tanks, learn him and abuse him while ya can.","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2015-10-28T02:37:41.162+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malphy is also the only tank that can reliably deal with fiora/yas and some juggs (GP being an outlier and doing well against the rock) and still have an impact even if he loses lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sorgklaan","date":"2015-10-27T20:05:42.165+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Singed is still the king tank of toplane.","replies":[{"poster":"cFlame","date":"2015-10-28T00:24:33.885+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least, in most match ups. {{champion:75}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2015-10-27T14:33:42.704+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"because darius and garen are just ruining their day with true damage ults, and other champs are just roaming top and getting free kills on them because tanks often lack escapes. \n\ngenerally top lane wants to push, take turrets quickly, and force people to go cover the pushing lane to prevent turret loss, and you can go 5v4 some other objective, thats whats popular right now. except not a lot of tanks can really take the beating top lane right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2015-10-27T23:58:27.399+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't deal damage, you don't get farm.\n\nPure tanks just don't deal enough damage or bring enough to a team composition.\n\nRiot has continually pushed MORE AND MORE damage into the game to the point that even having a full item lead as a pure tank doesn't mean you are actually stronger.\n\nLook at how they decided to buff Mundo, they just gave him more damage.\n\nPure Tanks were supposed to be \"Neutralizers\"  able to sit in lane and minimize the punishment high-damage split pushers did and then translate into team fights by being harder to focus down with great utility.\n\nPure Tanks just get destroyed in lane now, outscaled, outsplitpushed, and have shittier itemization.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2015-10-28T07:37:45.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spot on sadly, cannot upvote enough.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-10-27T21:12:28.538+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look at why Tahm top is powerful, because while you can poke him down, if he manages to get on you then he punishes you for it.
