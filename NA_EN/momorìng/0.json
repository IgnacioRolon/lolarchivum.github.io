I recently received a new laptop and tried to reinstall League on it. When I did, I kept getting these two errors.\r\nhttp://imgur.com/kA6VxDf\r\nhttp://imgur.com/PYz1TM4\r\nI've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Microsoft Visual C++ 2005, but it gives me the same error (first picture). I also tried searching up other solutions, but they didn't seem to work for me. In addition, I had reset my laptop as well in hopes for the problem to be solved.  I'm not too sure what to do since I'm not a very technical person, so please help! \r\n\r\nThank you so much!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-14T02:34:08.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue often happens if you haven't installed all the latest Windows updates.
