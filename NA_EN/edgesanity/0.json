There have probably been dozens of posts about this topic.  \r\n\r\nBut it still has to be said.  \r\n\r\nThis community is so toxic that people who play it don't even realize how warped their LoL version of morality has become. \r\n\r\nI haven't played in a couple years.  Decided to install and try it out again.  I made the mistake of saying at the beginning, \"hey guys, haven't played for a while, don't be too hard on me.\"  I should have known that saying that to 4 LoL players would be like telling 4 sharks, \"hey, I fell in the water, could you help me out?\"--but having been away from this toxic community for a while, I simply behaved as normal people do in society.  Of course my entire team starts insulting me, saying I suck, blaming every death they get on me, blaming me for the loss.  I stayed calm and didn't insult anyone, which seemed to only upset them more.  At the end of the game they all decided they were going to report me.  Not only that, but they told the other team to report me, and the other team just agreed because they were asked to.\r\n\r\nTo try to make one of the guys understand that telling your teammates they suck doesn't help anything, I presented him with an analogy.  I said, \"Tom Brady is better than the other 52 players on his team.  Do you think he constantly tears them down and says they suck?\"  The guy insisted that, yes, he thinks Tom Brady does, in fact, tell all his teammates that they suck.  Because, according to this exemplary LoL player, they do suck so of course he tells them they suck.\r\n\r\nAnyway, in the morality of LoL, if you join a game in which you are the lowest in skill level, and all 4 of your teammates insult you the entire game and report you, you're the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"TryMucinex","date":"2017-08-30T20:55:18.794+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think I played over 4,000 games of League of Legends or something xD. I don't think anything/anyone had made a dent in the way I feel or act. \nI never feel stressed, anger, or whatever in any game modes such as Ranked. I never retaliate in a cocky/sly/mischievous manner, with no intention to further stir the flame or patronize my teammates or enemies. I never feel stressed, anger, or whatever in any game modes such as ranked (I always try to learn and do better, and do my best [it's fun]) despite the turmoils I have in games (feeders, trolls, flamers, etc.). If I'm unable to calm them down effectively (no patronizing, condescending, or rude words), I usually have to stay quiet. I don't have all teh wise words o' wisdom to support my teammates... yet xP? \nFor others, if they seriously let something like this affect their mentality/personality/whatever, they probably didn't have the capability or mental development to withstand it. But it's like that for almost everyone, even presidents, doctors, police officers, hobos, bodybuilders. Mental development is a lot harder than physical development now in the growing technology world from what I've seen apparently.","replies":[{"poster":"La Belle Sauvage","date":"2017-08-30T21:00:30.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Excellent Post.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"La Belle Sauvage","date":"2017-08-30T20:13:36.299+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"First, let me apologize that you experienced that.

I dont know what kinda dick players are playing on NA but i guarantee you that a psycho or sociopath wouldn't lose his time on this game. And punishments are already harsh enough. Punishments  are: 10 game chat restriciton, 25 game chat restriciton, 14 days ban, perma ban. What else you want ?  And even this punishment system is buggy as hell and doesnt work as intended. It's all because there are programmed  bad words \"fuck you\" \"you're shit\", \"kill yourself\", \"kys\", etc. and if system recognizes one of those words-sentences you will get banned after a 1 report. It doesnt matter if you were quoting someone or you were joking or stuff like that. I've been told  to kill myself by my teammate, and i said \"kys ????\", only quoting, got reported by that stupid premade, and got a 14 day suspension , and ofc i won't get my plat rewards. Countless times i jumped from 10 games chat restrict to 2 weeks ban or even a perma ban, simply because the \"machine\" is the one who bans, and im pretty sure there  has to be a few \"If\" added by developers, because skipping punishment level is not okay. And also, i've noticed that bad things in this game are more dominating than a good ones. \nExample:\nGo on a 12 games winning streak -> Your mmr will be better than your division for like 50-100 poiints\nGo on a  3 games losing streak after -> Your mmr will be lower than your division, your LP gains will be abnormaly low.\nFlame -> Go on a 10 games chat restriction\nFlame for the same amount -> Skip 25 game chat restriction, get instant 14 day ban.\nEtc etc.\nHonestly, at this point i think they just removed a 25 game chat restriction and just made us go from 10 games chat r. to 14 day ban. Even my friends didnt receive a 25 game chat restriction for  like a season. Pretty sure its removed. Just to get rid of flamers, but save trolls and feeders <3.\n\nTLDR: No, i think there shouldnt be more punishments. The only punishment left is IP ban, which would massively cut down their $$ gain and active player number.

I don't know... I think it's made me a more patient person. I have a much higher tolerance to BS and can brush things off a lot easier after League because of having to deal with horrible people and watching their behavior devolve and thinking \"shit I don't ever want to be like that person.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"tribunalisrigged","date":"2017-08-30T22:19:07.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're in a giant social experiment, they are using the meta data to learn ways to better control humanity.

The system is flawed they know it we know it, the only thing that will change it is forcing them to follow real laws rather than made up ones they control the outcome of. Most of the toxic people i have met over the years of playing this have been non-north Americans. They come here with grudges and hatred, they want their turn to be hollywood and watch out they will tilt you in ways that only makes it easier for them.\n\nAll of league is based off this ideology:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6Ob5ne70a4","replies":[]},{"poster":"DariusDemiurge","date":"2017-08-30T21:31:33.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To the title, false it simply magnifies the bad side that was forged long ago do to the scum of humanity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oelyk","date":"2017-08-30T21:24:19.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It gives me a place to vent my IRL anxiety.

After I while when I started to take the game more seriously I become pretty toxic (:/ sry for anyone I flamed back them). It took me a while but when I finally got to gold, I had super friendly and nice team mates pretty much every game. I dunno what happened, but I basically stopped being toxic. Not sure if this game actually made my mental health better (or worse), but I have finally realized that the mute option is one of the best features in the game :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ginger976","date":"2017-08-30T20:41:33.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like to think that LoL just gave me the right outlet to achieve my true final form.","replies":[]}]}
