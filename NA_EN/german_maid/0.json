I'm looking for a team that actually analyzes their plan and their gameplay, and focuses on improving as a team rather than demeaning an individual for a personal mistake. (Raging has never been the most effective way to improve.) Ideally, the environment while practicing would be friendly, focused on improving, and so rife with constructive criticism and thoughts on how to play better in the future. The environment during a more serious match or scrim should be positive and focused on coordinating movement as a team, and thinking about the best way to win the game regardless of whether we have a lead or a deficit. I want teammates that can consistently meet the practice schedule in order to put in the necessary time playing as a team. I'm looking for a place where I can grow personally as a player and have a good time playing the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolfhardt","date":"2015-03-15T06:30:40.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name: Svane Vulfbad\nAge: 23\nSeason 4 Rank: Gold 1\nSeason 5 Rank: Plat 4\nRole: Mid\nTop 5 Champions:{{champion:31}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:55}}\n{{champion:40}} \nWhat are you looking for in a team?

I think it's weak and doesn't show much about a player. Filling out this simple application would only show you facts that are pretty much irrelevant. Knowing a person's rank and main champions doesn't tell you anything about that person. Yes, I've read the entire post, here's a Janna icon for you: {{champion:40}} \n\nAs mentioned before, I started playing League of Legends in Season 3, starting off as a top main. I liked off-meta champions at the time such as {{champion:114}}  and {{champion:133}}  (snowballing is fun). However, this only got me to **Silver I**. From here, I decided to learn how to jungle (I never touched the jungle in Season 3), and this help me learn the game. Jungling had helped me learn how the flow of the game works; when to take objectives, when to roam, when to chase, and when to flee. With this knowledge, I skyrocketed to **Platinum III**. After learning the basis of the game, I decided to transfer these skills to toxic champions ({{champion:76}} ,{{champion:105}} ,{{champion:103}} ). These overpowered champions combined with my sense of the game allowed me to reach **Diamond V** just shy of the end of Season 4. However, I do believe this was a slump, as during the pre-season for Season 5, I climbed all the way up to **Diamond II**.\n\nRight now you must be thinking, \"Okay, this guy mains top, jungle, *and* mid. What \\*\\*\\*\\*ing role role is this guy applying for?\" Well you see, I perform well on mages and assassins, but that's only when I'm the leader. This is often not the case in solo queue, so I transitioned to (wait for it) a marksman (seriously, who *actually* uses that word)! As a marksman, I can just play the game and focus on my performance. I can just sit back and follow the calls. I can play the game for fun (and that's what a game is for, right). \n\nI am very dedicated to teams, and I have been dedicated to previous teams. My previous teams had been quite casual, and I'm hoping for a more competitive environment. I am available between the posted times, but I do take a dinner break between 08:30 - 09:30 (flexible). \n\nTL;DR - I read your post, I would appreciate it if you read my application.","replies":[{"poster":"German Maid","date":"2015-03-14T05:45:16.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=the real will,realm=NA,application-id=K6EGEal2,discussion-id=Fb39TrOy,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-03-14T04:45:32.289+0000)\n>\n> Hello, my name is **William Nguyen**, and my in-game name is **the real will**.
