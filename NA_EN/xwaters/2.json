Taric has heals, no mobility, one stun, and a damage negation ult for his team.\n\nThe only similarities are they are both tanky like any number of bot lane supports, they both aa as part of their passives although Naut wants to hit lots of different people, and they both have shields.\n\nI mean I can see it for people who played old Taric, he was a lot more similar to Nautilus with excessive AOE damage, point and click CC, and way more damage than anyone expects.

Some people aren't that good at the game, so they play in Bronze and Silver. The fact that there are bad players will never change (though the bad players might become better, others may become worse, or new players will fill in the hole).
