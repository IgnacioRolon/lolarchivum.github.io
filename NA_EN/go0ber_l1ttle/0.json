We learned a lot from this experience including how players would react if they \"only\" had a Team Builder-like experience to play.\n\nHowever, we ended the experiment around April 27th, 2014 and moved Team Builder back to Level 25 because we wanted to make some fundamental changes to Team Builder's design (like just having players choose Positions, not Positions + Role + Champions) and the matchmaking (how we distributed experience of players in a low level game because veteran friends tend to frequently play with their newbie friends). We also had a few design improvements to avoid new players getting trapped in weird combinations like \"Taric Marksman\" because they read the description of Taric and felt that it was appropriate, but then ended up being rejected from lots of teams.\n\nWe found out that some servers (like NA) had their Team Builder levels reset to low levels again, and left it that way for a bit longer to continue collecting some data to inform the new Team Builder Draft design.\n\nWe're confident in the new Team Builder design now, and believe it's a great experience even for low level players that can replace some of the low level experiences and really help players onboard into the League experience. So to avoid players falling into some of the traps in Team Builder \"Classic\" that I mentioned above, we're going to keep it at Level 25 until we can roll out the new Team Builder design. I know this might not be a popular decision in the short-term, but we're looking forward to having new players experience the new Team Builder design, and would rather them \"level\" up in League playing Normal Blind Pick for now because the queue times are just much quicker, and match quality is a bit better.","replies":[{"poster":"56552559_DEL","date":"2015-05-27T20:30:26.527+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":5,"body":"From now on, could you guys at Riot start giving a better heads up for when you do this shit instead of leaving everyone in the dark and eventually pissing us off?\n\nThis is really getting annoying.
