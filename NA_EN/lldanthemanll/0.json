I liked the playstyle even tho many of the community didn't. He was my champion. I think this is how many of the Aurelion Sol players felt. After his rework, I can confidently say he is now the single most useless champion in the game. I understand his playstyle wasn't for everyone, but what is wrong with that? It was something for me and all the other Sol mains out there. The changes made to him have ruined him and I feel they should revert him back to his original kit and find other alternatives to buffing him or making him easier to pick up, but this iteration of Sol is utter trash.
