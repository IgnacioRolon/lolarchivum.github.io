It feels very fitting for this skin line. Would you mind sharing some of your thought process for what you thought the VO should sound like, what approaches you took when designing?","replies":[{"poster":"VØIÐ","date":"2018-03-29T19:42:27.139+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, I firstly glanced at the other Dark Star skins for other champions {{champion:412}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:59}} \n\n>***\n\nDark Star {{champion:412}} and Dark Star {{champion:59}}  were the only skins out of the whole skin line with edited voice effects, but I was aware that thresh received a complete new voice due to being a 1820rp skin. \n\nBut what I found a little surprising is that some of the other Dark Star skins {{champion:110}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:61}} didn't receive any to no changes to their voices. I know voice effects are primarily a 1820rp skin line thing but there are some exceptions like the Program skin line where {{champion:16}} has a majorly different voice sound for only being a 1350rp skin.\n\n>***\n\nAnyway in terms of how I thought the voice should sound like, I took a major inspiration from Dark Star {{champion:412}} Since they were both technically released at the same time for a purpose since there was a trailer featuring both skins being showcased in-game.\n\nIn case you were curious, I used Adobe Audition to produce this effect. I asked a Rioter not a while back on what audio software they used and Adobe Audition was a good choice I was told but I was also told that you also use other software due to more editing choice complexity.\n\nI also read Dark Star Varus's skin lore, and it mentioned that he was \"erasing entire planetary systems as if they were never there\". Looking at his splashart he is charging his Q and just blasting planets into pieces. I really wanted to bring out the sinister/destruction feel that he has since he was also called a \"interstellar titan containing multitudes within his eldritch mind\".\n\nThat's something that I thought both {{champion:412}} and {{champion:110}} shared most than the other Dark Star skins. In addition I think the final outcome ended up fitting the titan feel a lot, if I do say so myself.\n\n>***\n\nOne more thing, Varus was only one of the voices that I had edited before. I can post more of my edits on here, but the reason why I haven't done so is because I don't think that's something that some people are that interested in usually.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"º Kindred º","date":"2018-03-29T20:39:32.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"25th second\n\n**_O O F_**","replies":[{"poster":"VØIÐ","date":"2018-03-29T21:11:25.651+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lol, I love it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kmathieu2220","date":"2018-03-29T19:43:38.658+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"A liiiiiiittle tooooo processed but I like idea.
