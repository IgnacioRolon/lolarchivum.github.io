Our Audio Team uses several different software, but I personally use Nuendo as my main tool and Adobe Audition for final mastering and batching. Audition is a great piece of software, so I'm happy you use it!\n\nIn terms of plugins for processing, it really depends on the type and timbre of the actor's voice and what characteristics we want to add to them. In general, my go-to's are Altiverb, Fabfilter plugins, GRM Tools, Soundtoys, Ozone, Waves DeEsser & Rbass.\n\nIf you have other questions, feel free to ask! :)","replies":[{"poster":"CleverCactus","date":"2018-03-15T23:01:46.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you guys make sound effects for abilities?

Your choice in DAW is somewhat inconsequential. What I believe you're interested in is what's best to generate really effected voices (like Bane in Batman or Xerxes in 300). The ability to do that lays in your **plug ins**. \n\nI'll use an analogy.\n\nIf we're talking about the ability for a person to express themselves to others, humanity has lots of \"DAWs\" with agreed upon rule sets - Speaking, Writing, Films, Music, etc. Lets pretend our \"DAW\" is Writing. Well, to write well it's assumed you need a good vocabulary. The more words you know, the more ideas you can express by writing. Plug-ins are your vocabulary, they're your ability to express really precise ideas within the system, but they're not effective _because_ of the system, rather because of how you use them.\n\nWas that way too hand wave-y??

Maybe someone else can speak more to it than I can.

For example, Aurelion Sol's vocal processing uses a special cosmic/sparkly sound effect with a really long tail to give him his cosmic otherworldliness characteristic to his voice. The cool thing about this is the actor's voice excites the custom IR, so the effect is molded around the actor's voice. Altiverb let's you use custom IR files, so experimenting is fun and easy to do.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ahferroin7","date":"2018-03-17T00:29:18.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd argue part of it can be what software you use just as well as how you use it, but it also comes down to what you _can_ use.  Not everyone can afford Adobe software, and not everyone uses Windows or Mac (I actually know a huge number of people who insist on using Linux for multimedia work, especially when dealing with the recording side of things, simply because of the better latency).\n\nFWIW on the note of Audacity, it's decent in terms of usability, and the FFMPEG integration is wonderful for codec and container support, though I'm personally more a fan of [SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) (which I'd be willing to bet most people here have probably never heard of), but I also mostly do batch-processing work, not fine-detail stuff that you would typically need a graphical environment to do.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2018-03-15T22:19:15.176+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you also do the processing for localized languages? or only english?","replies":[{"poster":"Ampson","date":"2018-03-15T23:28:28.935+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, DeadUnborn - That's a great question!

Trying to keep the essence the same across 17 different languages has its fair share of challenges, but we trust one another in bringing to life each and every Champion and Skin we release. It definitely places a lot of trust in the recipe, so we try to make it as detailed and approachable as possible while working to keep the lines of communication open and constant across different time zones. Our Localization team is A-MA-ZING. :)\n\nAlso, our Localization team does a great job translating Champions so that they resonate with that region's taste and culture, so I can totally see how some regions will resonate more with you than others. I really enjoy listening to the different region's take on a Champion and find it interesting how some characteristics change while other stay the same. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2018-03-16T00:23:15.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All champs are originally produced in the main NA offices right?\n\nOr are some of Riots offices in other regions actually building up to the point they could create a champion for the game (presumably working closely with the main office), that would ultimately end up being localized for NA, rather than us always having the original?","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2018-03-16T00:37:08.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you look at their hiring page you will see they don't.

So for example maybe Camille  should have a Spanish accent like she has a British accent in English; she got a \"Neutral\" accent because in Latin America that is the norm for some reason \n\n*everything that gets translated is with the same rules since you hired the guy that translates dragon ball for LATAM\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI think a lot could be gained if Latam translations embrace different accents, and most importantly, colloquialisms from different regions. Have some champions sound Argentinian, Spanish or even have foreign accents\n\nHave characters use slang and colloquialisms from different regions rather than adhere to a language structure that no country really talks like (even if we all can understand it).
