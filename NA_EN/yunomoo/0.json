For a month  I have been experiencing EXTREME client lag. Now to the point where I cant accept a game because clicking accept would be unresponsive. Its like my CPU usage and Memory usage are both 100% but I checked and they are fine. I could play COD and not lag while having the league client open (so I know its not my computer). \r\n\r\nFor the past month, its been lagging and I was still able to play, but i barely was able to go through the champ select and the client in general. \r\nI am using Windows 10 64 bit. \r\n\r\nI've completely reinstalled league and yesterday I got to play a few games until later tried playing again and the same lag came back. I am tired of this, please could someone help me?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-09T21:45:22.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client is having a hard time staying connected to the servers.
