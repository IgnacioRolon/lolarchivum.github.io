I have all the correct permissions and I have cleaned my computer with ccleaner but the installer still thinks league is on my computer and wont install. The frustrating part of this is that I submitted a ticket to try to get help and the person who responded didn't help at all and literally copy and pasted his response to me twice without actually responding to the information I gave them and then they marked the ticket as solved..... I have played for years and this just really hurts, at this point I'm not even sure if I want to install league any more.{{item:3070}} {{item:3649}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-05T23:51:47.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry to hear you had issues with your reinstall. I took a look at the error messages you were receiving and I believe if we try an install with the base files of League, this may resolve the issue.\n\nI'd like you to try using our base installer from [**this link**](http://l3cdn.riotgames.com/Installer/SingleFileInstall/LeagueOfLegendsBaseNA.exe). Simply right-click on the installer and run it as admin to ensure it functions properly.\n\nPlease let me know if this worked for you or not.","replies":[{"poster":"TheJuggerNugget","date":"2016-12-06T14:36:36.838+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much, this solved the issue.
