Is there any way for me not to get these 20 minute lower priority queue things? I NEVER leave games intentionally. I always try to play to win, also whats the difference between a decline and no response? People who wait in queue and decline the match delay the game for others waiting, just like the afk people.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-07T18:39:48.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible to receive a lower priority queue for constantly declining or not responding to match queues.  Even if it's not intentional, it still causes a negative experience for other players who are trying to get into a game.  Your best bet is to play when you are ready to commit to the duration of the match.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[]}]}
