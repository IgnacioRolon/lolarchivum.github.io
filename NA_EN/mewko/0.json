You will also have 1 week less time to finish the mission bye the time she's down to 6,300.\n\n\n**- \"Unique\" spells**\nThis is insane in 3v3 AI, it's impossible even because there is always at least 1 person ruining it **on purpose**, yes \"on purpose\", by killing the balloon minions intentionally. And if RNG is nice to you to drop the same spells over and over, then it's a failed mission as well.\nIn my opinion the reason for this is because of how first win of the day works (20 (or 22) hour reset = ppl do it on 3v3 beginner bots. Much better would be a system where we simply have a daily reset for the first win mission, so that people would do it much more in normal games instead of 3v3 beginner bots. I still don't understand why there is a 7 minute rule for getting (IP)/EXP on that 3v3-beginner-AI-map while the real issue is the fact that a lot of not-beginners do this mode to rush the first win of the day because of how the first win system works.\nHow is this even good for the real new players?\n\n- Extra note on the First-Win system: Not everyone has a fixed schedule of 9 to 5 school or work, this is another reason why a daily reset is way better than a 20 hour reset, I will lose out on this next FW for sure now because I have to work tomorrow at the time it's available, and since my shifts change again after that, the delayed one won't be able to be repeated after that either and delay again. So that means losing 1 or 2 first win bonusses simply because of this system while there is nothing I can do against it.\n\n- I however thank Riot already for changing the FW to 20-hour reset instead of a 22-hour reset, not that it helps a lot for me personally, but I can imagine that a lot of other people will have a much easier time now keeping their daily FW at +/- the same time.\n\n\n**- Everything has to happen in the same game**\nHere is the real kicker why this mission keeps failing over and over. If the game is over, all your progress is lost.. You can be at 87.50 % completion rate (7/8) and instantly go back to 00.00 %. This is in my opinion the real reason why this mission is so very very hard. Sure all the other things are annoying as well, but if your progress would be saved, you wouldn't feel bad about this mission at all, you'd feel happy because you made progress. Sure I'd still have to play Zoe way too much to my personal taste because we would probably need to use W around 40 times and not 8 times, but at least I'd feel like I'm making progress and the mission isn't impossible. Making it \"8 not-unique spells\" or \"4 unique spells\" would be much better to be honest, but that's just my personal opinion because I don't like to play this champion and for me a progress bar wouldn't help much to make this feel more fun/positive/...\n\n\n**Feedback on mission \"8 unique spells in the same game\" for Riot:**\n----> Make this much easier so people don't fail over and over\n----> Make this a progress mission, so people won't lose all their progress over and over\n\n\nGood job by the way on fixing the bugs, that's one extra thing we really can't use on this mission. (No this is not sarcasm, it's a real thank you, and so are all the others)","replies":[{"poster":"Soyle","date":"2017-11-25T10:37:07.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Riot & every person using statistics:\n\nKeep in mind Zoe's pick rate isn't showing real numbers as long as her mission is up!\n\nMissions like this scew the stats a lot, because even people that don't like her, will keep playing her over and over till the damn mission is finally done.
