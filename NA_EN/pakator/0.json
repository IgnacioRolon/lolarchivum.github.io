Good to see that over the course of several years vayne is still OP and overplayed. After about 5 games, 4 of which vayne was picked and quadra and pentaed her teams (mine and theirs) to victory, I remembered why we got tired of this game to begin with. Riot has its love affair with certain champs, they are, and will always be OP, and its stale and boring. \n\nI suppose its human nature that there will just be people who will always pick the most broken champs every single game, because they would rather ez win that actually play the game, even in non ranked matches.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Legend Titan","date":"2017-05-27T17:00:07.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont have a problem with any of those aspects of Vayne, I think the problem with Vayne is that she is supposed to be a tank shredder specialty. This is accomplished by her W. The problem here is that she can also burst and assassinate squishy targets without this W, though the W helps kill them even faster.\n\nHer ult is problematic in that it gives her the AD steroid. Possibly make it increase her AS based on the number of W silver bolts on the current target. If she switches targets she loses the AS. Also her ult could provide bonuses to her E as well, maybe making it longer distance knockback. Her Q provides a ton of burst damage in conjuction with the current ult and has such a short CD. I think this leaves little room for punishment and allows her to pretty much 1 shot squishies by rolling and qing. If you want her to feel better, push her Tank killing specialty and dont let her 2 shot squishy targets.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-05-27T17:02:57.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the issue is the way people see a \",marksmen' and tries to apply that to vayne...\n\nshe is more a of  a duelist then a marksmen... so like a fiora \n\ndue to her being a duelist she has the ability to shred tanks, win 1 vs 1 and kill anything that happens to think they can beat her with out having a clear advantage","replies":[{"poster":"Legend Titan","date":"2017-05-27T17:08:41.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well of course, but fioras weakness is she is melee and needs to hit vitals for the most part, Vayne is ranged, and uses mobility to kite or chase while dealing damage. If she wants to duel an assassin or ADC thats fine, but 2 shotting, when your ult grants you invisibilty for your 2nd empowered auto + the bonus AD, is not dueling. If you want her to be about dueling then pushing her ult to stacking passive faster on a target instead of deleting the target through sheer damage is a better dueling scenario.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-05-27T17:15:55.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fiora has true damage, can dodge a skill , has a gap close and a heal and still is one of the best duelist in the game","replies":[{"poster":"Legend Titan","date":"2017-05-27T18:52:03.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said she wasnt a good duelist?
