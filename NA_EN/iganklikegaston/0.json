It shows the loading icon, but it just seems odd, since it takes longer to load the after game screen than it does to load into the actual game map. Is this just my computer being crap or is there a possible solution for this?","replies":[{"poster":"IGankLikeGaston","date":"2017-06-15T22:47:41.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were right, just finished a game and it came in almost immediately.

With that turned on, the client needs to load entirely from scratch after matches. Go into your client options, make sure that setting is **NOT** checked, and let me know if the post-game loads quicker.","replies":[]}]}
