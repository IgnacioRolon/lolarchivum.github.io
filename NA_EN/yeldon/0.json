Yesterday I transferred my main account to the Japan server. Everything is great but I realized one thing: I can't type Japanese in game. Even though my client is patched in Japanese and my Japanese keyboard input is selected on my Mac, I can only type Japanese in the client but not in the actual game. It only comes out as English.\r\n\r\nCould someone please help me resolve this problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-09T04:01:29.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I recall correctly, a lot of the keys are hardcoded inside the game. Because of this, I believe the only way you'd be able to type in Japanese in-game would be if you were using a keyboard with a [Japanese layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_input_methods). \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
