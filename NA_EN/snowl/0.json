At all.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that you have to target a tunnel to go anywhere. This becomes a problem when you have played more than one game with Rek'Sai. How are you supposed to initiate or gank with this ultimate at all? The enemy knows exactly where your tunnels are if your tunnels are in any position that could be used for a gank, and can step on them without any harm. What are you going to do, ult on them when they step on the tunnel? Good joke, your ultimate has a 1.5 second cast time that tells any enemy that you are heading towards them so they can retreat before you even start heading towards them. They have slow reaction times? Don't worry, they will usually have a movement ability that will completely negate your ultimate.\r\n\r\nThe only use for Rek'Sai I could find is travelling to Dragon/Baron (depending on what side you are so you can set your tunnel safely behind) to be able to contest easily or having the ability to teleport to top/mid/bot entrance quickly. Tunnels in the jungle are worthless (in the context of the ultimate) because they give no vision even when the enemy is standing on them so you can't quickly teleport to an invader.\r\n\r\nRiot, what was your vision for this ultimate? I think the mechanics of it should be adjusted a little (either give Tunnels an invulnerability period of say, 2 minutes or maybe give Rek'Sai an invisibility period of 2 seconds after teleporting to a tunnel to give her time to position to Unburrow on an unsuspecting enemy. She's underground!).\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-12-12T09:00:22.816+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"With Rek'Sai we deliberately did something a bit different with her ultimate.

Or maybe the guy was just joking around and is as jaw-droppingly amazed as the rest of us are that you let him off the drawing board in the first place?\n\n CertaintyT gets some well deserved shit for overloading champs in order to sell them but even Thresh and Darius at their worst are not as game warpingly stupid as Lee Sin. And his champs eventually get toned down to something approaching reasonable once Riot's made their money off them. I like all the new stuff Thresh has, right up until his stupid attack range and bonus magic damage for no damn reason. Passives having passives!\n\n I know you like to preserve champion identity when handing out nerfs (unless you're a support, tank, or immobile mage, then you can just quite politely fuck straight off). Lee Sin's identity is being the best at everything, having the most moves, having the most options. So yeah, some delicate little LCS flowers are going to weep real tears if your balance department ever takes the blinders off and decides to do their jobs in regards to the one reason why the jungle has sucked for three seasons and is about to suck for another one.\n\n ORRRRRRRRRRR you can continue pretending the problem doesn't exist. Which is what we are expecting of you. \n\n Regarding other things the balance team needs to fix: \n 1) I don't play Cassiopeia but holy shit how do you fuck up a poison snake this badly. I feel bad for Cass mains (and I play junglers like Sejuani and Evelynn and maybe Rek'Sai and not Lee Sin). Straight up just revert her back to what she was before you ruined her and start again. This time, with somebody who knows what the definition of poison is at the wheel.\n 2) Several months ago you nerfed Lux. Unnerf her, please. Give her her ms back, at the very least. You nerfed her because she was one of the few immobile mages who could still go mid against all the hypermobile ad assassins you keep shitting out and your solution was to nerf her instead. Light goes fast. Also, fyi you can see light in bushes GAMEBREAKINGLY OP Lee Sin is fine tho~\n 3) Holy Christ can you do something about a lithe scrawny stealthy assassin's best build being FULL TANK and being LITERALLY UNABLE TO KILL ANYTHING? Eve's roles are still assassin mage and her only viable build (I should say most viable, it still sucks) is ad tank. Whoops. No damage, no endurance, barely any cc. Maybe you should class invisibility with mobility and then redo her power budget (since mobility costs NOTHING to ANYONE as long as you have lots of it!). Or just put her stealth back on a button like what should have happened two years ago but who am I to judge? At one point at the end of S4 I was jungling Evelynn and Sejuani WITH THE EXACT SAME BUILD. (Got to gold with them!) THIS IS NOT OKAY.\n\n This is going to blow your mind: WARD JUMPING IS DUMB AND THE ONLY CHAMPS WHO DO IT ARE CONSISTENTLY PROBLEM CASES.

She'll have escapes for days and then could, in theory, ult right back over towards the turret (which won't run away from the sound of her ult, hah) and then rinse and repeat escaping.

She does have access to more skills but they really are not that powerful. tremor sense is great but to call it accurate in the way it tracks movement is pretty exaggerated. Champion movement tracking is so inaccurate as the game progresses,  especially on faster champions. it is fine with slower moving champs and monsters like the scuttle crab as they pulse more frequently, but faster moving champs pulse so infrequently that it is deceiving.\n\nIf prey seeker actually did halfway decent damage then I could understand this disparity, but it doesn't. If she fully revealed champions she hit with prey seeker it might make sense, but she doesn't. if she had a little better vision range while burrowed it might make sense, but she only sees in her immediate proximity.\n\nThen there are the tunnels. Sure, you can have 8 out at a time, but the instant the enemy team sees one it is permanently revealed on their minimap. They might last 10 minutes, but they are destroyed in a second if they stand on it...? I want to elaborate on this point a little more. I have never heard of a tunnel collapsing from someone standing at its entrance and just looking at it... it makes no sense. If the idea is that they are standing on top of the tunnel to force it to crumble wouldnt they end up getting trapped as it collapsed? that would be kind of a cool tradeoff actually for destroying a tunnel, it rooted you for a little bit (like .75-1 second) so there was actually a decision to be made when destroying it. It would also make an interesting mechanic in team fights in that if rek'sai tunneled into the middle of a fight and someone sat to long on the tunnel exit/entrance they get rooted for a moment as consequence. Then there is the fact that they give 5 gold for destroying them, \"hey there, good job standing still in that spot for a second, here is 5 gold\"... really? I had given this feedback on the PBE forum as well, there NEEDS to be a real tradeoff when it comes to destroying tunnels. Making someone stand in a spot for 3 seconds, root them when it collapses, something. I know why channeling to destroy them isn't an option, I get that, but just giving free gold to the enemy team for no time investment is just BS.\n\nThen there is Burrow and Unburrow. I love this ability and its concept... except for the fact that unburrowing on a target a second time before the 10 seconds for the next knock up is ready deals no damage. She already has a limited number of damage sources outside of auto attacking, was it really necessary to add this limitation as well?\n\nI like Rek'sai, I really do, but some of the decisions that were made feel poorly thought out... I don't mean to step on anyone's toes but it really feels that way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SeexydVanessa","date":"2014-12-12T13:47:48.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think her ult is pretty interesting and different, which i like.
