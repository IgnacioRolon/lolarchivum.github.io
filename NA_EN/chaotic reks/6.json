I&#039;m talking somewhere around 15% - 25% crit damage increase (still stacks with IE). \nReasons i&#039;d think this would be better for Yas and the game as a whole:\n\n* It still preserves his identity as an AD crit building melee carry\n\n* It still keeps his late game power \n\n* Eliminates the BS in building 2 items and having 100% crit chance\n\n* Makes his early and mid game less frustrating to play against\n\nReasons this would be worse for Yas:\n\n* Makes his mid game worse due to no more 100% crit powerspike after 2 items\n\n* Makes him more reliant on crit, and therefor more RNG reliant, making him less consistent until he gets a high crit chance\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: removed the detering bruiser and tank part","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-08-03T23:58:27.961+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would make his burst that much greater when he does crit, but a lot weaker when he doesn't.

Just a thought.\n\nProbably not a good idea, unless Riot had a specific reason to do so. Jhin for example is slightly more caster focused, So translating crit into AD, helped him do more damage with spells while allowing him to work with ADC items. (Though later, it was found that the Armor pen build was more effective) So if Yasuo suddenly got more AD instead, it would also affect his spells that had AD scaling. (Would also run into problems with certain global buffs, such as infernal drake.)\n\nAlso, Jhin's scaling with Crit is just weird. He has the crit chance -> AD scaling, But he's still able to crit, and he auto crits on the 4th shot. (Try tracking that power curve)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2016-08-04T00:48:26.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be weaker than his curreny crit passive, and would therefore do nothing to solve the current bruiser yasup problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2016-08-04T01:23:08.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yea, can't wait for a Ie yasuo to ishot me with AA+Q because he got lucky and did crit on both.\nRNG-Reliance is a utterly shitty concept, just don't.\n\nAnd how would it deter from tank/bruiser builts?
