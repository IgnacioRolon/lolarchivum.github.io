However last week when I hopped in a game of League, I noticed that my Club Tag was changed to something random. I still could see my Club and it still had the same Club Name, but the Club Tag disappeared for some strange reason. I contacted Riot Support already and they said they were going to restore my Club to display the correct Club Tag and Name, however I saw no changes on my client.\r\n\r\nIf any Rioters are reading this, could you look into this and help restore my Club's Tag back to what it was?\r\n\r\nClub Information is Below:\r\nServer: NA\r\nClub Name: Rito Games\r\nClub Tag: RITO\r\nSummoner Name of Club Owner: SpectreFour\r\nDate When I First Noticed this Issue: November 28, 2016 (Issue could have occured at an earlier date, but this was the first time I logged in and noticed it)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSpectreFour","replies":[{"poster":"Noobelishes","date":"2016-12-08T06:43:42.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"our captain has the same problem he still is leader but he cant see he's club or club tag  :s","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-08T05:47:35.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We aren't equipped to handle Club name changes or disputes here on H&S, but if you reach back out in your ticket, we'll take another look at this.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
