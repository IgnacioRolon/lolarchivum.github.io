While looking at my video settings, I can see I have VSync enabled yet my FPS is exceeding my monitor's refresh rate of 165hz. I tried using the in-game FPS cap of 144 and it also doesn't work as my FPS is still exceeding my monitor's refresh rate. I've tried enabling VSync through the Nvidia control panel and also reinstalling the latest Nvidia drivers, but nothing seems to be fixing the issue. Before this issue, my in-game FPS used to be locked at 165 and now it goes north of 250-300 causing screen tearing while I move the camera in-game.\r\n\r\nAnyone got any ideas on how to get the VSync in League to work again?\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-22T02:15:20.434+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes Nvidia's g-sync can mess with League's v-sync settings. Let's try going into your Nvidia Game Profile and resetting that, then do a quick config reset in League as well. Follow the steps below for how to reset your League config, and then go ahead and turn on V-sync (only Leagues) and test it in a custom game.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"SpectreFour","date":"2017-09-27T04:20:25.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply.
