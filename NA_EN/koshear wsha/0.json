Extreme cases such as the N word are exceptions, but in most cases it isn't the word that gets you in trouble its the message. If you are constantly showing negative behavior it doesn't matter what words you use.\n\nI would suggest that if you are not planning on saying something constructive, such as offering a solution to an issue, or nice, such as congratulating people on nice plays, then just keep it to yourself. Don't reply to negativity unless you can do it with positivity.","replies":[{"poster":"KoShEaR WsHa","date":"2016-09-24T23:13:35.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your reply.. if i mute everyone all games and not talk with players is thats gonna clear my report history and go back as clear account?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Casual Anne","date":"2016-09-24T18:10:49.272+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was a long time coming. I believe the first is a 10 game chat restriction to clean up your act but if you keep up with the toxic chatting it gets upped to 25. Your looking at time bans next. Clean up your attitude. /mute all if need be or even drag your chat off screen.","replies":[{"poster":"KoShEaR WsHa","date":"2016-09-24T23:07:52.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know i went from 10 game chat restriction that was my bad but this 25 game is not my bad .. if i dont talk and mute everyone its normal and no one gonna report me for this?","replies":[{"poster":"Casual Anne","date":"2016-09-25T01:13:00.494+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You cannot be reported for being silent. If they report you for toxic chat speak, harassment, or homophobic/racial words the system will see that you didn't even say a word and those report are canceled out. You can be reported for afking and intentionally feeding but those have to make it obvious that you were going that. Like running down mid 30 times. As long as you just try your best and help your team, you won't receive any punishments c:\n\nI also want to give you a link that states clearly what is breaking the rules and what is not breaking the rules. i hope this helps out with any questions.
