My settings box is also really small so I have to put my face super close to my screen in order to read it. My chat also used to be tiny but I fixed that by adjusting the resolution (1920x1080 IIRC).\r\n\r\nWhen I'm not in game, the box that shows up when I hover over someone on my friend's list is super tiny and the graphics in the store are kinda pixely (which isn't a big issue, just weird since my 7 year old laptop displays it fine).\r\n\r\nI think maybe it's a windows 10 issue? The icons in TeamSpeak are super small as well and some things (like facebook) are super zoomed in. I'm not really tech savvy at all so I'm not sure how to diagnose the problem really. Overall though, most regular web pages like youtube are fine. Just games and other apps. Does anyone know a fix? Is this a problem with all high resolution monitors?
