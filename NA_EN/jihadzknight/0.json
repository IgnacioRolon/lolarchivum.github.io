It'll send you to League's main page. But more importantly, it'll show what region you are signed into at the time, like this http://puu.sh/4Dgit.jpg\n\nIf you click the little drop-down arrow, it'll give you a menu to choose a region and language, like this: http://puu.sh/4DgdX.png\n\nI don't know completely how the system works, but it might be pulling the last info it had on your account from when you were on NA (did you transfer over when you were level 11?). Changing your region on there *might* make this display correctly.\n\nIf not, it may be something funny with the beta community feature itself, and how it is reading account information.","replies":[]}]}
