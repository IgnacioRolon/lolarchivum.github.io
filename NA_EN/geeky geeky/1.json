I know support is probably the best alternative role but what about top lane, or even jungle? Id like input from other people before i start jumping into games and become a full one trick.\n\nAnytime i look up info on Taliyah its always from when she was first released and is outdated, hoping to get some input from more recent times.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-06-19T16:46:25.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"taking iceborn and rylais and zzrot make for a pretty mean toplane build.  id say as a sup the adc she synergizes with the most is tf.  after he lands a gild card it's almost a free kill","replies":[]},{"poster":"Psyrix","date":"2017-06-18T23:39:54.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She used to be played top for a while, havent seen it recently tho.  Jungle, i guess it could work, but you'd have to make use of ur worked ground efficiently.  Her ganks could potentially be devastating in jg.  Support I'd say could be the hardest as her base damage is relatively high so you'd have to adjust so as not to kill the minions.  Ur mostly gonna be a damage support with minor, but devastating, disruption.  problem is sometimes that combo isnt too easy to land.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rand0mH3r0X","date":"2017-06-18T23:39:49.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's a jungler who always ganks, however, you'd have to be a real good jungler trying to make Taliyah work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dim2a","date":"2017-06-18T23:32:51.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She can support decently, if you adjust your style. She's good there early game, but transition to mid-game is somewhat tricky. Your wall takes much more work to be effective too, as you can't just roam bot (since you're already there) or top (too far) easily, and wall on mid is much less effective.\n\nShe can jungle OK-ish, I used to do it a lot -- clear is OK-ish, ganks are not bad to good, lategame is OK. But she's much weaker than meta junglers (more so after her w->e mini rework :().  If you're, say, plat player, you can probably jungle her OK in gold but not plat, so 1 tier lower than your peak and you should be OK. Prepare to face toxicity in the games that do go badly (any champion can have those), even if you do good with her on average.\n\nI know least about her top -- seems OK, but again, your ultimate is much less effective there, and she has a lot of bad matchups top.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vapor Wave Vibes","date":"2017-06-18T23:26:28.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She can support","replies":[]},{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2017-06-18T23:26:24.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen her as a support but the lane is two small for her q to be effective though","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcus Diabolus","date":"2017-06-18T23:24:19.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive seen streamers take her jungle, so I know she works there.
