Hiding behind fancy jargon like: Dunning–Kruger and Negative Bias, just makes the company look defensive and uninformed. The fact is, their system works great if a player is ranked simi-accurately from the start and then that player logs many, many games. But once a player _is_ mis-ranked, the system tends to keep that player mis-ranked -- it takes hundreds of games to overcome each compounding mistake the ranking system imposes on mis-ranked players. Riot hides behind the motto, _“We get 99% of it right”_. That leaves tens of thousands of mis-ranked players wasting hundreds of hours to overcome a flawed ranking system, and Riot’s response is, _“We have you place accurately. You’re bad, but you’re too stupid to understand -- Dunning–Kruger”_. What Riot should be saying is, _“We’re sorry. We know our ranking system tends to reinforce its own errors. We are working on it.”_","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wonderlands","date":"2016-11-17T23:04:51.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone drops a tier from where they left off?

For example when in normal games you have your previous year's boarder now but in the flex queue promotional games no boarder.  It seems that they are being very liberal with combining people together and not looking at the Dynamic queue rank from last season.    I was silver 5, went 7-3 and placed in bronze 1.","replies":[]},{"poster":"khorney","date":"2016-11-17T22:52:53.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"stay boosted","replies":[]}]}
