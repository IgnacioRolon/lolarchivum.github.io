If I step into lane I would get \"Attempting to reconnect \" I could type just fine as if I wasn't having issues, I also disconnected 4 times. But in the champion select it would constantly say disconnected from pvp.net and instantly reconnect and I couldn't type to anyone. Just wondering if it's just me, I reset my internet and my computer though I don't think it has anything to do with my computer since it's new, And as soon as I connected after a internet reset it instantly does the \" Attempting to reconnect \" Also my ping wasn't jumping up and down it was at a solid 90 and that's playable for me my normal is 45 but I wouldn't just disconnect with 90 ping, I tried a speed test and my internet seemed fine, Loaded pretty fast and normal, So is anyone else having this problem or is it just me? I would really like to just be able to play league again normally..","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-01T22:45:24.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even with a great computer or internet you can still have issues reaching specific servers, like our game server.
