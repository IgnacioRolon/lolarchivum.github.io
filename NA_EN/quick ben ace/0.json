Much smoother and more polished.\r\nOverall client looks so much better.\r\nChat is easily accessible but you can also get rid of it and get the conversation back easily.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\nDont see how many others accepted match.\r\npopup for finding a map is delayed past the time the client pops up when off screen.\r\nteams uneven.  We had a diamond player and the rest silver and gold, and they were silver and gold with 2 unranked players with &lt;200 won games  (might just be because its blind pick instead of team builder.\r\nno tabs in post game for statistics and such.\r\nProbably not yet enabled, but cant change summoner icon.\r\nAlthough it is prettier, changing ques is bulkier and takes longer.  Where you change queues is also not clearly marked.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-05-19T17:12:23.565+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are right, some of the things you mention are still in development. As we release updates you'll start to see more shiny buttons! Pro tip: the client has a feedback button that you can use to send us all of your observations.\n\nWe do check the forums and take note of what is posted here, but we can more easily gather and aggregate the data submitted through the feedback tool.\n\nThanks for helping us test the client!","replies":[{"poster":"Quick Ben Ace","date":"2016-05-19T17:46:18.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for letting me know.

However, I agree with the post game statistics. I personally feel like I rather have some detailed statistics inside the client as well. Maybe I'm just used to the current client?","replies":[{"poster":"Bodkins Odds","date":"2016-05-22T00:19:39.216+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I want some detailed statistics as well.
