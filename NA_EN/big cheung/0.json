He thought the opponent **was** going to show up and so remained camouflaged for his ambush, instead of CS'ing, etc. I feel for him, because this is definitely not a deserved loss.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rivuo","date":"2016-07-20T22:37:13.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You stood still for a minute and a half?","replies":[{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-07-20T23:21:45.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ApexCH,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=3EIWOBVc,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-07-20T22:37:13.040+0000)\n>\n> You stood still for a minute and a half?\n\nWhen I first started playing the game, I would invis in a bush for 3 min until a enemy champion walked in it, the POW POW POW I got a kill.
