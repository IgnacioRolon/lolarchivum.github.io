I was sup as Zilean with the other solo on bot as jhin. Didn't notice till the game started that our assigned jungle player instead went riven top lane and doubled with kled, meaning we had no jungler. She also swapped off her smite. The third guy, Ryze mid, actually played his role. Is this a bannable/reportable offense? By that I mean signing up to be a jungler in a Draft matchup then refusing to jungle by taking off your smite and never actually jungling?  \r\nNot to mention the Riven basically told us to cry about it and tried to use the classic \"It's just norms\" excuse.","replies":[{"poster":"Midg3t","date":"2019-02-18T15:04:37.899+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Kled was fine with sharing the lane with Riven I doubt it's bannable.\nBut if he wasn't fine with it, then it's griefing, which is bannable offense.","replies":[{"poster":"Deliberate Inter","date":"2019-02-18T15:32:37.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No,  griefing is deliberately hurting the riven's feelings and trolling,  and going duo top is evidence of that if you troll or if you don't communicate.
