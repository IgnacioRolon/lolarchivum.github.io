But what got to me was that the nature of &quot;becoming&quot; a voidborn seems fundamentally different in those caverns than it is when depicted in The Eye in The Abyss\r\n\r\nThe big, bad voidborn seem to be directly created by a Watcher with little to no regard to the initial form that biological matter took. All they see you as is a lump of play dough. I assume those where what the Ascended were facing off against during the whole Icathia thing. \r\nBut our Shuriman traveler and his bird (and to an extent the larger void creature in the story as well) are all clearly mutated variants of their previous shapes. If this is the case, it seems strange that a Watcher would modify them in such a way given the great success seen with learning and adapting Voidborn like Kha&#039;Zix and Vel&#039;Koz (AND MAYBE CHO&#039;GATH MAYBE? PLEASE???). \r\n\r\nAre these a separate form of life? (Void-Touched, for lack of a better word). Does proximity to the void cause random mutations even without the direct willing of a watcher? Have the creatures that Kai&#039;Sa has found herself fighting all her life been life forms mutated by proximity to the Void rather than Voidborn themselves? Did the Watchers just get lazy and decide the birds just needed to be angrier birds and the man a scalier man? \r\nHave the watchers changed the nature of the void to corrupt all life it touches, putting it on a sort of Void-Monster making autopilot? Or was it always like that, and the creation of Voidborn is when a Watcher decides to use that nature for more specific ends?\r\n\r\nAnd then what of the Void-Creatures we saw in the Nami comic? Are those Voidborn? Or are they Void-Touched deep sea life?\r\n\r\nI have many, many more questions and conclusions I&#039;d love to share but this would become far too long.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2019-01-28T19:51:41.615+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"In short, I really hope we can dig into the lore for the Void and Voidborn more this year, as you're not the only one with questions.\n\nI think the one important thing to remember is that the creatures in the comic are, like, \"newborn\". That is not their final form or anything like that. The Void is not an upgrade, and will corrupt and change over time.\n\nThe Watchers... well, that's a different matter altogether...

I'm now a step closer to having that answer and it looks like the Voidspawn vs Voidborn champion issue is a lot less dire than it had seemed. I think I'll need to write an actual thread now, damn you!\n\nI also hope for more void lore, ideally one that definitively answers what makes the Voidborn champions stand out amongst the legions of other monstrosities the void seems to produce, or corrupt other living entities into. The Watchers are unknowable, but their creations could could definitely do with a little more clarity. \n\nAlso maybe some way to more reliably differentiate between the fungus-like Void beneath Icathia/shurima and the actual Void itself would be nice (even if it's only that one of them takes the lower-case V)\n\nEither way I'm hungry for more content from you guys :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaisa Aran","date":"2019-01-29T01:36:32.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=I2cLcM9e,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-01-28T19:51:41.615+0000)\n>\n> In short, I really hope we can dig into the lore for the Void and Voidborn more this year, as you&#x27;re not the only one with questions.\n> \n> I think the one important thing to remember is that the creatures in the comic are, like, &quot;newborn&quot;.

In my opinion she's a big X-Factor that needs more focus than she currently has, though that's definitely a biased claim to make.
