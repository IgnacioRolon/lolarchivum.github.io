About Ranked Rewards and A notification I got.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was in lol at 9:05 ontario Toronto time on 10/26/2016 and i got notification that ill be bronze 3 starting next season and like last season that demotes you 1 whole rank, (s2-b2, g5-s5) but I am pretty sure i'll rank up in the next 12 days, by the time season ends and I am trying to get gold.  If I do I will still get rewards right and I can change what rank I will get next season,\r\n\r\n(kinda forgot but) Your next seasons rank will be bronze 3, keep in mind almost all players are demoted a rank. \r\n\r\nSo will I get rewards and border or is it already decided?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-27T02:35:57.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The [Ranked Rewards](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/2016-ranked-season-ends-soon) you receive this year will be determined by which *Ranked Tier* you **end the season at**. \n\nKeep on pushing upwards to Gold, friend.
