I'd never thought of prepping the voidling to get the bonuses, that makes a lot of sense.  You don't want to give Malz buffs, he's already secret OP!

Also, 1:41 is also doable when you start with W on your first camp, while 1:48 (this is the correct time because of the 7/14 seconds it takes for each voidling's buffs and the time of camp spawn is 1:55) doesn't allow you to start W.","replies":[{"poster":"SH Azykan","date":"2015-09-19T02:27:37.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"see I remember trying out right at 1:48 and it didn't work as well as at 1:47.

It takes around half the time to prep the voidling, so if he dies during an invade he can get back to his jungle faster while still getting his voidling, and if he fights the invade with his team he gets the silence and burst damage on Q to help fight back the invade.
