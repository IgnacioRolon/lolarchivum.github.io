I don&#039;t like to think about that nor do I want to.\r\n\r\nAs a Varus player, I have to ask, &quot;Why the fuck can&#039;t you just nerf my god damn passive?&quot; I don&#039;t play Kog&#039;maw, but I bet their mains are asking, &quot;Why was I nerfed at all if this was happening?&quot;\r\n\r\nAnd now, as top lane player, I have to say this benefit me. The item requires other onhit items to be effective. **Bruisers can&#039;t build other onhit items because they provide no defensive stats (besides Wit&#039;s End), and therefore they die too quickly.** BoRK is still a shitty item too, and they aren&#039;t buffing BoRK because then Ranged Rageblade users would just break it.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, why the hell would I give up the synergy Trinity Force and Sterak&#039;s Gage? Now ask, who actually benefits from this change? Master Yi? Vayne? Even Kai&#039;Sa is being nerfed before even coming out the patch after she hits with this change.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know what burning city looks like, you can just come to the Kayle mains Discord. Having to go through the nerf of from Devourer, the fall of Hurricane with the rise of Rageblade to compensate, both Rylai&#039;s and Fervor being nerfed for onhit users, the E cooldown change that makes her early game worse, and now her scaling is going to be hit. People aren&#039;t happy is an understatement.\r\n\r\nRageblade was originally a hybrid item that bruisers and hybrid champions would build. Now it&#039;s become a scaling onhit item, except melee champions don&#039;t stack full damage to gain efficient benefits. That&#039;s why only certain melee champions buy Infinity Edge; they have special synergy. Rageblade is being turned from a Hybrid Item into an ADC Item that Master Yi can also use.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-03-07T04:52:47.314+0000","up_votes":182,"down_votes":12,"body":"Gonna try out a few rounds of changes this week most likely.\n\nAnd as always, my final decision will be based on the expressed desires of the most upvoted, most rage-fueled thread on the topic that pops up during that time.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-03-07T05:03:11.796+0000","up_votes":75,"down_votes":2,"body":"Using the Boards exactly as intended.

This is a worry. I was serious when I said, \"If you want to know what burning city looks like, you can just come to the Kayle mains Discord.\" Right now we're in the period of where the city has already burned down and people are picking up the pieces trying to survive.\n\nAlso, I used math rather than circlejerk my way to the top, so at least give me props for that. If I had to give a recommendation, I would do the current Rageblade on live to 8 stacks (2 onattack for melee), but reduce the stats per stack to 5% AS, 3 AD, 4 AP (OLD (LIVE): 48% AS, 18 AD, 24 AP, max 6 stacks; NEW CONCEPT: 40% AS, 24 AD, 32 AP, max 8 stacks) and reduce the base stats to 30 AD, 40 AP, and 25% AS. That means you have to invest into more attack speed to get your stats (from the stacks) faster.\n\nVarus will still be an issue, but as a Varus, just nerf the AS ratio on his passive, or make it apply to permanent attack speed (like Kai'Sa has for her ability evolution). Seriously, it's ridiculous getting almost 2.5 AS on a fully stacked Rageblade, Berserker Boots, and Hurricane with a minion kill.","replies":[{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2018-03-07T06:01:08.783+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think his snide comment was at this post, but other ones that will be super similar to it.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-03-07T07:58:33.427+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is the case.

Is there a way to keep 6 stacks for ranged, but make it more efficient for melee users? For instance, with its live 48% AS, you could have 4 max stacks for melees (12% AS/stack) and 6 max stacks for ranged (8% AS/stack). Or could stack generation maybe be doubled on melee champion hit without a change in the number of stacks altogether?\n- This AD/AS only iteration could be too strong on Yi, Vayne and the like. Personally, I'd prefer keeping the AP on it as a price for those champions, especially for Vayne. Also, some intended users like Shyvana (who'd benefit from a more melee-friendly Rageblade) have been balanced specifically with AP in mind back in the day.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MohawkBird","date":"2018-03-07T01:54:28.219+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":10,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-03-07T02:10:36.441+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"Besides Kayle, Varus, and Kog'maw, who actually built Rageblade as a core item?","replies":[{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2018-03-07T02:32:41.297+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":2,"body":"> core item\n\nI feel like that is the problem.
