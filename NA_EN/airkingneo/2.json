He claims Jax&#039;s lower player base (pick rate) causes more winrate fluctuation, but then doesn&#039;t show any data to support that claim. He shows Ivern&#039;s graph, but not Jax&#039;s. Please note that Ivern&#039;s pickrate is dramatically worse than Jax&#039;s, by nearly 10 times.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s also important to note that this argument is disingenuous. There should be a similar percent of players getting lower winrates on Riven as their are Jax. If, for example, 10% of Jax mains are statistic inaccuracies, then should also be roughly 10% of Riven mains who are statistical accuracies. It&#039;s the same elo/skill level, so statistical, inaccuracies should be similar. Blastoise only says Jax has this issue. That means the number of statistical inaccuracies doesn&#039;t seem to be the same. This means that, on average, Riven mains have a higher winrate than Jax players. That&#039;s why as you go into high and higher elo, like Master, Riven&#039;s winrate dramatically increases while Jax&#039;s stagnates.\r\n\r\nThere is also the huge issue with Blastoise&#039;s data not listing ELO. Jax is a lot stronger in low elo, while Riven is a lot stronger in high ELO. If we&#039;re talking game balance or design, we should be dealing with high elo. I can only presume this is all elos accounted for rather than high elo, which makes this graph look very favorable for Riven in terms of not looking as overpowered.","replies":[{"poster":"Apocalypsic","date":"2018-12-28T02:14:26.750+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"He already shows all of the informational stats about Jax in a previous post.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2018-12-28T04:07:58.973+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Doesn't matter.

The graphs in and of themselves showcased that Riven's lower end players are REALLY FREAKING BAD, but the mains end up doing significantly better. Meanwhile, Jax's lower end players have a much lower skill floor **and similar gains at his skill ceiling, anyway.** Jax is an easier tool that does just as much as Riven does in the current state of the game, and a Jax player like Hashinshin has no reason to complain about Riven because he's playing an easier champ that's similarly effective in solo queue. That was the point of this whole thing between him and Hashinshin.\n\nTo say otherwise when a dude's literally giving empirical data and explaining it in detail **because he has access to all the empirical data** is a new degree of mental gymnastics that would even make a pretzel need a chiropractor.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2018-12-28T16:21:33.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I did not say he lied. I said he misinterpreted the data. There's an extremely huge difference. One is an accusation of ill intent and the other is an accusation of being wrong.\n\nI never denied low experience Riven players were bad. Jax players don't have similar gains at his skill ceiling, but a similar end winrate (but this is just semantics I assume?). I never denied that Jax was easier. This isn't even about Hashinshin; you could easily replace Jax with Kled and my argument would be the same.\n\nHe isn't giving the data though. He is not showing Jax's graph. You can tell if you just **CLICKED ON AND LOOKED AT THE STRING OF TWEETS.** I'm also saying that his explanation of the data is wrong. I gave reasons why, though you didn't address them.\n\n**It should also be important to note that nothing in your comment actually talks about any of the points I made in my post besides thinking Blastoise showed Jax's graph (which he didn't).** You didn't say anything about statistical inaccuracies of champions based on pickrate, and you didn't mention anything about statistics being warped based on ELO. These are both the core of my argument.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-12-29T04:31:32.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what concerns me most about this post is the \"yellow\" range  on  those graphs doesn't start until they reach 55% winrate...\n{{sticker:sg-janna}} \n\n im your breaching 53% or going under 46%... your an issue\n  a 10% winrate gap is WAY too large for a balance range \n\n48-51% should be green\n\n46-47, 52-53% should be yellow \n<46 and >53 should be red\n\n and thats for EVERY elo\n\n yellowing meaning on the topic for discussion for how to fix in the next patch or two.. and red meaning immediate hotfix","replies":[]}]}
