How is moderation just letting this happen?\r\n\r\nIt is literally said in the rules: Section \"Bad Stuff\", Subsection \"Gameplay &amp; Rank Shaming\": \"No belittling or shaming a player for their champion pool, rank, playstyle, or match history.\"\r\n\r\nIf you're a Zed, Riven, Yasuo, or 'whatever champion that is the flavor of the month' player, you might as well just not post on the boards.\r\n\r\nThere's no trade-off we're making here. These posts aren't providing high-level discussion in exchange for insulting players. They're the same low-effort shitposts complaining about a character without any real discussion other than \"x champion broken, x mains bad\".\r\n\r\n#Just to prove my point, let's get some examples going:\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/khrUOBEK-what-i-have-been-told-by-zed-mains-on-this-board-for-the-month\r\n\r\n> What I have been told by Zed mains on this board for the month\r\n> \r\n> Cry me a river.\r\nIt's a shame they made a rad skin for you guys just for you to move to Yasuo after the nerfs.\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/AjkUwENn-i-hate-playing-against-riven\r\n\r\n> The cognitive dissonance is fucking insane, they will NEVER admit that this champ has been broken for years now, that this champ's design is flawed.\r\n\r\nThese are on the front page of the boards.
