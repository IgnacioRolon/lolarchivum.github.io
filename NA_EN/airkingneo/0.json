Up until the last two months (give or take) she had a relatively small player base and so the arguement was her mains are dragging up her winrate. But that is no longer the case as her playrate AND winrate have gone up considerably. We the playerbase are thus inclined to believe the champion itself is extremely powerful.\n\nAs someone who has mained toplane and been consistently Diamond on multiple accounts I have to say fighting Riven was always hard and frustrating but at this point she is simply unbearable. For me PERSONALLY, it seems her access to CDR and extremely high shielding are whats making her powerful. But I might be wrong.\n\nLastly, this ties to alot of champions (Like Nasus albeit a bit less) these days, but Riven scales very well, consequently she should not be bullying the likes of Darius and Kled out of lane early game at their strongest points.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-03-12T20:21:05.509+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=5StackUltOneShot,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bEraBg5K,comment-id=000e0000,timestamp=2019-03-12T19:26:52.355+0000)I think the main problem comes in the fact Riven is supposed to be a 'high skill cap champion' that rewards mains.\n\nPersonally, I still favor (if nerfs *are* needed) exploring reducing her passive to a maximum of one or two stacks (instead of three) to encourage properly weaving spells and auto-attacks instead of spamming three spells. I think that would do a lot to make sure that her skill floor is a little higher, and her engagement window for maximum DPS a little longer.","replies":[{"poster":"Get Rekkkt","date":"2019-03-12T21:07:15.991+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":13,"body":"question of the year, why didnt you think of that for singed?\n\ni dont play singed, but if you dont see a bias, then at least say the reason u think so\n\nbc if u say winrate/playrate/banrate for singed, then ur argument doesnt make much sense because thats super bias if its ok to use those for singed and not riven\n\nand if its not that, then honestly what is it?\n\nif its a rune, ur gonna nerf everyone who uses the rune instead of the rune?\n\notherwise, i have 0 idea why youd choose to nerf one and not the other given the FACTS","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-03-12T21:23:21.930+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Get Rekkkt,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bEraBg5K,comment-id=000e000000000000,timestamp=2019-03-12T21:07:15.991+0000)question of the year, why didnt you think of that for singed?\n\nI'm not a Riot designer, so I can't say.

Metrics I'd use to assess health are:\n\n• Number of champions meant to be a ' hard counter' (a kit that is designed in a way that it is fairly easy to exploit that champion's designed weaknesses) a champion who is counterable but only has a couple options for such, can use bans to completely mitigate being countered, rather than choosing a 'better' matchup rather than a 'good' one.\n\n• the level of counterplay present, and its ease of execution in a matchup that is 'even' or not considered a 'counter.\n\n• when the counter to a champion is a certain strat (keep them from farming, shut them down early, etc.) that any champion can theoretically do, how easy is it to execute/how often are teams who try to execute it succeed/fail.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-03-12T19:27:26.296+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bEraBg5K,comment-id=000e,timestamp=2019-03-12T19:15:25.451+0000)For those that are actually seeking a discussion, what is the criteria we should be using to justify a nerf to Riven this patch that we'd be 100% happy with applying to champions in the future?\n\nPersonally, I don't think there *should* be a numerical criteria, as it's entirely possible that the cause of the issue is actually rooted somewhere else (such as a change in traditional counters or gold income or items) than make that change a larger contributing factor that should be addressed instead.\n\nThat said, if I was asked to come up with hard statistics *anyway*, the following might be good guidelines to strongly consider serious adjustments:\n\n* A win rate of 60%+ in any MMR bracket among players with little to moderate experience on that champion (showing that it is far easier to achieve success from little to no experience).\n* An increase of over +5% in win rate towards the upper 50's after any given change, again among players with little to moderate experience on that champion.\n* A global ban rate of 20%+ across the majority of regions.\n\nI think most of these are tuned high enough that they'd filter through most popularity shifts, and you'd only get a few outliers that qualify. Ultimately, however, I still think the method of \"appraise on a case-by-case basis based on the entire game ecosystem rather than numerical values of pick/ban/win rates\" is something I think is going to be far more accurate and lead to overall superior results -- the proposed changes above, for example, would indicate a need for *nerfs*, when the reality might be a need for *rebalancing* or an adjustment of the skill curve.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fízz v2","date":"2019-03-12T19:50:15.020+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":12,"body":"If ban rate can be correlated to frustration, Fizz having an extremely low ban rate means he can get buffed right? {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2019-03-12T20:03:17.755+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":5,"body":"The way we've been thinking about topics like this is that a very low ban rate more means that he doesn't need to be nerfed, not that he NEEDS to be buffed.","replies":[{"poster":"Fízz v2","date":"2019-03-12T20:07:15.409+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":"Sure not every champ with a low ban rate needs a buff, but what about his presence in pro play/high elo, and players like Jensen or Dopa saying that Fizz is weak?    \n\n\nI think if you had room to buff Zed when he had like 30%+ ban rate, there should be room for Fizz as well.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2019-03-12T20:16:55.520+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":9,"body":"He is weak for them.

Riven is a champion who deserves to be picked in the situations where she should be good. I also think this particular situation, where it really does seem clear what the problem is, calls for a nerf. It's obvious that Riven's ability to sustain in lane better after receiving the changes to Conqueror is what has led to this strange shift in her overall power level, and honestly lane sustain is something that doesn't necessarily belong in the game anyway. Fleet has been a problem since it was released, and now Conqueror as well. I think if there is some sustain that needs to be injected into lane, it definitely should not be on a keystone (and thus both take up a significant power budget **and** crowd out other options because lane sustain is more impactful as the early game is more impactful). \n\nI think that Second Wind is a good example of what sustain should look like, and Bloodline or whatever the life steal rune is from Precision is good too. Maybe there just needs to be one of those in each tree, with a ban on taking two at once?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ﬂoo","date":"2019-03-12T23:45:35.592+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this rule should ever make its way into your balancing, will that be a reason to finally change something about Yasuo, who has been under critic since his release?","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2019-03-14T07:08:44.240+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should just delete the champion to be honest.

This does not narrow down _whats_ to strong though... \n\"current state\" takes into account itemization in this case since its a general thing as riven has historically been a very \"i function well no matter the meta\" champion. If an item change is made and most champions who use it go up in both win rate/ pick rate suddenly and considerably its safe to say the item is at fault. \n\nAwakened dragon is really quite bonkers on everyone who uses it. A nerf to that would be well deserved - removing the ASP for example would keep the item as intended (an in-combat CDR source for fighters) but remove its inherent synergy that leads to easy abuse. \n~~As for riven, buff up her shield base and remove the ratio. That thing scales harder than a kayle with twelve item slots and makes punishing her impossible.~~\nAnother thing related to spear of shojin would be giving it a different passive and just moving the essence flare effect onto transcendence, that way you can make the CDR scale attack speed instead of giving flat offense stats.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellmaximus1","date":"2019-03-13T04:41:41.876+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"60% of a 16% ban-rate that's a 4% difference between NA and other regions (NA sits at 20.9%), it's kind of misleading to say NA has 60% more than other servers when that's just a 4% difference (not even 1/4).\n\nThat means other servers don't think she has a higher priority than other OP picks (such as Vayne, Yasuo, Zed, Neeko).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2019-03-12T19:56:00.281+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for coming to post here Repertoir, I really mean it.

She is banned 60% more often in NA than her global average. Ban rate is a readily available statistic that we believe can be correlated to frustration. I also said  on Twitter that Riven is a strong champion right now. Somehow that didn't make this post.\n\nVery likely it got overshadowed. You did say she was strong but not the strongest, which set people off because the data that is only available to us tells us she is. I do agree that when she's strong, she gets banned a lot here compared to other regions. I'm pretty sure that's due to the fact she has more one tricks here than in lets say, Korea (correct me if i'm wrong on that). \nThis means that there are more people here using her that know how to use her to the best of her potential on top of mitigating the effects of a losing situation/matchup. This is amplified when sometimes the counters for the champ are not doing well in soloqueue, the specific region, or in specific rank tiers.\n\n> There are good justifications to be made for nerfing Riven. I personally think some are pretty compelling. Good arguments can be constructed to nerf many things, however, and we want to be sure we're applying consistent measures in our approach to balance. I think we've not been great at this over the years, really.\n\nBeing honest on the fact you guys haven't been the best at it over the years is great. Transparency like this is what people like myself are looking for. If i'm honest, both sides haven't been great over the years (for their own reasons). I'd vouch for more cooperative work, but at the same time the community can get heated and tend to be rude about it, which then kinda puts you guys off. \nHell, there's been times where I was like that, but i'm learning from that, especially when Aatrox got hit with the massive sustain nerf on top of the loss of a dash charge. I want to help fix that but its hard in my current position.\n\n> Some champion will always be the strongest one that does not get nerfed in a patch. This patch Riven's pretty darn close to that. If she picks up any more, she's probably due, but we don't think she's crossing that line right now.\n\nI'd agree if I could understand what goes into determining what is strong in the balance team's terms. That's a thing that is mentioned a few times, but is inconsistent since certain cases call for certain approaches. Some get hotfixed (On Hit Neeko for example), and some take maybe even a month before something notable affects the pick (Klepto IBG Vik).\n\n> For those that are actually seeking a discussion, what is the criteria we should be using to justify a nerf to Riven this patch that we'd be 100% happy with applying to champions in the future (NOT the past, as I've already stated we haven't been consistent)?\n\nI'd put my answer, but at the same time it's hard figuring that out with the lack of equivalent data and knowing how things work for that team on my side. I do know transparency for certain balance situations like this one is key. As I mentioned in my reply tweet, it doesn't help that both sides might have conflicting data (or lack of knowing how something strong is determined by the other side). \n\nWith one side not being transparent enough just makes it harder for the situation to reach a common ground where people can agree on. It makes it harder to understand. Even then, I also want to know what the community wants as criteria going forward. I know that sometimes winrate and pickrate in certain cases doesn't mean a pick is strong. For Riven's case, she's doing a bit too good that it opens her up to more people even though she was mainly balanced around her mains. I think that's one of the major gripes the community has about the situation.\n\nMainly my question is, how do you guys determine what makes a champion strong on average currently? I feel like knowing that could help generate some suggestions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raiyza","date":"2019-03-13T14:58:21.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bEraBg5K,comment-id=000e,timestamp=2019-03-12T19:15:25.451+0000)\n>\n\n> Good arguments can be constructed to nerf many things, however, and we want to be sure we're applying consistent measures in our approach to balance.
