Balance team has been joking around for the past couple of years. Whether you agree or disagree with such a time length, you could just focus on the past year as a good example as my examples are within the past year.\r\n\r\nBefore even looking at examples, you probably want to know what exact I, and probably most people, want to see coming out of the balance team and gameplay. Using Worlds for an example, you&#039;ll see almost every kill, if not all of them, where the results of jungler ganks or 5 man deathballs. Where&#039;s the self snowballing and skill expression of map rotation? It&#039;s literally just picking up the nearest objective these days, though most players don&#039;t even do that themselves. Point is: It&#039;s boring and it&#039;s not fun to watch or play. I don&#039;t like seeing teamwide snowballing so you auto win the 5 man deathballs, nor do I enjoy solo kills being not worth it.\r\n\r\nI simply want a state of the game where no class(es) are ungodly overpowered in comparison to another, splitpushing is a viable tactic and not negated by taking Baron, solo kills are meaningful, teamwide snowballing isn&#039;t as high as it currently is, no class(es) or items invalidate another class. I want powercreeped reduced.\r\n\r\nThese examples aren&#039;t your memed, &quot;Ekko fares well against mages...&quot;, these are actual statements in patches or by Rioters that reveal how terrible balance has been.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/zhXLbxf.png\r\n\r\nIn summary, he&#039;s saying &quot;We buffed supports as class and gave them more impact in hopes that it would make support more popular as a role.&quot; Do you notice the problem with this? Perhaps making supports stronger inadvertently makes ADCs broken. Perhaps this inadvertently makes assassins and bruisers weaker. Did Riot consider any of this? Based on the previous patches of the game not buffing bruisers or assassins in any way, nor nerfing the peeling effects of ADCs (or lifesteal), no they did not.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LeBlancMains/comments/6wqe87/dear_riot_balance_team/dmax6n1/\r\n\r\nThis one happens to be a favorite of the boards. If AD carries have been broken since, we&#039;ll say, right before mid season, why wasn&#039;t this covered in 2-3 patches? If they didn&#039;t realize it, yet somehow &#039;crowd sources&#039; did, then isn&#039;t that a fault on their research? Also I&#039;m fairly certain the game has been competitive in others states, but maybe this is just a result of other unfixed factors.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/A4X8PI2.png\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think this should have been memed more than the Ekko thing. This wasn&#039;t a simple mistake, this was just absolute backwards design. Before being nerfed, Fiora was very powered. Now she&#039;s nerfed and an overpowered item, which is killing the bruiser class, exists. If you are a game designer, what do you do? Perhaps nerf the overpowered item? Maybe making Fiora auto win again, but this time only if her opponent can&#039;t buy Bramble Vest, is a bad design choice.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind the original context about giving Thornmail heal reduction, &quot;Against champions and teams that lean on heavy healing and regeneration effects, tanky melee types sometimes feel like they&rsquo;re actually hurting their team by serving as convenient health batteries.&quot; Clearly, they&#039;re talking about AD carries because the only melee champion who could drain tank is Fiora. Surely, Aatrox and Irelia are not related. So here&#039;s a good question, Why is the heal reduction not against ranged only?\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/l1d1mJB.png\r\n\r\nHe&#039;s talking about Sterak&#039;s Gage. I didn&#039;t know it gave anything near 20% cooldown reduction and 24% armor pen and a movement speed bonus extra.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/vx7EMWE.png\r\n\r\nApparently Riot isn&#039;t aware about what champions are broken. Don&#039;t know what else to say.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OX1CqOH.png\r\n\r\nFirst thing pointing out: **This guy is not someone who works in balance design or playtesting.** Second thing, focus on that 54% winrate for Pantheon. You can check op.gg for his winrate over the past 6 months if you&#039;d like. Apparently, &#039;better communication&#039; would help people better understand why a champion who you can&#039;t outplay or interact with is allowed to be broken.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/kRngWxZ.png\r\n\r\nJust using this to point out that there isn&#039;t a single person at fault, but instead an entire team.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhat does any of this mean? I&#039;m spreading the news. It&#039;s up for your interpretation for the most part, but it&#039;s a clear sign that something is going wrong.\r\n\r\nThe balance team has worked on the game for over 4 years now. The gloves are off, and there&#039;s no excuses left. They couldn&#039;t or refused to balance season 7. Now the game is in total chaos from a lack of checking numbers, despite apparently working on preseason instead of fixing the remaining season 7. I give them until the season officially begins to solve this chaos, and everything they refuses to fix in season 7 that still remains. If they cannot reach, &quot;a state of the game where no class(es) are ungodly overpowered in comparison to another, splitpushing is a viable tactic and not negated by taking Baron, solo kills are meaningful, teamwide snowballing isn&#039;t as high as it currently is, no class(es) or items invalidate another class.&quot; by half way minimum, then they have failed.\r\n\r\nUnofficially the last chance the balance team has to prove themselves as people who aren&#039;t faking a balance team. Here&#039;s a hint, &quot;In most cases with direct gameplay, &#039;Do not increase defenses; reduce damage instead.&#039; will almost always apply.&quot; Good luck.","replies":[{"poster":"EternalShock","date":"2017-11-10T02:35:57.020+0000","up_votes":68,"down_votes":8,"body":"the rengar nerf and twitch not being nerfed like him pretty much explained to me how they thought ( or didnt )\n\nbias is their middle name and they are proud to wear their nametag as long as the game makes money.\n\nthey had the AUDACITY to call out their balance team and show us their ranks.\n\nnot one of the names mentioned played bruisers. not one. not even a fiora player. they KNEW what they were doing when they nerfed this class and fucked it constantly for 3 seasons.\n\nthey played braindead tanks that have percent hp damage some shitty support mains abusing ardent and lulus polymorph and the rest are caitlyn/tristana/kog mains.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-11-10T02:39:48.019+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3076}} \"What do you mean bias?\" {{champion:40}}","replies":[{"poster":"EternalShock","date":"2017-11-10T03:02:43.930+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":0,"body":"what do u mean we understand top lane and how champions should work {{champion:114}}{{champion:31}} ","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-11-10T04:01:44.036+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:126}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:150}}","replies":[{"poster":"EternalShock","date":"2017-11-10T04:37:27.102+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"pantheon and jayce fall off bro jsut dont walk into lane as a melee for 60 minutes and THEN they wont do as much damage as they could be doing\"\n\n\"bro just dont walk near maokai and get cced lol\", \"just dont play a melee and ur fine bro\"\n\n\"frozen mallet is fine bro im silver support main i know how gnar works dude.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Squey","date":"2017-11-10T19:53:52.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"No one ever makes an actual argument on pantheon.

Not being ahead. Team fighting. \n\nYour one and only goal when dealing with pantheon is not getting him ahead.  If he goes even in lane or in comparison to everyone in the game then he lost and will most likely cost his team the game.  If he doesnt kill you in lane and any roaming he does is made up for elsewhere then you won.  It doesnt matter if your behind nearly as much as it matters that pantheon has gottten more gold then anyone else.\nYes u can complain about his kit being really old and lacks the kind of counterplay we are used to.  But if u complain about pantheon then you cant let gp pass either.  They play pretty much the same.\nPantheon point and click Q's you whenever your in range.  Gp does exact same thing but also applies on hit effects like grasp and crit.\nPantheon has block thats counters auto's and turret shots.  Gp  has oranges that give him sustain and negate cc.\nPantheon has good roaming with ult.  Gp doesnt even have to roam to impact other lanes with his ult.\nPantheon snowballs early and falls off.

IMO Support's power should *always* be in their kit, or alongside items that merely empower their kit in a minor way - not allow them to turn ADCs into super-statsticks. **It isn't like their kits didn't do an effective job**. The game's pacing + length should not be fast+short, because it goes against the fundamental design of the game; inevitably rendering some systems ineffective and twisting the game into something else - something that **didn't** amass it the fanbase it has today.","replies":[{"poster":"WiegrafOfValor","date":"2017-11-10T11:01:29.364+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://postcron.com/pt/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/gotit.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slich Bissi","date":"2017-11-10T16:14:36.170+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I used to main support.

It's entirely possible for two people to have different views on a subject. If we want to understand the divide in which two people disagree on a topic, you have to know what both think. \n\nFrom the arguments I see from the Cho topic, people dislike Cho building Full Tank, Stone Plating, Righteous Glory into one shotting carries with his ult. Understandable, but from what I hear from Riot's perspective, though I can't find a source, they have a point as well. If Cho is going to build Full Tank and do that, he is consolidating all his power into that single Ultimate use. \n\nAll his abilities are simply a means to an end, more specifically, your end via Ultimate. Due to Cho's Ult being low range, the Teamwork around beating him becomes fending off this giant monster coming at you, which is very thematically sound with someone like Cho'Gath. If Cho can't get past the front line, his one-shot is wasted on a less profitable target, like a Tank who won't die instantly. So the trade off is a lack of powerful ranged damaged tools, for an extremely potent close range that requires tankiness to use and to get into position.\n\nSome will argue that difficulty is overcome with Flash, but I'll argue back that most champion's difficulties are overcome with flash in general. \n\nSo, we have two people with two separate views on a problem. Anti-One-Shots think Cho shouldn't be able to do this, or to the extreme that he can do it. Riot believes he should, and though they've discussed whether or not it's too potent with a comment about \"changing Stone-plate so it isn't entirely bonus health\", they're okay with the dynamic that exists. \n\nSo my problem is, is that you think you are absolutely right about something being broken, and if Riot can't see it, then there is something wrong with them. That's incredibly black and white, and discounts the idea of discussion. They definitely do know about it, but in their opinions, they think that the trade-off between his Full Tank and AP playstyles is significant enough for it to be okay. \n\nThe thoughts about ADCs are pretty similar to mine, and I agree with you there. But assuming that you are the ultimate authority on if something is broken or not is where I see a problem in the name of arguing shit.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-11-10T06:23:23.445+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":17,"body":"Cho perma slows in lane with E so not really.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-11-10T06:38:30.364+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":3,"body":"You're missing the point of my small essay if you're focusing on that.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-11-10T07:07:58.931+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":15,"body":"Because I don't really care about his ult, nor is his full AP build even a build.

That&#x27;s not skillful rotations.\n\nThe weird \"deathballs\" assertion aside for now, why does rotation have to look exactly like you want it to look? Part of a game designed around meta shifts is that everything doesn't stay the same and stale over a long period of time. Even if 1-3-1 specifically is bad, and I'm not saying it necessarily is in all cases, why is that a bad thing, and what relevancy does it have to the overall state of rotations?","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-11-10T17:14:17.659+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"1-3-1 is an example, but you clearly missed the point.","replies":[{"poster":"Morgan le Fey","date":"2017-11-10T18:55:25.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AirKingNeo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EZbcUBMj,comment-id=000500000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-11-10T17:14:17.659+0000)\n>\n> 1-3-1 is an example, but you clearly missed the point.\n\nMaybe.

Teamfight metas typically revolve around powerful engages and aoe combos that punish clumped teams, deathball meta revolves around a late game carry and their team peeling and cc'ing the enemy. \n\nDeathball isn't about carefully orchestrating an engage, managing resources (sums and ults), and timing abilities, it's about your primary tank walking under the enemy tower and sitting there while your support, mage, and secondary tank/secondary support spoon-feed kills into the grinder that is your adc - you snowball, get an advantage, and bludgeon the enemy to death with a massive bag of gold while they hide under a useless tower and desperately try to kite back.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Brotha","date":"2017-11-10T02:38:39.726+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":5,"body":"> Designers at Riot are given quite high agency to make their own decisions and are not held at the whim of some random silver overlord.\n\nSo they're rarely if ever held accountable for their fuck ups, if you're below a certain rank your opinion will immediately be disregarded, and knowing this they have no incentive to do their job.
