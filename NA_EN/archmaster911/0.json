I made a lot of efforts to get into gold elo. I love this game and I respect it also, but when I play ranked, some people just feeds intentionally, they troll, and it makes me mad. Like me too I want to climb elos, but some people literally doesn't let me. And I also paid a lot of money on this game, so I would like to get back my account for that also. During this moment, I was also gonna get the new skin of Yasuo, Nightbringer one.
