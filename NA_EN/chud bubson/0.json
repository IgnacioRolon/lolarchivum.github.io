Why not skip the month before the patch when they are on near permaban status and do small changes like lowering base damage by 5 or ad by 2 or something to make them more difficult to abuse if no one bans them?  From a technical standpoint, would it be too stressful for the servers, changing more often, or can our feeble minds just not handle the unforeseeable long-term consequences?

We used to have kassadin and yasuo who literally had a combined pick/banrate reaching over 100%. Most champions boards complains about are purely circlejerk.

Just more anti assassin circlejerk bait.  Bans are all player perception. They have almost nothing to do with actual power and are never going to be used strategically outside of premades or pro play.

There is a reason riot buffed him recently which put him to the spot he is in now which is more or less average. \n\nHe doesn't seem to have a dent in damage because the tank items all bring way too much damage with them. That's not an ekko issue it's the items. To say it makes zero difference is straight hyperbole which no one actively balancing this game cares about. It obviously hits his total damage potential but since getting ulted by ekko if you aren't afk, or CC'ed isnt a thing you are never going to notice that his ult is hitting you for far less damage. On top of that he doesn't explode instantly so he has more time to use his passive. If AP ekko bursted you you would notice the difference instantly. Instead of burst he gains a longer window to deal sustained damage which always takes longer than straight burst. \n\nOverpowered is warwick pressing R and melting over 60% of your hp while you are supressed. Overpowered is Kassadin chasing you down 700 range blinks while building tanky and silencing you for 2.5 seconds. I could keep going. \n\nThe point of items is to get rid of your weaknesses. Ekkos main weakness is that his damage is unreliable when built full AP and if he goes in and get's CC'ed he explodes. So yeah I would go tank too if it meant I got to function.\n\nWhy would I care about yi who has already been addressed and if it is worth nerfing will probably get nerfed again? Hell that build has been available for months. It just takes the boards too long to learn about what is actually good so they know what to complain about.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-04-06T04:52:06.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You are the one that implied replacing a number is easy.

I guarantee the backend for LoL isn't written in an interpreted language like Perl. It is probably a combination of Java and C/C++. Both of these languages are compiled (I am aware Java emits byte code and C/C++ emits machine code).\n\nOn the C/C++ side (assuming use of gcc), changing a single number with high enough optimization level can actually have a significant changes to the emitted machine code (I'm not sure the level where this happens, high level optimizations have really strange effects on your applications behavior as you go past 3, and 3 itself isn't always a safe choice). I truly hope LoL isn't run with anything great than -O2 (-O3 and above can actually disable explicit memory corruption protections in the name of performance, creating security vulnerabilities).\n\nIt can also have unintended consequences elsewhere in code for a codebase that suffers from severe technical debt (the boards likes to refer to this as spaghetti code, but that is not entirely accurate; spaghetti code is a type of technical debt).\n\nNow, if champion numbers were stored externally such as in a relational database or a config file there wouldn't even need to be a code change. However, in C/C++ there are performance gains to be had by hardcoding numeric values as the compiler can make better optimization decisions. The config file approach gets complicated for large scale distributed systems, which may require repackaging the backend (which, depending on tooling, may require a rebuild of the software) if something like Puppet isn't being used to manage configuration. The database approach has complications depending on replication schemes and colocation considerations.\n\nI'm going to stop going down this rabbit hole now.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/23fX9dd.png&noredirect","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sneakyy XD","date":"2016-04-06T15:44:56.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NgydW5vR,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-04-06T02:05:52.535+0000)\n>\n> Hotfixes have a much shorter testing time available to them than regular patch changes.

I don't think she needs straight buffs though, her reworked kit has a lot of problems that need to be addressed.\n\nNamely the reward on her ult makes no sense and feels out of place on her kit and %HP true damage was a terrible idea. I think Fiora's vitals should be changed to deal %HP magic damage. This makes her still hard for bruisers to duel since she has a phys/magic split but overall she'd be less able to just go in and blow up a tank. Obviously this change would need to come with some damage buffs since changing true damage to magic is a straight nerf in almost every situation.\n\nAs for her ult I'd say something like empowering her vital procs and bumping the heal on them would be better than her team wide heal.
