Have you ever encountered, whilst in Solo Q, someone that goes 25/0 and has 100% kp playing a hyper carry assassin in the mid lane? No? Good because I sure as hell have. Generally, this would be all fine and what not, but when you make your way into the post-game lobby chat, you see that same person and they say \"Don't worry, I'm a smurf\" this part angers me to the core, yes... I'm going to worry because the fact that you're playing against me (a Silver player) while you're a lvl 250 Diamond 1, 20LP player is absolutely ridiculous. I have some pictures and of something that I think you should see as well.\nhttps://image.ibb.co/jWzLZe/screenshot_20180902_163732.png\nhttps://image.ibb.co/hfgZue/screenshot_20180902_163638.png\nhttps://image.ibb.co/njUb7z/screenshot_20180902_163944.png\n\nNow whether you choose to view these or not is up to you, but this is a clear example of what the people that smurf are looking to do. Don't think its ranked?\nhttps://image.ibb.co/b3ONEe/screenshot_20180904_171142.png\nIt's the same person, but what was he having fun doing? Smashing players in lower ELO. Now I reported this person via support direct, but every time you do that you don't know if they are actually doing anything because of the privacy policy. (Which is also another thing how does knowing if someone was banned invade their privacy?). The real reason for my report on him is because he was also boosting, which is a whole 'nother thing, luckily... it's bannable. To be entirely honest here, I do have more than 1 account, yes, but I have never played ranked on it, check it if you want it's username is DigitalSteven. I also never go on it, only if I'm playing with my lvl 15 friend (ReddTrout). The point is, my reason is actually acceptable, we don't play ranked, the games don't actually matter, I just don't want him to be playing against people 50 levels above him.\n\nBut until this point I never really addressed the topic of why it should be punishable, but at this point it goes without saying. Smurfing in Ranked Queues make the game not fun to play for those in lower ELO's and can lead to players not wanting to play and not have fun playing. Now tell me if you have fun playing against a 15/0 twitch that one shots your entire team, just because... \"why the hell not, accounts are free and smurfing isn't punishable so I'm going to ruin other people's MMR's so I can have fun!\"\n\nIn all seriousness, I see the problem here, though, they can't know if it's really a smurf or someone doing really good. To that I say \"Well why can't we just report them to support if they admit to it?\" I mean it's a good point too, if they say \"Oh btw I'm a smurf\" and have a score of 20/1 the people that work at support should be able to decipher \"Hey there may be something fishy going on here.\" Now, \"Hold up!\" I hear you saying, \"this will give the people at support way too much work and they could never keep up!\" Well, I never said it had to be a fast ban or suspension or something, just at least something to make players not want to smurf as much. These could include longer queue times or just getting matched with their actual ELO. That's the real reason smurfing isn't punishable because the automated system can't tell if it's really a smurf or not, well not everything has to be automated, we have a manual report system for a reason. It's like talking to a robot on a phone then waiting 10 minutes for it to finally say \"Press 0 to be connected with customer service or press 'pound' for more options,\" it's just aggravating and starts to test your patience with the game, I know I've stopped playing for a week in fear I'll run into those scumbags.\n\nEither way, that's just my rant about smurfing, I'd love to hear your response, even though it will most likely be \"Silver? LOL I'm Diamond, get good kid.\" To that I reply \"The reason they have the MMR is to match people up with their rank and there's a reason I'm not in higher ELO, I'm not that good at the game.\"\nGGWP, Riot, GGWP.\n\n-EDIT- I think I got this before anyone could comment about it, I get that pros smurf because they don't want to mess up their main account, I see no problem with that, because their \"smurf\" is still in Masters/Challengers, I'll take TF Blade as my example, his main account (at time of post) is ranked Challenger #1 with 1218 LP, his secondary account (I know he has many account but they are probably high Diamond/low Masters) TF Blade 2 is currently ranked Challenger #5 928 LP. If you get it, the point is that both of his accounts are in challenger, and he will always be playing with around his MMR, I know he had to get there, but for pros, it doesn't take that long and they don't purposefully stick an account in silver win 10 games and lose 1 to stay in silver. \n\n-EDIT 2- For the above edit, I realize that it isn't really a smurf, this is more of an alternate (or \"alt\") account, which is acceptable. I mentioned this in a reply to a comment so I'm going to talk more about it here, not all smurfs are bad, some truly just want to get up to the higher ELO with their smurf, that's fine, but if it matches or overtakes your main accounts MMR, it is just an alt account. It's the people that abuse smurfing to stay in low ELO on purpose so they can continue to \"pwn newbs\" (wreck lower ELO). This is done by them winning a few times then purposefully losing so they can stay in low MMR.\n\n-EDIT 3- **Please ensure that you read the entire post before commenting, this isn't addressed at all smurfs, just the ones who abuse smurfing in lower ranks. A couple of comments have thought that I am targeting all smurfs in general, I'm not.**","replies":[{"poster":"Alex h8721","date":"2018-09-04T21:53:28.697+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"You know what's just as tilting? when the smurf is on your team and they say \"haha i don't care about winning this game, im keeping this account in this elo for fun, its my smurf\"\n\nAnd they'll soft int/throw the game on purpose (but this isnt detectable by riot's trash punishment system).","replies":[{"poster":"Phlumph","date":"2018-09-05T21:15:09.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Did this a bit this season on a different account (this one is not my main, I just use it for playing with silver friends so Norms games don’t suck for them) because the meta for the champions I like to play was so godawful this season they were basically unplayable. Tbh, playing like a monkey on purpose and doing stupid shit is the most fun I’ve ever had in league. I started out in Bronze back in S6, and seeing silver again after leaving it is absolutely eye opening.\n\nThere’s nothing you can really do to prevent inters from joining your game. But there are easy ways to spot them. Let me give you the best example: Press. Fucking. Tab.\n\nI have to say, the lack of awareness in Silver and below is astounding. When one of your teammates is building full attack speed Teemo (no actual damage or on hit effects though) with hexflash and never finishes an item, that should be a pretty damn obvious troll. But no one ever seemed to press tab and see WHY the Teemo was 2/9. Or when the Evelynn on that same team is 11/2 but is literally never in teamfights or defending objectives, just AFK counterjungling and killing for fun, that should be pretty obvious. But no one figures this out until the very end, and if they do they only notice one of the two. In higher elos that shit would have been obvious to everyone very quickly. In one game of like 14, a single Brand player caught on to what was happening. My friend and I even agreed that if anyone in Silver could put the damn pieces together before the game ended that we would actually try. You want to know the best way to spot a troll? Press tab and look at the build. Is it retarded? Well then, there you go. The second case where someone is purposely never helping is tougher to spot in low elo because it’s sort of standard for people to not know what’s going on. In the troll case it’s taken to a “tactically bad” level, where it’s clearly intentional they’re farming enemy jungle while 2 people are taking your inhibitor. Inting is reportable but if no one realizes it they can just pretend they’re bad or new players. Ranking down is a large part acting. But if you can spot it and call them out, there’s a good chance you can get them to actually try, as a 9x report isn’t something they want.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Subject 5","date":"2018-09-04T21:50:45.827+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Think Riot is busy focusing on the **real **problem.\n\nBad language.","replies":[{"poster":"Buckeye2002","date":"2019-11-06T19:03:42.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Subject 5,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XAVun5s3,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-09-04T21:50:45.827+0000)\n>\n> Think Riot is busy focusing on the **real **problem.\n> \n> Bad language.\n\nnow this is hilarious.

It can be hurtful if it's directed at other players, i.e. someone being toxic to another player by saying something along the lines of \"You're shit kid, uninstall,\" while I usually just mute the people, some players simply refuse to ignore it and start a heated argument.

His smurf should either be banned -OR- (as I said in the post) should experience longer queue times so that way it at least makes them not want to continue playing on the smurf. I see you're point it would be stupid to ban the main account, which is why I didn't talk about that. BUT to be perfectly clear, ban evading is also against the ToS, in a way and I quote \n\"If your account is terminated, you’ll no longer have access to it, including any of the associated data or content (e.g., champions, skins, Riot Points, etc.). You’ll not be entitled to any refunds and we’ll have no liability to you.

Also when I say this and why I went on the rant is because some smurfs intentionally stay in lower ELO's to continue curb stomping the lower ELO people. When they say \"HAHAHAHA\" in post-game lobby chat, they aren't doing it to recreate an account, they are doing it to win a ton of games then soft int in some to stay in low ELO on purpose. As I said in the main post in the edit, not all smurfs are bad, just the ones that abuse creating a new account to continue destroying low MMR.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Koiyaki","date":"2018-09-04T23:34:27.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I havent been in ur same situation, rather the situation of someone saying that they re on their smurf and dont care about winning, aince im mid diamond atm. But i think another problem is that there are alot of proplr who say their smurfing in order to get a role or champ or just some internet cookies....whn they actually arent.\n\nIts things like this where making a catch all system is diffucult, people slipping through the cracks or people getting punished for the lies of others. For example say u get into a game and 2 people on ur team soft int one person in particular, say their mid. That mid has been on a decent win streak laterly cuz the matchmaking gods actually gave them teamatws with hands, so this game would be their 8th win. The mid laner ends up with over 20 kills and 98% kp. Someone on ur team is super salty, but the soft int from ur teamates isnt notices by anyone else on ur team. Lets say ur top accuses the mid for smurfing, so they get reportes by him. If there was a smurf punishment in place, the mid would get watever punishment their is, but heres the kicker. Its his main acc and as i said, hes just been getting lucky, now he auffers cuz 1 person was salty. Now this may not be a direct abuse of any proposed system, but there will be people who witch hunt people on win streaks just to report them for smurfing, how do we tell the diffencw...i coulsnt tell ya.\n\nIn all honesty idk how this could be solved besides forcing peoplem to use something permanat and unique id for each peraon. For NA, ssn would be obvious, but how many people in na would be inclined to do that? And with how good hackers are getting, its just anothe avenue for even more swnsitive information out there.\n\nBest i can say is mute them if the gloat in all chat. The people who smurf in low elo for nothing but the 'luls' obviously have small egos they wanna swell. I have a smurf, but it was made accidentally when i was trying to make a euw acc to play with some friends there.  I barely ever use it unless some of my frienda wanna flex and im not doing anything else. Peraonally if i 'wanna smash lowbies' i got norms for that. No need to mess up rankes more than it already is. But thats jist my 3 cents...","replies":[]}]}
