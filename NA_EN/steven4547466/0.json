Why?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"This is another example (like twisted treeline) of something people don't use because it's old and needs to be reworked. Removing it is lazy, removing TT was lazy, you could've fixed the game mode and made it better, but no need to talk about that anymore, it's gone. But why is Ohmwrecker getting removed? This is an insanely old. **named** item, this one item has a ton of history of league. It was from the youtuber with the same name that got added when he referred 1000 verified players, it's 7 years old now and it's just getting removed because Riot seems to think removing old things instead of making them better is the way to go. How long until they remove old champions then? (Probably never because lore, but you get the point).

How is it lazy to remove something that has a proven record of not getting any sort of traction? You would be delirious to think that reworking ohmwrecker for the 90th time is going to cause any sort of positive effect when the last 89 times haven't done anything. \n\nYoi can complain all you want it doesn't change the FACT that neither the mode nor the item has gotten any sort of traction whatsoever, despite the attempts done to try to make them be more appealing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChaosReyn","date":"2019-11-19T00:54:41.342+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"In the case of TT, they *did* rework it...and still, almost nobody played it in comparison to even ARAM. They didnt make that decision on TT to be lazy - they removed it because it didn't perform, and they wanted more free server space.\n\nSimilarly, Ohmwrecker isn't performing in that same type of way. It's not as simple as \"it's niche\", more than \"it's completely inferior in every way.\" People took Zzrot Portal if they needed that point runner bonus...there was no need for Ohmwrecker *at all* because the Zzrots could do more to stall out towers than Ohmwrecker anyway, and it had better stats, a more versatile active, and a better all-around...everything.\n\nSure...they could rework it...but it's not a case of \"underused\", it's a case of \"NEVER used\". As in, you *MIGHT* see an Ohmwrecker consistently built in game by maybe...well...less people than the \"0.0006% of players that are permabanned\". It was simply not used by the playerbase.","replies":[{"poster":"BladeSteel","date":"2019-11-19T00:57:09.120+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"They reworked it into a much poorer version.
