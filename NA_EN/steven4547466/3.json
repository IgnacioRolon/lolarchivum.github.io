Now personally I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s fair that I have to dodge a game because someone got filled and said they will feed. Other than reporting this/these player(s) is there anything else I can do, because queue wait times are annoying and there is no way to stop someone from int feeding.\r\n\r\nEither way, has this ever happened to you/what did/could you do about it. Not only does it lose LP, but it also can make you lose your series which is annoying because it&#039;s not your fault that someone said they are going to feed.","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2018-06-24T00:02:25.042+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played many champ select where someone said they will feed.  Only roughly maybe 1 in 8 games where they actually do it in-game.  If someone say that, I would call the bluff (not egg them on, but play the game anyway).  Either they are bluffing and play the game normal or I get the chance to report them so they can't do that do other people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chimichanga soda","date":"2018-06-25T17:44:07.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you see these people the best thing is to screenshot their text and submit a support ticket.
