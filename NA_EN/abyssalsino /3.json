That's the truth.\n\nWhen talking about your punishment it doesn't matter what everyone else did only what you did as you are responsible for your own actions.\n\nAns while it may very well be the truth it is still a insult.\n\n>Kept saying i was crying through the entire game, i asked someone to loan the kid a dictionary. Not an insult.\n\nCalling someone a kid is a insult when used in a derogatory way as you did.  It also directly attacks the persons intellect when you say they need a dictionary.\n\n>I was pretty friendly with that guy, really. I got ganked mid, he got worried and TP'd to scare them off. All i said was i had that double if he didn't use his TP to scare them off.\n\nYou might think that.  However it doesn't mean that everyone else does.  I personally found it to be nothing more then blaming and attacking.\n\n\n>I followed up and died, and was apparently reported for intentionally feeding. Isn't it normal to not want to follow up again?\n\nI never said you have to follow up.   However flat out telling your team you will not help is very negative.\n\n\n>He was calling me bad through the entire game and i thought i'd point out a misplay he made. Nobodys perfect.\n\nI don't care what they did/say.   That has no bearing on your punishments.

It just doesn't matter when addressing yours.   You are responsible for your actions they are responsible for theirs.   As long as they are reported it will be addressed.   If you are in any way worried you can always report these type of threats via a support ticket as well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-02T21:55:36.162+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can choose to mute them, or you can choose to get permanently banned if you keep it up.\n\nYou say you won't be convinced you were wrong.
