I have a couple of things that can help resolve this. First off, make sure you update your Avast Antivirus. You can find the most up to date virus definitions for download [here](http://www.avast.com/download-update)!\n \nSecond step is adding League of Legends to your Exclusion list. We have a Firewall troubleshooting guide [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#jwq2) that will show you which files to add. \n \n Please let me know if that works for you!","replies":[{"poster":"McKecks","date":"2014-11-24T22:52:49.237+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so I added League of legends to my exemptions and then i uninstalled league. after uninstalling it i then went into my downloads file and i started the re-install and it worked so thank for everyone who helped!","replies":[]},{"poster":"zacharus","date":"2014-11-24T22:41:55.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that Avast actually deleted a part of the game and it can't launch anymore.

Do you know what file Avast is removing that is causing this issue?\n\n\nOtherwise, You may be able to work around the game not launching by launching from the Lol.launcher.admin.exe file. You can find it at this location:\n\nC:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends","replies":[{"poster":"zacharus","date":"2014-11-24T23:03:40.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I didn't have time to see which file was getting deleted.

We're working as fast as we can to finish the maintenance. It looks like ShoulderPops saw that it deleted lolclient and the lol.launcher files. Were you able to run the Lol.launcher.admin.exe?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"but im an","date":"2014-11-24T22:45:31.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But what happen if u got a different anti virus?
