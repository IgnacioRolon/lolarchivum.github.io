In \"Present times\". It seems that after Xerath left the tomb, he took over a city and became emperor of this \"new capital\" without knowing that Azir ressurected. \n\nThe boy is Renekton as a child... well, a memory of Renekton as a Child created in the mind of Nasus to be exact.\n\n> With a heave, the boy hurled the rock through the air, its perfect arc threatening to shatter mercenary bone on impact.\n> “Renekton, no!” roared Nasus.\n> The riders abandoned their half-hearted deception. Nasus knew then that the caretaker and his wife were dead. Xerath’s greeting would come in the form of cold steel. Truth began to eclipse illusion.\n> Nasus reached for the boy. The child tore into shadows of memory that dissipated across the starlit ground.\n> “Goodbye, brother,” whispered Nasus.\n\nAnd about the picture: Considering that Setaka died like.... looooong time ago, its safe to say that the picture is from the times before the \"fall of Shurima\" (aka, when Xerath destroyed the place).

Probably from just before Nasus left him to attend the Collegium of the Sun.  Xerath is summoning Nasus to Nerimazeth so that Nasus can kneel and pledge loyalty before the empire's rightful ruler (as far as Xerath is concerned).  Nerimazeth was once, long ago, a capital, but lay abandoned for a _very_ long time.\n\n> \"_The Shuriman city of Zuretta is ruled by Hierophant Hadiya Nejem, who believes herself to be a descendant of the Ascended warrior Setaka._\"\n\nI'm not finding your image links to be working, but if we're going by [this image](https://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?f=https%3A%2F%2Funiverse-meeps.leagueoflegends.com%2Fv1%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffactions%2Fimage-gallery%2Fshurima-hierophant.jpg&resize=:1200) labelled the 'Daughter of Setaka' then as Epicurus says - there's no reason to assume that the 'Daughter' is actually a literal daughter of the legendary Ascended warrior, despite what she says.  It _could_ be (like the priest Azrahir Thelamu in Vekaura) a claim to legitimacy that has no basis.  \n\nThere's not enough information to go on (but I will say that the building behind her looks a bit tatty and old to be from the height of the empire.)\n\nSpeaking of image links, just so folks don't get confused (like I did) [this image](https://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?f=https%3A%2F%2Funiverse-meeps.leagueoflegends.com%2Fv1%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Ffactions%2Fimage-gallery%2Fshurima-vekaurastreets.jpg&resize=:1200) of the Streets of Nashramae has a filename that mentions Vekaura.
