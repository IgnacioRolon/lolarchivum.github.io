Honestly I feel it would probably benefit the game. It would extend game time and I think that&rsquo;s a benefit in itself because it would bring those late game champions back into the game. Yes marksmen mains even though I really like your play style I still want to give you the time to get to the point where you can hit your power spike just like every class should. Some champs should hit their power spikes earlier as always but they have to try to win the game before late game comes because that&rsquo;s when they fall off. In addition I would also have no problem with towers becoming more resistant and yes since this would be in a tank meta I think towers should have a anti diving mechanic. This would also makes games longer by I still think it&rsquo;s beneficial. The only thing I see that might be a negative is little jimmy can&rsquo;t play league during lunch time in between classes anymore.","replies":[]}
