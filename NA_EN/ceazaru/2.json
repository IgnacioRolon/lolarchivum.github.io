Here we create an &quot;inclusive&quot; environment by segregating our Consumers based on Gender. Don&#039;t worry that&#039;s not a contradictory statement. Rather than letting people accept each other through interaction we do the direct opposite. We separate them and create the environment that they will resent instead of accepting. Can&#039;t have those dirty man babies interacting with women. I mean why would we let our consumers mingle together to exchange ideas and practices because we all know that&#039;s appropriation. Better to separate our consumers into groups the hate and try to actively avoid each other.\n\n\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}
