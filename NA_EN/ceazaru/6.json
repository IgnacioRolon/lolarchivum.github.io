Mainly on why there is so much damage. If you guys remember at the beginning of the season riot introduced the new rune/mastery system and when they did that they increased the damage of every role and champion in the game while also nerfing all of the armor and magic resist. The new rune system gave us nothing back for the nerf to the resistances and the increase of damage. Every Rune that is in the game right besides conditioning is for damage/offensive actions or sustain and sustain doesn&#039;t really help mush because all it gives you is heath, life steal or health regen so you can still get blown up. Riot has also been nerfing tank items. So I think the way to fix this would be to either revert the resistance nerfs from  the beginning of the season or start introducing flat/scaling resistance runes to the game other than conditioning. You could also nerf damage but i don&#039;t think that will help much. Anyways that&#039;s all.","replies":[]}
