Good luck asking your top laner to TP bot for ganks now. Honestly with this nerf TP may be removed as the primary tool for top laners and be replaced by ignite and we all should know how top lane is when ignite is being used. With towers being paper thin nowadays there will no chance for top laners to get back in lane to protect their tower having to wait on the 6 minute tp cool down. So i guess top lane will an even bigger hell hole with an volatile and snowbally environment that will make the lane be decided in 1 or 2 kills. Gosh I&#039;m tired of my role being shafted because bot laners can&#039;t keep their hands off top laner items and resources.","replies":[]}
