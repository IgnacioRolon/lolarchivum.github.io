Patch 5.20 is almost here so obviously not going to arrive on PBE near the end of 5.20 cycle. Patch is in 2 days, then Halloween is shortly after 2 weeks when 5.21 comes around. Sooo, should be later this week or next week on PBE. 5.21 cycle would be Harrowing stuff because end of October OP.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kneel on Ice","date":"2015-10-14T12:04:30.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you give us some clues ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Tsundere","date":"2015-10-12T18:32:23.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Necromancer Azir pls ;_;","replies":[{"poster":"kneel on Ice","date":"2015-10-14T12:04:10.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lissandra & Azir definitly should be in the harrowing theme","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Epic Murph","date":"2015-10-12T18:32:09.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Drunk Tsundere","date":"2015-10-12T18:32:02.468+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nope.
