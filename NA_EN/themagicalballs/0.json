You can submit a report through a [support request](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to our specialists.\n\nIn the future, I recommend reporting players like this in the *post-game lobby*, as it helps us prioritize who we look at. Let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"No cute name","date":"2016-10-23T07:31:16.609+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I don't know who's in charge of report and banning system. But I can't help telling you what I think.\nSorry if I sound emotional. But this problem upsets me for a long time.\n\nPeople get banned only if they are toxic every game instead of being randomly toxic.\nEveryone knows the mechanism - people can talk offensive language every few games.\nMy girlfriend is unhappy the whole night coz someone abused her in ARAM (I reported him).\nThat guy is plat 3. Guess he only RANDOMLY talked shit, so never got banned and even got to plat 3.\n\nI told her to mute all every game. She forgot it somehow. Also, she doesn't play normal (although she wants to) because people playing normal are more toxic. Even if she mutes everyone, some people knew that, they'll spam pings around her. \n(Btw, she'll always match with smurfs Idk why. New players like ARAM way more because they'll always get slaughtered in normal.)\nJust tell you the truth, I almost reported someone every day in normal. Still there'll always be someone who abuses teammates.\n\nMaybe I could be a little more indifferent coz I'm from China. I know how Chinese servers are like, you never get banned ever, even if you are 10 times more toxic than taylor1. You don't wanna know how we talk dirty in Chinese coz it's beyond your imagination. You don't wanna know how many times Uzi AFKed (says gonna take a shower) and abused people during streaming. (He even asked Xiaoweixiao to afk in a game with Baozi, and Xiaoweixiao did it. Yes, Uzi never got banned. Yes, you don't know who is Baozi. That's why you don't know this thing. If Baozi posted this thing on SNS, he'll get destroyed by Uzi fans.)\n\nBut I didn't really play much on CN server. The dirty words in English sound better than in Chinese, however, the frequecy of abuse is pretty much the same. Knowing the relationship between Riot and Tencent makes me more despair coz Tencent has never punished any verbal abuse in its games.\n\nI totally understand some people extremly care about winning or consider high elo to be an intellectual superiority. I understand people like to realse their pressure, they like to spam pings, laugh, taunt. I understand why they abuse people. But what I don't understand is that they can RANDOMLY abuse people and be quiet for some games and continue to RANDOMLY abuse people. And they won't get banned. Yeah the tolerance is real. Cheat gets a permeant ban, hurting people RANDOMLY don't.\n\nI don't know why don't you just eliminate salt and I don't wanna know. What's the percentage of salty players, I have no idea. Hence I'm not going to question your banning policy again and waste more of my life.\n\nJust show you some potential trend:a\n\nThe current game environment is: Either you get abused and fight back or you get abused and bear it. You can't punish random abuse. They are not afraid of being reported. I have to report someone every day. \n\nHow players, who is always raging with teammates, are likely thinking:\nAbusing randomly is safe.\n\nHow players, who rages with teammates but don't abuse, are likely thinking:\nForget it, i'ma abuse coz they all abuse. \n\nHow players like me, who never rages with teammates, are likely thinking:\nAbuse those abusers. Beat the shit out of them verbally. Reports don't work anyway.\n\nHow players like my girlfriend thinks:\nQuit this game.\n\nI've never offended anyone on my own initiative since S5 (maybe a few times from S3-S4, 0 time since S5). I will fight back though. If someone is abusing other teammates I will try to stop him. If that doesn't work, I'll try to let him realize his mouth is smelly. \n\nI wish I can play only with people like me. But I knew it's not realistic to change match system so hugely. \n\nAt last, my girlfriend is so unhappy that she forgot to report that guy and she even didn't fight back since she knew she was bad at Gnar and she was focusing the game too much. Btw, that guy wanted Ziggs so she traded for a Gnar. That Ziggs was 8/14. She was 13/12. I'm unhappy too, coz I knew I can't punish him. If he gets punished, my girlfriend will maybe comtinue to play League with me. But at least, I think it's necessary to make report outside post-game lobby easier, so people will be less upset for knowing they reported the salty players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wolfess","date":"2016-10-17T09:31:02.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"submit a ticket here:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\n\n select “I have a question About League of Legends/Riot Games” and then  “Games and Features -> General Questions”","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project XxXultra","date":"2017-04-01T20:52:33.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It has done almost nor a gank in the lane and one did and got the kill while the poster you ingite please riot games banarete him please his name on lol is alexlazar everyone i group He said report zac-p zac in telefataio game Make report won but with the pissed banarete","replies":[]},{"poster":"0someone0","date":"2016-10-17T04:52:25.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"so what","replies":[{"poster":"heizman fan girl","date":"2017-06-12T17:12:47.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"come 1v1 paliopoustara pou exeis kai gnwmh","replies":[]}]}]}
