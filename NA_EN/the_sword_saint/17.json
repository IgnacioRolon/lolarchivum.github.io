This often leads to a disconnect between which champs are listed as &#039;highest mastery&#039; on a profile and which champions are actually the most played overall or recently, when it comes to someone who doesn&#039;t play SR as their primary mode.\r\n\r\nCase in point, I can count on one hand the average amount of riven games I play in a week, and haven&#039;t played lux in maybe a month - but you would wrongly assume that I spam them nonstop by looking at my champion profile.\r\n\r\nAs an added annoyance, champions who are at rank 5 mastery but don&#039;t make it into your top 3 mysteriously vanish altogether from your mastery list when viewed in the profile for some reason - which makes mastery points on a profile even less accurate than they would otherwise be at showing how often someone plays certain champs.\r\n\r\nThe only one of my top 3 mastery champs that I play regularly is fiora, and she&#039;s listed as number 3 because, again, 3v3 doesn&#039;t give mastery points (not even in ranked 3s teams).","replies":[]}
