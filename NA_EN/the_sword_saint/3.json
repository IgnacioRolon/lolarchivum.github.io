While annoying for Riven players to deal with here, it has the positive effect of Riot not taking any anti Riven crap here seriously. They know that even if they made Riven&#039;s base ad 1 and made her e give no shield at all, the people here would still complain anytime they lost to a Riven.\n\nTherefor there&#039;s no point balancing Riven based on forum feedback and they have to rely on other methods.\n\nSo please, keep it up. Wouldn&#039;t want any calm reasonable discussion to trick Riot into thinking maybe they should give any sort of serious thought to anything on these boards when it comes to Riven.","replies":[]}
