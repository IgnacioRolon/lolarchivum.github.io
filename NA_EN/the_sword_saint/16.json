You cannot keep failing THIS badly and STILL keep your jobs!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is just fuckin pathetic. Not one of you on the script writing staff deserves anything except to be fired from gross incompetence. We CANNOT keep having these SAME issues with you fuckin morons for 7 years and keep using you. Its time these programmers were let go, they can&#039;t do the job, they don&#039;t even know HOW to do this job, this is just a complete failure on their parts.\n\nOverturn this bullshit script ban wave now.\n\nJesus. How fuckin stupid are you script writers? How stupid is it even possible to be? You folks have the intellectual prowess of a 2 year old. My 2 year old is better able to perform this job function than your entire staff combined.\n\nFuckin pathetic.\n\n15 other people have made the same script in the last month and noone using theirs get caught but anyone using your scripts gets an instant perma ban for something no one has even been warned for because its always a fuckin joke\n\nFFS Riven isn&#039;t even a good choice of a champion to make scripts for, they break every patch for random reasons!!!! God DAMN yall are some stupid ass fucks.","replies":[]}
