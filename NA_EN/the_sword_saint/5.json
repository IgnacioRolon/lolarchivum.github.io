Edge is similar to fury or rage in that it starts at 0, increased through aggressive play, provides benefits depending on how much you have, decays over time if you stop generating any for a while, and can be consumed to power up an ability. Riven gains 20 edge whenever she procs her passive on an enemy champion up to a maximum of 100, and edge decays by 10 per second after riven has not proc&#039;d her passive for 10 seconds. She gains 1% damage for each 10 edge for a maximum damage bonus of 10% with a full edge bar. Casting windslash will consume all of rivens edge and will proportionally scale up windslash damage in the same manner as it used to be scaled up based on % missing hp.\n\nOn a separate note, Riven can no longer hold multiple stacks of her passive.\n\n______\n\nWhat does this mean for riven? What has she lost from this?\n\nThe first major effect is that riven has lost the ability to enter into a teamfight and perform a variant of the third q hydra stun windslash combo to instantly deal as much damage to a squishy out of position target as before. This is because windslash now scales with edge and such an engagement would permit time for at most 2 passive procs before the windslash if the goal was to finish the combo while the enemy is cc&#039;d or before riven can be peeled. This would provide 40 edge from an assumed 0 to start as riven cannot prepare edge in the same way other champions can prepare fury due to edge only being generated by procing rivens passive on enemy champions.\n\n\nAdditionally, rivens ability to quickly double cast ult to snipe a low hp enemy under tower or similar has been greatly reduced as without edge her windslash will always do the minimum damage - that is to say the damage that windslash wold do to a max hp enemy on live.\n\nFinally, because riven can no longer gain multiple stacks of her passive riven loses the ability to stick around after her spell rotation is down and get any significant extra damage off on an enemy who is fleeing for their live by using up leftover passive stacks. This significantly weakens rivens ability to finish off enemies at very low levels (1-3). This does not otherwise impact riven&#039;s damage as there are no common combos that use multiple auto attacks in a row while there are still spells ready to be used, meaning that every auto weaved into a combo will still be empowered by rivens passive. A full basic combo that weaves an auto in after every spell will generate exactly enough edge to fill the bar from 0 to max.\n\n______\n\nWhat does riven gain from this?\n\nHer resource bar is no longer empty so that&#039;s neat.\n\nWhile her windslash has become a little more difficult to use at full power, it&#039;s damage will be more consistent across targets as damage dealt will be based on how much edge riven has prepared which is something riven has much more control over than the %hp of various enemies who might be in range of her windslash. It will damage them all equally rather than only really hurting low hp targets and tickling high hp ones.\n\nIt rewards riven with more damage than before for making multiple consecutive trades in lane to build up the edge meter. In mid to late game teamfights that last longer than a handful of seconds, she will do much more damage than before due to the additional 10% from edge.\n\nIn an extended skirmish or in laning phase, riven will have built up her edge meter to max and could thusly cast windslash more freely at any time during the battle without losing damage the way she would have before by casting it when the target was not low hp. This is important because it allows riven to have an easier time against champions who could easily dodge, block, or otherwise mitigate windslash due to knowing to expect it when they get low (fizz, elise, vlad, yi, garen, fiora, braum, yasuo all come to mind immediately).\n\nIt allows riven to build slightly tankier while still dealing the same damage due to receiving 10% bonus damage from max edge meter.\n\nWith edge meter built up, the persistent bonus damage will make it easier to cs (especially under tower) since it will stick around as long as you have edge meter unlike passive charges which each only help get 1 cs before being consumed.\n\n______\n\nWhat do these changes show about what riot wants out of riven?\n\nThey decided to trim some of the power she didn&#039;t need (some super early game kill potential, some &#039;sniping&#039; kill potential, some &#039;show up to the fight late and clean up just by double casting ult&#039; potential). In exchange they gave her a resource to manage that will allow her to deal more damage overall and specifically more consistent windslash damage as long as she actually participates in a fight in a meaningful way. \n\nThe edge meter will give riven players more satisfying windows of power and provide clarity to enemy players on when riven is strong similarly to how renekton and tryndamere&#039;s resources function. \n \nThis is a powershift for riven, taking some of her early game kill potential and mid game &#039;ks&#039;ing power&#039; and trading it for increased overall damage and more control over the power and timing of when to use windslash in a duel or team fight. It also adds a bit of clarity with the resource bar which can give riven and enemy players better insight into her windows of power.","replies":[{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2015-10-01T05:02:33.038+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think the \"rework\" forces Riven to think and play smarter, instead of just mashing buttons willy-nilly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jacknife","date":"2015-10-01T04:54:22.670+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Less snowball potential in the early game and more power shifted to dueling and teamfights instead of assassinating, I like it.

She now wins slightly harder when ahead, but is significantly worse when behind or in teamfights.\n\nWhen ahead in lane: Riven is even more threatening than before. With 10% more damage and overall a more potent Wind Slash (in lane it's rare to get the full execute power without wasting damage), her ability to faceroll for a kill is much higher. This is only if she has Edge already though. It does take time for Edge to generate, which is good if she's just back from buying items or something. Mostly a loss on the balance front.\n\nWhen behind in lane: Like on live, there's not much Riven can do. Being completely melee means you lose automatically to anyone who can outdamage you, and her piddly little shield isn't going to save her. As such, she can't generate Edge without suffering damage, which significantly lowers her comeback potential with R. When Riven falls behind now, she will be far more likely to stay behind.\n\nRoaming / Teamfighting: Riven won't be doing a full Broken Wings combo on any player who isn't braindead, and she can't even stack Runic Blade anymore.

Much worse off now.\n\nThe worst thing is that Riven still has minimal counterplay in her kit. Needing time to access her full power does not do much due to Edge's damage bonus being quite small overall.

It starts out at just adding 10% because they don't want to spook people who aren't used to the idea yet, but think about it. They added a flat 10% without taking damage away from anything else. But now that edge exists (in theory, experimental, etc) they can tune her in ways like say, lowering her passive proc damage by 10% and raising her edge max bar to 20%. This would make her procs without edge to less, they would do the same at max edge, and also her abilities would do more than before at max edge so the result would be that she would be weaker then now with low edge and much stronger with full edge. And they can tweak that all they want to get the balance of 'weak damage when low on edge and lots of damage when full edge'. If they make the edge bonus significant enough, riven can afford to build tankier - how tanky depends on how much potential bonus damage edge will add.","replies":[]},{"poster":"O Fallen Scholar","date":"2015-10-01T20:10:45.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cloud Potato,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nP3Ln4d0,comment-id=0015,timestamp=2015-10-01T15:23:40.095+0000)\n>\n> This is overall a net gutting for Riven.

It almost entirely removes assassin riven. Note i said ALMOST. Wind slash is still going to be a great execute tool because by the time the enemy is low health you will have several edge stacks to work with.\n2. It makes riven harder to play and a little easier to play against. Rivens will now have to micro manage her passive and make more decisions about what they can do with the bonus damage, and when it is best to use their abilities. Enemies will also know when will try to go in and know her moments of weakness.\n3. This will push her more into the sustained combo fighter that she was designed to be. Rivens will be rewarded to longer skirmishes, proper comboing, and sticking to a fight longer, instead of assassinating and running.\n4. This gives more build and play options. With the 10% damage bonus and wind slash change, Riven can afford to build much tankier and effectively play as a bruiser. Wind slash can also be used at the beginning of a fight, or if it used as an execute, it can still nuke whoever it hits regardless of their hp.\n\nOverall I like the changes, especially after actually testing it. There some things i would change, such as letting you stack edge on minions for a reduced cost and duration, or allowing full stacks on large monster, because with this change, jungle riven will no longer exist. The changes bring more strengths and weaknesses, more counterplay, and just straight up offers more options.

Instead of removing animation cancelling or destroying her kit entirely to remove the ridiculous strength she has from players exploiting a bug to deal tons of nearly unstoppable damage in a short time, Riot has provided a means to deal that same damage IF Rivens are willing to stay and fight for it, giving other laners counterplay to her kit. Instead of all of it happening within 3 seconds because of the damage being available instantly its now a buildup. Then the ultimate that used to make you cry as soon as you had less than 45% now has to have stacks built up to be able to execute people at 25-45% hp especially early game post-6. As far as I understand it, Riot found a way to keep Riven's current kit but at the same time reduce the \"OMG NO COUNTERPLAY\" factor of her gameplay. She now is more focused on fighting you consistently rather than 100-0 in under 2 seconds or only fighting when Q is up. Good Riven players can probably still can do that, but it provides more ways of playing her, and less overall strength without staying in the fight. Feel free to offer feedback on this view, but I think I understand it properly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ExileSword","date":"2015-10-01T13:14:58.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what a shame making a so well designed versatile champ with a teamfight potential into a brainless trynda with a renekton early game i don't know how she can join teamfight and try to build that edge in front of 5 people with all these vaynes running around and her terrible tank stats she would be gone as fast as a sona diving an enemy team id rather prefer huge nerfs than this unneeded rework","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2015-10-01T06:52:49.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kinda fear this will put her in a stronger state in lane and weaker in teamfights, from what I understood of the edge mechanic.

Because old Riven's only job was to build full dmg and sneak into enemies back line to flash+combo squishies. If she failed to do that, she died, simple. Terrible team fighter unless very fed.\n\nI hope she can be better in team fights without flash too. But still have a bad feeling how it turns out. She is great in skirmishes though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrNova","date":"2015-10-01T04:09:15.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well written","replies":[]},{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2015-10-01T05:51:46.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"It looks like she's mostly the same except that they deleted windslash from her kit, and she no longer gets stacks of her passive anymore.

It's far from deleted unless you only ever used it to ks low enemies with. Only having one stack should never realistically ever impact your damage in a trade or all in unless you for some reason were using more than one auto attack in between spells.","replies":[]}]}]}
