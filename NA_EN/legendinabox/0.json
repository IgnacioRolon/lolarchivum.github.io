In a TEAM based game.\n\nYou know that's the problem, the god damn team. I'm done trying to help out my unknowing bronze players to play correctly. In my promos, two loses: one was because one got auto-filled and I had to take his place as jungle, guess what? Had no map awareness, didn't help out and was a complete nut job and got me behind. The second game, all four teammates were feeders, no map awareness, MACRO, vision control, or anything. I carried the idiots as Zoe, we still lost. Zoe is my number one champion. If I can't carry them with her, no one can. Simple as that.\n\nTeam game or not, it's to focus on your team doing good and not about how good you are. You could be Faker and still not carry if your team is bronze enough. Sorry, but fuck my teams.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2018-05-28T23:51:29.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like a fine game to me. Adc well fed, Lux good kill amount (despite the deaths), Teemo was kind of bad though, and the Soraka had respectable numbers. And it was a 40 minute game. You're team even had the most kills.\n\nSo yeah. It honestly looks like a good looking match. Why complain? It's not like all 4 of your teammates to the point that you would look like a smurf. By all accounts, it appears to be a legit good game.

What could, possibly go wrong? Galio is out of meta, and Swain is very light damage as a tank.\nAlso, the new meta askes you to play a fast clearing champion in the jungle, making a tank really weak. I can't see an ADC being a tank, the sup is the only role, that could fit it. That would have been the better option.\n\nNow thanks for the obvious, captain obvious. (Not trying to be too mean about it.) But you can't control people, and it's not my fault if an idiot would pick a Teemo as the last pick. Your comment is just stating the obvious. I don't know if the Teemo picked last, but honestly, I could care less. People should stop playing Teemo top, or just in general. If Riot buffs him, the community will scream at them, just like they did in the early stage of season 8, when he was OP as hell. The funny thing here is, Quinn can successfully build tank or bruiser, without losing too much of her power. I tried it, it's fun as hell, to see them try to kill you. If you want, a strong top lane range champion, then Quinn is your best bet. \n\nBut, yes your right. \n\nGL HF <3","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2018-05-30T07:25:49.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh sorry, I was mistaking you as OP.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ben Sharpio","date":"2018-05-28T23:47:23.288+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"i fucking hate teemo top players so god damn much","replies":[]},{"poster":"Off Hiatus","date":"2018-05-29T01:03:54.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.imgur.com/B91w6I2.png\n\nThe irony is too much for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Legendinabox","date":"2018-05-30T21:44:24.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Did you actually look at those matches though? 4-12 I was auto filled support and entire team fed before I had to switch to building damage to try and offset our lack of it.\n\nAgain second game look at the numbers.
