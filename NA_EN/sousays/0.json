I still want the figure and either way i&#039;ll get Thresh, but i just wanted to know. P.S if this isn&#039;t in the right section, i&#039;m sorry, i&#039;m still learning to do this. Thanksies!\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Riot removed this post in another section, and i have to say thank you for that and letting me know. Again, still getting the hang of this and believe it or not, this was my first guess for this topic XD","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-19T23:03:38.249+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This will unlock the champion and the skin.
