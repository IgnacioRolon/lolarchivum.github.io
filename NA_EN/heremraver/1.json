Jax begins his stun animation, I (Malzahar) ult (Suppress) him. Jax, although suppressed continues his stun animation and stops my ult. Suppress, by definition, should not only stop whatever a champion is doing but it should also stop the outcome of that action as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Mataka Tek","date":"2015-08-18T06:14:54.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malzahar's suppress is not working against melee autoattacks at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Urgot2BKiddinMe","date":"2015-08-08T20:12:00.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or ulting a zac mid ult and he keeps going....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2015-06-21T02:10:34.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not a bug. Jax's stun is like Garen's E or Wukong's ult, no matter what, so long as they don't die, the spell can't be stopped by stun, displacement, suppression or anything. Even zhonyas won't stop it.\n\nIt's just the nature of those spells.","replies":[]}]}
