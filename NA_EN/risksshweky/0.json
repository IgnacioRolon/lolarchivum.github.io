I cant ping baron respawn times or anything, and none of my friends can either. It was very helpful and i dont know why it would be taken out. Also on a somewhat related note, ive NEVER been able to ping how much bounty someone has. Ive tried to a bunch of times but it never does it. Fix your pings","replies":[]}
