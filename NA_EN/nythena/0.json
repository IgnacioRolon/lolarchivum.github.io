Attempting to reconnect to the game yielded the same error over and over. After nine or so tries I finally logged out to try and relog. When I did this I was met with the patcher applying a patch for the game and the servers being listed as unavailable on both the server status page and the patcher. Another thing to note is that only three people got into that game, so I have a feeling myself and the other six got punished.\n\nSo on the night of the 28th at around 11pm I had logged back in to find I was given a leave and had to type I Agree.  I decided to ask support about it only got told they couldn't change Leaver Buster punishments when I wasn't asking them to. I was asking why a game I couldn't get into due to being kicked out completely and the servers becoming unavailable had been flagged as a leave. When trying to further explain that I was looking for that kind of help I then got another response for a different support specialist saying the following:\n\n\"Hello Summoner,\n\nYour account was audited by our new LeaverBuster system. Due to a recent left game or AFK on your account, LeaverBuster has placed you into a low-priority queue. For more information on the revamped LeaverBuster system, refer to our new FAQ:\n\n[there was a link here I just removed it for copy paste]\n\nWe will be unable to modify your current LeaverBuster punishment, but if a technical issue is causing you to be disconnected from your games, please let me know and we can explore solutions.\"\n\nI just got the warning and now I'm also in a low priority queue and don't understand why. I only played a single custom by myself after it all because I don't really have a will to play thanks to all of this being so confusing.\n\nThis is the first time I've really had any trouble and I'm just curious why Leaver Buster flagged that game with all of those circumstances. I would really like some help or possible answers from Riot because so far my support ticket just has me thoroughly confused and I'm honestly afraid to even ask more on the issue.\n\nEdit: I should note that I doubt asking why has gotten me lower priority. My wording was a bit dumb and as such I have fixed the line that made it seem that way.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-01-30T23:00:58.218+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Nythena!\n\nWithout knowing your original ticket information, I can only go off of what you said in this thread.  It sounds like you were more concerned as to why you got this message when you were forced to leave due to technical issues, which I can help explain:  The notification message appears simply as a warning and as a information tool to let players know that leaving is not 'ok'.  It is only a warning, and does not punish you in any way.  The only way to earn lower priority queue status or further penalties is to consistently leave games.  \n\nI checked your account, and it doesn't appear that you left/AFK'd in any other games recently.  Therefore, you should be fine to keep playing without any sort of penalties.\n\nI hope this clarifies some information!

I can also copy and paste the original points I made in my ticket if it would help you understand it a bit better. I was just worried because I got a leave when the servers had apparently went down for the patch. Currently I'm more worried if the lower priority queue is true or not because I can live with a leave on the account the timing of it all just felt and still feels really weird.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-02-02T21:19:25.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I double-checked your account, and I wasn't able to find any penalties on it currently.
