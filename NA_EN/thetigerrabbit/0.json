You will be compensated for your time.\nThere will only be 10 participants chosen for each date, so please fill out the form as soon as possible to have the best chance of getting picked.\nNOTE: You must be at least 18 years old to participate.\"\n\n\nIs this legitimate? The survey itself is conducted by qualtrics; I know Riot does use them for surveys in some cases but I've never heard about \"onsite playtests.\" \nIf it is a scam, what could they be after? The only personal information they asked for was my name, contact number, and approximate age. I also live very close to West LA so it didn't seem too surprising. \n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Radiant ILight","date":"2018-01-19T22:40:04.372+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey so i recieved this email about 2 days ago, filled out all the questions and what not.
