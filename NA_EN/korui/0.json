(for example, profile takes forever to load and I can't see the champions in champ select and it makes me dodge. seriously I'm on -23 lp because of that.) and I tried running the Hextech repair tool but I don't see any improvements. \r\n\r\nI tried launching the legacy client but it says that there's an update but the update is stuck on 0%. \r\n\r\nI tried everything but I don't know what to do anymore. if anybody could help I'de be more than glad.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-02T18:27:32.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be having a combination of issues here starting security settings that's preventing game files from being used or scanned properly.
