Is there a link in which it shows when the skin is 50% off because i only have the 50% amount of rp :(","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-27T19:02:16.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Magnificent Twisted Fate is categorized as a legacy skin, per the [Legacy Skins](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944-Guide-to-Legacy-and-Limited-Skins) guide. It is available in the store right now but he may not be around for long, and he can make an appearance at some point in the future.  He isn't available at half price though, so it won't be possible to change that unfortunately.\n\nYou also have a chance to find him through mystery gifts or hextech crafting as well.  Be sure to bookmark the [Sales](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales) page in case he makes his grand entrance.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
