(Only applies if you are OatsMealz)\n\nSo I let my younger sibling play 1 game of league on my account. I usually let her play against bots but today she wanted to play a game against real players. So she picked Nunu because hes cute{{champion:20}} and led the charge in 1 norms game. \n\nNot a particularly exciting game, she loses her lane as does everybody else on her team. Nobody types in chat, but the Yasuo afks pre 10 after he died 3 times to his laner, and Ezreal runs around in base just shooting his ultimate occasionally.  Game ends at 15:09.\n\n**Oh cool  I got a 2 week ban.**   \nAnd I knew STRAIGHT AWAY it was because of the ONE game my sister played. And it was! No chat logs, no other games, just game 1.\nSo what was the ban for exactly? Being stomped on for 1 game everybody else got stomped on?\n\nDid the Yasuo who afkd at 10 get banned? no. Did the Ezreal who ran around in base and shoot ults get banned? no. Did the pantheon jg with the same cs and played equally as poorly in this draft pick norms game get banned? no.\n\nObviously I'm being targeted by somebody who has connections or some Riot employee doesn't like that I comment \"Thanks for the new akali skin! We haven't gotten one in ages!\" on her past 2 skin videos this week. If this doesn't prove it the last ban I got  (which was **totally completely justified** I am a better and reformed player now) was for telling the jg on my team who strategically tower dived top, mid, then bot 2 times each at the start of the game then afk farmed that I was unimpressed with his mental IQ.","replies":[]}
