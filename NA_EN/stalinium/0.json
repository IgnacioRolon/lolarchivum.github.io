I don&#039;t. You can, and that&#039;s awesome (thank you support mains... I dunno how you can stand it), but I play this game to enjoy myself and I don&#039;t do that when I play as the gold deprived, level deprived bitch of the team who can&#039;t fend for themself. From now on, I&#039;m simply dodging whenever I&#039;m filled as support. I can play other games that actually let me play what I want (mostly World of Tanks and War Thunder). Riot wants shorter que times? Not going to happen if people keep getting qued as support and dodge. Takes just as damn long, if not longer. \r\n\r\nJust stop it. I&#039;m tired of being qued into support and having to now wait 30+ minutes to play the game. I may as well just play something else.\r\n\r\nCan this please not take an entire season to get rid of like Dynamic Que? Thank you :)","replies":[{"poster":"Hawckey","date":"2017-01-12T07:18:22.863+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just go Brand, take your adc's kills and don't build sightstone, you will do so much dmg trust me.
