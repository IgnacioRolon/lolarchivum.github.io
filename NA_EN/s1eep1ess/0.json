Do you happen to the link to the list of legacy skin?? =3 I thought I had it bookmarked the last time you posted it, but I guess not. I'm not sure which post you last showed it in either. Cause I was wondering if any of this year's Lunar skins are legacy or not. I only remember that Jinx is permanent.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-10T21:49:09.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean [this](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944-Guide-to-Legacy-and-Limited-Skins)?\n\nFirecracker Jinx isn't legacy, and neither are WK Katarina/Nidalee. :]","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-02-10T21:55:17.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.

As an FYI to Riot the skins are awesome, but you previewed them so early it was kind of a let down waiting like two (or was it three?) weeks for them to come out.  I even got jinx for her new skin, and then was like.. ok where is it.. c'mon now... *checks watch.* :P\n\nAt this point the excitement has kind of died down.  The skins look awesome though.  Planning on getting one.\n\nHoping the wait on DJ Sona won't be super long!","replies":[{"poster":"Raja Chachki","date":"2015-02-10T15:19:30.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's months, gotta suck it up and get good at Sona in the meantime :)","replies":[]}]}]}
