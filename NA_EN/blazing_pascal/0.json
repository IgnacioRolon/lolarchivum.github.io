Ranked Demotion Bugs/Errors/Inaccuracies at the end of season...","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot, I love you guys and I love this game... but this is so bad.  I'm trying to laugh about it instead of going into rage mode and throwing my monitor through a window at Riot HQ.  Now I understand I am 1 player out of millions, but I worked REALLY hard to get to gold before the end of the season and I ACHIEVED that goal.  I debated long and hard about continuing to play ranked solo que, did a lot of research and decided it was worth a shot to continue... besides, maybe I could help out some of my buds in Silver by duoing with them.  The ONLY reason I felt comfortable playing was because Riot stated that\n \"If you are in division 5 of a tier and your MMR drops an entire tier, you will be warned about possible demotion. For example, a player in Gold V would receive a warning upon reaching Silver V MMR.\" -The people I used to trust at Riot\nWell today I decided to duo with my buddy who is in Silver III- we lost- and I got demoted.... I think???  There are so many issues with this. See attached.\nProblem 1: I was put into Silver I with no warning. I was relying on this warning.  Where was my warning? I trusted you Riot and you betrayed me...\nProblem 2: The message I got says I am being demoted due to inactivity. Well I currently have 8 ranked games on my match history over the last 3 days.  Is that not \"active\" enough?\nProblem 3: The message also says I am being demoted to Gold V.  Well that would be nice. As you can see in the background of the picture; this is completely false, and I was put into Silver I. I was ALREADY IN GOLD V! \nYou should probably fix that little \"notification\" since it is full of erroneous statements and hurts my feelings in general. \n\nI should add... I don't mind being told I suck and lost too much and will be demoted etc. etc.  What hurts me deeply is the NO WARNING.  I want a big flashy warning with sirens to tell me that IF U LOSE ANOTHER RANKED WE'RE TAKING YOUR GOLD AWAY!\nDo that next time plz. Thx.\nbtw... if u don't rectify this Riot, I fully plan to earn my Gold back in the 2+ weeks I have.  I just wanted to let you know I am hurt. Deeply. And I am concerned about my fellow comrades in arms who this will happen to on Nov 10th or something. Sirens next time plz.\n\nEdit: See page 2 for Riot's response.\n\nEdit 2:  I got my Gold back, but with no help from Riot.  I feel bad for those that didn't have time.","replies":[]}
