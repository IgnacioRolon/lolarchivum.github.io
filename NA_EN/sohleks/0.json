They've been requested. I know the skin-base for monstrous champion users DO like the options. Personally, I'm sure it'll be forever before anything is done with Skarner again. So another option would have been really nice. \n\nIs the baseline for them not meeting the criteria for skins more that they come across as chromas? Or is it that it's not deemed profitable to give them some colored particle effects to hit 750 tier? I'd like to actually here some more context on the adversity to meeting the desire versus...\n\n\"I'm delivering unto you this news with regrets because of [insert quote here].\"","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Vitzkrieg","date":"2017-09-14T19:20:18.323+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo, sorry for the confusion!

I appreciate the perspective.\n\nI understand that it isn't a promise. But I feel better knowing that giving the loud and clear feedback that we appreciate the team's works might bear fruit to a more permanent skin set makes me happy. Thank you for starting the conversation. How will we know how the conversation is going? Will there be an update like a Riot Pls post explaining the final verdict, or...? Obviously, I know there are way more hurdles when actually testing there. I'm just wondering if we might say know something before a few months down the line.\n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mogarl","date":"2017-09-14T22:36:08.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nightmare skinline?

I was extremely disappointed when I realised it was no more than an in-game model and ended up sucking some hype out of the event.\nI'm disappointed in the skins team for not jumping on this opportunity ASAP because all of the champions (excluding Kha'Zix and Kog) are in need of some skin love and the skins are guaranteed to sell well as people will want to buy them to fit in with the Star Guardian thematic (appealing most to those who aren't interested in glittery girly styles). \n\nPlease, if anyone from the skins team sees this, definitely consider investing some time into this theme!

A champion permanent or a ward skin? Dont get me wrong I'm sure for players who dont have every champ that mighta been nice and a ward skins pretty and all but I'm never gonna use anything but my fist bump ward so I had no interest in it,  I wish you guys had decided early in to possibly make those as other rewards for the event then I might force myself to play it more but its just way too hard for nearly no reward :/ Now hearing they may not ever happen as skins when they would all be for 4 of my Fave champs in league even tho it looks so cool.
