Feels like Azir's too strong in lane considering he functions as an AP hyper carry with good self peel. His ult is extremely powerful. If you don't jump Azir he and his ADC will shred your team apart. If you do attempt to dive Azir his ult is a wall, but not just any wall it shoves you away and blocks off your most direct route. Then if he or his team wants he can go through the wall, it basically means you cannot dive him without multiple gap closers or a flanking approach. Best approach to dealing with him is ranged burst.\n\nHe is also a powerful force in sieges...\n\nIt shouldn't be an uphill battle playing against Azir from level 1.","replies":[{"poster":"MEMEME670","date":"2015-01-07T08:36:23.669+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">, but not just any wall it shoves you away and blocks off your most direct route\n\nAll walls block your most direct route(to behind the wall)...","replies":[{"poster":"Sohleks","date":"2015-01-07T08:48:35.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MEMEME670,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aJ51eq2A,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2015-01-07T08:36:23.669+0000)\n>\n> All walls block your most direct route(to behind the wall)...\n\nI said it like that to emphasize the point that unless you have a good flank or Azir let's you walk up to him you need to use a gap closer.

Reduce the base damage scaling on Arise!(W) mid-late game.Give the ability a new function,see below.\n\nOn cast if an enemy champion is within the sand soldier's attack range Azir will issue an attack command and will try to hit the enemy champion(s) based on this priority list:\n- a champion with the lowest hp\n- a champion\nautomatically.\nNow casting it \"on\" an enemy champion will deal the dmg of the soldier almost instantly but it will take control away from Azir till the attack ends.This gives him burst damage but with the cost of the range.Also its uptime and with that the chance of landing it will be more rare than of his Q and on top of that the opponent could just walk out from the range of the soldier just before it would connect making it again more difficult to land.\n\nPossible change is to increase the damage from 25% to 30% from additional soldiers.\n\n3. Decrease the cooldown on Sun Disc.\n    Increase the attack speed/cooldown ratio to 1.5% from 1.25% to balance out the damage reduction on W.\n\nThe first change takes away some burst from him.The second takes away some sustained damage from his soldiers.

His mana costs are really prohibiting early on so it's easy to go oom if you harass, and if you use your W-Q on someone in lane they can just walk up on you and force you off of the minion wave until your cooldowns are back.  it's a mistake if you back off of an Azir after his W-Q.  His cooldowns prohibit him from moving the soldier again for awhile so you can just walk up to him and punish him really hard immediately afterwards.
