But I'm going for a panda gnar all the way xD, ik this idea is dumb","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sohleks","date":"2015-04-10T19:42:08.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One daytime bump for visibility, since I posted this at 3 am","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sohleks","date":"2015-04-10T08:10:38.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another decent Gnar skin concept.

Just another monster I guess.
