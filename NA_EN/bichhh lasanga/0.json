She played Quinn, and I played Jax, I ended up getting 2 kills to 1 on her, BEFORE preceding into the jg to take a drag and a blue and red. It was then that I got called a dirty player for taking a drag, a blue, and a red buff. She said she liked &quot;clean 1v1s&quot; without any buffs or anything. Wtf, lol. She even had like 100 more cs than me, but still quit the game, lmao.","replies":[]}
