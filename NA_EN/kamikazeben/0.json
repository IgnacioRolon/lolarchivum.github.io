If I simply roll back my video card update (from 2015?) League works fine. If I update the video card the game crashes right before loading screen and tells me to update my video drivers (?). My laptop is not the latest but it's served me well for three years and has never given me an issue with league in the three years I've been playing on here. Only now all of a sudden - a year later - League has decided not to like my video driver update. I'm on a pretty standard Acer Aspire V7, Integrated Intel HD Family Graphics and NVIDIA GeForce 720M. The driver I rollback is on the Intel HD Family Card.\r\n\r\nCan someone please help, I'm not going to keep updating and rolling back a video card for one game. I've reinstalled the game, run repair, deleted some files as suggested by ancient forum discussion archives, and nothing works except for rolling back the driver update. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-14T22:51:54.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like League may be trying to launch from your integrated graphics (Intel HD Graphics) rather than your dedicated video card (Nvidia 720M). This could be caused by a corrupt or malfunctioning driver for your Nvidia card or a power setting with Windows. I strongly recommend working through the steps that address this issue in our [FPS troubleshooting guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting)\n\nLet me know if those steps helped.","replies":[{"poster":"KamikazeBen","date":"2016-09-15T03:18:08.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes! It worked! I went to my laptop manufacturer's driver downloads and updated my NVIDIA driver manually, and now League loads up no problem! I also adjusted my power settings - they were all set to low. Thanks for the help, I would have beat my head open trying to figure this out on my own, I'm no techie. Cheers!","replies":[]}]}]}
