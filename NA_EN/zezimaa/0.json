EVER","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ever since the hextech update has come out, I have not been able to receive a single hextech chest. Before anyone tells me the obvious things, i'll clear things up. I have never recieved one single chest for any of the S-, ever. I DO own the champions i should have received a chest for. I have a level 6 rank on Janna, since receiving my first S on her for a token, I have not gotten a chest. I have also received a S rank on other champions such as nautilus and thresh, to which both the champions I have NOT received a chest. If i were to open my profile tab, it shows that I have 4 chests available (and always have) that i can receive, and when hovering over the champions that i should have received a chest for, the golden chest icon does appear, though I do not receive a chest and the 4 chests per rotation counter does not go down. Am I doing something wrong? is there a function to collect the chests or something? is this a bug? please help. If you have any questions, I'll happily answer. I have 12 keys from fragments that I want to use but can't get any chests.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n1: I cannot receive any hextech chests\r\n2: I DO own the champions\r\n3: I have NEVER gotten a single chest\r\n4: the gold chest icon DOES appear when hovering over a champion signifying a chest is received but wasnt, and the 4 chest counter on the main profile page does not go down and remains at \"4 chests available\" no matter how many S- or higher I get. \r\n5: I have an S- or higher on: Janna, Amumu, Ziggs, Thresh, Nautius, Garen, and no chests.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-01T23:55:01.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account and it looks like our records show you earning chests for getting S-grades on a number of champions. It doesn't look like the pool of champions you play is very large, though, so I'd recommend expanding the number of champions you play in order to earn more chests.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezimaa","date":"2016-11-02T16:36:23.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it states i have recieved the chests but if i were to go to my hextech tab, i do not have any chests. would it help if i were to record myself getting an S- or higher and then not receiving a chest? because if that's what it takes for me to show you, I'll do it. My hextech tab has never had a single chest received from getting an S- or higher and i feel like it never will. let me know if a recording of this would be helpful.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-02T23:47:48.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can actually head into your summoner profile and look at your champions page.
