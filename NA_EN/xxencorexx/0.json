The goal of this is to make sure that people play a champion and do well with them in ranked but all the reasons can be summed up as:\n\n**The Mastery Level has no correlation with whether or not they can play well with a champion.**\n\nA person can have a high mastery score and be terrible at the champion.  There are people who have low to no mastery score but more games on a champion than people with level 5 \"mastery\" because they have been playing long before the mastery system was a thing. And so on.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-12-17T11:34:54.312+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Somebody who has mastery 3 with a champion might still be bad at the champion (and probably will be), but they'll at least know what each ability does and whether the champion is AD or AP.

It does not ensure a minimum competency.\n\nIt's already been well established a hundred that mastery system says nothing about skill, knowledge or capability.  It's no improvement at all. e.g. I know what every champion in the game does regardless of \"mastery\" score meanwhile there's people with a million+ mastery points who do not even know how to build their champions.\n\nSay I am a one tricking a champion.  Why should I have to play dozens of games for twenty different champions that I have no intention of ever picking in order to play the one I will?\nSay that I'm a D4 ADC, I can play any marksman in the game.  Why should I suddenly be forbidden from playing champion X who I have played before, when Bronze 4 player who can't play him half as well is allowed to? Let alone due to some imaginary, hypothetical player who is too incompetent to figure out how many AD or AP scalings they have.\nWhy should I barred from picking a champion I know how to play because I do not have the arbitrary number of games required because I put in hundreds of games before the useless mastery system was made?\n\nIt's not an improvement because it only serves to punish a massive amount of players for an action they had no part in.\n\nIt's an idea only born from an irrational idea from fear that you might get some player who will lose lane, when it does nothing to change the fact the player this is for would just pick a different champion and lose anyway because he doesn't care to learn lanes he gets filled to and would pick his negative winrate champion he has level 5 in and \"mastered\".","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-12-18T07:48:08.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's for the same reason that you're expected to have a specific license to drive a truck even if you already have decades of experience in driving cars.

Some players are trying new champs (or showing some cool new skins) in rank game instead of AI or normal, which makes them play worse and cause their team lost. So I am giving a suggestion that mastery 3 or above is needed for rank game, no matter if the player knows how to play or build the champ or not. At least it will kick out PART of unskilled players in rank game, not all, but part of. \n\nSome might play good at new champs. Maybe they tried it in PBE or they are born to be good at it, but it is just a small group of people. Just win around 4 or 5 games in normal then they could get mastery 3 champ and enter the rank with it.  Again, mastery 3 is just a suggestion for Riot and maybe they could have a better solution for this.\n\nI don't know how you guys treat the rank game mode. Is it just another mode similar to normal?
