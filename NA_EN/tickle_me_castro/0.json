He is a lane bully and a late game monster, and on top of it he is not gated by mana or energy. As frustrating as he is we aren't going to get him gutted or put into the dirt by some of the nerfs proposed because they are unreasonable. \r\nOne of my main frustrations with him is his wind wall. As someone who plays a lot of ranged spell casters this is something that infuriates me to no end. Many times you can perfectly predict what he is going to do and send out a stun, or your jungler casts a cocoon and just a millisecond before it hits him his wind wall comes out. Because it originates from the center of his model, it will block everything from where he is to the max range. \r\nI am proposing making it so the wind wall STARTS at the max range instead of it coming from the center of his model. This means that those well timed cc can actually hit him when he doesn't wind wall in time. It also makes sure that he can't just purge any projectile near him. \r\nThis will allow players to be able to punish him with well timed cc and punish Yasou players who don't think about how to use wind wall properly. \r\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2016-12-07T18:03:06.545+0000","up_votes":80,"down_votes":11,"body":"I think his Windwall should use up his Flow. He does not need 2 ways of stopping damage, not on a champion with so much raw damage and mobility.  \n\nThe size and duration of the windwall will depend on how much Flow he has, I think about 75% Flow should be his current Windwall and 100% can even go on longer to compensate (or maybe not if it isn't needed). If his Shield activates he can't use Windwall anymore, if he has 0 Flow somehow (and his shield is not active currently) Windwall will still come out but it will instantly go away. Meaning he can still use it as a reactionary ability to protect himself if he is good enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Ruin Lance","date":"2016-12-07T19:38:11.302+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":35,"body":"this would make him unplayable in mid lane because he would not be able to trade with anyone","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2016-12-07T20:57:20.248+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":6,"body":"Yasuo is one of the strongest laner's in mid lane, but it's not because of his windwall it's cause of his passive, it prevents the player from recognizing yasuo's actual power, its near impossible to gauge what a yasuo can do.

People don't realize how bullshit his scaling is, and that it is mostly because of his passive. It allows him to just rush PD and gain ridiculous stats from it, far outscaling what it normally would, and should, on any other champion. His windwall is a joke compared to how broken his passive is and how it scales him.\n\nHe is a nightmare in lane because of all the extra free shit he gets from his passive, and it only gets worse as the game goes on. Late game Yasuo's passive is worth:\n50% crit chance = 2000g\n510 HP Shield x 2 = 2719g\n\n4700g of stats from his passive. And these are MULTIPLICATIVE stats, so their effectiveness will scale off of any of his items, such as Phantom Dancer giving him triple multiplicative scaling (Crit chance multiplies his AD, his passive multiplies the crit chance, and the % damage reduction multiplies off of his shield) \n\nFor a late game example, Level 18 Yasuo with no other items besides PD and IE will get these stats from PD:\n30% critical strike chance = 1200 Gold x2 from passive = 2400 Gold\n45% attack speed = 1125 Gold\n5% movement speed = 197.5 Gold\nPassive 1: Ghosting\nPassive 2: 7% movement speed = 276.5 Gold\nPassive 3: 12% damage reduction ~= 12% total effective hp when fighting a single target\n\n12% total hp comes out to be\n1912 base HP at level 18\n1020 HP from shield\n12% of that HP = 351 HP = 938 Gold\n\nAdd that all up and you get... 4937g worth of stats, for an item that costs 2550 gold. Yes he doesn't unlock these stats right away, but the multiplicative scaling is insane. That's 193% gold efficient WITHOUT any other items, though thats at level 18.\nBut let's take his common build, he usually gets Frozen Mallet and Guardian Angel.\n\nFrozen Mallet gives 700 health and GA gives 60 Armor + 45 MR.\nThis is a combined gold value of 3876g. 12% of that = 466g. \n\nOh wait but he builds Bloodthirster too! It will multiply off of the lifesteal AND the shield.\n20% life steal = 750 Gold\n350 shield = 933 Gold\n12% = 200 more gold. \n\nLet's get a total again: PD will grant a full build Yasuo ~5600 gold worth of stats, meaning its 220% gold efficient. It's over 3000g of free stats added. And that's not even counting the Ghosting passive from PD which lets him walk through units. Oh, and the bonus effective \"HP\" that he gets from PD's damage reduction vs his target is of course, unaffected by % health damage, % missing health damage, armor/magic pen, or anything else.\n\nDuring the laning phase, he doesn't have all of this power unlocked, however, it gradually goes up and even if he is massively behind, it doesn't matter because his scaling is ridiculous. And god save you if he is ahead lol. But yeah in mid levels even if he got destroyed in lane, he picks up PD as his first item anyway since its so obscenely broken on him, and he functions perfectly fine, and can even outperform a fed enemy. Stupid. And late game, well we all know how stupid he is then.","replies":[{"poster":"Reposer","date":"2016-12-08T18:36:08.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like the problem is PD as an item then, rather than Yasuo, in this case? It's pretty commonly known that PD is extremely powerful as opposed to the other Zeal items, especially for Yasuo, since he's a duelist who has everything to gain from the item. But even so, it's just a problem item, on a champion that makes great use of it. This is such a common theme lately, with itemization pushing a champ too far, and then people complaining about champs rather than itemization, even if DIRECTLY TALKING ABOUT ITEMS (Read: Tank Ekko). \n\nThere are some issues with Yas, but making a drawn out explanation on why PD is super powerful then using it to complain about one of the champs that uses the items, isn't necessarily proving anything about the champ themselves, just that they happen to benefit from an OP item. It's just like complaining about Shyv/Yi/Xin when devourer was strong instead of the item itself, even if it was obviously Devourer pushing champs over the edge.\n\nAlso, 12% Damage Reduction is NOT equal to 12% extra HP.

He is always at an advantage over majority of champions.  \n\nIf we change the Windwall to be less reliable we can lower its cool down while retaining the true use of that ability, to block CC.

If it wasn't clear, I play Yas a lot, he's definitely one of my mains, and whenever I'm against him, not only do I counterpick if I can - because he has a LOT of counters that are oft played - but it's easy to bait out walls and take out his shield if you're a ranged caster. And if you're a melee, it really just depends, but some of the common ones mid - Zed, Ekko, Talon - can work well against him as long as you play around Yas properly.\n\nEspecially the latter, you literally just need to auto him once to remove his shield if you're ranged, and that's not really that difficult to do. If he REALLY wants to keep his shield up, he'll have to back up - thus losing CS - or he'll have to Windwall it, which is really just a waste in most cases.\n\nYou can't really remove his shield the way he is now, because he is incredibly squishy, which most people seem to forget. If you made the wall more reliable but harder to use - something like an instacast that blocks everything like normal, but only hits in front of him for a split second, and works on charge system.\n\nThat's just my fave idea, but something along those lines could definitely work out as a change that would make him harder to play for people that aren't good at him, and potentially make him better for the people that are actually good at him, which most people don't complain about anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2016-12-09T07:50:24.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am not doubting you play him a lot, but I have faced him many many times and two things that are always consistently annoying are his Flow Shield is rarely ever down at a certain point and his windwall can be damn near impossible to punish most of the time.  \n\nHis Flow Shield has far more counterplay to it than his Windwall, its the only part of his kit that is up to both you and him to play around. Windwall on the otherhand, well if he uses it and is punished, he didn't use it correctly. Its just that kind of ability, i mean he can just stand on it and be immune to ranged attacks from all directions. Combined with his insane damage, mobility, and decent CC it can be hard to \"play around\" him using his Windwall because he doesn't pay for it. He retains all his damage, mobility, CC, and Flow Shield but now he is immune to ranged attacks. He needs to pay for it, he needs to lose something for using it, just like pretty much any other champion that isn't toxic by design.  \n\nNot saying my idea is the best, it was more to get my point across.

If you take 100 damage you take 12% less, so 12 less. If you take 1000 damage you take 120 less, still 12%. And if you took 100 damage 10 times you'd take 12 less, 10 times, still 120 less. Percentages work exactly the same for any number, thats why they are percentages.\n\nBut you are actually right, I was thinking about it the wrong way. If you have 50% damage reduction, you basically have double hp, because 1/0.5 = 2. So if you have 12% damage reduction, you have 1/.88= 1.136 so 13.6% more effective HP.

Would also prevent yas throwing up a windwall to save himself or a low teammate from something like a veigar ult that was thrown 1 sec before.\n\nThe current windwall gives him too much reaction time.  with this it would still be a counterplay tool but a higher skillcap one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2016-12-07T18:19:57.151+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"imo they should make up their mind on what his windwall should be: A reactive defense tool or a zoneing tool. Roght now it is both, and that is pretty frustraiting to deal with.\n\nIf they want it to be a reactive tool, they should keep it as it is but reduce the duration to 1sec and decrease the cd further with each rank, so it no longer prevents ranged(projectile based) champions from doing anything for ~4sec.\nIf they want it as a zoneing tool, it should only start blocking projectiles once it reaches it's maxrange, with probably a bit higher delay than it has now, so he can no longer reactively screw a combo.\n\nAnother change that would already help alot would be if the faceing of the wall finally matters, so walking around it actually allows you to attack instead of yasuo just walking through it and beeing save again.\n\nHowever, any nerfs to him most likely need some compensation buffs as he's not directly to strong, just annoying to face.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BearsOnCrack","date":"2016-12-07T20:13:49.764+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not make his windwall like Braum's unbreakable??\nJust nerf the damage of abilities and projectiles that go through it\n\nThen it will block the first projectile incomming so it still will work as a reactionary tool.\n\nI don't really care having it block a ability or projectile, but all of them for four seconds... it makes me salty.\nEspecialy when he just fucks up placing it... or me finaly playing arround it and have him just walk trough it and done. Its just too bullshit that i can fuck up a whole combo that easily.
