We also have never claimed that the systems in place are perfect. What I, and many others **do** claim, is that the systems currently in place are better than nothing. I would rather see people getting feedback from their harassing chat behavior than not at all. Flaming in chat has always been a gateway to more destructive forms of toxic behavior.\n\nFor example, Riot tried to do the permanent mute thing. All that did was force the bad eggs to just use non-chat behavior to \"speak their minds\", leading to many more games with trolling and feeding.","replies":[{"poster":"Sorin Alucard","date":"2017-12-02T17:17:56.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"that's the thing, we didn't have \"nothing\" before this. We had a system where you'd still get punished for being racist n such.

People are only raging so much (IE players who have a bad day and get 14 day restriction) because trolling is so.fkn.ez.\n\nI disagree with the focus.

The primary difference between the Tribunal and IFS is the time between offense and punishment. While the Tribunal voted heavily to punish negative and harassing chat (regardless the \"context\" or who started it, or who else said what) that system had an inherent delay between when someone said something negative and when the punishment was applied. That delay caused a huge amount of confusion with players saying \"I just played a game and said nothing in chat, now I'm banned?????\"\n\nThe IFS, on the other hand, is much more expedient at both reviewing **and** applying the punishment. This gives it the *appearance* of a focus on chat, when all it has done is shorten the feedback loop time.\n\nIn addition, the tribunal only very rarely handled trolling and feeding cases, because you cannot actually watch the game. Going based on score and chat alone it is nearly impossible to discern between \"they got their ass kicked\" and \"they inted their ass off\".","replies":[{"poster":"Sorin Alucard","date":"2017-12-02T18:03:20.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I do know. yes, I'm aware of the current system.\n\nI do not agree with what its done to the community. Its super effective at reviewing what you say, then delivering swift punishment. If you were typing and obviously trolling (inting, buying all tears) you'll get caught. \n\nThat's good to a certain extent, but its still become super super strict about what you say. Basically its redundant and over corrective. It lines up well with the opinion that you shouldn't say negative things at all in game. I believe you shouldn't be so concerned with correcting what other people say, but how they play. Be responsible enough to mute and move on. You can't tell me having a chat filter option that still censors language isn't evidence of this shift in focus.\n\nI ask why not spend more time investigating troll behavior, even if its more difficult? (thinking from the time period before current system before it was decided) \n\nTrue trolling has left the int/afk all game stages. I'm just saying there are way too many obvious, exploitable loopholes that are hard to detect unless you watch the game. Idc if its the minority opinion on the boards of whats harder to deal with as a player, but I think it would be awesome if the hammer came down on someone after one game of trolling like the way it does the zero tolerance to chat.\n\nI do understand too that the system gets flooded with false positive, only furthering my point earlier there is too much whining and pettiness being catered too.\n\n\"he said I'm bronze when I'm clearly silver! REPORT he's a troll!\" - yes this was something I've actually read before -- This person should've used mute, should've _let it go_ and just played.
