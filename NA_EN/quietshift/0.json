I also got an S+ in that game and the client said I got a token for getting the rating but it's not in my hextec crafting area. It normally appears as soon as you get it but I've logged out and back in the game to see if that fixed it and it didn't.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-11T00:46:40.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Zombiemaster* is correct here. The messaging when you hit level 5 is to inform you that you can **now start earning tokens** rather than you *have earned a token*. Sometimes the excitement can cause a bit of confusion, but I thought I'd clarify that a bit further.\n\nYou can read more about the Champion Mastery System in [this guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide).

I'm thinking that the system doesn't expect a player to get at least an S- when a person reaches lvl 5 on that champion but at the same time I feel like that could be often if it is mentioned in a post.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-16T21:54:06.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The message can be confusing if read through very quickly, and we can compare the two messages below.

(this is my situation)  I level up my champion to Level 5 and it will just say that I can get the champion to level 6 but it won't give me a Token even though I got an S in the same game where I leveled up?","replies":[]},{"poster":"quietshift","date":"2017-01-22T19:57:47.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the really delayed response but at that time I got both messages and that's mostly why I put this thread in.
