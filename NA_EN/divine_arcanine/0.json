Has anyone leveled up in honor yet? Is there some kind of honor leveling start date I'm not aware of?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-29T23:25:38.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It hasn't been too long since the season started, and it wouldn't make much sense if people were able to power level their way through Honor. You're meant to progress through Honor over the course of the season, and you'll start seeing it rise over time. No need to be in a rush ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Divine Arcanine","date":"2018-01-30T06:07:50.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well there are 3 checkpoints per level, and then the level themselves, meaning basically 12 checkpoints in total if you started off at level 2 with no checkpoints. I haven't gotten anything yet in 2 weeks of constant play, so assuming I actually progressed in the next few days that'd mean I'd average around 1 checkpoint per half-month. With this logic a very active player would finally reach honor 5 in approximately 6 months. This worries me for the people who aren't as active, they may struggle to reach a high honor level by the end of the year. This doesn't even take the level 5+ rewards into consideration, are you sure there's no way that the honor system might actually be secretly disabled or not functioning properly?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Adurin","date":"2018-01-29T19:13:04.485+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still at Honor 2 - 0/3 Checkpoint and I've been getting 1 honor every 1/3 games, and been hitting a 2+ streak recently... Kinda weird with almost 100+ games played I've yet to even go up 1 checkpoint at my current level.....","replies":[]},{"poster":"YOU SO BAD","date":"2018-02-03T14:11:39.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iv put in over 300 games averaging 2 honors a game from players im not qued with as well as honors from players i am qued with.  I have not moved from honor 2 checkpoint 3. I am convinced that it has to be based on a certain amount of time.  I was max honor level last season with about as many games and honors as i have already accumulated this season already. So there has to be some kind of time limit to be able to get to the next level. Which in my opinion is stupid.  above Broporo states we shouldnt be power leveling honor?  That has to be the dumbest comment iv read in a long time on here as other people have to honor you and its weighted for more honor from people your not qued with. So there is no way to \"power level honor\". Essentially what riot is saying is your honor means nothing! play 100 games get 5 honors each game you still wont go to the next checkpoint. Its now based on time. Furthermore you cant even see someone elses honor on their profile even though there is a spot for it. Ignorant. and why are there even different kinds of honors? you can not even see how many of which kind you have and other players cant either. I like the leveling honor system idea but Rito has really drooped the ball on the implantation.","replies":[]}]}
