Are they seriously just throwing stuff out without prior testing? If the rubble is going to stay there permanently, why  not just make it a non-interactive asset, similar to the animals that run around the map? It's just beyond me why they would have it be interactive to begin with, if it is purely for strategic thought and nothing else\n\nThe past few ranked games I've been playing I found that AT LEAST 3 or 4 shrooms get popped solely because of this bug.

If you look at my history, you can see I only play Teemo, and normally I don't really bring up my qualms about the champion, but this is just ruining the game for me. I'd really like to get this fixed or have rubble disabled until it is relatively bug free.","replies":[{"poster":"BADxW0LF","date":"2015-11-17T17:59:19.488+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"relatively quick\"?  lol they don't spend their entire work day on the boards.  you posted this 3 hours ago...","replies":[{"poster":"mx0cSeVs9T","date":"2015-11-17T18:03:31.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BADxW0LF,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=GaxzBge0,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2015-11-17T17:59:19.488+0000)\n>\n> \"relatively quick\"?  lol they don't spend their entire work day on the boards.  you posted this 3 hours ago...\n\n?","replies":[{"poster":"BADxW0LF","date":"2015-11-17T18:05:37.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"nice edit lol","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-17T17:48:40.397+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThanks for the report!
