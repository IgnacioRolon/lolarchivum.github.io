It also doesn't let me pick a champ or ban so I end up dodging when not needing to which has been causing a problem lately and now I have a hour ban from even getting into game. The only reason i continued to queue up was because I did not think that the problem with the black client would occur more than once or twice. Anyone know what I should do to fix this problem. My laptop is also fairly new so I do not know why this is even happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-02T00:22:36.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this still an issue?
