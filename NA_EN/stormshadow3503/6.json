We know lore and gameplay shouldn't be connected but its just illogical and it sucks. Piltover's Caitlyn has a sniper who's a good shot. Shadow Isle's Kalista whom is undead and brings vengeance for many all across Runeterra is countered by Caitlyn (she sucks in general but you know). It just sounds kinda dumb.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
