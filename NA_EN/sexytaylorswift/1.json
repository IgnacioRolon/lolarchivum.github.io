Sona is currently sitting at a little over 53% win rate, and since her rework has consistently been around that winrate. Then you'd argue \"well, why nerf a champion that isn't even that popular?\". First off, a champion's particular popularity isn't (and shouldn't be) the basis for why they are buffed or nerfed. Secondly, while Sona isn't the most popular of supports she also isn't the least popular either. She currently sits close to 10% popularity among supports; so not as popular as Thresh, Janna, or Leona but more popular than Braum and Morgana. Sona has good damage and good utility, which is really strong combo and can easily lead to imbalance. But then you could say, \"Well, you shouldn't nerf or buff entirely based on win-rates alone\" and you are right but it is an important factor to take into consideration. Plus, you have to take in mind that (whether you like it or not) some of the balance changes are based upon the opinions of the balance team (although at least their opinions aren't uninformed cause they get to see all relevant data); while Sona isn't the most popular supports, she is one of the more successful as such they probably believe her to be sleeper OP. Also, no offense again, but as a non-Sona main regardless of my feelings towards who and how Riot buffs or nerfs champions its hard to feel sympathy to Sona mains when literally every other thread on the boards is a post complaining about the nerfs. Most of these threads have not really had that great of record of including well written and thought out defense of Sona against said nerfs and instead have appeared to be little more than cireclejerks (for lack of a better term). I realize this is probably gonna get downvoted but hopefully some of you take something away from this and at least can somewhat see the reasoning behind why Sona is getting nerfs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Space Bum","date":"2015-01-07T19:43:01.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As for me, I would rather play support and  end the game with top damage... {{champion:143}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"SexyTaylorSwift","date":"2015-01-06T19:40:52.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grunt666","date":"2015-01-06T19:08:17.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"indeed nerf sona! because uhm...
