The only major problem they had with removing crit was that they felt it created \"memorable moments\". Balance concerns were not brought up as a major obstacle. That goes along with that \"the minds of the players\" thing you brought up earlier. Derandomization is meant to preserve the same gameplay and balance, not necessarily the same feel. Critting once every 10 hits for double damage can be seen as more fun than hitting for 110% damage every time.

It uses pRNG (psuedo RNG). This is a system used to decrease variability in random number generation. The way it works is by increasing the chance of an event every time the event does not happen. For League, this means that if I have 50% crit chance, my first hit may actually have 30% crit chance, then my second will have 40%, then 50%, and so on (the actual algorithm is a lot more complex, but you get the idea). Getting a crit lowers it back to the initial chance. Multiple crits in a row lower the chance even further (in some pRNG systems) After a point, the odds of not getting a crit or getting a streak are mathematically insignificiant. Your always crit or no crit event is so improbable that it probably hasn't happened even once in the entire time the game has been out. So, we aren't even shifting from true RNG to a normalized system, so we aren't even getting as big a variance decrease as it would initially appear.","replies":[{"poster":"Pinker 10","date":"2014-12-25T21:47:00.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Why?

It IS imbalance. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exdil7N1Mdo\nI'm fully on board with fixing crit, in it's current state it never belonged in a moba in the first place. However, doing so requires not only extensive testing to ensure that damage actually IS similar, not just theoretically similar, but also multiple champion reworks. True, it would be easier than say, removing penetration as a mechanic, which besides being unnecessary would require full revamps of multiple systems, but it's not easy, and it can't possibly happen over night.\n\n> Second... no you can't.

People win the lottery. \npRNG itself is a more reliable system than RNG, but having the same odds as being hit with a lightning bolt the second after you hear you won the lottery while sitting in a basement, as getting a crit on your next attack, does not make that crit impossible.\n\nThis is why anything removing crit's randomness requires extensive testing and not just plugging in numbers.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2014-12-25T22:29:40.579+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">That's not finished.\n\nUgh, I knew I was forgetting something. My bad. Long day. The point was just that expected damage and variance ranges at any given probability can easily be calculated.\n\n> theoretically you should get 500 heads and 500 tails, twice. You won't.\n\nTrue. Then, do that 100 more times. You'll find that you'll vary above 500 tails about as often as you vary below 500 tails. That's the important point. Variance is not impactful on balance because it is just as likely to screw someone as it is to help them, and it can't be predicted, meaning the only thing anyone plays around is the expected result. The doublelift clip you linked is a good example of this (or would be, except that it wasn't actually a non-expected result. He didn't crit for most of his earlier hits. He just noticed the later hits more because he was about to die. Someone mathed it out on the Reddit thread back when that first showed up, and it was mathematically a pretty predictable result). Doublelift played around the expected result, and was surprised when he didn't get it. However, it is just as likely that the enemy could have had more crits, and killed him much quicker. Variance could just as easily have favored his opponent as it could have favored him. In terms of balance, something that has no systematic benefit is not actually affecting overall results. For example variance did not exist, we'd expect people to win and lose the exact same number of lanes, just without ever getting screwed or screwing someone else (which again, we expect to happen at equal rates).\n\nThe point is, he didn't play around that option, and neither his champion nor his role has any systematic benefits from the existence of variance. I'm not saying the game wouldn't change at all. Of course it would change. I'm saying that balance wouldn't change because variance has no systematic advantage or disadvantage for anyone.\n\n>However, doing so requires not only extensive testing to ensure that damage actually IS similar, not just theoretically similar, \n\nThis makes no sense. Damage in League is a math equation. This is just another math equation. DPS would be the same. We can state that as a fact. We could test it, but that's just plugging numbers into the game and letting the equation act out instead of plugging the same numbers into an equation and getting the same outcome.\n\nThe important question isn't whether damage is the same, but whether or not variance is a quality that systematically benefits or harms certain champions (for example, if \"fishing for crits\" is actually central to the way some champions lane). I don't think there is, and I've never seen a good example of anything that would actually change.\n\n>Attack speed based champions that build high crit chance would be effected the most, as the game system stands attack speed steroids on high crit chance champions are one of the most broken features in the game, and indeed are the entire argument for removing the randomness in the first place.\n\nI actually think that the low attack speed values are where the randomness affects the game the most, because with higher attack speed values the variance tends to normalize in most situations. Easier to normalize over 10 attacks than over 4 in the same period of time. Higher sample size and all that.\n\nTo wrap it up, of course this would all be tested. There is no reason not to test it even if we can mathematically predict an outcome. However, testing would likely be quick and easy unless we find a systematic benefit to some champion or role from variance (something I don't think we're likely to find), and it promises to be much less impactful on balance and gameplay than any other proposal made.\n\nHere's what I'd like, from you or anyone. I'd like a specific example of a champion, role, item, whatever, and how having variance removed would benefit or harm it. I have never seen a good example of this. Let's start with ADCs.

It will be a few days before I'm back, so I'm probably not going to make a response. If you think you've got better things to do than write for someone who won't be here to see it, I'll understand.\n\nFair enough not quoting. It is going on quite long.\n\nIE isn't hard. Right now, IE passive means that you get a 1.5% increase to dps for every point of crit instead of 1%. For example, if I have IE and 50% crit chance and 100 AD (numbers chosen for simplicity, although I can replicate this with realistic numbers and game scenarios if you would like)., I would have one attack for 100, and one for 250, for 350 damage. A derandomized system would have 100 ad, increased by (50% * 1.5 = 75%), for 175 AD, which would be 350 over two attacks.\n\nAnother example: We can do the same for 25% crit chance and 200 AD. Random: 3 attacks for 200, one for 500 = 1,100 damage. Derandomized: 200, increased by (25% * 1.5 = 37.5%) for 275 damage. 4 attacks at 275 = 1,100 damage.\n\nWe can do this for any crit damage modifier. As a rule, 1% extra crit damage is a 0.01% multiplier to the damage given by crit chance. IE gives an extra 50% damage to crits, so you multiply the crit chance by to get the crit damage.\n\nSo, as I see it, expected dps would be exactly the same with an IE with a random or derandomized system.\n \nI'm not sure what exactly you did in your example.
