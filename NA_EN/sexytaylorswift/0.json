I explained that the problem was their installer/patcher and explained the steps I had taken to deal with it.\n\nSupport responded by asking me to do some network diagnostics.  I went ahead and did so, sending them the results and telling them again that the network wasn't the problem.\n\nThey elevated my support request to the next level where they wanted me to run some script* on my computer.  I packaged up LoL logs like the script would have done and sent them back to support with a link to where I documented my fix on the boards.\n\nThere as some more back and forth but you get the idea.  I'd hate to be stuck in a position where I actually needed help from support.

When I was looking into your account it looked like you had a spike in toxicity right after your received your first chat restriction. IMHO immediate feedback is always better (and one of the reasons why we have behavior alerts). Right now, we can't give you another restriction while you are serving an existing one. A good improvement would be to allow chat restrictions to increase while you're being restricted. This would let you know that you still need to improve and not seeing that message would give you confidence that you're getting better. I'll bring it up if we revisit the system.\n\nBTW, I absolutely know how frustrating the game can be sometimes, and one thing I struggle with is how to talk about mistakes we've made constructively. Also, I often find that \"mistakes\" come from us not being on the same page about what we're doing. Keep in mind that your teammates are other, imperfect, human beings who are probably already frustrated by the mistakes they made. I know my first reaction when I make a mistake is to be defensive and try to blame someone else (the jungler, obviously) or the situation (that adc has a plat border!), or maybe I'll blame you if you offer me some unsolicited advice. I try to keep that in mind when talking to other players.

I see that you say there was a spike in toxicity right after I received my first restriction. Can I get any insight as to what that was? I really didn't think that I had any toxicity during my chat restricted games, and this was what lead me to further investigate the issue. I feel like it may have been defending players that were being ridiculed for being bad. I do call players out that do this and tell them not to smurf if they are going to harass bad players because they are just learning the game. I do not remember harassing anyone for being bad, though. The problem that I am now running into is not knowing whether that is the reason I was banned. If it was, I fear that I may get more restrictions because I did not know that defending a teammate against verbal abuse is bannable. If I do get told that this is the reason I am restricted, I would be more than willing to not do it.\n\nI do appreciate you giving me that answer, though. Even if I disagree with it, which I cannot comment on that without knowing the rational behind the ban, I at least have a reason as to why you guys did what you did. So for that I thank you. I don't understand how this original guy can sit and say that he looked into my account and that I was not toxic if you are saying I was.","replies":[{"poster":"Lyte","date":"2014-11-26T00:51:40.256+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey, bouurns is right, we're still working on refining the system and the clarity around chat restrictions isn't great yet.

I got some chat restrictions at the START of the season and after that, I was neutral/positive in all my games therefore not getting any punishment, including bans, ALL season.\n\nI realized that I just lost all my season rewards today. I am asking for a chance for you guys to re-look at my punishment. Please, I have never been banned before and always encouraged teamwork/diffuse conflicts within teammates when I see them. I am not a toxic person in real life, but I had a bad week A FEW WEEKS ago and got some SERIOUS insults in game towards me including death threats, just because I was doing badly in game. So I basically just lost it and insulted them back. I SINCERELY apologize for what I did and the next time, I will just mute them WITHOUT saying anything. \n\nI was really happy and looking forward to the ranked rewards that I've put many hours into.
