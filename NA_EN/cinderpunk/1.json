The only reason I think this is not implemented is job security for the millions of dollars Riot wastes on reports and &quot;studying toxicity&quot; in the most toxic game on the planet and is well known as this.  \r\n1. You put a chat system into play that is useless as far as helping the game, everyone will probably still use a 3rd party discord.\r\n2. Why would your not make the chat for the people in your 5 man Que not in your party. This will in turn cut down toxicity.\r\n     a.
