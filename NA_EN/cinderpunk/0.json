You shut up and report them after the game. You don't derail the game even more for your team. If you got a chat restriction, it was not from just one game, you have a history of negative chat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-10-12T01:09:34.443+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally everything you said in chat was to harass a teammate. That's not what chat is for. If you don't like someone's behavior, report them after the game. Flaming, arguing, and threatening doesn't help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-10-12T01:34:15.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, they consider it harassment when you try to get everyone in a game to gang up on one person, regardless of the situation. The fact is, theres literally NO reason to do that. One report is all it takes for a report to be reviewed. They dont go \"oh 4 people reported this person so they MUST have done something wrong\". I mean, premades exist. So doing it that way would be absolutely stupid. Thus, calling for reports is against the rules as it serves no purpose other than to antagonize a player. Report them, and let Riot handle the rest. You dont need to get a mob assembled to report someone.\n\nBesides, you also called everyone trash. Insulting players is against the rules as well.
