In a basic sense, a disconnection looks the same regardless if you hit the *quit* button, unplugged your router or even lost power to your home.\n\nI strongly recommend taking proactive measures to reduce these issues from happening. A great start would be working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure all your local network settings are compatible with League.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
