I cannot select anything, and will eventually be kicked from queue for not selecting a champion. I&#039;m not attempting to fix this again, just uninstall/reinstall, but PLEASE can you say how I could fix this by altering the files if it ever happens again?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-14T21:47:29.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Akenero,\n\nWe're aware of this issue and are actively working to resolve this ASAP.","replies":[{"poster":"Akenero","date":"2016-01-14T21:53:30.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much!\nwould that have to do with the \"unexpected platform error\"?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-14T22:07:45.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course!\n\nI'm not 100% sure.

What happens is it say the game has stopped working and just completely closes. Also i cant play because when i get into a queue when it finds a game it crashes and i don't have a chance to see the accept/decline buttons. I tried a client repair but still no luck. Also another issues i am having is in the last patch after most games the client would not open so i had to click the RIOT icon in the bottom right and it opens the game then says the Mastero client crashed.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-15T17:08:08.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm.

It was caused by pinning your league client to the taskbar.
