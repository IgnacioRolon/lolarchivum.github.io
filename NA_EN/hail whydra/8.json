Oh i see, you thought I made the number 2 picture. LOL thats the not the case at all. Im sorry I guess I made the mistake of believing that the 2nd picture was an actual official RIOT center based splash. My bad, that second image was one that I got from another summoners post, its not my work at all. Based on your reaction I guess it is safe to assume that the second picture is NOT from RIOT. I did not alter the picture to prove my point.\n\n\"Splash art, not skin. :P\nIt seems to be an unifinished version of a splash that was being made before his VU (notice the design) but then they probably decided to update his visuals so they remade the splash with the same scene and pose but with a different design.\" - DwarvenGiant\n\nYes one is different, so Ill try another reference.\nHows this\n\n1.)http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/9/9b/Graves_OriginalSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141107222205\n\n2.)http://i.imgur.com/JSJMeg6.jpg\n\nHere I believe both of these are officially from RIOT, not altered at all by me to make a point.\nI guess its all up to opinion. But I still believe that the 1st uncentered splash is better. It makes you feel in the moment, its action packed, it puts you in the same setting makes you feel the same things that Graves felt in that moment. The uncentered splash with all the details is the culmination of what it is the BE GRAVES (now, please Grave-cigar-loving fans please don't jump on me for \"liking thew one without the cigar better, for any reason you come up with\", thats another point for a different argument, COMPLETELY unrelated to the point I make now). The cented splash dilutes all that, it dilutes his character and that moment. My point is that you spent all that time on the original splash and it looks good, the other details are NOT distracting, they add to the image. My point is that its a waste to cover it up and it takes away from the essence of the art.","replies":[]}]}
