That&#039;s just a minor point I want to bring up.\n\nBut the whole main point I want to bring up is on Heated Up, make it apply grievous wounds. \nIts suppose to be implying that its fully heated up and ready to destroy. And yet that mundo with his ult going off, even 200+ armor can heal 225% addition damage from turret shots. Make it so that it&#039;s nearly impossible to heal and that will be a better buff to towers.","replies":[]}
