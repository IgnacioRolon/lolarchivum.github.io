Of course not everyone agrees.\n\nHere is the issue though.  Because of this kind of thing, the devs are always receiving contradictory feedback on everything.  This means that player outcry on pretty much ANYTHING is... well... easy to ignore.  After all, a quick scan of the boards would likely find a bunch of people who LIKE the new lore/dynamic queue/Fiora's art/whatever.  So the devs have real trouble figuring out what the fans of the game really want.  Or worse... they don't bother.  If they're going to get people griping for AND against every choice that they make, why listen to anyone but yourself and your co-workers?  Riot becomes an echo chamber that makes things that IT wants and it takes MASSIVE revolt and objection for them to even consider that they might have messed up or put out something unpopular.  The game is huge and successful and unless it cuts into their profits to dismiss them there isn't much reason to cater to fans.  People will snap up whatever is put out.  People will complain on the boards about everything.  Riot just does what IT wants and filters everyone's feedback out unless it's excessive.\n\nLook at all the reviled reworks that have been put out.  At the new queue and how hated it is, even by pro level players.  They realized after the fact that they ruined some things too.  Skarner got trashed and was reworked what... three times?  And he's still kinda crap.  Cassiopeia got reworked twice and is due another one.  If they had listened to the fans back when those reworks were being worked on, perhaps some of this could have been avoided... but because they get so much negative feedback no matter WHAT they put out, it's hard to tell the good from the bad.  So Skarner, Cass and Morde got trashed.  Every patch... EVERY update... there are posts of \"X is ruined forever\" by over-reacting people on the boards.  I'd love to blame Riot for trashing solo queue and some of my favorite champs, but in all honesty... I see why they don't really listen to fan opinions.  \n\nIt just blows to realize you have NO impact on the game, your opinions and words mean nothing and champions you love can be pulled away from you, gutted, re-built into hideous things you never want to play and then handed back to you with the devs saying \"There... they're better now!  You're welcome!\".  Makes it hard to get attached to ANYONE.","replies":[{"poster":"Doktor X","date":"2016-04-24T04:36:38.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed. Once you realize this (that you have no voice, that your favorite champions could be changed at any time, etc.), there are two things to do:\n\n1. Stop buying RP. I'm not going to give Riot any more money when I don't trust them to take the game in the right direction. Why buy a skin for a favorite champion when either skin or champion could change drastically?\n\n2. Don't fall in love with any champion. Adapt to the meta and play the OP flavors of the month. I recall when they had Voyboy on the Patch Rundown, and I realized this. Paraphrasing, Voyboy said:\n\n> Kind of the way League of Legends is, there is always going to be different metas. It's not about mastering one champion. It's not about mastering Akali or Ahri or something like that and becoming the best at that and winning Worlds or something. You've got to be playing a wide variety of champions. You've got to be able to adapt to different play styles, different changes. It's just a fluid game and you've got to be able to keep up.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Tcwa5_r3MQM?t=11m2s\n\nYeah, it's crazy cynical, and I really don't like being cynical. But that's just how I feel at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2016-04-24T08:04:04.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And if you play because you're interested in the characters and the story?  You're boned.  The characters change on Riot's whims and the story did as well.  Leona isn't a stalwart defender of the weak now... she's a zealot.  Oh, I'm sorry... did you really identify with Leona's old story?  Tough crap.  Old GP was a goofy pirate, new GP tortures people and (and I am just speculating here, but I wouldn't be shocked to see it be real) wears skivvies made from the flayed skin of his enemies.\n\nNot all of us are into it for the same reasons.  Magic: the Gathering had a thing about this that I can't really remember and I'm too lazy to look up, but it basically amounted to there being three main kinds of players.\n\n* One who is most interested in winning, and plays the best and strongest things he can do ensure that he can.  He doesn't care about ANYTHING but whether a card/champ is strong or not and will help him win.  Pros HAVE to be this guy by default... at least in games that matter.\n* One who enjoys being creative and weird and tries to win in unusual ways because he enjoys it more. They know their picks/builds are sub optimal, but they just REALLY wanna try to win games with... I dunno... AP Varus.  These are your off-meta hipsters that run odd builds.\n* One who plays things he likes and thinks are cool, regardless of how good they are.  These are your fanboys, the ones who LOVE a champ/deck/whatnot so much they will play them no matter because they prefer to play things they like over whatever happens to be strong.\n\nVoyboy's statement basically says that league is a game built entirely for the first guy... which blows a bit if you're not him.  I'm not him.  I gave 0 shits about the project skins when a ton of people ate that sh*t up, because I don't like the champs that had them.  I tend to loathe the power champs, not play them.  I enjoyed the lore and am FAR more likely to play a champ or buy skins for them if I like their character, their aesthetic or their art/voice work.  I play lots of champs, but I tend to AVOID the ones people are spamming in every meta because I'm sick of them, and seeing a new kid BMing as the OP meta champs in every game sours me to them.  I'm kind of a mix of guy two and guy three... and this game just... wasn't built for me.  Lately it seems like everyone who isn't the first guy is at a rather large disadvantage due to the gap in power between the power champs and the normal ones... and that makes the game less fun for me.\n\nHonestly, I've thought about giving it up for a long while now and I haven't bought RP in ages.  The game just doesn't appeal to me anymore, and it's pretty obvious Riot isn't interested in catering to me or players like me.  They're scrambling to get teens and college kids to bring whole premades of their friends into the game to spam the meta champs and type \"gg ez\" in every match.  THAT is the guy who league is catering to... and I freaking HATE that guy.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wolfram Oxford","date":"2016-04-23T17:00:57.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"URF is amazing.
