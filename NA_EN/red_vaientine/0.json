All u have to do is log on with a **different account**. (you can make a new account to log in with, just use a **different account**)\n2. Exit that account\n3. Log on to yours\n4. You should be logged in.\n\nThis solution fixed mine and i hope it will fix yours if not, heres another fix that helped me once\n\nFix:\n1. Open league of legends (opening as admin is optional)\n2. On the top right corner you should see your server near there (eg, North America)\n3. Click on your server and change it (I recommend Oceania if your in NA but any works)\n4. let it update\n5. after the update switch back to your original server \n6. Once you switch it back it may or may not update but let it update if it is updating (If it isnt updating than this may not work for you)\n7. Once the update is done log on\n\nThose are all my fixes, hope your problem was fixed! \n{{champion:64}} \n\nIf this fixed your problem please post it in the comments thanks :D\n\nStill having problems?

I definitely **don't** recommend account sharing, as it's bad for security and against the [terms of use](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse). \n\nGood on ya for posting this up though!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Red VaIentine","date":"2016-08-07T22:20:45.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol i was thinking about that but some of my friends share their accounts i dont share mine but i see it alot.
