It also means she has a really, really hard time fighting multiple enemies if she can't kite all of you. There are some nearly unwinnable melee match ups, but you usually either outscale or she falls off, as her teamfighting is pretty bad, even with the dps ADC build, because her low range and unreliable self peel make her very risky (her E is good against melee, but almost utterly useless against ranged except to wallhop, and if she uses it for damage, she completely opens herself up, and also brings her forward far enough for a diver/tank/support to use some targeted CC or dash to get onto her, and now her E's down as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Doozku","date":"2017-05-21T02:31:05.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd say that Illaoi isn't actually very fair, not because you can't outplay her, but because she can't outplay you.

The only Tentacles that're gonna live are the ones near you, so you can use them to protect but not disrupt as well.
