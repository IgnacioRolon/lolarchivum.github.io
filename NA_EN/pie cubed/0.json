That quote has essentially become a meme at this point for its utter stupidity and lack of any logic whatsoever. Why would you buff champions for no reason anyway? This thread isn&#039;t about the Ekko buff itself, moreso the apparent meaning behind that quote.\r\n\r\n&quot;Annoying champion does this pretty well, so we&#039;re giving annoying champion the tools to be annoying more often. We&#039;ll maybe possibly sometimes give annoying champion a nerf of -1 base health to compensate so we don&#039;t overdo it.&quot;\r\n\r\nSeems to be Riot&#039;s logic. Balanced champions (or as close as can be) don&#039;t need buffs.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-13T09:31:26.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What they are saying is that he is below average in terms of balance, but he is better in his losing situations when his cd's are up, so they are focussing on improving his weakness rather than improving his strength for the buffs that will bring him closer to balanced.\n\nWhen people see a champ as \"broken\", that champ is really good at one thing and not so good at other things. That champ ends up being so good at that one thing that, even though they are winning a lot of encounters, they lose the game because the other team can outdo them elsewhere.\n\nEkko is good at skirmishes and roaming, but he isn't as good at objective control, teamfighting, or waveclear.","replies":[]}]}
