I'm tired of people dodging from being countered top lane. Someone selects Soraka and I counter with Yorick -- she dodges. Then some clown selects Darius and I select Soraka counter, HE DODGES.\n\nIf you dodge when you haven't selected a champion, fine, the current penalty is ok. But if you (or one of your party members in your group) has already selected a champion, and you dodge (or one of your pre-made members dodges), then you or ALL OF YOU in that pre-made should get the afk/leaver penalty. \n\nDodging is not okay, and it should be severely punished after champion select.","replies":[]}
