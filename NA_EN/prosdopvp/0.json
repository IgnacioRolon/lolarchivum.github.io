From the [Tribunal FAQ](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2411284): \n\n>**Do paying players get leniency?**\n>Paying customers are treated exactly the same as non-paying customers by the Tribunal.\n\nSecond off, you got a permaban because you refused to change your behavior after receiving at least 35-games worth of chat restrictions and a 2-week ban as well. Also, permabans are **ALWAYS** reviewed by a Riot employee personally, so they had to go through your entire account history and see that you had no intentions of reforming in order to decide that you needed to be permabanned from the game. It wasn't false reports that got you punished, nor was it just these 2 games either (reform cards never show every single game that you're valid reported in).\n\nAs for your chat logs in particular, here's what stands out to me as reportable: \n\nGame 1: \n\n>ProsDoPvP: seems a bit salty\nProsDoPvP: add some to my chips.\n\nCan be taken as being a bit passive-aggressive here.\n\n>ProsDoPvP: riven\nProsDoPvP: are you retarded?\nProsDoPvP: same\nProsDoPvP: RIVEN\nProsDoPvP: ARE\nProsDoPvP: U\nProsDoPvP: STUPID\n\nVerbally harassing Riven: definitely reportable and punishable.\n\n>ProsDoPvP: my team is brozne so ?\nProsDoPvP: team based game\n\nYes, it's a team based game, and you being passive-aggressive and harassing your teammates when they do something wrong is not being a team player. Also comments like the first one in this quote don't help matters at all whatsoever.\n\n>ProsDoPvP: vlad carried you guys\nProsDoPvP: so tbh\nProsDoPvP: idk why you're talking\nProsDoPvP: no\nProsDoPvP: vlad carried you guys\nProsDoPvP: thats all.\nProsDoPvP: gg\n\nThis comes off as you being a sore loser and unsportsmanlike.\n\nGame 2: \n\nHonestly I can't find much of anything that I or anyone else for that matter would hit punish for except for maybe these lines right here: \n\n>ProsDoPvP: lmao\nProsDoPvP: you're funny kid.\n\nBut even then it's a bit of a stretch there honestly.\n\nOverall the attitude that you displayed in game 1 of the chat logs is the kind of behavior that got you punished in the first place. In terms of games alone I would punish for game one and pardon for game two, but for the case overall I would definitely hit punish just because of game one (1) alone (remember that it only takes one game to receive a punish verdict). Next time try asking politely and respectfully why someone did what they did, and if they start to act up then just mute and report them after the game has ended. Don't stoop down to their level though, as that's exactly what they want you to do.\n\nTL;DR: You weren't punished for \"doing nothing\", you were punished for being passive-aggressive and verbally abusive to your teammates when they did stuff that you didn't like. Game 1 is definitely the worst example of the 2 games the reform card shows, but because you showed consistently negative behavior like the kind that game 1 showcases, and because you refused to heed the warnings of your 3 prior punishments before-hand, you received a permaban because of it. However much money you spend means nothing when it comes to your behavior. Also, someone else being a verbally abusive jerk doesn't give you the right to become one yourself. When you retaliate yourself you're forcing up to 8 other players in the game with you to put up with 2 raging jerks now instead of just one: the original and now you. If you don't have anything nice or constructive to say then just say nothing. I wish you the best of luck in all of your future endeavors.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Void Nargacuga","date":"2016-01-11T03:44:59.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bit of advice: Read the [Terms of Service](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse)","replies":[]},{"poster":"lolptwo","date":"2016-01-11T04:18:44.958+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"ProsDoPvP: im brnze\nProsDoPvP: im sorry\nProsDoPvP: same\nProsDoPvP: same\nProsDoPvP: wuts silveR?\nProsDoPvP: yas lost lane and then roams im done lmao\nProsDoPvP: or wut?\nProsDoPvP: report for?\"\n\nThis is my favourite part when he plays \"stupid\" and pretends he's bronze so whatever he's doing (intentionally letting teammates die) looks like it's nothing.
