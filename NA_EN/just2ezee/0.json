When I join a game my ping starts out at 80 for the first minute or thirty seconds then it all goes down the drain and it goes over 200 for the entire match. Also whenever I die it always falls to 60 or so, then I go back to lane and again it goes over 200. I have it on the lowest settings, no other apps opened and wifi speed is around 45 to 50 mbps. Also at night my ping goes beyond terrible sometimes reaching over 9k but usually stays within 1k to 3k which is still bad. My champ moves so slow I can't even see them cast an ability or an AA, and when I get ganked the jungler suddenly pops on my screen and I'm dead. I get reported over and over because of this, please any help will be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-05T15:42:45.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sudden lag spikes and input delays can be due to network issues maintaining a strong connection either from running on wifi, settings, or something else.

I myself have been constantly at 45ms for months and tonight I logged on and I'm at 56-57 ms constant. I noticed GoodGuyGarys ms increased recently from 41 to 48 constant, he is also in Florida.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/EtkiV9lF-higher-ping","replies":[]}]}
