FPS stay above 60 at all times and ping is 40ms all day. The problem is that during some games my champion will freeze and it just stands there doing nothing. Mouse clicks show they are going through but it doesn't do anything until a few seconds after the champion froze. On top of that I can see what everyone else is doing including killing me and my team pinging me to move.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-19T21:53:23.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm sounds like that might actually be some packet loss instead of your average everyday lag.
