We&#x27;re always open to bringing new game modes into the rotation, as well as old favorites every once and awhile.\n\nPlease believe me when I say that I was involved in some very heated discussions with L4T3NCY and Ghostcrawler over the retirement of Dominion (Things like \"how can Riot call themselves a 'player-centric' company when they've treated Dominion fans and players like garbage since the mode's launch.\"  They still haven't given me an answer, btw).  Still, as apologetic as they wanted me to believe they were, they were equally as adamant that Dominion, as a permanent, capture-the-flag style game mode, would never come back.\n\n\"Definitely Not Dominion\" was, in my opinion, just a cynically put together game mode using already available assets that claimed it was like, but was in reality 100% unlike, the original.  To put it in a real life equivalency, it's like substituting a can of Dr. Pepper with a glass of sugared tap water, calling it \"close enough,\" then getting upset that people say anything at all.\n\n> If you do have any constructive comments, you&#x27;re more than welcome to share those too. The best place to get the devs attention on those ideas is over in [**Client Discussion**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion).\n\nAny comments I had about the new game mode, constructive or otherwise, were disregarded by the powers that be.  That is, if anyone in the RGM team paid attention to them at all.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-07-10T17:44:31.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I was involved in some very heated discussions [...] They still haven't given me an answer, btw\n\nHumm, I wonder why...","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2017-07-10T17:52:48.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DeathBurs7,realm=EUW,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=MLrUzKb9,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-07-10T17:44:31.228+0000)\n>\n> Humm, I wonder why...\n\nThey've given answers to angrier people on similar topics, so I don't understand what you're insinuating.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2017-07-09T23:49:38.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a Dominion fan, I can confidently confirm to you that Riot will never bring back the map mode in a permanent form.\n\nRiot staff determined that Dominion wasn't worth the effort to update the map to Summoner's Rift standards, even though it's lack of popularity was more the fault of the company (no promotion) than the players.  \n\nSo, as much as I'd love to have my favorite game mode return, it won't happen.","replies":[]}]}
