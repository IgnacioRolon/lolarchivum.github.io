I looked up the player in question, though, and his record was really interesting. He typically plays a few times each day in ranked. He had a pretty normal looking record up until late last September, then he went off the rails. \n\nThe vast majority of his games since then have a KDA of 0/0/0 with 0 CS, and no items bought (not even a Warding Totem). Every once in a while he plays a normal enough game, but those games are drowned in a see of zeroes. \n\nI have a hard time imagining how you&#039;d get through a zero game like that without attracting the AFK detection system. Sure, the AFK detector has its shortcomings, but it does work to some degree. The fact that this has been going on for months is a bit disturbing. Maybe he&#039;s always playing with friends so nobody is reporting him? It&#039;s an odd puzzle.\n\nOr is that what you get when you dodge? I've never dodged, so I'm not familiar with that. That would still be an amazing amount of dodging, though, and I would think the Leaverbuster system would have a word with that.","replies":[{"poster":"Der Lindwurm","date":"2018-02-05T01:37:33.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm surprised revealing names is such a big no-no.

Riot may place one on the account if a manual review shows excessive leaving/afks, but the automatic system maxes out penalties at the 20 minute LPQ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-05T02:36:26.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dolyna,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=9OEE6dA7,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-02-05T01:54:14.963+0000)\n>\n> The AFK detector is supposedly designed to catch cases like that.
