Then they go 0/15. 2/12, and 2/6 for the guy who actually got jungle.\n\nWhen you have to do that a second time, people call jg and mid, and  instalock in mid or jungle and you have to play support, even though you said either one of those roles first. \n\nThey also said \"You can only choose 1 role.\" \n\nApparently they think I'm calling two roles when I said \"Mid or jg pref.\" \n\nThen your ADC yells at you for taking 1 creep. \n\nThen when you go 0/4 because they did that, apparently you&#039;re the one who is salty. Totally not the ADC who keeps cursing and saying report me for taking 1 creep..... \n\nThat&#039;s blind pick. Thank god Riot fixed champ select. At least I don&#039;t have to play that anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2016-04-26T21:18:57.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blind pick is kinda known for instalocks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nekusen","date":"2016-04-26T21:17:14.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"toxic people =/= toxic game type, just report them afterwards.\n\ni like blind pick because i dont have to wait 30 minutes since i start queue to the moment the game starts","replies":[{"poster":"Atolan","date":"2016-04-27T00:41:04.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play it.

That means I called mid or jg, but people instalock in champions. Like examples would be {{champion:78}} or {{champion:25}}. Especially towards the more recent matches I have.
