I tried manually setting the FPS cap to 60 to prevent the \"tearing\" but it only makes the screen tearing so much more obvious and worse. When I try turning Vsync on, the map stutters and champions and minions slows down horribly. This is really annoying and I just want to be able to run League as smooth as my other games lol. I've tried borrowing my friends monitor which is 1920 x 1080 60hz, but it didn't fix anything. Any help would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nI'm sorry if I missed any important info or if I'm not understanding something. I'm very new to this type of stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-26T16:55:34.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A new rig requires a lot of love and tuning up to get to its best potential.

I probably wasn't clear enough in my post, but the problem doesn't seem to be low FPS - it seems to be skipping some frames when uncapped. It always says I have 110+ frames even during large teamfights but it just doesn't look as smooth as it should be. It's weird how with my FPS capped at 60, my screen tears, but with Vsync on (60hz refresh rate, so it should still be capped at 60 fps) it just slows everything down and looks stuttery. Maybe it is a monitor problem","replies":[{"poster":"Asmodeus","date":"2016-12-16T03:56:03.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have same problem , idk how to fix .
