What this means is that if you have 200% MS from another source (2x MS) you effectively multiply that multiplier to 350% before adding the 75% on giving you 425% or 4.25x your base MS.\n\nNow his E only adds to that multiplier meaning you only get up to 275%, or 2.75x your MS.","replies":[{"poster":"Weretiger5411","date":"2015-06-10T09:12:54.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LankPants,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2FeURofk,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-06-10T08:25:08.328+0000)\n>\n> It's not really adding to his move speed in quite that way.\n> \n> Before it took all his move speed and multiplied it by 75%.

That's like 10 Zephers or Homeguard two seconds after you leave pool. Homeguards is the only time you should really see the interaction hit this hard, if you just have a tri there'd be around a 5% difference. It also has no effect on flat MS at all, so phage and boots are still just as good on him.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-06-10T08:23:32.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope this won't totally gut movement speed builds.\n\nI mean trinity + youmoo's isn't that bad ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"Weretiger5411","date":"2015-06-10T09:13:25.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lane Cancer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2FeURofk,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2015-06-10T08:23:32.774+0000)\n>\n> I hope this won't totally gut movement speed builds.\n> \n> I mean trinity + youmoo's isn't that bad ;-;\n\nHes still very viable, but no more one hit shots though","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Weretiger5411","date":"2015-06-10T10:12:14.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah I see now, thanks for replying everyone!","replies":[]}]}
