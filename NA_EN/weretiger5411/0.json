I found out that someone got on my account and was able to send messages out to people on my friends list to join a discord group. I told everyone not to click on the link and if they did to change there password(i did this myself) and tried to gather info on this. From what I gathered from one of my friends on my friends list, someone can send out a message like this to tell your friends to go join this discord group. They said that they don&#039;t have to have your password or account information from this, but can get it if anyone accepts the invite to the discord group. \r\n\r\nI want to know more details about this and how it is done so that I can work on preventing this in the future for myself and others.","replies":[]}
