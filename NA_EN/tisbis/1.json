I would say that that plus the Grievous wounds puts it above RoA, and again I usually don't need the mana. A lot of people cast way too many spells so often I will still have mana after my opponent is out even going Morello's first.\n\nThe goal with morello's first isn't to be tanky, its just that the health helps more than most people thinks it does and it also has amazing offensive stats.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rock MD","date":"2019-06-16T20:59:27.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zezockary,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2lVxMjqT,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-06-16T20:47:20.806+0000)\n>\n> I rarely build Luden's anymore, the goal of a burst mage is to kill them with one rotation when you catch them with cc so you shouldn't need much cdr for most characters.

What do you do now?\n\nFact of the matter is mages can't oneshot most characters, and the ones they can there's enough counterplay to prevent it. You might as well just maximize your utility and CC and rotations.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2019-06-16T21:11:34.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rock MD,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2lVxMjqT,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-06-16T20:59:27.347+0000)\n>\n> And then the enemy builds Hexdrinker.
