It seems i can play for a few seconds get to lane and then black and white none responsive monitor screens and screeching audio. I have to restart my PC. Sometimes I can play longer but it always crashes before 3 minutes. \n\nThe thing that is odd is, I updated my graphics drivers, reinstalled the game and upgraded to the new client and thought it was fixed because this issue does not happen in ARAM queues. I though it was fixed but apparently it only happens in summoners rift.\n\nI am not having similar graphical freezes in any other games such as Overwatch and etc.\n\nAny help?  My video card is an AMD Radeon HD 7800.","replies":[{"poster":"Zosoled","date":"2017-04-28T21:07:43.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From the ticket I opened, we gathered that the crash was caused by the game using my integrated graphics instead of my Nvidia card. You have to set the game .exe to run on your graphics card specifically through the Nvidia control panel (or whatever the AMD equivalent is). If that's not an option, like it wasn't for me, then you have to disable the integrated graphics through your BIOS, which will vary among motherboards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-30T23:05:17.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like this might be caused by some type of hardware error, so trying to update your drivers was a good start!
