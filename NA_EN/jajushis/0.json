Mobility/ganks pre-6 is actually some problems, but so does champs like warwick, fiddle, etc and are pretty decent.\r\n\r\nP.S. : THIS IS BRONZE/SILVER FEEDBACK SO I WOULD ACTUALLY LOVE TO HEAR SOME GOOD ADVICE FROM THE PROS HERE.","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2015-03-28T03:46:21.606+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Done it.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/tips-tricks/4kLnaNMB-so-ive-been-playing-leona-lately)\n\nMay remake it with Cinderhulk instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Jajushis","date":"2015-03-29T04:14:35.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice!
