At the time, I didn't really think much of it, but then I realized that there might be end of season reward restrictions for honor zero players. I looked online, and there is no mention of honor zero having any impact on end of season rewards other than not being able to get the honor 3/4/5 ward skins. Just wanted to clarify and ask: If I end the season at honor zero, would I still get the victorious skin, loading screen border, and icon? Thanks for any help. \r\n\r\nPS: My ban was beginning of August, nowhere near the August 22 cutoff for account restrictions.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-12T03:25:23.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't seem like being Honor Rank 0 disqualifies you from anything except the Honor Ward Skin. You should be just fine as long as you don't get another 14-day ban, or end the season with a chat restriction.","replies":[{"poster":"Nerf This","date":"2017-10-12T21:57:27.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks for clarification :)","replies":[]}]}]}
