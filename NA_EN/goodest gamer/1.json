Once Garen's villain passive is changed so it no longer effects enemies that kill him, punishing you for winning lane, he's still the same old Garen who has always had trouble getting kited. For Vayne, learn Draven. IMO one of the most fun champs in the game that also teaches you how to make a lot of clicks making it easier to dodge things later on. Vayne also struggles against heavy lock down, champs that can hit her from a spot that she can't fight back from, or champs that can burst her in a second (Caitlyn, Ashe, Nautilus, Leona, Kog). Thresh support doesn't really have any hard counters I suppose, he's a bit problematic. The good news is statistically, he loses games. And as for Yi, Yi has always been a champion that pentakills your team, sated devourer helps him do that but he's still the same champ. Something that I personally have found helpful against him is to have a huge bruiser that can 1v1 him or at least force him out of the fight near the backlines like Renekton or Hecarim.\n\nGood luck, summoner.","replies":[{"poster":"Syvenon","date":"2015-09-14T01:58:52.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WE'RE NOT SUMMONERS ANYMORE DON'T USE THAT WORD NOW WE'RE \"unseen controllers of champions who are loosely connected and fighting for no apparent reason\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jasiwel","date":"2015-09-13T05:42:43.821+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Today I had two games.
