There's definitely differences in how well a person plays a champion across tiers. Even one as seemingly simple as Maokai. \n\nI will say that sometimes the mechanical differences between a Diamond and a Silver are oversold. However, there are a lot of things I'd expect from a Diamond Maokai player that I wouldn't from Silver. \n\nOn the more tactical, mechanical side: \n\n* Last hitting : I expect a better Mao to get more CS, whether that's through skill ability patterns (E/Q for backline) or knowing his thresholds for killing minions\n* Passive usage : Would expect a higher tier Maokai to pay more attention to this, and get more passive procs off especially as you get into team fights\n* Trading up in lane with Q use to disengage\n* Increase his threat level around turret by having better W -> Q combos to knock enemies back into turrets\n* Better mana management, in particular around ultimate usage\n\nAt a more strategic level, I'd expect the Diamond Mao to be better at: \n\n* Building appropriately for their lane / game match-up\n* Wave management with abilities : maybe it's not always the best idea to permapush with E/Q\n* Better teleport plays and control over bottom lane\n* Understanding of when to engage and what is a good engage","replies":[{"poster":"Goodest Gamer","date":"2016-06-22T23:56:09.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":17,"body":"there are meta builds that are shown on websites as well like probuilds.net and such. as for laning, most maokai  players play it super safe so they dont die and such and are able to cs. as for csing for low elos, they still manage to scrape some gold up and can get gold from teamfights and such.  i dont think silver players are going to have a hard time following their lanes tp when they can just tp themselves to that specific lane. mana management for maokai is almsot impossible to screw up seeing as he has low mana usage and he doesnt need to spam his skills to do damage and such.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-06-23T00:07:14.293+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AzureRaven,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sriAE7pV,comment-id=000100000000000000010000,timestamp=2016-06-22T23:56:09.324+0000)\n>\n> there are meta builds that are shown on websites as well like probuilds.net and such.\n\nThere is no one build that works in every game, especially for tanks.
