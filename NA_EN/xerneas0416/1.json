They changed his story from literally soloing tribes over and over again until being overwhelmed then summoned again, basically holding his fortress all alone against thousands of people from various tribes, to not being able to kill a standard knight with 1 swing?","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-06-25T18:30:47.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My bad, actually.

I don't know but he seemed like he was pretty big to me, he was only ever stopped when piles of people were literally thrown onto him. Back to the point, the artwork for the immortal bastion, atleast in my opinion makes it so that there were literally armies of different tribes just coming at him, and he was only ever stopped with overwhelming mass. Even then, he was always ressurected by his necromancers, and they only stopped him because someone stole his skull? (not sure). So yeah, the only thing i don't know is if the armor was made specifically for him before he died.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"thefatlazycat","date":"2019-06-05T12:25:17.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say he's reasonably stronger, being just as immortal-if not more- than them.
