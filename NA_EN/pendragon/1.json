Do you think downvotes should be a disagreement with the content, or should be based on the desire for the discussion to be seen/had? In my mind with something like this - even if you disagree with the post you'd want to upvote it to make sure other people who disagree with it can see it, and to make sure that it's visibility enough that it gets sufficient discussion. You've also created a scenario where you're heavily upvoting the response to something that is difficult to find because it's heavily downvoted.\n\nSecond piece I think is - would it be better for that second post to be a reply to the first post instead of being its own discussion?

That way when someone reads the first one - the most visible comment is a well thought-out rebuttal?\n\nI'm obviously biased here, but two quick points.\n\n1. A thread can only contain so much.\nIf you packed all the \"lore retcon response\" sub-threads into the dev blog post, the page would be completely overflowing and unreadable. Comments don't have titles, and it's hard to pick through a sea of nested threads to find the sub-topics that interest you. If I want to read more about how the Freljord will be in the new lore, it's easier for me to spot an original thread on that topic than to pick out the one relevant comment inside a mega-thread.\nThis is especially so given that it seems a random early comment often takes and retains the top spot.\n\n2. Post formatting is better than comment formatting.\nAlthough you can (e.g.) embed teensy images in a comment, and do a little text formatting, a fresh post offers a much more versatile and attractive canvas.\n\nWhat I *do* think would make sense would be to have some way to flag a post as being in reply to another post, in a \"Related Videos\" sort of way. Sometimes, I'm less interested in perusing a particular subforum than I am in examining in more detail the post ecosystem developing around a particular thread, like the dev blog. \"Hey Boards, show me all the other threads about this topic.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-09-05T21:50:54.448+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">What I do think would make sense would be to have some way to flag a post as being in reply to another post, in a \"Related Videos\" sort of way.

But, with how people are, having many different voices all raising the same issue (especially if they are all being upvoted) creates a larger amount of visibility for pleasure and displeasure than putting it all in one place. Simply put, if someone sees 5 or 10 or 50 threads, all being upvoted, along the same basic train of thought that can carry far more weight than comments with 10x as many upvotes because each and every one of those posts shows a more systemic and visceral response to a given issue.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-09-05T21:38:11.468+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good exercise!\n\nI upvote all of the entries in the [Champion Concept Contest](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/Gq3Y51cy-ccc-september-champion-concept-contest) I am organizing, to get them a little boost for visibility for feedback and also be a bit more forgiving towards anyone who's new to concepting (and will probably get downvoted).

Although, the thread isn't *amazing* in trying to start a heavy discussion or out to provide constructive criticism to fix a problem, at least it's not an empty question such as: \"Should I buy Diana, pls help\". There's a bit more room to talk about Diana as a champion, how well does she fit into the current meta, and if she really does need some buffs, etc. Simply because the thread is set up in question form. And the comments in that thread were genuine in trying to answer OP's question and overall was a positive construct thread as pointed out by the Beowitz. So, I say this is pretty decent as far as discussion value goes. \n\n\n**Upvote:**http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/TAKi0EwB-favorite-support-champ \n This thread is even lighter than the first one in term of discussion value, but given that it's posted under Micellaneous it serves its purpose to just get the community sharing and talking. So, anything that is positive or just getting the community to share warrants an upvote in my mind. I would agree  though that the post would have been much more interesting if people explained \"why\" those champs were their favorites. Even I didn't explain why since the OP's post was light to begin with, but just having some light topics/threads ain't so bad to deserve a downvote simply because they don't require heavy discussion. If this thread were posted under Gameplay and Balance I would just ignore it and not vote. \n\n**Downvote:** http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/0l2Rl1AA-please-change-ranked-league-promotion-method  \nSo, unlike the other two threads this one is making a statement about what needs to be done. Which is perfectly fine if the OP brings up valid points, and offers room for discussion. However, half of the OP's post is him ranting about one person's performance in game, and the second half is about his \"suggestion\" to fix promotion matches in ranked but it is not really convincing, unorganized in it's goals for having a discussion, and the OP even admits at the end that he's just \"rambling at this point\". \nSo, this just shows that he didn't really put a lot of effort in wanting to have a discussion about the promotion matches in ranked, and made it more about venting on one of his teammate's performance. There might even have been something worth discussing here: Is the structure of promotion matches in ranked frustrating to players? Should we add a \"demotion\" series to ranked? But the thread itself is poor constructed that it doesn't allow discussion to really happen.\n\n\nThat concludes the rational behind my voting. Took a while to write but I hope it becomes useful in helping to improve the quality of discussion here on the boards. Thanks again for coming up with this exercise.

If it's a well presented opinion that I agree with/was about to express, I'll upvote it. A lot of times too, if there's some contrast in a common topic, that'll influence my voting, like with the threads above; I'll be more likely to upvote the well structured posts and downvote the poorly structured posts instead of staying neutral.

When a lot of threads on the same topic come up, I'm more likely to upvote the ones I think are healthy discussions and downvote the ones I think are non-productive. I was mixed on this one for a while; I think Factions is a really great idea, and done some really great work that I have supported on previous threads. There are some points in this post, though, that really come off as too confrontational (like the last part of the title). Under normal circumstances I probably wouldn't vote on this thread, but in light of the previous threads on this topic that I upvoted (which show the range of how a discussion can be held), I think there was a better way OP could have made this post, and that the threads I upvoted would provide/are more deserving of good discussion, so I ended up downvoting.\n\nEDIT3: One other thing; if a post or comment has been downvoted to 0, and I don't think it deserved it, I will upvote it back to 1, even if I wouldn't have upvoted it normally.\n\nEDIT4: Okay I swear this is (probably) the last one: I also vote in relation to my other votes: I might upvote a post/comment to say, +3 since I think it's a good post/comment that deserves more attention, but maybe won't upvote a post at +2 to +3, even though I like the comment, because I think the first post deserves more visibility, and the way the posts/comments are, the difference between +2 and +3 in terms of visibility seems pretty significant. I do this more often for comments than for threads.\n\nEDIT5: I lied.

(downvote)\nGroup 2 says a vote is     this content is well thought-out/this content has low effort (downvote)\nGroup 3 says a vote is     this thread deserves more visibility/deserves less visibility (downvote)\nGroup 4 says a vote is     I don't care (upvote or no vote at all)/troll thread (downvote)\n\nAnd a vast number of variation or derivatives of these (and other) rationale for voting. Part of the problem could be answered by having a Riot defined explanation of what a vote means. Another part of the problem could be answered by having different voting options.\n\nUpvote/Downvote are an incredibly vague medium for parsing content's value. If it were up to me, threads would have a drop down menu with multiple options that could be quickly ticked off describing the thread. Then, those options would be taken into an algorithm that decides if the thread's visibility should increase decrease or lock.\n\nBut hey, that is just my 2 cents.\n\nUpvoted for visibility. (I voted purely on visibility for this thread, sometimes i vote on agreement/not, and often my downvotes mean disagreement or troll thread.)","replies":[{"poster":"Zhugan","date":"2014-09-05T21:37:27.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that's the entire reason he's asking.

Years of silence about the lore just to announce that you won´t do anything short then slaughtering all that had been without giving it some good thinking (there are soo many ideas in the community how to tell stories in the current cannon with only slight adjustements)...just showing that noone in Riot actually cares about the playerbase the slightest if it´s not a horde of lee-sin-\"mains\".

Who is Vayne responding to when she says \"Joke? What do you mean?\", and who the hell is instructing her to tell a joke anyway? Herself? That would make her crazy, but that would be the case with this new lore. Also, there would no reason for Sona to have ANY quotes whatsoever, seeing as the only person who can hear her, the summoner, no longer exists within the lore (This would also mean that her in-game voice is non-canon, since she will have no one to talk to in the lore world).\n\nThe list goes on.\n\nThe second reason is there is no meaningful discussion to be had. 90% of the posts are people showing discontentment with the new lore direction and their reasons why. And the other 10% are reds responding to praise while being unwilling or unable to justify their position. Despite the fact that I want the discussion to be visible, I can't bring myself to upvote it because that would imply that I am in support of the points brought on by the OP, which I would have to be a complete idiot to do.\n\n[Upvoted](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/teko6RP4-psa-you-should-vote-more)\n\nWhile not necessarily a topic meant to generate discussion, it is a good topic to raise awareness about. However, I will agree to disagree when it comes to upvotes and downvotes, as I view them as a way to show agreement or disagreement. Upvoting a discussion, while it does help raise awareness about the topic, it also sends the impression that general consensus is that people agree with the topic, even though it may not be entirely the case.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daen","date":"2014-09-05T22:25:59.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So far it seems like there's a consistent trend of inconsistency. :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-09-05T21:11:21.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't usually upvote or downvote topics themselves.
