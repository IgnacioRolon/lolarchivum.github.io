{"poster":"Pendragon","date":"2013-09-17T18:39:21.369+0000","title":"Welcome to the Community Beta","subforum":"Boards Feedback","up_votes":40,"down_votes":31,"body":"Hey folks, \n\nFor the last little while a small team of Rioters have been thinking about how League of Legends players interact online outside of the game itself. Players have conversations, they share awesome content, and they form communities.\n\nA lot of that interaction happens back on our official forums. Traditional forums are pretty great at fostering discussion, but with a community as large and talkative as ours it can be truly overwhelming to find the content you want or the conversations you want to add your voice to. We’ve also heard a ton of feedback from you guys with ideas on how to improve the official forums.\n\nSo we took a step back and thought about how we could best serve the community’s needs. We looked at other thriving community and social platforms, we talked to players about what they want, we drank a lot of coffee, and we started building a new community platform with this goal in mind:\n\nWe want to create a player-driven platform that brings the community together around awesome content and discussions relevant to your interests.\n\n* You should be able to find awesome content that you care about\n* It should be easy to have great conversations with other players and Rioters\n* Your actions should influence the community\n* You should be able to form friendships and build communities with like-minded players\n* Your feedback should shape the future of the platform\n\nSo we’ve been working on this for a little while now – but we can only get so far on our research and assumptions. We need you to participate – post, upvote, downvote, discuss, debate, and test what we built (read: break stuff).\n\nWhat we really need the most is for you to tell us what you think so we can move forward and work with you to build something great for the community. We’re excited to share what we’ve got today, but it’s important for you to know that this is an early look – it’s gonna change and grow and evolve based on the community’s direction.\n\nSo, welcome – help us test this and make it better. Community pls!\n\nOh, and go here to ask us anything about the project: http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/c/beta-feedback/f1Fsz53Q-were-the-team-behind-the-community-beta-ask-us-anything\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n**Will this replace the forums?**\nMaybe one day. I can’t state this strongly enough, though: this is at a super early stage. We’re asking YOU to shape the direction of this platform to be the best possible place for League of Legends content and discussion.\n\n**Is this available globally?**\nFor our first round of testing, to keep things focused, we’re just launching this for the NA region, but anyone with an NA account can participate. Based on community feedback, we’ll think about the right time to bring this to other regions and languages.\n\n**Will posts from the current forums appear here?**\nNope. It’s a brand new platform and the way discussions work is fundamentally different so it’d be pretty messy to try to copy and paste things over.\n\n**Can I give feedback?**\nYES! GIVE FEEDBACK! Go here and tell us your thoughts: http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/c/beta-feedback\n\n**When will it be done?**\nShort answer: never. Just like with League of Legends, we’re committed to constantly improving this based on your feedback.\n\n**Is this inspired by Reddit?**\nWe took inspiration from a variety of community and social platforms that have been extremely successful at serving community needs. Reddit’s a big one, for sure, but we’re also looking at Facebook, Disqus, and a dozen other discussion and social sites. That got us to where we are today – now it’s your opportunity to help shape this.\n\n**Why couldn’t you make improvements to the existing forums?**\nThe current forums use off-the-shelf forums software (vBulletin) that’s really great at what it does. However, the changes necessary to accomplish our goals would basically mean rewriting the whole platform anyway, so we decided to build something new ourselves.\n\n**Where will you keep us up to date on changes?**\nWe’ll have constant update threads in the Beta Feedback subcommunity with the latest updates.","replies":[{"poster":"Void Devoid","date":"2013-09-18T12:08:34.818+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":38,"body":"looks like garbage","replies":[{"poster":"Montag","date":"2013-09-18T16:07:18.128+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":23,"body":"I'd love to hear what you don't like about it.

This feels like a news article and a little comments section.\n\nRiot, Reds, if you guys like Reddit so much, use it, post there all you want, your posts will trickle down to the actual forums pretty quickly. But don't force the rest of us to adopt your fad. I am totally comfortable making the sweeping statement that the vast majority of the community does not like this new system.

A lot of discussions have been taking place on the League subreddit rather than your own forums. Is this a company stance/preference that the Reddit layout is superior to a more traditional forum layout? And if that is the case, wouldn't it be easier to tell the community that you are going through with the Reddit layout and no amount of feedback will change that particular point?\n\nAs an onlooker, that more or less seems to be Riot's stance on the matter. The Reddit layout is final and won't be changed, and we aren't interested in feedback to that point.\n\nI feel this would be a better stance than suggesting you're open to feedback, and then just more or less blowing off all the negative feedback i see pertaining to the Reddit layout.\n\nI don't spend a lot of time on forums. Generally i am interested in conversations that aren't \"nerf this\" \"buff that.\" I feel like this Reddit layout will not be able to diversify the communities to the point where you don't see \"nerf ____\" threads in every forum. And on the note of sub-communities on this Beta, I feel that many communities won't have enough traction to interest any rioters to post. I mean hell, look at the current forums. If you want a Riot response you are forced to post in GD because the vast majority of Rioters seemingly don't even browse other forums. And why would they? Almost all of the sub-communities are dead.\n\nI agree that there needs to be a way to break up the LONG list of just... garbage... that is and can be posted in GD. Many threads are incredibly knowledgeable... some are toxic... and yet others are just pointless spam. There needs to be a way for the community to speak directly to the developers to which their thread pertains, other than just \"@Pendragon\" threads. I think if there is a Riot employee that interacts with the community, they should have a sub-community where they can field the questions that are important to them.\n\ni.e. @Xelnath, Why are you doing 80 Bazillion reworks at the same time?\n\nPersonally, i do NOT like the Reddit layout. But, if you are insistent on this being the way of this new forum... please... I implore you to just TELL us that outright.\n\nThanks for your time, and hopefully you'll be able to respond to some of these points Pendragon.

Here's Markdown's designer on paragraph versus line-break formatting:\n\n> A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a blank line — a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.\n\n> The implication of the “one or more consecutive lines of text” rule is that Markdown supports “hard-wrapped” text paragraphs. This differs significantly from most other text-to-HTML formatters (including Movable Type’s “Convert Line Breaks” option) which translate every line break character in a paragraph into a '<br />' tag.\n\n> When you do want to insert a '<br />' break tag using Markdown, you end a line with two or more spaces, then type return.\n\n> Yes, this takes a tad more effort to create a '<br />', but a simplistic “every line break is a '<br />'” rule wouldn’t work for Markdown. Markdown’s email-style blockquoting and multi-paragraph list items work best — and look better — when you format them with hard breaks.\n\nI feel there's also another, more important reason, to not respect a simple line-break as a '<br />', besides the flexibility to hard-wrap paragraphs or block-quotes. It forces the writer to write for the reader -- you have to decide why you're using single-line breaks and format appropriately. If you're creating a list, it makes more sense to use the list style (starting a line with a \\- or \\*). That way, we can tell what you're doing and style it in a way that's best for the reader -- might be mobile, might be desktop, might be a totally different visual style down the line. Sometimes writers will use single line-breaks *as* paragraph breaks, and these are virtually unreadable. In that case, it really does makes sense to use two.\n\nThat's my thought. It's certainly not the end-all for Markdown -- services like GitHub respect line-breaks inline -- but I feel like there are some good reasons to stick to the strict Markdown spec, especially to make posts work primarily *for readers*.

You can find it here:\n\nhttp://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/c/beta-feedback/OI8QmnuW-if-this-reddit-style-goes-live-im-done?comment=0001000000050002\n\n( By the way, the list in that topic (copied over from YouTube) is a great example of painfully adding double spaces after every line, going to preview to make sure I didn't miss any, and then going back to add more if I did. It's really annoying. )\n\nWhat I wanted to bring up with you is #5. It's really hard to tell where a first-level comment begins after a huge pyramid of child comments. Even changing the margin from 10px to 25px on the top of every comment thread greatly improves readability. Check'em: http://i.imgur.com/ePB6VHq.png (Why do images automatically parse to inline thumbnails? Look at how badly it screws with line height.)\n\nAnd there's so many other things I keep bumping in to.\n\n1. My first instinct in the profile's My Updates area is to click the title of the thread to go to the comment, but the \"Go To Comment\" link is a little button in the bottom right. The comment's URL should be very close to the thread's title name.\n2. The permalink buttons use a god awful javascript:; href that changes your browser's URL that you then have to copy, instead of just letting you right click \"copy link address\" to get it.\n3. To even get to my profile to see my posts, I had to scroll all the way up to the page (about 6 screen's worth of scrolling), and then all the way back down and figure out where my reply was. This problem doesn't exist in the standard threaded view, but the Reddit style will show hundreds of posts in a single view.\n\nHate to nit-pick you to death but I really love webdev and I see you guys are passionate about the new community area, so I'm trying to chip in as long as it's welcomed.","replies":[{"poster":"Montag","date":"2013-11-02T18:27:31.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I really appreciate your feedback, and I *love* nitpicking.

Something I'd take for granted, like chronological threading or bbcode, is considered \"baggage\" to other people. There's a really indescribable feeling you get when you say something you think is universally true and are told, \"nah, that's wrong.\"\n\nAs an experiment, I made three very small changes to the layout of the thread.\n\n1. I added this rule to hide replies of replies: #discussion .primary-comments-container .primary-comments-container { display: none; }\n2. Doubled the margin-top of the first replies.\n3. Changed \"Show More\" to \"Show All Replies\"\n\nAnd here's the result:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qlnCEER.png\n\nI think this resolved a lot of my complaints. Posts are very easy to distinguish, irrelevant replies to replies to replies are hidden, and you can see the discussion of the original topic without distraction. But, the availability to see sub-discussions is still there.\n\nWhat I think is very interesting about the layout I've given is it does exactly what the layout is supposed to. My comment about \"unpopular opinions would get downvoted to oblivion\" doesn't hold weight here. You see two conflicting opinions up at the very top, with more ideas of how to reach middle ground below it. If I wanted to see discussion about a particular idea, the availability of replying or showing all replies is there without being shoved into my face. Everything relevant is readily available, everything extraneous is easy to open but not in the way.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
