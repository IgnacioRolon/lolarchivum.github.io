If you really think that is all it is. You could make the same argument for literally every role with all the reasoning you provided. Hell, its a lot easier to do nothing and just farm in mid lane. Pick ziggs and waveclear. \n\nSilver 3 is the highest you can reach because you aren't good enough to carry yourself out. Think about it. Assuming you always do well (which you're implying saying you can't climb because of your teammates) you have 4 potential bad teammates, and the enemy has 5. You actually **benefit** from bad people being in queue with you. \n\nHow do you think people get higher ranks that you? They get lucky and stay lucky for the entire season? What about those that climb to their rank every single season?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-03-01T20:54:37.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you admit to inting? \n\nWhat do you mean they are only supposed to farm the first 15 minutes? If neither jungler is checking/ganking botlane in that time frame then I want that piece of heaven. If they aren't getting 4 manned at 10 minutes, I want that. \n\nAnd finally, if you have a problem with the ones you get, learn the role yourself to play it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-01T20:23:36.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just get good and leave silver 3 if you don't like playing with silver 3 teammates. You're not a special snowflake that gets all the baddies as teammates, the enemy gets them too. If you can't win despite the enemy getting just as many feeders, than it's your fault alone. Stop whining.","replies":[]}]}
