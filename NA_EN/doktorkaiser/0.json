Ever since the 7.5 patch I have been having extreme fps drops, some games go smoothly but in some games it just drops hard, at the beginning its 0 for couple of seconds, then it reaches max 40-50 fps which is already suboptimal and sometimes it drops bellow 25, especially in teamfights when often times it drops bellow 10 making me literally dc-ed in the middle of the most important part of the game. I have been playing since season 1 and I have NEVER EVER even on the most shitty of PCs had any kind of fps drops untill now. Its obviously something that is caused by the newest patches and I have no idea what to do to fix this. Btw I play on the old client. Can someone please help ?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-05T18:33:41.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're reinstalled then it's unlikely the culprit would be bad game files here.  There could be other problems like driver issues too.  Playing the game itself is independent of the client, so it shouldn't matter which you use.  I suggest going over each step in the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to help rule out possibilities.  Test it in a custom game and let me know how it goes for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Timm3rr","date":"2017-04-05T20:53:06.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive also been having the same problems for a little while now. I tried all the the recommended steps for the FPS issues and there hasn's been any improvement. The frame drops happen occasionally throughout the game and it is random (not during big teamfights or anything like that). It seems to happen more when my champ isn't on the screen if that helps at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-05T20:58:39.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, this sounds like an FPS issue to me as well.
