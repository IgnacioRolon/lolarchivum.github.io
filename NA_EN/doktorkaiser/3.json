I absolutely hate it, I just came from college couple of mins ago to see this shit and it completely ruined my day. It has literally 0 heart to it, its ugly, the colors are awfull, the design sucks balls, its not a gargoyle any more, the voice sounds like fucking mundo (I love mundo dont get me wrong) and so do new quotes, where as he used to be a vice ancient sculpture,  HE DOESNT FUCKING FLY ANY MORE !!!!  The skills are the ones of a brute, instead of an ancient mage sentinel. \r\n\r\nIt might be too soon to say this, but as a Galio semi-main and huge fan - THIS REWORK IS THE FIRST ONE THAT I WILL SAY IS ABSOLUTELY AND UTTERLY TERRIBLE IN BOTH GAMEPLAY AND DESIGN !!!!!\r\n\r\nRIP in piece  Sentinel's Sorrow, thank you for countless hours of fun (and freelo in season 2 when you carried me out of gold elo), I will alway love you and remember you as you were &lt;3  {{item:3070}} {{champion:3}} {{item:3070}} \r\n\r\nP.S. - fuck you RIOT seriously...","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-03-06T20:25:21.159+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The teaser just looks so... gaudy. It's about opposite as you can get from Galio's traditional look/feel. \n\nI honestly feel like the teaser and art would have worked better for a Jayce rework than a Galio rework.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-03-06T20:30:37.913+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"^This.

There is just nothing in this new \"Galio\" that even remotely reminds me of a champion I fell in love with long fucking time ago and that I still play to this day even though he is the lowest playrate in the game most of the time...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-03-06T20:25:08.309+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was my first thought as well.\n\nAnd my second thought was, \"This doesn't look like a character I can take mid when my team needs a tank.\" That is why I picked up Galio in the first place. =.=","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xeoxed","date":"2017-03-06T22:34:49.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love Galio.
