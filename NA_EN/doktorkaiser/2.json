All 5 of us noticed it and also some of his own teammates, and we werent like bronzies or something, we had diamond players in the game (it was all for one). How do I make sure that RIOT look into this and ban him immediately, I mean I sent the report ticket but I kind of feel like they wont give a fuck, I want to make sure he doesnt ruin any more games because I feel so cheated now its not even real. Is there any way to make sure that somebody will ban this scumbag soon, because I dont have a slightest doubt that he is indeed scripting ?","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2016-11-26T00:31:21.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":13,"body":"how about u go on with you life and not be a salty little snitch","replies":[{"poster":"BigBellBrute","date":"2016-11-27T16:09:19.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hells bellsX,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=qHE2Q4AA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-26T00:31:21.576+0000)\n>\n> how about u go on with you life and not be a salty little snitch\n\nAll that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing.   \n\nP.S.

Buuuuuuut, given the amount of posts that have come through the PB&M board the past month about players saying they were permabanned unfairly for third party programs, scripting, etc., Riot is definitely doing something with those reports.  Nobody knows exactly what voodoo magic they use to make certain that a person is in fact scripting, and not just having really good mechanics, but they take the reports seriously and do look into those cases.  And they look at more than just one game, to be fair to the people being reported, so that innocent players don't get the banhammer because someone got salty over not being able to land skillshots against good dodging. \n\nTL;DR Riot does take the reports seriously, and if the guy is really scripting, he's probably gotten other reports on him for it and will end up banned for it when they investigate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tyrone Lannister","date":"2016-11-26T01:04:36.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Send a ticket to riot support","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2016-11-26T00:34:20.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much all you can do is report him.","replies":[]}]}
