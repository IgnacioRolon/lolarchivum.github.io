I have had attack move click bound to my Mouse Button 5 ever since i learned how to use it. Despite it still being bound to MB5 this hasn't been working the last few days. I have unbound it and rebound it both in games and in settings on home screen, but it won't work in game, even in training mode. I thought it was maybe my mouse so i went and bought a new one, but it's still happening.(needed new mouse anyway) Was there something hidden in the patch notes maybe i missed? Or is this a bug. I was watching Solo Renekton Only stream yesterday and he said his attack move was buggy too. Looking for some clarity plz. I know it's not 100% needed but I've gotten used to kiting with this and my right clicking is bad now that i always kite this way.\"","replies":[{"poster":"DaenrysTargaryen","date":"2017-08-31T03:36:23.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Doc Rat,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=Vq4bJmmR,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-08-31T02:55:12.843+0000)\n>\n> WTF riot.

This is a feature I put into the game and I'd hate for it to not work. It was meant to work with left click not another binding. I also had my mb5 not work with new windows update and it's tilting.
