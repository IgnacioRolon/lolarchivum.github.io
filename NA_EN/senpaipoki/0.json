I just got a Private Message in my League of Legends client with a serious death threat. This over a simple game of LoL. Please reach out to me ASAP.","url":"https://twitter.com/senpaipoki1/status/1043516955444097024","image":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1043521327938895875/3uNRkFJl_400x400.jpg"},"up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"Today I experienced the most extreme thing ever, during my time as a League of Legends player. After a match one of my teammates who had been complaining about my gameplay all game added me. As the nice person I am I accepted the friend request and asked \"What?\" because I didn't know what he/she wanted.\r\n\r\nHe/she answered \"Where are you from?\" and I hold him/her that it's not concerning them.\r\n\r\nInstead of dropping the conversation he told me \"I'm going to track your IP and I'm going to murder you and your family.\"\r\nLater on he even said he would send his \"%%%%%s\" to murder me after they raped all my family members. They would murder me afterwards by cutting/pulling off my limbs piece by piece. Very EXTREME threats.\r\n\r\nThis shocked me as this is the first time I've had an online death threat thrown at me, over a GAME. Even if this is all a \"joke\" or a way to try and scare people I'm sure that I'm not the only one who's been threatened in this or any similar way. This should be taken way more serious than some people may think, after all it's a **THREAT**, and threatening people is illegal in most countries.\r\n\r\nAlso since this is League of Legends of course some people will say, \"This is league, what do you expect?\"\r\nWell I can tell you that there is plenty of polite players out there and that taking threats like this more serious is better for the entire player base.\r\n\r\nThat would make the community so much better in every way.\r\nI'd rather play with a 0/16 {{champion:102}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:16}} or any other champion, than with a 22/3 toxic player.\r\n\r\nPlaying games is supposed to be fun.","replies":[{"poster":"RuFiot","date":"2018-09-22T17:55:22.689+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"One guy voted \"Not been and did threaten.\" xD FIND HIMM","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2018-09-22T21:25:27.582+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go contact their support, big chance they wont see you on the boards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2018-09-22T20:41:17.758+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a very serious question.

That behavior is completely unacceptable & uncalled for, especially over a VIDEO GAME. \n\nIn the future, I'd advise not accepting friend requests from players that complain about how you play as they're probably one of these kinds of people. If they spam request you (they usually do if you decline them), block them so they can no longer friend request you or invite you to their games.","replies":[{"poster":"HoogaBoogaBooga","date":"2019-07-01T10:39:19.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it's possible for the creators of LoL to pull up records of anything sent via message.
