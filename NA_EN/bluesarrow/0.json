So i did and when i got back i had the same problem as him. At this point we're both really confused and someone  also in the game we don't know added me on her smurf and asked if we had the same problem. I have no clue what else to do but please we need help fixing this riot!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-19T17:58:00.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually just finished replying to your duo partner's post about this same incident! It looks like what occurred was what we refer to as a *Ghost Game*. These happen when the game server has a hiccup and fails to report the outcome of the match. \n\nThis shouldn't lasted longer than a few hours at most, at which point it resolves itself.
