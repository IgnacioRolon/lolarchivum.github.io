I am currently stuck in bronze 4. I am fine with my rank but i am seriously botherd about how many toxic players and troll players who intentionally ruin the game 4 me in this elo. I am guessing thats why they call bronze elo hell. A lot of these players stress me out because it makes it impossible to carry and climb thru back to when i was bronze 1 in promos. \r\nI think it would be a nice idea if riot made it possible to do placement games again because i did mine as soon as i hit level 30. I wasnt as expeirenced as i am now but i blew my placement games and now am stuck with toxic players who flame me as soon as i make a mistake which leads to me playing poorly.\r\n I dont think it is fair that i have to play with players like this \r\nFeedback from anyone is encouraged on this. Thank you","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-18T04:15:01.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd first suggest that you make use of that report button on the post game screen, as that's your gateway for sending possibly toxic players our way! \n\nThere's not much we can do about adjusting your tier placement. Doing so would compromise the way ranked play works, and we don't even have the tools to do that here on the boards.","replies":[]}]}
