All these whiners are the ones that have fed a Yasuo and had to pay the price. However that is the situation with any champion. The current OP champs we should be addressing is the reworked assassins (talon, katarina, rengar).\r\nYasuo has a high skill cap so if one summoner is good with Yasuo he has worked for it. He isn&#039;t a brain dead op champ..*cough tryndamere cough garen cough jax cough vayne cough swain*\r\nPersonally yes i do play him and yes i do enjoy it very much. with that being said there are games where i fall behind and when you fall behind there is no coming back as Yasuo. So tell me how that is OP because it sounds like any other champion if you get ahead you do well if you fall behind you stay behind? I would hate for his perfect stature to be nerfed because a few boosted players play champs that is hard countered by Yasuo. Here is a tip: PLAY any ranged champ and you have advantaged.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2016-12-09T21:05:58.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  He isn't a brain dead op cham\n\nnoooo... he totally isn't\n\n>  Here is a tip: PLAY any ranged champ and you have advantaged\n\nyou know that there is this shit wall that counters any Ranged Champion?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-09T21:25:55.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His wall is up at most about 10% of the time, learn how to bait him and stay at a safe distance.\n\nRiot is already considering him for nerfs, and nobody who actually knows his strengths and weaknesses expects anything else, but being strong against ranged champions is not a big part of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2016-12-09T21:29:51.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when the Yasuo player is not a braindead monkey (what applies to pretty much all of them), he won't use his wall in every situation but when it matters. And when he did he plays safe until it's up again.\n\nhe still also has his passive shield to deny poke. actually getting to his Ranged Target is no problem either, and when he does they are basically dead.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MilamberZ","date":"2016-12-09T21:03:45.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if his current balance state is good, people will still complain about him. And riot decided to trolling by letting it be, and even add salt into it, you can be sure that he'll get nerfed, probably gutted even.\n\nIf they should nerf something, it would be his trade power on the early phase, and shift it into the mid game, simply up the Q mid damage and uping the cooldown (7 to 4 seconds) would already solve the problem. But they'll not do that, since Riot decided that yasuo wasn't a good champion anymore rofl. \nIt's useless to make any thread, you'll get only hate, poor yasuo main xD.","replies":[]}]}
