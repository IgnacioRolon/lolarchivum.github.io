It was warping their power curve beyond reason by doing nothing to help with their poor jungle clears, adding nothing to their ganks that they NEEDED to pull off to catch up in gold, and then when they hit those team fights they became literally unkillable because the old tank enchant had to have a massive multiplier to make up for how awful tanks were at the time from every other angle.","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2016-03-04T23:52:41.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Magus was literally Morellonomicon without the Mana Regen. 80 AP. 20% CDR.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-03-04T23:56:37.211+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=My Waifu Chocola,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JYAuVK8l,comment-id=0002000200000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-03-04T23:52:41.017+0000)\n>\n> Magus was literally Morellonomicon without the Mana Regen. 80 AP. 20% CDR.\n\nSo like Warrior, except for a class of champions that don't have powerful auto attacks to fall back on when their abilities are on cooldown.\n\nI'm pretty sure that's the main reason most mage items tend to be AP + something cool and useful while most AD caster items are just stats.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"High5","date":"2016-03-05T00:37:46.587+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I normally agree with Yoshi, but warrior works fine and in most cases, it's not flashy, but very effective.\n\nI know people don't agree, but Devourer is a very delayed power spike in a meta that tends to have quicker games.
