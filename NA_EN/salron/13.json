They screw all the mana regen items over.  Fiddle uses ALOT of mana with his spells.  So you can't go mind really because you can't really farm with fiddle (the way his spells are and his auto does no damage and really slow).  No regen means about 2 fears 2 drain and 3 bats then your oom.  Don't get me started on MAW \n\nso jungle agrrr wait now everyone can see you blue buff (have to use to farm in jungle due to heavy mana cost).  If you jungle fiddle when its up the whole enemy team will run to it.\n\nLooking at the items they lowered the Raw AP.  No more CD/Mana regen (what fiddle needs early game)\n\nSO....\n\nare fiddle spells gaining a high ap ratio or we increasing any damage?  Lowering mana cost?\n\nCause the way I see it now.  I can use only 1/3 to 1/2 the spells mid as I could.  Jungle is not going to be an option due to mana regen, everyone seeing blue, and fiddle weak early jungle.  Heck ill be oom 2 or 3 packs without blue.  add the AS jungle item, it will cause an hit on effect jungle meta now.\n\nSupport has been screwed by the adc power and tank support dives.\n\neveryone might not agree with everything I said but I think they will agree I just see all nerfs to may guy while other champs just roll there faces on their keyboards to win.  Heck with the new que system the premade have TOTALLY changed the balance of some class.  In solo que at least more champ we played due to the non premades.\n\nI told you all on the boards after you hired Ghost Crab from WOW that whoever is make the top decision is a moron/clueless and is just going to squeeze all the money they can out of the game before the sink it.\n\n\nOf course no blue will response be fiddle is not Zed.
