Why then does this take you as a company allocating valuable man-hours to creating a website, that nobody, that is in your customer base, wants? That's as counter-productive as your balance team.\n\nGD is a mess, we all know this, and yet, we keep using it. Why? Because it works, there is no popularity ruled system that will keep the little man's voice unheard there. Everyone has an equal opportunity to have their opinions voiced, and likewise, heard. However, with this system, and god do I hate Reddit's system. Unless you're posting something that is a popular opinion, praise towards Riot, or \" x \" useless fact about a pro player, your voice might as well be a fart in the wind. If you think GD is bad now, image how terrible this system will be, when you have tens of thousands of people rapping on your doors. Popularity based threads are nice and all, for a site like Reddit. They don't have anything useful, or constructive to build upon there, for the most part, and as such, their system works, however flawed, and almost unusable it it. However, Riot, you are a multi-million dollar gaming mecha of a company. You **\"value\"** your players input, and yet you're trying to force those **\"valued\"** customers, onto a site that would systematically take all of their voices, if they are negative towards Riot, or contrary to a popular opinion, and completely extradite them from the conversation regarding your game.\n\nI understand why Rioters like this site more than GD. I mean who wouldn't, in your position. GD is a harsh place, where everyone is going to voice their raw emotions, and not give a dam who it reflects on. That is however, what you call \"Feedback\" wither its negative, or positive, it is feedback from your **\"valued\"** customers. And forcing them onto a site, where only the positive feedback makes it through to the masses, is pathetic. You need to understand however, you need to take things that are said on GD with a ton of salt. Like I said previously, these are Raw emotions that are being thrown around, often without a second thought on the matter. GD is mean, they are harsh and they will dig at you for ever single mistake you make. But that is what you have to expect when you open up a conversation room, for hundreds of thousands of people. The most vocal majority, are often those with the smallest backing. The silent majority loves you guys, we understand that shit isn't as easy as flipping the switch and making everything OK again.\n\nSome Rioters, even through this sea of raw emotion, and mindless spam, still post consistently. IronStylus, WookieeCookie, Morgageddon,and Xelnath, to name a few. We value your posts, for the most part, they are insightful, explanatory, and generally very light-hearted.\n\nHowever, only looking at the dull-green grass that is GD doesn't mean you should try to force a shiny batch of red grass onto us. None of us want that. We've tried to tell you, countless times, over the **years** that what we wanted, was a better version of the current forums. Something like vBulletin. Give us features that would make the experience on the existing forums more enjoyable, some that would make it less of a spam fest. Allow us to follow threads, keep up-to-date with the topics that matter to us. How the forums work now, is how they should work. Popularity based forums allow for only a small minority of voices to be heard, and topics to be discussed. While our forums, however imperfect they may be, get the job done. They just need a spit-shine, and they would look good as new. \n\nAdd some actual, visible moderation. As stated countless time, the mod's on GD, are pathetic. They are more hated than Hitler and Teemo at this point. They seem to have no rhyme or reason behind how they handle the forums, countless posts that don't deserve to be closed, are. Others that deserve to get shut down, like pornography threads, are left open for countless hours, while the mods do nothing. The lack of moderation, is what makes the forums seem so \"toxic\". If there was any form of effort put in on your side to actually dedicate some time to moderating the forums, it could be a wonderful place. Yet as it sits now, we get nothing but random user bans, and pornography threads that stretch into the double-digit pages.\n\nI would really appreciate if you talked to us Riot, respond to some of these threads, not only here, but on  your actual dang forums. Hundreds of thousands of people will roll through GD on any given day, I'd be generous to say you get 1/10th of that hear. Appeal to your wider audience, if you have something to say regarding the forums, post it on the forums. Not the community beta that no one wants.\n\nSorry if this comes across as harsh at some points. I'm a little flustered at the thought that you might actually force us into something that none of us want, all for the sake of your own mistakes.","replies":[{"poster":"Zastie","date":"2014-02-19T06:33:05.117+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"See that \"Report\" button on the corner of the post?

That time and effort would be way better spent getting this board ready for not being a beta any more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Schtauffenz","date":"2014-02-19T17:00:22.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They are taking an active role in creating a new forums better designed to active, engaging discussion.
