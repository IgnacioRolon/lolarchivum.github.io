Why would you choose one that was already free, Garen?\n\nIf I were to make a guide for new players, in the past it would include: \"like Riot on Facebook for Tristana, send in a support ticket for Alistar because the youtube thing is broken, and follow them on Twitter for Garen. You need to conserve all your IP for runes, so get as many free champs as you can.\"\n\nNow I would just tell them \"don't even bother following them on Twitter, Garen is free from the chest and the skin sucks.\"\n\nBESIDES ALL THAT, why would you ignore the massive feedback from the playerbase? We TOLD you Garen was already free, and TOLD you to choose a new champ.
