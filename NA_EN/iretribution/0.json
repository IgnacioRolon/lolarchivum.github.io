It is 4% of targets max health first hit. Less then q used to do, but q is also getting a base damage near double what it used to be level 1. Which isn't much of a loss when you think of its affects early game. what is used to be. Second, w's over time now deals 4% of total health level one vs 10% of bonus health. What this means. If you were to have say... 100 bonus health at level one, you would get 10 extra damage. But if you had a total of 600 health, this equals to 24 bonus damage. \n\nYes the percentage of her health went down early, but the scaling is now on her total heatlh, not bonus. The only reason this isn't a straight up buff is because they lowered the base damage enough that it counters the advantage EXCEPT that her q got a better base damage and her w is now the primary damage tool which helps her clears dramatically to level.\n\nThis is a big difference since as you level it, it eventually reaches a higher percentage then before, and even at the lower percentages it beats the old bonus health percentage. \n\nsimilarly, before you had to pick between q and w for overall damage or E for gank power and burst potential. Now, all damage is consolidated on her w, and her e, while no longer having a scaling slow, has nearly half the cooldown(6/11) with 3/5ths the slow as you level it. The damage went down as well obviously but the overall damage went up with the lower cooldown since you can use it nearly twice as often going to a state where you would do about 260 max rank to 360 in the same time period. \n\nHer Q is the only one that was substancially nerfed, but its actual damage early is pretty much the same and late game is meh. I don't remember if that naturally scales per level, but it means she loses less by leveling w and still has burst and sustain damage.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ulquiorra995","date":"2014-11-28T17:23:37.031+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because unlike Yasuo who gets compensation buffs immediately after his win rate falls down, Sejuani does not make flashy enough plays to earn a pure buff without compensation nerfs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essorance","date":"2014-11-28T14:05:28.323+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol  new skins also bring along a nerf.... remember gatekeeper galio?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yandere Carry","date":"2014-11-28T04:23:11.086+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"That W looks pretty useless base damage-wise..... it does... 40 damage... over 6 seconds..... so... half of a lvl 1 auto attack... over 6 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"iRetribution","date":"2014-11-28T07:11:00.924+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get that a a % is being tossed on there, but it was already pretty weak.

But this is far closer to old Sejuani's damage output then new Sejuani, and remember, back when Sejuani was reworked, all the Sej fans were bitching about the reduction her in damage. Because it was visibly lower on her W and focused on her new E. Moreover they relied on a perfect AA reset use of Sejuani's W to keep her DPS up--and this is before the post rework patches gutted her damage repeatedly.\n\nE's damage isn't exactly nerfed as its CD is almost halved at max rank. Optimal DPS, with an AP build will be considerably higher, but even without, she'll be able to reliably apply damage more often and keep targets in a state of almost-permaslow.\n\nThe big thing to note here is her W's initial hit+AA reset being where her damage is rooted is natural for her jungling. She'll do more damage then she did before with a single ability. I.E. Her damage at rank one with W, at level one, assuming she took Health Quints and Health Yellows  and had at least 9 defense. (Which while not necessarily optimal, is something plenty of people do on Sej due to her passive armor buff. Moreover, starting with this extra bonus health favors her old W over her new one as its adding in a sizable chunk of bonus  health.)\n\nwould be 4+12% HP on initial hit (its hard to figure math properly here, but as an example, lets say she's using it on a level 1 Anivia, the lowest health champion in the game at 468 HP, worst case scenario for Damage against a champion. Her new damage from W would be 4+56.16 magic damage+a total of 40+32.4 damage. Or, 132 magic damage. This is versus her old W damage in the same low-level health stacking scenario being 141.\n\nMeaning, in the worst-case champ vs. Champ scenario, it is a nerf. In an average case, the %HP boost it into a buff, and in the jungle its a ~colossal~ buff to her first few camps.\n\nAs an example. Let's say Level 1 Sejuani starts Gromp for the poison armor. (she may also start Krugs, which is even more favorable as they have negative MR and high health both) her W will now chunk for 4+192 on the initial hit, +40+32 from her spin. Making her level 1 damage ~268~ from her W, vs. 132. Note: This is not single target damage. All additional damage, including the initial hit from her flail is AOE. The only portion of her W that is not AoE is the actual physical damage from her auto attack.\n\nThis means that her damage is straight up higher at level 1 in the jungle. It will also grow vastly in power as if she focuses W... As 12% total health scaling is huge.\n\n\nNote her E is a shift, though. But maybe its just me, but I value near permaslow over rare heavy slows. Moreover, its damage is honestly higher now as it ranks up. Its damage is lower, but its CD decreases with each moment damage is distanced from her old E. Its higher DPS (slightly) and lower burst.\n\nMoreover, I enjoy that Q isn't where your damage is located, this encourages Sejuani to use it as an escape--moreover, its value as CC is still present. Q was flat out nerfed. But she's up considerably in damage because of it. (The overall damage on Q is lower without the HP damage unless she's targeting like, Raptors or something, but her W has a much shorter CD (rank 1 CD is the same as rank 4 Q) and she can always, ALWAYS land her W AA after a Q (W can be activated mid jump and you can immediately auto on landing, so you can still get the burst-over-a-wall, actually its total damage is just higher now)\n\nTL;DR: Sejuani's DPS is considerably higher, her Q is not where much of her damage is, favoring its use as an escape. Her W outperforms her old in everything but extreme early game against extremely low health targets. Her W outperforms her old Q in its same role as its CD is considerably shorter. (more damage) and her E doesn't actually have a damage nerf as its CD decreases as its base damage doesn't grow as fast, leading to similar DPS, lower burst (higher overal damage with AP as well) She is gettin a near permaslow at higher levels, and the ability to constantly keep Liandri's burning.\n\nAKA: Buffs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jade harley BARK","date":"2014-11-28T04:50:51.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She doesn't need her late game buffed, which is what I'm guessing they're trying to do.
