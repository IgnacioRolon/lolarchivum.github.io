If Ren lost to Aatrox prior to the fury change, he was considered a garbage Ren. Renekton LIVES off of interacting with champions and if the enemy champ is melee, he gets to interact a LOT. The only melee champions that usually destroy Renekton are ones that have ungodly early games. This being Darius, Garen, and Yorick. Everyone else usually gets crapped on. There's also the fact that Renekton hasn't been popular in months now, so most have also forgotten how he even works. Well, I'll tell yah... He's a lane bully and beats the crap out of almost every melee because he out damages them, out sustains them, and out tanks them. Early on. I personally just faced a Ren in one of my last games and I went Akali. Needless to say, he built magic resist and even got ganks quite often from Pantheon and still lost incredibly hard because he still has his old weaknesses... he needs Fury to trade. If you can keep Ren from interacting with you, you win the lane. This Fury change made that weakness even more noticeable since he now HAS to hit you to gain his fury because his fury generation got halved against minions. If he can't Q you when you get near minions, then he can't do anything and can't get fed in lane. Not fed in lane? Not too much of a threat later on. I will admit that we lost that game that I beat that Renekton, but that was more or less the super fed Annie one shotting the entire team while our Brand and J4 ate max range Lux Q's. lol.","replies":[]}]}
