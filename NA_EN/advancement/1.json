And it really made me open my eyes about it. I have come across to the realization that critical chance is actually kind of bad for the game. It makes the game inconsistent and instead of fair balanced battles, its more of will you get lucky enough to get that crit to kill an enemy opposed to actual skill required. Lets say I am in a 1v1 battle adc and adc we both have the same items and the same critical chance but he ends up get one more crit then I do, ends up completely killing me due to that crit with no real skill involved in it I also could go all day with examples. The critical chance adds too much randomness in the game. But how would Riot replace it for ADCs to do a decent amount of damage and does Riot or the people even care is why I posted this here. I have a couple of suggestions such as nerfing armor or giving ADs more AD for less gold but I would think that champs such as Zed and talon would go off the roof in superiority.

It causes Rangers to be largely interchangeable with each other since *the* most important part of their kit is nothing more than a heap of items.\n\nThere are two ways to address this.  One would be to make Crit grant percentile damage bonus on auto-attacks.  This would closely mimic the system we have now, just without the variance.  And most importantly, without the 1% crit chance cheese.\n\nThe other would be to turn Whisper and Voidstaff into flat penetration items and then change 'Crit Chance' into 'Piercing'.  Basically, you would be buying percentile penetration for your auto-attacks so that Rangers can still quickly chew through hard targets without turning soft ones into a fine red mist.  This would effectively remove two layers of auto-attack damage amplification from the game (crit chance and crit damage) and allow Ranger kits to be buffed and diversified so that they're something healthier than 'hurdur rightclick and use your dash if someone gets close'.\n\nAnd I suspect both Ashe and Try would be able to keep their in-kit Crit chance.  Ashe's is the *opposite* of random and Try's would give him a neat tool that no one else has.","replies":[{"poster":"rinsujo","date":"2014-12-19T21:17:21.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ashe, Tryn, and as much as i hate it, possibly Critplank should be allowed to keep crit, just reworked - Like Jax and dodge.

He will still deal the same amount of damage on average.\n\nSame goes for Ashe and Tryn. Ashe gains a free 2x damage shot with her passive and Tryn builds bonus AA damage over time. \n\nThis is no different for Yasuo. 10% crit chance would equal to +20% AA damage (minus the % penalty).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Epilogue of Life","date":"2014-12-19T06:54:14.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"It should be changed so that if you have 33 percent, you WILL crit every three autos...instead of pure luck.

It adds a hail Mary kind of situation when they occur, and that can lead to fun times in games, because the unexpected just makes for something far more interesting than numbers against numbers. \nWith that being said, most other games with Critical Hit rarely have the capacity to jack it above 50%, and very rarely allow the stat to be increased by increments larger than 10% at a time, and that's usually considered high for the stat. With items in LoL increasing it by 20-25% at a time, and absurd champions *COUGH*YASUO*COUGH* who downright have a built in abuse of the stat, the stat will naturally feel toxic. This can easily be fixed by lowering how much crit is granted by items, or simply giving an overall cap limit to it, similar to how CDR has a cap. Characters like Ashe can keep their passive because a one shot crit isn't going to be game breaking. But characters stacking excess of 50%-60% crit and using it to deal massive damage with next to no retaliation are a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-12-19T13:21:01.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Critical Hits are not a broken mechanic, such is present in nearly every video game ever made involving attacks.\n\nThere´s a huge difference between Crit/RNG in a PvE-Environment and a competetive setting.
