When its not even my fault but i always log back in on time and it just treats me logging back into my account as dodging instead of just bringing me back to the q. Its really dumb and I want change.{{champion:121}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T03:55:19.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I cannot alter your LP, I can assist you in troubleshooting this issue. Disconnections or crashes during champ select or while sitting in queue are often caused by your client losing its connection to the game platform service entirely. I recommend checking out our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step in investigating this.\n\nLet me know if those steps resolved this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-10-09T22:08:04.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you Windows 10 user?
