In the 'Process' tab look for League of Legends entries, click on them, and then click 'End Task'.\n\nEDIT:\n\nYou may also be having an issue with Anti-Virus or Firewall settings. Some people have experienced the need to reset their firewall permissions with the new client. \n\nHere is a link; https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#section-windows\n\nAlso a video. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyJisyEQ248","replies":[{"poster":"BlackJesusKFC","date":"2017-04-25T22:27:57.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've done both and neither of them did anything. i also did a repair and it still doesnt work","replies":[{"poster":"Postal Twinkie","date":"2017-04-25T22:28:25.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BlackJesusKFC,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=9TBllF0l,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-04-25T22:27:57.211+0000)\n>\n> i&#x27;ve done both and neither of them did anything. i also did a repair and it still doesnt work\n\nCheck my Ninja Edit.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAnother edit for you; it may be worthwhile to completely remove the Firewall permissions you have in place now and replace them with fresh ones. \n","replies":[{"poster":"BlackJesusKFC","date":"2017-04-25T23:04:35.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"completely turned off my firewall and still couldnt connect","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
