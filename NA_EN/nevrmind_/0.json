This is a reason why the Leaverbuster system treats all disconnections equally, regardless of the reason the disconnection happens. It's also a reason why we cannot modify or remove any penalties related to Leaverbuster. \n\nI recommend working through our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to address your unstable connection so we can get you back on the rift quickly and effectively.

This is an outrage i have to wait 20 minutes for each games (5 games = 1 hour and 40 minutes) because i needed to use the washroom and i was going to get to my own lane 3 minutes late? and this away from the worst part where people bug splat have to re log and join back(takes more than 3 minutes) and get low priority again for a bug in your game. Why are others being punished for there being a bug? I'd like a response from a riot member","replies":[{"poster":"Kiting Riven","date":"2016-08-11T11:47:30.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"maybe make remake like 4 or 5 minutes, I don't know i just knowing 3 minutes to get to my own lane. isn't something i should get punished for like its my lane and 3 minute isn't alot","replies":[]}]}]}]}
