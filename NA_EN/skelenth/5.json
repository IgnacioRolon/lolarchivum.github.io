During early development Kassadin was actually known as Kassawin. After implementing the &quot;Winning&quot;-mechanic Riot had to change his name to prevent unintended sarcasm. Other champions affected by this change were Win Zhao and Win Fortune.\r\n2. Kassadins original design was actually a character Riot Ezreal created for a fanfiction taking place in Hirohiko Arakis &quot;JoJo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; manga-series. His appereance is still heavily influenced by the &quot;Stand&quot;-characters of that series.\r\n3. Kassadin&#039;s joke originated from his voice actor Adam Harrington, who remembered a time in his childhood, where he broke the one taboo: He tried to silence his mother.\r\n4. Kassadins ultimate inspired the time travelling author Steven Gould to write the novel &quot;Jumper&quot;, which later was adapted into a movie of rather mediocre quality.\r\nAn A for effort though.\r\n5. Kassadins Passive &quot;Void Stone&quot; is actually just a barnacle covered in bioluminescent algae as a diversion.\r\n6. Kassadins W &quot;Nether Blade&quot; is in no way related to the Nether known from the Sandbox Game &quot;Minecraft&quot;\r\n7. When Riot Ezreal was asked why Kassadin would have a low cooldown blink ability, he answered &quot;Because he can.&quot;\r\n8. Kassadin was updated in 2014 in Season 4&#039;s 4.4 patch, and thus his update is the only true beauty we need in this game.\r\n9. Festival Kassadin is mentor and father figure to Festival Queen Anivia.\r\n10. Cosmic Reaver Kassadin is him, after taking Bards role as celestial janitor. He changed the name, because he felt it would undermine his purpose.\r\n11.
