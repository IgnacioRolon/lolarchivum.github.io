If you read her lore, you know the thing that explains the reason a champion is the way they are, you'd know her tribe was mass murdered. Most likely that concept art showed what she would be like if she didn't regain hope and she just became scared of everything.","replies":[{"poster":"mirAcIe","date":"2018-12-17T19:54:19.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Trent,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=FtymrbnY,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-12-17T13:42:43.091+0000)\n>\n> I think they were exploring between making her super hostile and animal like or really hopeful and they just ended with hopeful.

Yes most, of their people were murdered by Noxus. That kinda how it be for them. A lot of champion's backstories aren't mass murder tho so idk what ur talkin about.","replies":[{"poster":"mirAcIe","date":"2018-12-18T10:34:06.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Trent,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=FtymrbnY,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2018-12-18T08:41:09.349+0000)\n>\n> There are a ton of champions that don&#x27;t have that background...

But it was used enough times to become a meme.","replies":[{"poster":"The Trent","date":"2018-12-19T08:08:19.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mirAcIe,realm=EUW,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=FtymrbnY,comment-id=00020000000000000000,timestamp=2018-12-18T10:34:06.113+0000)\n>\n> You must be fun at parties. &quot;Dark and mysterious past&quot; wasn&#x27;t *literally* every champion&#x27;s lore either.

The rest of them might have a dark past, but not mysterious at all. So if you're trying to make a joke by using that phrase, it's not a very good joke because it doesn't apply very well here.","replies":[{"poster":"mirAcIe","date":"2018-12-19T08:40:01.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Trent,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=FtymrbnY,comment-id=000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-12-19T08:08:19.396+0000)\n>\n> but literally like... 5 champions I can think of meet &quot;dark and mysterious past&quot; requirements.

Maybe you're unaware but \"dark and mysterious past\" has been a meme for a while. I didn't come up with it and it didn't require every champion to have that lore. Seems like now they decided to \"fix\" that issue by just saying that \"everyone they knew got murdered\". Much better lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2018-12-17T08:19:05.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL the last picture","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captainn Ginyu","date":"2018-12-17T17:30:10.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk i kinda liked the first picture stuff","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-12-17T01:35:12.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gross","replies":[]}]}
