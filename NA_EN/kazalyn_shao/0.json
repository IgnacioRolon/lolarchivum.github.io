Didn&#039;t even get a turret?  And that was after they barely eeked out a victory over TSM, which was a game they should have lost.  Cloud 9 used to be my big white hope for NA, but that is no longer.  They are a shadow of their former selves, which weren&#039;t even fully realized yet(and likely never will be), and incarnati0n doesn&#039;t add much to the team but a one trick pony that played poorly both games.\r\n\r\nGuess I&#039;ll have to throw my vote behind CLG again(for the first time in years).  At least Doublelift plays a champion that I love, Ashe.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-06-01T14:00:57.708+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Gotta love the Fair Weather fans.

They lost a shotcaller so Meteos/Lemon are needing to step up and that will take time which added with the time for synergy with Incarnati0n we are in for a bumpy road with C9.\n\nAlso, it should be mentioned that as the competition in NA rises, teams must adapt or get left behind, but adaptation isn't instant.

He hasnt performed that well in LCS, and if you catch him on stream, he gets beat down regularly by supposedly worse NA mids. He loses all the time. Like the casters said, even Hai is still higher then him. He looks like an average mid. He will just be there, have a good game here or there, whatever. I dont see him doing better then Bjerg, Pobelter, or Slooshi.\n\nHai was a great player; plagued by injuries. His mechanics were good, his champ pool wasn't. Then he started getting injuries and wrist problems, couldn't play, and his gameplay slowly deteriorated. I think the loss showed how much his shot-calling helped them. Hopefully, they get some semblance of it back, becuase at is stands Incarnation really isnt bringing anything to make up for it. He broke even in lane with Shiptur, someone who routinely loses lane but has great teamfights. Shiptur is not known as a strong laner, and he was in a bad matchup to boot, and still just broke even. Hell, Bjerg beat the breaks off him harder then Hai ever had them beat off him.\n\nAlso, Alex Ich was there, available. A far more clutch player, who proved he still had game left in him when he solo carried TDK into the LCS. Really a crime that so many teams have overlooked him. Huge champ pool, can play anything. Doesnt get stressed, just chill. Teams really should have looked into him.\n\nI believe the jury is still out on him.
