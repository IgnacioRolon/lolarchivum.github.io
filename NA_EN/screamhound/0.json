I've opened task manager and noticed that everything related to league just closes after I press it to.\r\n Any advice?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-17T22:18:28.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If nothing is happening after pressing Launch, then it's likely that a pc setting is blocking the client from opening.  You'll want to go through the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to restore that access.

I deleted any files associated with new client and launched Legacy client and it's working now. I'm not sure what the issue was but the new client definitely needs a lot of work.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-17T22:44:59.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Manually going in and deleting those files might end up causing you errors if you try and play a game, because they share game files.  You might want to run a repair and run the legacy client manually.\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nIf you have any feedback, let the [client devs ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion)know at the client discussion boards.  Thanks for testing!","replies":[{"poster":"Gloom Shroom","date":"2017-02-18T08:00:08.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want to use the legacy client and not even running from lol.launcher is working. I open lol.launcher and click launch and nothing happens. I check my task manager and see \"LoLPatcher.exe, LoLClient.exe, and LoLLauncer.exe\" but no League windows are open. I've reinstalled the game twice and repaired multiple times. I've also set \"leagueClientOptIn = no and leagueClientOptIn = yes\" and neither of those worked. \n\nI'm seriously at a loss here and don't know what to do. Usually one of these fixes would work but it's just not working. I really prefer the legacy client to the new client, and clicking \"Launch Legacy Client\" also leads to nothing happening except for it showing up in my task manager.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-18T16:36:09.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like Targons Blade helped you out with this, though it sucks to hear that the issue persists.
