Whenever there's a huge team fight with tons of spells, and hence audio overlay, the sound drops out or gets clipped and distorted. This causes my fps to drop to about 10, making it unplayable at key game moments.

Everytime i get into a teamfight my fps drops to 3, and my mac can run things really well but after testing stuff out i found out that it was the game itself and alot of times its not even the audio its just the fps dropping for no apparent reason and when i get that static of sounds then yeah it still does happen, and for me i have a special case with my gameplay sometimes where my screen will glitch out will all kinds of shapes and colors giving something like epilepsy, which is annoying and when all 3 things combined its just a nightmare, i cant even play easy champions like Yi without standing in the middle of a teamifght and just literally standing there as i soon die","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shajal","date":"2016-03-27T03:26:07.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happens to my Mac and my ping goes to 34 to 400 really quick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arraca","date":"2016-03-26T19:56:28.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres apparently a shortfix where if you turn off the sound, the lag stops happening.

I agree as well, it makes teamfights essentially unplayable. The sound glitch even occurs at red side blue buff for me. I hope they fix it soon cause i like playing with sound :/","replies":[]}]}
