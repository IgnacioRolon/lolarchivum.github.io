Also i think players deserve little bit more information of what the root cause was and how it was resolved as many of us went through 3+ weeks of painful game experience.  Having said that, thank you again for the great work and hopefully it is resolved for all other players in the future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nymtheraven","date":"2016-04-20T21:38:03.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, i do have an older computer.
