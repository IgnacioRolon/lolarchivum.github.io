He deliberately avoids showing us the two other chat logs. \n\nThis is also a permanent suspension, which means he has been punished a minimum of three times in the past without learning his lesson.","replies":[{"poster":"Tjennie","date":"2018-03-23T19:56:35.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"All true, but these games which I got my permaban for are NOT justifiable as evidence to permaban me.

We're not going to side with you unless you show us the entire chat log. We've been here a while, and we know the types of tricks people tend to pull. Nobody's willing to get hoodwinked, so either show your full log or accept that nobody who matters is going to side with you because you failed to produce the full evidence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frontline Fury","date":"2018-03-24T17:27:22.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tjennie,realm=EUW,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=URi4Ed7U,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-23T19:56:35.147+0000)\n>\n> All true, but these games which I got my permaban for are NOT justifiable as evidence to permaban me.

Reports don't stack, so you shouldn't be asking for help reporting someone anyways. Your one single report is all it takes to flag the game for review. Additional reports won't do anything to increase the likelihood or severity of a punishment.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2018-03-23T16:05:43.369+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you copy paste the text","replies":[{"poster":"Tjennie","date":"2018-03-23T19:55:19.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how","replies":[]}]}]}
