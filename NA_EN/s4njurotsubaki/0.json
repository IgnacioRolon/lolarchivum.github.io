I finally accepted the fremium model with the champ purchases... I can live with a grind where I can buy a champ every week or two.  but this change with the BE is pathetic.  For a company that has been around this long and is this big, there is not excuse to do something that is this detrimental to the player base.  \r\n\r\nJust to be clear: at this rate, it feels like it will take me a month to unlock a single hero.  I just did a grind when Nidalee was in the rotation because I decided I wanted to buy her.  1 week later I had enough IP and bought her.  If it happens again that there is a champ I would like to purchase outright for BE, ... I just don&#039;t realistically see that happening.  Like Kayn for 6300.  How in the hell am I ever going to save up that much BE at 750 per level?\r\n\r\nI have been playing with my stepson as an excuse to bond with him, and I was thinking we would be playing this game for at least months if not years, but if he and I will not be able to unlock any reasonable amount of champs over the course of that time then I&#039;m afraid I just cannot justify putting anymore energy into this game.  I will just get him solid on MOBA mechanics and then we will move to DOTA2 after a few months if this BE situation is not fixed.\r\n\r\nI think I will being going back to DOTA TYVM..... \r\n\r\n(P.S. the Champs / Heros in DOTA are free.  Skins and battle passes cost money, but are reasonable.  $10 for enough RP to buy a champ is INSANE.  Don&#039;t make the excuse that Riot needs the money folks, they are not hurting, their revenue in 2015 was something like 1.6 billion (Wikipedia))","replies":[]}
