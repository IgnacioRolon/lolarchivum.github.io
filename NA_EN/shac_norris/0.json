Maybe if the backstab was a crit it deals 200% damage and some new interesting effect (like bleed damage or flat damage or extra cdr on q or more interestingly gain an ap ratio or something so really weird hybrid crit builds could be a useful approach too).\n\nMaybe each natural crit combined with passive backstab should lower Shaco's Ult Cooldown by 5 seconds or something (more or less). This would only work against Champions.\n\nIf you've high CDR, 40 to 45%, I think you get about 1.65 to 1.8 seconds CD per backstab. At 4.8 to 5.4 seconds if you backstab as soon as you are able to 3 times, you'd have lowered the CD on the ult by 15 seconds. Crit builds could use some love on Shaco.\n\nThe lore excuse could be something like, \"With his enemies' back turned, Shaco locates and attacks their **MOST** vital areas (found with the additional help of the crit items, rather than standard vital areas he finds with the passive alone), feeding his treacherous lusts, thereby enhancing his senses in that instant, and enabling his most deceitful ability to be used with greater frequency.\"\n\nOnly thing about that is it makes you build crit. If they want to give Shaco many options for builds it's nice since it's not too strong, but gives you a benefit for going crit. You could go AP with no crit and get the benefits that gives to your damage, and box lifetime (how long it can go unused before dying). You could go damage + tank with no crit and have more presence in teamfights without blowing up. Or, you can take the somewhat risky route of being a squishy crit assassin who's able to Ult more frequently if he gets backstabs off on Champions a few times in a short period.\n\nI don't think it would be too strong since you'd be combining the passive and normal crits, without both happening at the same time it wouldn't proc the ult CD being lowered. Also the CD reduction would only proc against Champions.\n\nWith 70-100% crit this would be a fairly potent addition to his arsenal, but restricted to those who build crit, which is already considered a mostly weak avenue for Shaco at higher ELOs from what I've heard.\n\nWould be nice to get feedback from one of the Red Riot staff members on this.\nLove Shaco btw, eagerly awaiting next patch when the crit damage is fixed on his passive. :)\n\nP.S. - I tend to build Essence Reaver in my crit build, and just added 10% Scaling CDR blues (+9 scaling MR) to my runes, so by level 18 or late game (depending on how well I do and in what order I buy Essence Reaver and Infinity Edge) I'll have 40% CDR all of the time. I could opt for 45% as well if I wanted, though the Lethality/Magic Pen. mastery (Precision) might be superior.\n-\nP.P.S. Usual build before I replace items:\n{{item:3006}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3087}}, then either {{item:3031}} or{{item:3508}} first (with 10% scaling CDR blues for 40% CDR late game), then one of these depending on if I want to kill squishies or tanks,\n{{item:3036}} {{item:3033}} {{item:3147}} {{item:3078}}. By the time I get my 5th item I've 70% crit.\n-\nLate game I'll usually replace {{item:3006}} with {{item:3046}}, giving me 100% crit. Then if I don't need the waveclear for split pushing, but think fighting would be the best option, I might replace {{item:3074}} with {{item:3072}} for the extra effective sustain and overheal shield. If I don't care about extra sustain I could just get {{item:2140}} for my lifesteal and replace {{item:3074}} with anything else listed as one of the 6th item options.\n-\nIf I keep a lifesteal item then I've the choice to get {{item:2138}} or {{item:2139}}. With a lot of attack speed (say if I bought Trinity force on top of the crit AS items), {{item:2139}} gives you a constant extra 25 True Damage against towers, which could matter for sieging. Otherwise {{item:2138}} gives you the HP boost you might need along with the Tenacity to survive situations you otherwise might not, while your sustain item keeps you alive long enough to kill important/vulnerable targets. Of course, combining {{item:2140}} WITH a lifesteal item will give you higher sustain (and increases your crits a bit with the added AD from it), assuming you can stick close to your target to get constant autos off (without Tenacity), it depends on the situation. {{item:3078}} + {{item:2138}} would make it very easy to stick to most dashing ADCs, you could combine that with Stormraider's instead of Thunderlord's to be almost impossible to escape from.\n\nI'll end up with something like this if I don't replace anything:\n{{item:3006}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3508}} {{item:3036}}\n\nOr something like this in the late-late game if I replace items, and if I find the tanks are less relevant (I need to kill squishies at all costs) or there are no tanks:\n{{item:3046}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3508}} {{item:3147}} with {{item:2140}} \n\nAlso very good at taking down towers and will kill minions very fast, even without Hydra.\n\nYou just won't have any way of replenishing health on minions/jg camps before you start fighting the enemy team, since the lifesteal from {{item:2140}} only works against Champions.\n-","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bardful","date":"2016-11-28T04:23:32.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shouldn't crit shaco be rewarded at least a little for backstabbing.

At the moment it looks like AP is a bit stronger than AD, but some of the sample sizes are pretty small and Shaco numbers are themselves a bit weird --- he's a champion overwhelmingly favored by people who've mastered him, he's really sensitive to jungle changes, etc. We'll probably have some balance adjustments for him in the patch after 6.24, but it's hard to say their precise nature until we get clear data.","replies":[{"poster":"Gone Away","date":"2016-11-23T21:50:47.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right now he just seems so underwhelming if you're not playing him AP.
