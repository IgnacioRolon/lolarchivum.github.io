Idk though... i think LCS should at least start with a superweek. No mid-split super, no end-of-split super... but open up with one","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-03-18T13:37:12.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You understand you are asking for a 12+ hour engagement?\n\nWith the way they do the LCS broadcasting (which has a ton of filler), I have no doubt that this entire process, if a super week was introduced, would take five-ever.\n\nI think they need to trim the fat as is. I can understand an interview after that match. What I can't understand is pre-game analyst, post game analyst, 5 minutes of filler content between end of game and start of analyst. 3 minute break after analyst before pre-game analyst.\n\nIts all just tedious.","replies":[{"poster":"Whitakker","date":"2015-03-18T18:23:28.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I imagine they have that \"filler\" analysis as something to discuss while the teams leave/set up the stage, get their equipment set up (mice, keyboard, mics, etc.), make sure the network is running smoothly, and the like.  Seeing how often they still run into technical difficulties, I'd much rather listen to Preak and Jatt talk about whatever than watch two teams sit at monitors while Riot techs fix problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-03-18T18:39:43.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No I completely understand, but I still fill they have entirely too much of it. LCS teams do not bring their own computers, They bring in a keyboard and a mouse. They shouldn't need to check all of that every single match all day.\n\nJust watch closely (most of the time) after the post game interview the teams are already attaching peripherals and preparing to start. They then need 10 minutes from that point for Post previous game Pre next game analyst desk commentary, THEN 3-5 minute break before then shooting it back to the casters to talk before starting Picks and Bans. \n\nIf we compare this to LCK, They have Post Game interview with the MVP > 5 Minute Break > 2-3 minute discussion before the next match.\n\nEven when they have multiple matches to play there is no more than 5-10 minutes between games. LCS has double the amount of filler.\n\nWhich annoys me. Downvote all you want.","replies":[{"poster":"Whitakker","date":"2015-03-18T19:27:05.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No downvotes here, you have a valid argument to begin with.  I suppose one could chalk it up to the LCS desperately wanting to be the \"SportsCenter\" of eSports.  And while I'm sure you can draw a lot of parallels to what the analysts, commentators, and color casters do and what Phreak & Co. do, Riot seems to not quite understand that not all of their fanbase who watch LCS is appreciative of the SportsCenter model of sports entertainment.  Me personally, I enjoy it, as I'm a huge sports fan, and ESPN is the only thing on cable I still watch.  I guess others' mileage will vary.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
