I thought that it was being silly, because I played a Ranked match last night, but then I saw this tag.\r\n\r\nhttp://prntscr.com/d84ui2\r\n\r\nApparently the decay is for the Solo/Duo queue, but I cannot play because it isn't available so...Any ETA in the new queue or any word about the decay system being turned off or something?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-16T19:52:33.142+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're in the preseason, so inactivity or decay is actually disabled and nothing would happen.

Although I suppose I should submit it as a bug that the new launcher gives you a decay warning whereas the old launcher didn't, as in to avoid future confusion.","replies":[]}]}]}
