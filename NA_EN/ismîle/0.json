EVERY game was placing me against smurff (mostly korean / asian ) . always unfair game where we would get beat up back to back and im talking normal games not ranked . since ive reached platinum 4 i feel like im where i belong to . iam not bad at the game and im far from pro . so since i reached my *ranked goal* ive been playing league mostly for fun , playing normal game so i dont have to try hard and try new champ and build. but like i said , every game was HARDER than my ranked match . i understand that game cannot always be fair and its hard to place you versus opponent with the same skill level in normal but it became just not fun anymore . no one in my game where even speaking english . even got placed in a challenger vs optic academy game .... the fun was taking out of me . it lead me to become mad AT THE GAME ITSELF . not the player . just how unfair every match were and that i wasnt allowed to have fun in a game that i enjoy . always placed in matches that i wasnt belonging to . so i started taking out that rage on player . talking shit and tilting for about no to little reason . i dont know if a permaban can be lifted and honestly i feel like taking a break would just be fine to me but i still love this game . im level 224 , platinum 4 , spents a lot of money on skin and events and i feel like this bad behavior is just a receip of bad event mixed up with life struggle togheter that lead me to expel this on other player . if you read this and theres still a chance of turning the tides back i would be one happy summoners . i understand the rules and the reason of my ban . i understand that my game experience shouldnt lead me to ruin other player experience with the game and im sorry to those that were affected by it . \n- a yasuo main {{champion:157}}","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-04T05:47:04.580+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iSmîle,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=KKbT8Ne4,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-07-04T04:58:24.072+0000)\n>\n> i totally agree that ive been toxic alot more than usual in the past 6 months\n\nThis is why you are banned.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=iSmîle,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=KKbT8Ne4,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-07-04T04:58:24.072+0000)\n>\n> since a couple months the game seems to place me in games that i dont belong to .

You are not likely to be unbanned, as it was not because of **bad matchmaking**, it was because of your inability to follow the game's rules. What other people are doing is not an excuse for you to lose control and fly off the handle on your team.\n\nAdditionally, a permanent ban is the **very last** punishment - you had your chances to reform.","replies":[{"poster":"iSmîle","date":"2019-07-04T05:35:21.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"did you read or you just commented without reading ?","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-07-04T05:37:30.257+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, did you?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iSmîle","date":"2019-07-04T05:36:04.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i understand the rules and the reason of my ban . i understand that my game experience shouldnt lead me to ruin other player experience with the game","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2019-07-04T05:33:05.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The boards are not able to help you here, only riot support (contacted through a support ticket) can. As a tip, I would recommend not blaming matchmaking, it can make it seem like you feel the toxicity wasn't your fault/you don't have anything to reform. Be polite and explain your case and perhaps a bit on your goal of reforming, and the worst that can happen is they say no.","replies":[{"poster":"iSmîle","date":"2019-07-04T05:37:21.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"thanks for the tip and i did send them a ticket :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"wren620","date":"2019-07-04T05:23:51.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Although I do not support toxicity, I do understand how uncomfortable it is to play with 4 Chinese people who are literally typing Chinese in the chat. I think that the riot’s matchmaking system is sometimes very broken, and you just got the bad end of the stick. If you don’t get unbanned, i think taking a break is the right way to go, buy if you really want to, contact a riot support member. Hopefully they will help you.
