When would you be down to play? And of course your friend can play, too! :]\n\n{{summoner:3}} Sorry, I just read this as I played one game and now I feel like I messed up real bad. Can we play 1001 Dalmatians style and celebrate it anyways? I would understand if you said no because it was my fault for not reading, but I'm just curious because personally, I think if it were 1002, it wouldn't be as special as 1000 or 1001. \n\nUp to you of course if you're still able. If you are, it couldn't be tomorrow, May 5th, because I'm seeing Avengers with my sister, but maybe sometime this week. Of course, only if you want to do it, and if my friend plays, it would be his first game as a level 30. \n\nSorry for my ultimate tardiness and I would understand if the opportunity is gone because I'm not the only one to hit 1000. I promise not to play another SR game until a response within 2 weeks though!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-05T17:10:21.013+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, absolutely, we can still play! \n\nLemme add you and you can message me when you're around to play! :]","replies":[{"poster":"Chåd","date":"2015-05-05T18:38:14.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=kEHXAbGk,comment-id=000300010000,timestamp=2015-05-05T17:10:21.013+0000)\n>\n> Haha, absolutely, we can still play! \n> \n> Lemme add you and you can message me when you're around to play! :]\n\nAwesome!
