After several attempts I get a notification that it could be my video card drivers. Uninstalled and reinstalled drivers, restarted computer. Got in game at the 10 min mark. \r\n\r\nWe ended up beating the Teemoining. In the after game screen i get the leaver warning. I did everything in my power to connect to the game promptly - why would this cause me to get a warning for leaving the game? Yes i was absent from the game for the first half of it, but the reason for not being there was for something that i was unaware of.","replies":[{"poster":"Lew","date":"2016-10-29T21:26:31.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The warning always gets sent after the first time someone afks or leaves and the system doesn't take into account why it happened.","replies":[{"poster":"IBSwimmin","date":"2016-10-29T22:29:35.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was more wondering why I would get it even after i successfully joined the game and played.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-03T23:27:41.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because 10 minutes is a *significant* amount of time to be out of game and the message was just letting you know that if a trend of disconnections occurs, you could land in a low-priority queue for up to 5-matches at a time.\n\nCheck out our [Leaverbuster FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) for more information on how the system works.
