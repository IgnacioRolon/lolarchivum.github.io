It ONLY happens when I'm playing a game. I can do anything else on my computer, but LoL is the only thing that gives me trouble. So now, I can only play bot games, in fear that if I play a regular game, I will disconnect and get a leavers ban. It usually happens about 10 min into a game that my ping will begin to skyrocket and then cap out at 500ms, then the box that we all love \"Attempting to Reconnect\" starts popping up. Now, it doesn't just pop up once and be done with it. Noooo, this thing pops up, then goes away, then pops up again, then goes away again, over and over again until either the game is over, or I leave and get a ban. Now like I said earlier, I can play any other game on my pc, MMOs included, and not have this issue. Why dear God is this happening? Can anyone tell me why this happens and how to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-08T23:34:57.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League requires a constant connection, and it sounds like you might have a poor connection that can't hold against the flow of data.  My suggestion is to use the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tighten your connection specifically to our game servers.  That should get you squared away!","replies":[]}]}
