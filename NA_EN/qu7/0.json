Cos when I checked my laptop, there were 1 GB space, but that was not enough, so when I cleared more than 3 GB garbage data on my laptop and redownload the patch, it worked. And I checked the space again, 2.78 GB space were free. So it means I need at least 1.22 GB space or more.","replies":[{"poster":"Can We Give Up","date":"2017-08-05T15:00:02.640+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is so annoying, I can even play League Of Legends.
