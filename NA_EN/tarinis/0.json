You have to make the \"friendly\" aspect obvious.\n\nPro tip: Add raging text emoticons to whatever you type. Everyone pretty much knows that if you're GENUINELY pissed, you will NOT take the time to type a rage emoticon.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-02T03:12:28.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a moba: half the players are toxic, and half the players are grownups.\n\nWhich means half the players will get ticked over an insignificant loss and report based on totally inconsequential factors, and the other half will report because the first half have issues...\n\n... Which is why Rito has several report categories that are pretty much ignored in all tribunal cases. It's a quick and dirty way to funnel all the crap ragaholic reports into the trash can.\n\nEvery once in a while I receive an alert that I've been reported. Still no bans. I don't think too much about it. Meh, some of them might have been SLIGHTLY legitimate, in that I can get a little bit snippy with people who are too assertive about how to play. But I don't throw around blatant insults, and that's probably why I stay in the green.\n\nBut that, in effect, is why there are reports practically every game. And yes, it's sad... I've stopped thinking about it so much in game. I just play. So it doesn't bother me enough to leave LoL.","replies":[]}]}
