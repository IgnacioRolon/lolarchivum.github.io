You have less dmg, no poke, youre not tanky as other top tanks are. Also they nerfed his W dmg and range so you cant rly trade. Especially against something ranged or like camille. You are full tank with no much of a dmg so youre just a cc bot for your team and it gets boring. Zac is on the other hand good when your jg helps you but he has to babysit you - good for duoQ maybe..low elo. Then you can be useful. \nAnd jg- he cant rly 1v1 enemy jg cause (as mentioned earlier) he hasnt got dmg. In crab meta when its all about contesting those green thingis ... not rly good champion. His clear is fine tho, but hes very weak early and enemy jg can invade you whenever he want and you cant do anything about it. His winrate also dropped on 45% i think. I still play him on top mostly now, cause i dont want to learn best jg pathing-takes so much time. I guess you can do this on my rank (silver) but even there its bad and i have to try really hard to do something :D Most of solo kills come from enemies mistakes or outplaying dives (with passive lol)\nAlso old R was much more fun than new one. New one can be gamechanger, but also a game destroyer. Its a good ability but does anyone rly enjoy it? Maybe first succesful ultimates when you lock whole enemy team but then you realize youre still a cc bot. You can play leona instead and be more usefull to the team. But the old R? Who wouldnt bounce around rift and take kills?  It wwas like best ultimate in whole gam for me and thats why i started to main the blobber.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-11-20T08:55:59.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's an odd thing to think, but have you considered taking him mid?\n\nif his matchups are bad top for those reasons, perhaps he should use his durability  and sustain to his advantage in another lane\n\nwith lots of crowd control and decent burst, if you can solve the wave-clear problem, he'd be a decent match against a lot of the mid meta","replies":[{"poster":"ListeRo","date":"2018-11-20T12:15:07.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried to google zac mid but all i found was some guide on mobafire :D But it could work against something, i wouldnt go for blind first pick tho :D I dont know if this could work. Especially in low elo where i belong, where meta doesnt rly exist so you can get anything on mid against you. And i think that ranged mage mid will destroy him.. i dont know tho.
