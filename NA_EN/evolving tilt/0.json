OP OP OP\n\nCheck on op.gg, where it shows win rates of champs if you don't belive..","replies":[{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2017-10-27T21:03:23.465+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Winrate is a factor, but not the deciding factor when it comes to balancing champions.\n\nI certainly am not advocating that twitch be thrown into the dumpster, but his combination of stealth + AS buff + high VERY fast AoE team damage could stand to be lowered slightly.","replies":[{"poster":"pro rusher 2","date":"2017-10-28T13:49:05.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"So u are fine that mf does more dps with her ult and enemy team doesnt have to be put in stright line, for her to be able to destroy whole team, and she also has higher win rate.","replies":[{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2017-10-28T16:52:39.792+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, because she generally must be visible to get into position and not be cc'd at ALL during her ult to put out that kind of damage. She also has the kind of ult that synergizes well with ally CC. Twitch does as well, but I would argue that ally CC is less important for Twitch, he can generally level a team by himself and with unique first-target access that his stealth allows for.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
