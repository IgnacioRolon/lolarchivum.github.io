I am here to propose some ideas to get him out of that oppressive state and into a place that is more challenging and interactive for the player and those who play against him. I am not a Teemo main, but I do enjoy playing him and recently, after a lot of games of not playing him, I came up with an idea to not have him in a polarizing state of either yordle whipping boy or Toxic Deathspawn.\n\nWith the recent assassin changes and vanguard updates, Teemo has been in a position where bursting him down in either top or mid lane is relatively easy. His range is laughable compared to other marksmen, so ADC Teemo is hard to make viable. Support Teemo is a pretty much a troll pick. I believe that the Jungle is where Teemo belongs and to me it makes sense from a lore perspective. So I give you Teemo, the Yordle Commando!!\n\nPassive = Survival Instincts: In the jungle Teemo gets increased movement speed based on his current level. In brush Teemo, gains attack speed based on his movement speed. \n\nQ = Noxious Trap: Teemo throws a trap that does poison damage (AP scaling will be less than with his previous Ult) and applies 2 stacks of Jungle Fever. If it makes contact (or close enough, similar to a Syndra ball toss) with an enemy it triggers immediately, greatly slowing them down for 2 seconds with a low AP damage. If the trap is not immediately detonated by a champion within 1 second, it will arm it self and turn invisible. The slow is decreased and damage is increased when the trap is armed. Armed Traps last for 3 minutes and only 10 traps can be on the map at a time, they also provide limited vision. Teemo can store up to 2 charges of traps at once. 3 second cooldown in-between stored charges{The skillshot slow is useful for ganking}\n\nW = Invisible Predator: Teemo after a short delay turns invisible for 2 seconds and gains movement speed for 4 seconds. Attacking breaks invisibility, but the movement speed is kept {Long Cool down: used for ganking, disengage, and seeting up Ult}\n\n\nE = Kumungu Toxin: Teemo applies poison to his auto attacks (AP scaling should be weaker than current scaling). \nPASSIVE: Jungle Fever:  Every auto attack that hits an enemy applies 1 stack of Jungle Fever. At 7 stacks the enemy is nearsighted for 2 seconds and some percentage health damage is done (low). An enemy recently Jungle Fevered cannot be Jungle Fevered for a short duration of time. Certain abilities can apply stacks of Jungle Fever. Jungle Monsters take 3 stacks for a Fever to occur. {useful for clearing jungle, needs 7 stacks for an effect so counterplay is to disengage for stacks to reset}\n\nR = Toxic Cloud: Teemo takes 2 seconds to prime an explosion of his stored poison. After priming, the area around Teemo is covered with a small cloud of poison (AP Scaling). Enemies within the AOE are blinded and slowed for 2 seconds. 1 stack of Jungle Fever is applied.\n\nA full level 6 Teemo gank would look like: Use W to get close, throw out the trap for the slow, AA, AA, ult for the blind and slow, finish the stacks with AA\n\nI know any Teemo related subject will generate toxicity from the community but hopefully with the added elements to this proposed Teemo rework, Riot can find many way to tune him to a viable/less troll state. Any additional comments are more than welcome!","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-05-02T22:07:48.722+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Gonna admit, my main reason for voting yes was how funny you made the vote phrase instead of the valid reason that your rework seems cool and could add some much needed balance to the hatespawn that is teemo.","replies":[{"poster":"K1ng1nTh3N0rth","date":"2017-05-02T22:37:39.306+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Haha Thanks!

Squishy and needs to kite camps. Although, Nidalee can chuck a spear and deal half your health, Teemo has to get close to you for that. Not the best tactic for a squishy champ. I believe that he is built using bloodrazor out of Jungle and with no gap closers it is hard for him to get to AA range. Even when in range, he doesn't have any reliable CC so escaping is easy. But since Teemo doesn't build health or have Lifesteal that early, he can just run up to gank and get engaged on immediately. He works sometimes, but not as well as other junglers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2017-05-03T05:36:06.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Invisibility for only 2 seconds?

He'll have an ambient, aoe damage blind for an ult and his Q is a skillshot slow. Looks like he'll run people down because his passive gives MS and his W also gives  MS so he'll sit in bushes and jump people but he'll also be tanky and fast with a blind ult so fighting back would be difficult. Sounds like a tank that is best in jungle and wants a little attack speed, like Shyvanna.","replies":[{"poster":"K1ng1nTh3N0rth","date":"2017-05-02T21:56:22.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I did think that jumping someone in the jungle would be OP with this kit, so i wanted his damage to be low to mid. The thought of building him tanky did not occur to me since in order to get in the middle of a teamfight and ult, Flash and his W could be used to escape/engage. Although an invisible tank would be awesome!! Good thinking.\n\nTo me his ult is more like a Ziggs ult but less bursty and more DoT, not to mention the soft CC.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2017-05-03T06:35:36.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"hes shit. and he needs a rework. hes a meme and they know it themselves. and I think they said hes not a serious champion or w/e.\n\ntbh if you're playing against a decent jungler. you will never do much as teemo. I know people get to masters and challenger on teemo but simply you're playing against people that can make mistakes. ideally teemo is useless. hes just a shitty kennen .","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheWhitterMatter","date":"2017-07-26T03:29:45.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know this was probably late but I have to say, this doesn't seem too shabby. I was a teemo main once, but when the nerfs kicked him in the ass and he passively grew weaker as tankier items became available. He is just never how he used to be and it makes me very sad. I have to upvote this as I am currently a jungle main. This really has a lot of what I like about teemo. The only think I don't like is he can't go invis while standing still here, also getting 7 stacks on an enemy seems like it might be difficult, but I can see how it might sneak up on the enemy in a dual. He will get buttslapped even more by assassins as well since the blind won't kick in until a 2-3 seconds if he lands everything. I can also see this taking while a bit of skill, something that most teemo players don't need.","replies":[{"poster":"K1ng1nTh3N0rth","date":"2017-08-04T00:28:24.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheWhitterMatter,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wNQuG6gK,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2017-07-26T03:29:45.462+0000)\n>\n> I know this was probably late but I have to say, this doesn&#x27;t seem too shabby.

That flexibility makes him weak since he doesn't have very clear advantages aside from tank shredding. So yes, those darn items (Adaptive Helm I'm looking at you) are really sinking Teemo's viability.\n\nThe way that I envisioned this rework was to build him AP/Health Items. I wanted an Urgot like character (AD/Health Bruiser) but instead of AD, an emphasis on AP. The poison damage is decreased but maybe the on-hit magic damage can be increased to fit this mold. Assassin's would have trouble bursting him then due to the health. Maybe at 7 stacks the enemy can be Grounded as well as Nearsighted, that would really hurt mobile characters like Ahri. More risk for them since they thrive on quick skirmishes and without escape abilities it will be tough for them. Besides, Assassin's are more ability based than AA based, blind is only good for AA.\n\nI wanted to promote active game play rather than wait-and-see tactics. Not a lot of champions are like that, and I believe Riot wants to make a more active game. The invisibility standing is nice but I feel it doesn't promote team fighting. Teemo, with this kit would have a good amount of utility, good for team fights.\n\nP.S. It is never too late to respond. I'm going to nurse this thread 'till retirement.","replies":[{"poster":"TheWhitterMatter","date":"2017-09-30T07:59:59.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I took a look at the brand new runes, and I saw that there are many new benefits teemo can gain from the precision tree as a primary and maybe sorc as a secondary. He can gain that attack speed he needs and will be able to take enemies out decently early. I played a few games with the first keystone (basically endless buffed ferver) and discovered that all of teemo's damage can be buffed significantly during a fight, so that in the end, a basic and ignite can really finish off early targets, and at a faster rate. This doesn't increase ignites damage, because that would be op. \n    Yes Teemo can be itemized basically anyway you want and I agree that is his downfall. In a team fight he pretty much brings his blind, (if he gets close enough to a good target) he has a mushroom or two (does damage only is someone steps on them), and he is a fast little shit. In all honesty that's not much even compared to Yi, who does more damage, heals himself/reduced incoming damage, is very fast and avoids slows in ult, and has his Q to deal damage/avoid abilities. He has all that to a fight and teemo has a few things, while the rest is better suited for duels and laning. It's unfortunate because I believe he should be able to bring more to the table besides throwing shrooms around and winning a number of duels. It probably sounds like I'm making teemo less than he is, but this is kinda the truth. \n     He doesn't have as much character personality as lets say the reworked Ryze or any of the new champions. He doesn't have this neat stacking system that you mentioned here, or this blinding cloud from shrooms or whatever it was from. Those kinds of thinks are useful and serve as an identity. Teemo is basically a lesser ranged Yi with mushrooms for an ult and no true damage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-05-03T05:21:38.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Looks fairly good, but I'd change the ult so that he can throw it or something, otherwise it either needs a massive aoe or he has to be super close to the enemy.","replies":[]}]}
