Assuming we swap them out with SKT and put SKT before Immortals, they would still be ranked in the top 10. \nDeep down I feel that the Immortals are getting a raw deal and should be allowed to participate at worlds. I&#039;m in no way excusing how inconsistently they played all year, I&#039;m just saying I really feel bad for them. Maybe they can use this as motivation in the off season to come back stronger next year.","replies":[{"poster":"177A Bleecker St","date":"2016-09-10T16:35:24.627+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"i mean c9 is better tho they beat them twice in a best of 3, does that make c9 top 5?","replies":[{"poster":"ShiishKabob","date":"2016-09-10T16:50:49.192+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you that C9 is better.

I know they worked on season 2 since before the summer split, but you would think that they would have backup players that they filmed as well to make sure they had players attending Worlds in the series.
