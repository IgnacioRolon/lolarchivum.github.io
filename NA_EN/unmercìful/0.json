I have already submitted a ticket to try and find out why my account my suspended but I still found it odd that I didn't receive an email...I start trying to figure out why I didn't get an email and I go check my account settings and realize that my email has been changed...I try and change my email back to my original email but it says a passcode was sent to the email to confirm the email change. Clearly I won't be able to get that passcode because I have no access to the email thats currently linked to my account. My question now becomes, if there is a passcode necessary to change the email then how was it changed? I checked my email account for all previous LoL emails and there isn't a single one asking for a passcode to confirm an email change.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-09T21:12:20.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We applied a security lock on the account to protect it from unusual activity.
