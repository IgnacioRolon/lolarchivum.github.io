Top lane can have basically anything - tanks, bruisers, some mages and sometimes assassins and marksmen. Jungle can have tanks, bruisers, assassins, sometimes mages. Support can be a mage, a tank or an enchanter. But alongside the support, there has to be an ADC bot lane. It's rare that you can afford to bring a mage in the ADC's place, and if by some miracle a champion of another class shows up there and isn't a trollpick, it's getting nerfed out of there soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2020-02-28T15:50:31.326+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"That's because ADCs have been force to *only* go to that position. **Four** ADCs see meaningful play in other roles.

ADC is the only role that has been required for pretty much most of League's existence.\n\nThe topic is about being \"Overpowered\", not what some people without experience _feel_ the role is like. The Supp/ADC dynamic is not always the best for either party. You could just play those 30 Solo Queue games I challenged the other person, but I'll try to break it down:\n\n- Unlike any of the solo lanes or the Jungle, we Bot laners (I mean both ADC and Supp) have to deal with a new lane partner every game. We don't know how the other person plays, we don't know if they like playing aggro or safe, and we depend on each other to make the lane work. Very often, either of us will make a mistake, and that hurts us both. When a solo lane dies, the only person affected directly is them. In the Bot lane, if your Support dies you're probably gonna be zoned out from your CS for the next 30 seconds at least, and that hurts like you have no idea. If you are a Support and your ADC dies, the best you can do probably is to roam and try to help the Jungle invade, get a drake or maybe Mid. This usually means you lose on XP and you're giving up plates to the enemy, and your ADC probably isn't gonna be able to trade anymore with them.\n\n- Bot XP has been hit hard, and it usually results on both ADC and Supp being behind solo lanes by quite a wide margin. Levels are incredibly powerful in League right now. If you're two levels behind a solo lane as an ADC, it doesn't matter if you're mildly fed. If the solo lane plays a duel or fight properly, they will take you out.\n\n- Playing fights as ADC is hard. You think Uzi or DL being called some of the best mechanical players in their regions comes from nowhere? You need to position properly, and unless you have a good frontline, it's hard as balls to not get blown away if the enemy assassin or fighter is fed. If the enemy has a bunch of gap closers, you'll often have to blow re-positioning spells, which can feel very rewarding and is a form of skill expression (Trist Jump, Xayah Ult, Vayne stealth, Kai Ult, etc.). Everyone who doesn't play ADC seems to always complain about the role being broken, but rarely (if ever) have I seen any of you take up the challenge of playing a bunch of Solo Queue ADC games. it's hard, specially compared to Tanks.\n\nI am **NOT** trying to insult you or offend you, but I seriously believe if you're gonna talk about a role, you need to get out there and actually play the role. You don't have ADC games other than a couple odd ones with Jhin, and those are normal matches, and they didn't go particularly well for you as far as KDA is concerned, which makes me question your positioning. And again: I don't intend to offend you and I'm sorry if I come across like that, it's just somewhat infuriating when people who don't even play bot (Be it ADC or Supp) think they know how it works just from their roles from elsewhere in the map.\n\nLook, I promise I'm not trying to be confrontational for the sake of it:\nhttps://imgur.com/k0XcElK.png[]\n\nI've been playing a bunch of Tank games and having quite a blast to be honest, specially with Galio. Fights are nowhere near as hard to execute as when I play ADC, and I just love going in, being a strong wall for my carries (AP or AD or the fed Irelia), taunting people, peeling for them, and it's just a bunch of fun! I just want to have experience next time someone tells me _\"This class is whatever\"_. For instance, you'll rarely if ever see me talking about Top lane because I'm shit at that role. I have no idea how to properly play any Top laner, other than building HP on Cho or Poppy, losing lane and hope I can do as a Top Tank what I do as a Jungle (or Mid ~~Galio~~) Tank. When people say _\"Top is in a horrible state\"_, you won't see me going around talking about Top like I know what's up as an ADC main, because I have no idea.\n\nExperience is key to formulating a stronger opinion. So my friend, that's my challenge: Go play a bunch of Solo Queue ADC games and comeback to me with your new experiences.","replies":[{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2020-02-29T02:48:57.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yordle Xayah,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YbvQeLUs,comment-id=0000000500000001,timestamp=2020-02-29T02:26:55.236+0000)\n>\n> The topic is about being \"Overpowered\", not what some people without experience _feel_ the role is like.

Levels are incredibly powerful in League right now. If you're two levels behind a solo lane as an ADC, it doesn't matter if you're mildly fed. If the solo lane plays a duel or fight properly, they will take you out.\n> \n> - Playing fights as both ADC is incredibly hard. You need to position properly, and unless you have a good frontline, it's hard as balls to not get blown away if the enemy assassin or fighter is fed. If the enemy has a bunch of gap closers, you'll often have to blow re-positioning spells, which can feel very rewarding and is a form of skill expression (Trist Jump, Xayah Ult, Vayne stealth, Kai Ult, etc.). Everyone who doesn't play ADC seems to always complain about the role being broken, but rarely (if ever) have I seen any of you take up the challenge of playing a bunch of Solo Queue ADC games. it's hard, specially compared to Tanks.\n> \n> I am **NOT** trying to insult you or offend you, but I seriously believe if you're gonna talk about a role, you need to get out there and actually play the role. You don't have ADC games other than a couple odd ones with Jhin, and those are normal matches, and they didn't go particularly well for you as far as KDA is concerned, which makes me question your positioning. And again: I don't intend to offend you and I'm sorry if I come across like that, it's just somewhat infuriating when people who don't even play bot (Be it ADC or Supp) think they know how it works just from their roles from elsewhere in the map.\n> \n> Look, I promise I'm not trying to be confrontational for the sake of it:\n> https://imgur.com/k0XcElK.png[]\n> \n> I've been playing a bunch of Tank games and having quite a blast to be honest, specially with Galio. Fights are nowhere near as hard to execute as when I play ADC, and I just love going in, being a strong wall for my carries, taunting people, peeling for them, and it's just a bunch of fun! I just want to have experience next time someone tells me _\"This class is whatever\"_. For instance, you'll rarely if ever see me talking about Top lane because I'm shit at that role. I have no idea how to properly play any Top laner, other than building HP on Cho or Poppy, losing lane and hope I can do as a Top Tank what I do as a Jungle (or Mid ~~Galio~~) Tank. When people say _\"Top is in a horrible state\"_, you won't see me going around talking about Top like I know what's up as an ADC main, because I have no idea.\n> \n> Experience is key to formulating a stronger opinion. So my friend, that's my challenge: Go play a bunch of Solo Queue ADC games and comeback to me with your new experiences.\n\nI've played plenty of ADC games in the past(It's not like I only came here this season, but ADC is stale, and I prefer my Katarina as I never get bored of playing her), and yes, I'm not the best at the ADC role, but like you pointed out in those games, I didn't do well, but I still ended up winning. And guess what? That's because my support helped me early on, I got some farm, and eventually started scaling. Didn't get a lot of kills, but my Ws and ult helped get a lot of picks later on by using them from long range and softening them up in the fights early on, where the teamfights later caused them to die, and despite sucking so hard early on, I eventually started doing a lot of damage once I got my items. Had that game lasted any longer, I would have gotten plenty of kills. I got 4 manned pretty often though and my team was able to take care of that by pushing. But I would have been much worse off if I didn't have a support(even if the support wasn't great and was kind of a not so fun person to play with). Let's also not forget that the enemy ADC was a Senna, because Riot loves making newer OP ADCs that can go so far as to even HEAL themselves now. How about you look at that Jhin game from the OTHER ADC's side? She had 19 kills, 5 deaths, and 18 assists. Her support had kills as well as a high number of assists. Remember that there are always two ADCs in one game at the very least, so one will always shine hard while the other doesn't shine very much at all. I don't play ADC as much because I like my off meta games, and you can't REALLY go that off meta with an ADC. They're all very standardized, except Ezreal. They killed off AP Miss Fortune too.\n\nYes, ADC is hard, but that doesn't make it weak. You have to deal with a new support every game, but that doesn't mean the support 95% of the time isn't trying to get YOU a lead.\n\nBot lane is the focus of every game. Junglers constantly gank bot lane, bot laners always try their hardest to farm for the late game, and who ends up doing the most damage by the late game? ADCs. The game doesn't focus as hard on ANY OTHER ROLE IN THE GAME, so yes, I would say ADCs are overpowered. Not saying they need nerfs specifically(Senna definitely does), but some changes to not make right clicking so prominent would be nice. Ezreal, Jhin, Kai'Sa, and MF are the most popular ADCs for a reason. The only one who is popular that only really right clicks is Vayne.","replies":[{"poster":"Yordle Xayah","date":"2020-02-29T03:18:49.421+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I've played plenty of ADC games in the past\n\nIf I can't see them I can't trust you have.\n\n> I didn't do well, but I still ended up winning\n\nYou did less damage than Lux that game. Your support didn't \"Help\" you. All she did was kinda prove how irrelevant you as an ADC were that game. It's not even about kills, but how little you contributed to much of anything. And _\"If the game went longer\"_? Well, if I was Master I may try for Academy or something? I don't care too much about \"If\" but what actually happened.\n\n> Let's also not forget that the enemy ADC was a Senna\n\nSenna is a single character. You don't say _\"Top Fighters are the most overpowered thing ever because Sett exists\"_ that's not how that works.\n\n> Yes, ADC is hard, but that doesn't make it weak\n\nThis thread is about **The most overpowered thing in the game**. Not about roles being mildly stronger depending on circumstances.\n\n> Bot lane is the focus of every game.

I agree wholeheartedly that its insanely frustrating because people in other lanes don't seem to realize that the game revolves around and has revolved around Dragon, not bot lane, for literal seasons. Its not like ADCs like it or enjoy it; no one likes having two extra people in their lane tower diving them constantly. Its not fun or enjoyable. :/ There's a reason I almost never play anymore and its purely because the role I enjoy sucks ass to play and they're determined to continue keeping all of the champions in it as awful as possible. \n\nJust move dragon, for the love of god.
