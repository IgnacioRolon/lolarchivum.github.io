All of it was still there and saved but when I pop into game I don't have a keystone. I thought that's weird. We lost that game so I went into another one, same thing happened. I thought my Keystone was messed up but i went onto lolnexus.com and found out my masteries wasn't their and it said 0/0/0. So i thought this was a bug until i go back the the home screen and try to look at my masteries.... still there. So my problem is why isn't my masteries taking action in game but it shows it at home or in champ select?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-04T23:29:36.056+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like one or more of your mastery pages are corrupt.
