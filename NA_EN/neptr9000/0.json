Had a jhin who i supported, started inting and even threatned to int after nasus inted. Had a riven top who fed enemy kled. So after game yasuo and all of enemy team agreed to reporting all 3 of these inters but the servers went down disconnected pretty sure none of us were able to report any of these toxic players. So how can i report these players. They should get suspended like when i got suspended punishment should be fair for all of us. 3 summoners who inted If u see them in game report them","replies":[{"poster":"Xypher","date":"2016-09-18T05:20:30.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DId they actually admit to intentionally feeding or were actively trolling? Or were they just having the disconnect /  ping spike issue with the server?","replies":[{"poster":"neptr9000","date":"2016-09-18T17:50:36.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The riven was obviously inting cuz she kept going into the tower. The jhin admitted to feeding he even said to the nasus if he comes bot one more time he will feed, which he decided to feed. The nasus 2 minutes into the game went bot lane and ran into bot tower gave vayne a kill. So I think they were just inting","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-09-18T08:08:31.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remove the summoner names from here before the thread gets deleted for name and shaming.\n\nPut them into a support ticket if you feel the need, but if they keep doing that they will get banned without your help anyway.\n\nEdit: also assuming that they were int feeding","replies":[]}]}
