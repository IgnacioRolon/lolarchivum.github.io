From new patch which is 6.24 im lagging for no reason. Having 59 ping and 250 fps. It looks like im teleporting from one to place to another (more often when i use spells).

That post is pretty old, but  it does seem to be referencing network issues like packet loss.  Running a log reader instead was helpful, and it looks like you've got some sporadic loss of data in your games.  \n\nAre you running on wi-fi?  Either your local network is having problems holding steady, or your ISP could be taking a long way to route to the game server.

Shouldn't be lagging at all. Oh and this is the first time i've felt the need to post on the forums in 6 years of playing this game....if that tells you how put out i am :D\n\nTried: repairing, rebooting PC, rebooting router, updating GFX software.....all to no avail\n\nTL;DR:\n\nSeason 7 update causing GFX problems. Screen lag when casting abilities / moving. Causing champs and minions to jump around the screen. Extremely disorienting in team fights.","replies":[]}]}
