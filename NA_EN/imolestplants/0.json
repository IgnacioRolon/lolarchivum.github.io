My first one was for asking to report someone who was walking down mid and feeding. Now, I get chat restricted for telling a Chinese troll, to go back to his own region. I&#039;m not saying I shouldnt be chat restricted but im saying these punishments are terrible. \r\nBefore my first ban I was honor 4 and probably about to be honor 5 then i got banned for asking people to report (i report everyone who ask for reports ever since my banned and those people arent being banned, riot told me, that people who ask for reports are always punished)\r\n\r\nI got honor 1, 3 months ago and I was 2/3 checkpoints to honor 2, now im reset back to honor 0. You shouldn&#039;t lose your honor unless you are saying shit every match and being toxic as hell. For the last 4 months, I have probably been nice 95% of the time, That is out of a shit ton of matches. It&#039;s just crazy that I have to go through another 4 months before im even close to honor 2, I might as well just being a toxic player because I see toxic people almost every game have honor 3/4/5s and they dont seem to be punished. Either fix the punishments or dont give them out at all. \r\n\r\n\r\nBasically what I am saying is that this system is trash and I see tons of toxic people being toxic, I report them and get no messages of their ban, I can&#039;t be 100% nice person all the time in such a toxic community like this. I get a chat restriction after having one 4 months ago for asking for a report and its stupid. \r\n\r\nIf Riot post what I said in chat, make sure you (riot) post what the troll was saying so it has context.","replies":[{"poster":"Jikker","date":"2018-02-16T15:57:43.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nThis Board is for serious reports of in game bugs, not for discussing the chat restriction and honor systems.

More than likely your issue wasn't the 1 game that triggered your punishment but several since when you get a reform card it almost always has the most recent game that was used to punish you in it. What you can do is ask support nicely mind you for all the reform cards that were part of your most recent punishment.\n\n\nPerhaps there's something you don't remember and this might help jog your memory of what happened. Just remember it doesn't matter what that troll does since oftentimes they want you to respond. If you cross a certain line(s) you're going to get punished. That troll almost always gets punished as well, either sooner or later yet you sadly don't get to see the satisfaction of them getting nailed. \n\n\nThat is unless they come here and post about it and say they were unfairly punished whereas you said you deserve the punishment just not the severity.  What usually happens is they inflame the forum until a Rioters comes in and posts the reason they got punished. They turn around and change their tune and say what they did was ok racism, death threats, rape, cancer on family, murder etc. \n\n\nYou've at least made progress in realizing you made mistakes and deserved the punishment and are coming to grips with how hard it's going to be to get back what you lost. However since you've realized you were wrong it'll make it easier going forward hopefully to change your behavior and not respond to trolls or someone just having that bad day we all have.\n\n\nLike I said rebind your chat key and don't say you're on a chat restriction, just say in champ select you don't talk much and instead like to use smart pings. If someone starts flaming you ignore them or mute them but don't say it in chat. simply go about your own business and play your role. You can also earn all that honor back by playing more games but remembering to take plenty of breaks, especially if you get on a losing streak or are getting frustrated.\n\n\nDo what I do and curse at your monitor, although avoid hitting your desk as that gets painful and breaking mouse/keyboard gets expensive.

I've ton nothing wrong since, and i gained no honor, I was honor 1 and 2 / 3 checkpoints from making it to honor 2, You have no motovation to not be a troll/toxic/etc... after you get punished once because it takes too much time, to get honor 2. It takes 6 or more months to go from being honor 0 to get honor 2, which is unacceptable.     \n\nIm assuming this because I was honor 0, took me about 15 - 20 days, to get honor 1, 2 months into my ban, I got check point one, just last week, i got checkpoint 2. It's stupid, the system is bad. You can get banned for something so little, even if your not a toxic player and be punished for so long. Im not insulting those who respond to me, im not going to treat people with respect who clearly think little of me. I wont say anything snarky or rude to you because you actually responded in a nice way, not straight attacking me and trying belittle my words. \n\nTrust me, you will be muted unfairly one day, Imma support main, Ive been playing since 2012, at first was toxic and trolly then again I was 12. I have been nothing but kind in matches to people, only time im not kind is when someone is trolling. That is why this game needs to the tribunal system back so people can review the situation and the game. So, real league players can see how this person was treating the whole team and how he was feeding on purpose. I also not posting any logs until Riot sends me the trolls logs as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-13T23:42:16.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Show logs if you want to prove this is unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"imolestplants","date":"2018-02-14T00:02:21.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=W6gUqwuA,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-02-13T23:42:16.519+0000)\n>\n> Show logs if you want to prove this is unfair.\n\nWhy would I show the logs, they are bad.
