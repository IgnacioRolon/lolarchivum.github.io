I have been and will forever be a silver-at-best scrub, blind pick normals player.  I enjoyed it, I had fun with my friends, and had a lot of love for League (even if it came with a regular spike in blood pressure from going on tilt).\r\n\r\nI loved buying derpy skins like Armor of the Fifth Age Taric (I loved that it was making fun of Burning Crusade Paladin T5), played Poppy even when she was intentionally beat into the dirt, and had a real love for the kits and flavor of certain champs.  These are all the kinds of things I bought into and enjoyed about the game.\r\n\r\nThen I stopped playing for a year and a half.  Now I don't recognize the game.\r\n\r\nChamps and skins I purchased are now fundamentally different and have been changed.  I can't play these champions now without learning them from scratch.  In previous reworks I was at least given a classic skin for my trouble and a thread I could follow from one design to the other, that doesn't seem to be the case now.\r\n\r\nI embraced a lot of changes.  Champion ranking and other features I loved.  I tolerated my favorite champs (favorite from a mechanical and flavor standpoint not flavor of the month) being taken out of relevancy during the nerf/buff cycle.  However, League now changes at such a rapid rate between Items, Jungle, Game Modes, and now Champion reworks I can't enjoy it (I'm sure there are more changes that I haven't even noticed yet).  I reinstalled the game yesterday and was barely functioning in beginner bots trying to figure everything out.\r\n\r\nWhen you buy a product, I believe it is reasonable for any consumer to believe that if you come back to it you aren't going to have something wholly different.  In the most literal case I now have purchased skins that I didn't sign up for.  In the more abstract I have bought into a game that doesn't care if it resembles anything I enjoyed before.\r\n\r\nIt is true that games like League do need to evolve to stay relevant but your current design philosophy alienates players who don't have the time and resources to sink into such an oppressive amount of changes.  You're also removing, at an alarming rate, the history of the game.  One that many of us felt we were a part of.  The vast majority of those I played with share this sentiment.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I feel the game has changed to such an extent that I could argue for a full refund of the RP I purchased.  However, seeing as I doubt that Riot is going to be sympathetic to me complaining about the hard work they undoubtably put in to these changes.  I won't hold my breath.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure where one of your Financial Analyst's would rank me as a client would I be below average, average, above average with my lifetime dollar spend?  I'd argue I would be above average maybe even a capital client.  Seems like poor business practice to alienate someone like me, then again I'm not privy to the stats I could just be collateral damage in a much bigger plan.\r\n\r\ntl;dr I'm an old player who feels the game left me behind and there isn't much that's familiar about it.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-23T20:14:52.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every game does this, if you leave for a few years, expect to come back to it changed. Nobody is going to give you special treatment because you feel offended by improvements.\n\nAlienating you? The truth is that you do not matter. You are one person, and no matter what you think, you speak for a tiny minority of the community. Everyone else is happy that useless, painfully binary kits have been updated and game balance improved.\n\nAnd no, you wont get a refund, per the statement on the champion update page.\n\n(Fifth age Taric is still gloriously derpy, what are you on about?)","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-04-23T20:11:59.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> being taken out of relevancy during the nerf/buff cycle\n\nYou are playing normals not high elo ranked, everything is viable.","replies":[]}]}
