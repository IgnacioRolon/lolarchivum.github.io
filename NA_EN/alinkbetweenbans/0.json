There are some extensions that conflict with the support site (ex adblocker) and private mode disables them temporarily.","replies":[{"poster":"ALinkBetweenBans","date":"2018-03-10T05:54:07.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you aware of this ping issue happening to charter users?

The game feels really bad.  Its better if we have a thread with a large number of comments and upvotes than 50 threads with the same topic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ALinkBetweenBans","date":"2018-03-10T01:59:56.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a lot of players are experiencing over 100ms ping today because of some bullshit riot did","replies":[]}]}
