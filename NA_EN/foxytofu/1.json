I restarted my router and everything and reconnected 20 times but i still was unable to come back. There is no filter for people that just leave games and people that lag out of games. I HAD 1 WIN IN MY PROMOS AND SINCE I DC'D IT KNOCKED ME BACK DOWN TO SILVER 4 WITH 81 LP LEFT. WHAT THE SHIT.  Ive spent the last 3 days power farming games and i get literally nowhere with it. \r\n\r\nIf some lovely riot employee could give me my silver 3 i would really appreciate it. {{champion:30}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-18T03:57:59.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, we cannot modify your ranked standing or your LP.

As a preventative measure, I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local network settings are 100% compatible with League.\n\nLet me know if you have any other issues with this.","replies":[]}]}
