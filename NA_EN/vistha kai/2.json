I'm the creator of the video in question. I do agree that the skill is currently working as intended (I said as much [when I initially posted it](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/7kUZ6pBf-meddler-repertoir-can-we-give-syndra-a-very-tiny-buff-to-the-scatter-the-weaks-range?comment=00010006), and repeated/added to those thoughts in [another comment in this thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/cWKqq7Le-meddler-id-like-to-remind-you-about-one-thing-you-responded-to-but-never-followed-up-on-it?comment=0001000000000001) ).\n\nI would like to touch on Syndra's current balance state. I feel that the buffs currently on PBE are going in the wrong direction, and will be bad for the health of the game. While I love Syndra, seeing her buffed then immediately nerfed again will be heartbreaking.\n\n**The short version:**\nSyndra has always functioned as a jack of all trades, master of none (similar to Jarvan, Lee Sin, etc). She has more damage than utility mages, and more utility than damage mages, but is less effective than either at their respective specialties. If you want good utility, you grab someone like Orianna. If you want good damage, you pick Cassiopeia. If you want something inbetween, you pick Syndra.\n\nCurrently, she has arguably the single-worst laning phase in the game. Going by the buffs on PBE, it would appear that Riot is planning to buff her late-game damage to compensate, instead of fixing her early game directly. If we're going to buff her damage enough to justify such a terrible laning phase, **this is going to invalidate champions like Cassiopeia and Karthus.** Why pick any damage-focused mage when you can get the same damage numbers AND utility by picking Syndra?\n\nI'm incredibly Syndra biased would have no issue with it, but I'm not completely blind. That would be bad for the game, and it would get her re-nerfed and we'd be back to where we are now.\n\n**The long version:**\nRead this comment  on reign of gaming and all its replies. There's really nothing more I can add to it.\nhttp://www.reignofgaming.net/news/32228-unofficial-pbe-patch-notes-for-8-20-2015?page=2#c30","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Aishi","date":"2015-08-25T10:46:24.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a recent game where my Q+E combo failed as I was moving towards the enemy I was casting it at though, so there is clearly a bug hidden in there somewhere","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Aatrox","date":"2015-08-25T07:39:25.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry if this is unrelated but is there any chance you have any news on Aatrox?

The reason you're being downvoted by people probably isn't because you're wrong (you're not), but because you feel the need to immediately cuss and swear about it.\n\nYes, in the video, I'm forced to move slightly backwards. First off, I'm human and can get a true 90* angle. Doing so was also not the point of the video, either. The purpose was to show just how unforgiving the skill is. After playing with it some, this was the smallest distance I could move with it showing up clientside (at least on the computer/connection I had been on at the time of recording, YMMV).\n\nMy general feeling is that the skill is working as intended, but a QoL buff wouldn't be entirely out of place either. I would much rather see mana buffs.\n\nThe is based off gut feeling and memory, not concrete evidence so take it with a grain of salt:\nThe skill used to be more forgiving, prior to the E nerfs. The change in size of orb hitbox also seems to have affected the launch hitbox as well - in otherwords the skill has effective range than it used to, since the E needs to hit the orb more directly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-08-26T00:13:59.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He didn't.
