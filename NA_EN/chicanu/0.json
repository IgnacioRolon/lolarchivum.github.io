Though she once sought the acceptance of her people, years of futile struggle shaped her into a bitter, resentful **warrior**. She now presents her foes with a terrible ultimatum: revere the **moon's light**, or die by her crescent blade.\n>\n>Though she was born to the Solari, Diana's inquisitive nature set her apart from her brethren. She had always found solace and guidance in the night sky, and questioned the dominance of the sun in her society. The Solari elders responded to her challenges with only derision and **punishment**. Diana remained convinced, however, that if she could find evidence of the **moon's power**, the elders would listen to reason. For years, she studied Solari archives in solitude until she discovered an encoded **message hidden** in an old tome. This clue led her to a secluded valley on Mount Targon where she unearthed the hidden entrance to an ancient, sealed temple. Inside, among aging relics and faded murals, she found an ornate suit of armor and a beautiful crescent blade, both inscribed with **sigils of the moon**. Diana donned the armaments and returned to the Solari elders that night. She declared that the artifacts proved others had once worshiped the moon as she did. Her discovery of evidence challenging Solari dominion shocked the elders. To Diana's horror, they pronounced her a heretic and **condemned her to death**. **As the elders prepared her for execution, Diana's anger and sorrow overwhelmed her desire for acceptance. She lifted her gaze to the sky, calling upon the moon for strength. Lunar power surged within her and she shattered her bindings. Raising her relic blade, she turned and slaughtered the elders. With the temple in ruins behind her, Diana resolved to destroy all those who would deny the power of the moon**.\n>\n>\"The sun does not **reveal truth**. Its light only burns and blinds.\"\n― Diana\n\nthe Light of the Moon reveals. \nreveals powers .....\n\n2) **Old vision:**\n\nI do not have enough level to post, Please someone help me posting the link to this conversation in the original post?\n\nI had a lot of work to get it this far, I asked support for the Brazilian team, and was ignored by them, said they were impotavam with my initiative, I asked a friend who has an account on NA post for me.\n\nEdit:\n>vote your favorite diana style by: JustBoneBrook\n>http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/WVLngAmK-should-diana-be-more-assassin-or-more-tank\n\nLock is an idea I have to rework the champion Diana.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n> I am Brazilian player Diana, and use a translator, and asked this friend that plays in NA post this, my name in game is Tricker.\n\n> **My goal is**: \n> Focus **Moonlight **effect on rework. Being the main point of departure.\n\n> with my rework Diana, does not change the essence, players did not feel strange. Why all effects continue, however at different points.\n\n**Passive:**\n> 1. Remove all current effects.\n> 2. With Direct Focus Moonlight, let's create a new effect:\n> 2.1 Diana gains **movement speed** when moving toward enemies or monsters Jungle marked with Moonlight.\n\n**Q: Crescent Strike**\n> 1. All current effects remain.\n> 2. Again focusing efforts on Moonlight, crescent Strike gains a \n> **new Passive Moonsilver blade** :\n> Hiting basic attack enemies marked with Moonlight, the effect of Moonsilver blade is activated, increasing damage.\n\n> Old passive Moonsilver Blade, now becomes a passive Crescent Strick, and is active through the Moonlight mark,\n\n> **Question: ** New Passive Consume mark Moonlight? yes or no?.\n> The answer is simple 2 second cooldown time for the new effect Moonsilver Blade.\n\n>**Important Notes: **\n>2.1 This creates the possibility to amplify the fighter diana, it improves close combat. \n>2.2 Good fighters have low cooldowns, and Diana can not receive this work. \n\n**W: Pale Cascade**\n> Again focusing on Moonlight, Pale Cascade gains a **new Passive**:\n> Hit an orb at enemies or monsters Jungle Tagged with Moonlight, Increases % Armor and % Magic Resistance to diana temporarily. (Tankness Top Lane Options)...\n\n>**Important Notes: **\n> Reduce Shield base AP. and Improve Armor and Magic Resist to Create Shield.\n\n**E: Moon Rising (Active Timer Effect skill) /  Moonfall (Desactive Active Timer effects, and call Moonfall)**\n\n> E becomes a new skill, with two stages, Turns ON and OFF, the player's choice. \n> recharge time of around 6 seconds between on and off.\n\n>**Important Notes: **\n> **Moonfall **is no longer an active skill, and becomes a **passive **effect of a new skill\n\n> Again focusing on **Moonlight **\n\n> Lets go to New Skill:\n\n>1) New passive **Lunar brightness**, \"New System Stacks\" : \n> 1.1) Hiting the enemy or \"Jungle Monster\" with Crescent Strike.

And until it is activated , removing all brightness and adding Power for 6 seconds .\n> Interesting , no? Channel Moonlight by the sword , making it the focus of power. wonderful, I think at least .\n\n>**Important Notes: **\n> Old Diana combo skill Q, E, R to trade side by enemy continue.. but Necessary of new Combo skill : Q, E, E, R to trade side by enemy. \n> And Timer Effect is good to Burst to Fighter, not to assassinate. More to new All combinations skills, Fighter Diana is Reality, and Assassin Diana is Reality by take off tankeness.\n\n**R: Lunar Rush**\n>Again focusing on **Moonlight **\n> Not Change Effect..\n>And Add New Passive: \n> Hitting enemy or monster adds attack speed temporarily, 20%  (old passive) (Reuse Reset bonus Timer? YES)\n>(maked by Moonlight besides reset the cooldown) \n\n\n**Conclusion**\n>Diana, becomes more dependent on Moonlight, what do creates many forms of counter play. with the addition of the passive Q it can become a more powerful fighter. In addition to movement speed while the target is to MoonLight.  These two changes, improve melee diana. \n\n> The new skill \"E\" Diana helps early game.\n\n> Can create ways to increase the intelligence of the game, and when to use the accumulation ...\n\n> E becomes a single feature throughout the league, when applying effect when Disables.\n\n> Easy to balanced, nerfs or buffs, consist in Cooldown by \"Q\" Moonlight... Determine to ALL Skills used...\n\n> New E is Important point, to Amplify effects and damages by having stacks.. and stack equals cooldowns of \"Q\".\n> Diana new Having 2 potential skills E and R, so wath use? E or R?\n\n> New E trade to R? R to basic skill, and E to Ultimate? YES! is Good..\n> Diana gain choises..\n\n> and more..\n\n\n\n\n**Resume Revison:**\n\n>But the main idea, diana with a more dynamic system, with more options and choices, without changing its main characteristics.\n>\n>With the suggestion, I believe that the old dianas continue to exist, and new dianas arise, with improvements in the skill system, the dynamics would only ones and different styles of play.\n>\n>Not want to create a champion with an AoE ultimate why this lot already has, and it would be boring mischaracterizing the diana.\n>\n>But working in E consistently seems an excellent choice.\n>\n>My idea Nerf infinity E. But also buff to infinity E, with cooldowns being registered with activation and deactivation, Moonfall to be used more frequently, but with very little power, unless you are good at hitting the Q.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2014-10-20T15:42:05.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand a word of it.
