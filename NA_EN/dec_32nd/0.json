See, Cull was bought with gold that was given to you for free, that you had to do nothing to earn. Every game, you're going to lane with 0 gold. Cull makes it so you can make a bigger chunk of gold from just farming (Something every ADC does) and then sell the item. It's alot of free gold. All of the gold from 100 CS, plus the 400 from Cull, plus the sellback gold from it. You lose literally nothing from buying it, using it, and then selling it. you actually gain.","replies":[{"poster":"Cherysse","date":"2015-11-17T03:11:12.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well that's true, but now games are shorter and it is difficult to get the full advantage of the item :s","replies":[{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2015-11-17T03:11:50.938+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cherysse,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VkMtZr0E,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-17T03:11:12.663+0000)\n>\n> Well that's true, but now games are shorter and it is difficult to get the full advantage of the item :s\n\nGames are shorter or longer depending on how safely it's played.

You make 400g off it, so you net a total of 130g extra. Doran's Blade doesn't give you gold and it's 450 that sells for 180. That means Doran's blade, you're in the hole 270 compared to 130g ABOVE.
