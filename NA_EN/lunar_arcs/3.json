A simple, non harmful question. Got absolutely mass downvoted ( yet accused of upvote botting on the actual post itself, wew fuck) and got told that im pushing an agenda and im the reason feminism is a joke blah blah lblah. Same incel rhetoric, different ign. Like literally any time i have ever expressed an opinion about women in video games i get called a feminazi bitch or whatever. MEANWHILE in actual games if my ign is \"girly\" i dont get taken seriously, i get told to play support, i get told that im a boosted egirl and that i should uninstall because girls cant play league. Like i cant actually win, it's literally a daily thing on my main and yet when i talk about hating it, even if just very briefly like \"oh i wish people took me seriously and not characterized me based off gender\" i get SWARMED by the literal definition of incels.\r\n\r\nI wouldnt actually be surprised if i get a comment like\r\n\"Well maybe we would take you seriously if you didnt shove you being a girl down our throats, honestly you're the reason people act like this\"\r\nI swear to god the song may change but the tune will always remain the same. It's wild. Rant over.","replies":[{"poster":"ScatterTheWeak","date":"2019-05-25T14:22:31.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know what I was gonna type up a pretty negative paragraph, in fact I did posted it, and deleted it. But it doesn't change anything. And tbh I cant even be mad at you for having different views. Like me and you arguing over different views is actually not changing anything. I actually kind of feel bad for you overall that your experience in league has been so bad that you've even gotten to this point. Like I want to be angry and say your just doing this entire thing because you think the world revolves around you, and who knows that might be true but it also might not be. The same shit happens to me, I go through the same shit but I guess I just view it differently and handle it differently. I'm actually trying here to be a bit sympathetic, my origional paragraph to this thread was pretty mean and accusatory. I realized after i typed it up and posted it that it wasnt solving anything and then i tried to put myself in your shoes. We both are two different woman in the gaming world dealing with the EXACT same problems but coming at them with different views. Even though they seriously conflict, its actually stupid to fight with you over it because its not changing anything or helping the problem. Meanwhile the culprits get away with what they are doing. Anyways. Overall. I'm sorry for offending you in my older posts and getting so heated. I just come at this shit with a different arsenal and I guess some of the things you do i feel just make things worse. But I cant blame you. So sorry for that.","replies":[{"poster":"Lunar ArcS","date":"2019-05-25T16:32:13.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know , I am really surprised. Honestly,. No one I've ever disagreed with online, has apologized to me before. Especially in boards. I'm sorry for being a %%%%. Sometimes I let my emotions get in the way of actual issues rather than minuscule one. And thank you for being such an adult about this.","replies":[{"poster":"ScatterTheWeak","date":"2019-05-25T17:46:36.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's prob  because im not a troll most people online arguing are trolls. I actually have very strong feelings about some of the issues brought up and I just think we clash on some of the solutions to solving those issues. But there is actually no point in fighting because its actually achieving nothing. Both of us trying to force beliefs on each other is impossible and its not actually doing anything to stop the culprits. Idk when i put myself in your shoes I just was like idk I COULD have those same exact beliefs it just depends on experiences and i mean not even that because im sure we've both had alot of similar experiences but I think we've both chosen different paths for how we deal with them. Which is honestly something we never should have gotten into a fight about in the first place. WE should be feeling for each other and supporting each others ways to deal with them. Like for me i just try and hyper focus on what the point of league is and it being a game and just none of the shit i deal with matters. I refuse to tell people my gender and or confirm it when they use pronouns. and I also dont like making fun of like sexist terms like \"egirl\" and shit because I feel like it desensitizes and makes people think its ok to do because oh look girls call themselves that too. That was the big thing that got me tbh and I kind of went off on you over that. Anyways I feel we were both wrong in the whole grand scheme in how we handled it. Anyways. Yea sorry. gl with everything tho.","replies":[{"poster":"Lunar ArcS","date":"2019-05-26T19:00:35.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you take a look about two comments down, you'll see just what makes me feel this way.

I think we just sort of lashed out at each other over something but like i think its mostly attributed to just how fed up we are with the community in general. Who knows we might even be more alike then we think. Maybe we are friends in another life. :) who knows. anyways tho wish you the best.:D","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Volkswachter","date":"2019-05-26T13:55:48.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Volkswachter","date":"2019-05-26T14:02:31.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"CarpeConundrum","date":"2019-05-26T14:24:37.375+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am this wonderful ADC's Yuumi.

If you poke your head into female-dominated circles, you'll find exactly the inverse. It's really that simple. \n\nStereotypes exist because they're relatable. I get that it sucks to be on the wrong end of one. I don't like the fact that every girl I meet up with treats me as a potential rapist until I prove myself...but I can't blame them. Most rapists are male, I happen to be male, so I've got to live with the reputation some bad apples gave me. There are plenty of girls in gaming that deserve to be taken seriously...and a whole lot more that don't. When was the last time you saw a female streamer that didn't have her tits hanging out? Or heard a feminist voice opinions without shrilly demonizing anything with a penis? \n\nBottom line is, while neither of us deserve the stereotypes we're labeled with, every group comes to be known by its lowest common denominator. All we can do is sigh, and go on proving we don't belong in that group. Or not...fuck 'em, they're just a handful of disposable people out of 7.7 billion others. That's the upshot to overpopulation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CarpeConundrum","date":"2019-05-26T14:49:37.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Lunar ArcS","date":"2019-05-26T18:55:47.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was a really sad attempt.
