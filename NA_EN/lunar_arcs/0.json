Being unresponsive and reckless will just make people leave at faster speeds. You think new players are going to trump old veterans? Let me just put it this way.\n\nLeague was very strategy based. Hence why the games have almost always been longer than 25 minutes.\nCasuals, do not want to play 30-40 minute games. Too time consuming for someone who is new and doesn&#039;t care.\nThey will move on to overwatch. Or any other game where they can play 10-15 minute matches.\n\nThen you&#039;ll regret ignoring your veterans.\nIt&#039;s so heartbreaking to see pro players just straight up quit because the game is in fucking shambles and you guys seem to not care.
