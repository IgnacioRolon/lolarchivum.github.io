After some theorizing, I'd like you to try something out!  I'm guessing here that the formatting window might be a result of the client trying to provide you with some piece of news or information.  I could be wrong, but it's worth a shot.  Out of curiosity, is this your first time logging in since the preseason patch?  \n\nI'd like you to try going to back to the legacy patcher to see if you'll instead receive a message there.  You can return to the legacy client under the Sign In button of the updated client, or manually through your League of Legends folder -> lol.launcher.\n\nLet me know if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Heizenberg65","date":"2016-11-17T12:25:59.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same issue and can not find a solution.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rtbf200050443","date":"2016-11-17T04:27:14.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently suffering this exact same issue.

Popup is unresponsive and first time logging in since new client patch. \n\nIt appears to be an information window regarding the beta client as one item is {{betaFAQ}}.\n\nI have un-installed, rebooted, launched from shortcut, launched from lol.launcher and lol.launcher.admin but nothing works. Same thing happens when the client starts with each one and this popup blocks the screen and you cannot close it.","replies":[]}]}
