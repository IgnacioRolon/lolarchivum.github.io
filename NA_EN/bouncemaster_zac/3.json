I like Soraka a lot, she's been a growing pick of mine in my extremely small pool and I noticed something as I played her more. Healers are generally much less problematic than shielders. I think this is because you have now given all three archetypes, mages, tanks, physical fighters, Wounds in some way and made it easier to proc. This means that healers are easily countered by simply adjusting a build to include one item for each type of champion and you reduce a healers power by 40% or more depending on who it is, since Soraka is effected by GW more than say Nidalee. But shielders don't have an equivalent. Healers generally have some kind of stipulation, normally very high mana costs. Sony's heal I believe costs 85 mana, Nami's heal costs about 110 mana, Nidalee is also about 110, Soraka costs max health even if the costs is a bit lower but even so the spammy nature of it can lead to mana issues, and maybe one or two more. And while shielders might have similar mana costs, they don't have a way to have their shields reduced. This leads to a cycle where you guys might nerf items that buff heals and shields, but what you have just done is further reduce the effectiveness of healers while only bringing shielders down to a more bearable state until suddenly you can't viably pick a healer and still be at an advantage in team comp because a Soraka is just not as useful as Janna more often than not.\n\nI understand that remove all poke can be annoying for some players in a lane like bot, but those same people need to understand that healers are designed to beat out poke. A Brand who does nothing but harass with W should lose to a Nami or Bard who specs into healing their ADC over just doing damage. Because those same people need to learn that all in beats healers, Thresh, Blitz, Leona, etc. So please don't nerf healers too much, Soraka and Nami have not been as hot as Janna and Lulu for some time so I think that shows a trend of who is relatively more powerful than who.","replies":[{"poster":"Soraka is SO HOT","date":"2018-03-01T17:45:49.068+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"In the same vein, I hope that they don't mess with {{item:3114}} {{item:3222}} {{item:3504}} {{item:3107}}  unique passives.\n\nCurrently, % heal/shield boosts from Forbidden Idol and its upgrades are concurrent - the item boosts the strength of **both** actions in one unique passive.\n\nNerfing the value of % heal/shield boost will hurt the healers.\n\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"q3fogWe6LF","date":"2018-03-01T18:13:37.521+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"The unique passive could be split into two - one for heals and one for shields!\n\nHealing is already countered by grievous wounds, so there is no need to nerf % heal boost.\n\nBy splitting the passives, we could nerf potential shield power without touching healing.\n\nFor example...\n_____________________________________\n\n{{item:3114}}\n **Unique Passive:** _Bloodrush:_     +8% healing power.\n**Unique Passive:** _Shields Up:_    +4% shielding power.\n\n\n {{item:3504}}  \n **Unique Passive:** _Ardent Healing:_     +10% healing power.\n**Unique Passive:** _Ardent Shielding:_    +6% shielding power.\n\n\n{{item:3107}} \n **Unique Passive:**     +10% healing power.\n**Unique Passive:**   +6% shielding power.\n\n\n{{item:3222}} \n **Unique Passive:**     +20% healing power.\n**Unique Passive:**   +12% shielding power.\n\n___________________________________\n\n\nOverall, you could only gain 24% increased shielding power versus the current 40%.\n\nThis would serve to nerf the current power of shielding without affecting the state of healing.\n\n{{sticker:sg-ezreal}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ahri Inari","date":"2018-03-01T21:11:33.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that healer counter poker, but it's also important to give room for outplay to overcome matchup.

Janna and ardent were an issue for an entire season and she's still at 54% with a 21% (INSANE) pick rate. I feel like rings true with any damage dealer (Vayne, Trist, Twitch, Shy, J4). If they're near 53% for more than a patch they get addressed, yet somehow shield supports go untouched for months, and the sentiment is oh we are just behind.
