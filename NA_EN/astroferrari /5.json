Most of the time these champs aren't actually doing more damage than the carries.  Pure numbers wise they are doing significantly less damage (ever see 2 tanks fight each other? its a wet noodle slapping contest).   With one damage item however they are still doing lots of damage to the squishy 2000 hp full damage apc or adc. There is a fine balance of which role can kill the other one first and unless they are super fed allowing the bruiser to mitigate most of your damage or the adc to shred your health bar then its a dance between who can kill who first.","replies":[]}]}
