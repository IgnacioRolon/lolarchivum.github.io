Example that people commonly use is making A attack move click while I have it set to an extra button on my mouse. \n\nSecond is that it will target the nearest enemy unit to where you clicked that is within range.\n\nIn other words if You want to attack unit A and there is unit B clicking right next to A will target them assuming they are in range.\n\nOn the other hand if A is slightly out of range and B is in range it will target B making it have some considerable draw backs if used at the wrong times.\n\nIt can be really good for chasing a single enemy champ or waiting for them to get out of hiding. It is however not the most reliable thing to be using when trying to hast hit minions..\n\nSo should you use it? I would say yes if you are willing to learn when to use it.","replies":[]}]}
