That's like 1 out of every 10 losses. \n\nSometimes my botlane will still be in provisionals and have no history playing ranked, vs. people as high as Gold 3 and sometimes Gold 2. \n\nSometimes someone will do a troll pick but I tell myself \"high elo smurfs get through this stuff all the time, it's just a part of the game.\" Something like Leblanc support and full AP Malph jungle. \n\nOr sometimes someone AFKs for the first few minutes and comes back before we can remake, or continues to DC and we start the game at a pretty high disadvantage. \n\nAnd yeah you'll probably look at my match history and be like \"Oh you're a Jax player quit complaining.\" Only reason I play Jax is cause he's strong enough to give a fighting chance in all these scenarios. If I played the champions that I really wanted to play all these game would likely be auto-losses. At least on Jax I can get fed enough to carry said situations. \n\nend rant.

I've been told, if you consistently dominate your lane, you will win enough games to climb no matter what anyone else is doing. I don't know about that, though. It seems like you have to grind through so many games where something totally ridiculous makes the game unwinnable no matter what you do and lose all that LP before you finally get that fair chance to prove your worth and crush your lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2019-10-16T00:12:59.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah no, that seems pretty false.

He was 10/0 when I first encountered him, and it became a slaughterfest of who can do more lasting damage to the other's 4 pawns to push the pieces across the board, and I actually overcame a literal 10/0 out of lane phase Darius. With the right play, a fed ADC *can* work around a fed top laner.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mihalikb","date":"2019-10-16T00:29:43.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I basically feel the whole \"play enough games you'll climb\" shit only applies to botlanes and jungles.\n\nI've seen midlaners consistently dominatung their lane, having 20/2/10 KDAs, but they just can't carry the botlane that fed 0/15 by minute 15. They come out of lane having fed 3/5 players on the enemy team.\n\nAs a top laner 90% of the time you feel like you have no effect on the game. You got first kill, won lane, took first tower, took herald, roamed mid.\n\nYour botlane will not lane swap, the ADC  is \"split pushing\" somewhere, the support or jungle is MIA somewhere on the map, existing somehow if not inting but not pushing, taking objectives, clearing or creating vision.\n\nSo you are 3v5 trying to capitalize on your lead but you just can't.","replies":[{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2019-10-16T03:11:53.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, if toplane gets camped, they legit, and I mean legit, will be able to do nothing for the rest of the game depending on their pick.

Makes you wonder just how many games smurfs have to play to get the point where they understand how to win and play accordingly no matter what's in front of them. I was 1 win away from gold back in June but tilted all the way back down to Silver 3.
