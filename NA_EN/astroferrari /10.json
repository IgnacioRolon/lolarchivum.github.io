While reworks like Sion, Galio and Yorick are cool looking, they did not take enough from the previous models to look familiar. Yes, of course you should change them, but not to the extent that they are unrecognizable. Poppy and Warwik are both good examples of what to do right in this department.\n\n2.-The gameplay is fun while keeping warwick's gameplay theme familiar. It is expected that with updates a champions kit will change, but keeping it thematic to the character while also conserving what worked on the previous one is when a gameplay update succeds. Gangplank and Warwick are great examples of what to do right. Yorick and Galio are ok given how unplayable their older kits were, but maybe could have had improvements. Fiora and Sion are examples of how to create basically a new champion that is only losely related to an older one\n\n3.-Warwicks gameplay is what people imagined they were doing while playing old warwick, only now its true.
