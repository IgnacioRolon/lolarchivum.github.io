Nothings going to happen to them.\r\n\r\nRinse, wash, repeat. Couldn&#039;t help my team against a fed Draven today, woop. Here come the insults.

I feel like there might be issues with matchmaking when there are more than the usual number of players in the game, but until they see that and start work on that, a lot of us are going to keep experiencing these downward spikes in game quality.","replies":[]},{"poster":"d4rkshock","date":"2017-06-17T23:16:55.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on what they say or do. If they run it down mid, they will get banned. You have a report score. If you report someone and the bot doesn't detect them as super toxic, then they won't be punished. If they said something like kys,then yes they will be punished. I also had a game where this talyha was super toxic and there was someone she didn't like so she sat at fountain afk. And was moving around because leave buster. Then our ADC said something and then she ran it down mid. This is the kind of thing that makes me go from one of the friendliest Ayers to pornstar zillean toxic. I said the same thing that got dunkey banned. Also why feed. Can't you just leave. It will be over faster. What happened is I reported her for unsportsmanlike like, intentionally feeding, and afk and I was informed that she was banned. Im also kind f sarcastic so if I see then say %%%%%%, I will say wow, I didn't know killer keemstar played lol and I didn't know I was going to be on damage alert and I'll report for hate speech.","replies":[]}]}
