GP was a very balanced champion with a respectable and balanced win rate. He was clearly balanced in every way and had very, VERY clear weaknesses before Kleptomancy. He is now at nearly a 20% ban rate because of one rune and the only thing that has changed about him was the rune itself. \n\nAs an ADC, Ezreal was unquestionably the worst in the game. This is why people started taking him as a jungler. Kleptomancy comes and all of a sudden he is pick or ban with a win rate in a range of 53-56%. \n\nPlease Riot, do not nerf GP just because he can make good use of this rune. I&#039;ve had a day or two to articulate this and I now know that Klepto either needs to be taken out of the game or changed heavily so that it works on champions outside of those that abuse on hit effects. \n\nWithout this rune, GP is balanced and Ezreal is still weak.","replies":[{"poster":"13900 Essence","date":"2018-01-19T22:56:22.447+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd like to try other runes on him, but it just feels awful knowing that if you don't take klepto you are playing sub-optimally.","replies":[{"poster":"AstroFerrari ","date":"2018-01-19T23:02:42.065+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree whole-heartedly.

I can see Illaoi taking it because you can proc it on champion spirits but everyone else is just asking to be destroyed in laning. Fiora is a bullshit champion though so if you can get her to late she could still probably beat almost anyone in 1v1/2 in the mid to late game even against a person with a rune that synergizes much better with them than a fiora with klepto. \n\nJax though is the one I doubt for sure. He would just get clobbered by anyone with a combat oriented rune. And unlike these champions, Jax lacks a way to farm without putting himself in a position to get all ined/poked down with no innate sustain. Going into the laning phase as Jax with Klepto just seems like your asking for hell.","replies":[{"poster":"Janna Me Fiddle","date":"2018-01-20T19:42:19.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MistakenKing,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bo1WaP7w,comment-id=0013000000000000,timestamp=2018-01-20T08:57:16.920+0000)\n>\n> holy shit i checked op.gg and those 3 do take lul.

E max also means an even weaker laning phase trading wise. That combined with a lack of built in sustain and combat runes means any meta laner at least should be destroying you. Also just like Klepto a lot of the runes in Inspiration aren't directly combat focused meaning even less trading power. That rune set up is just too greedy on Jax imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Janna Me Fiddle","date":"2018-01-20T21:02:03.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MistakenKing,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bo1WaP7w,comment-id=001300000000000000010000,timestamp=2018-01-20T20:16:41.015+0000)\n>\n> Counter strikes wont stop non auto attack based damage though and even then most champions have ways of getting around it or forcing it before to going for an extended trade.

Press the attack used to until it got nerfed, thunderbolt doesn't feel good on him at all, grasp is meh, glacial augment is severely underpowered which only really leaves him with fleet footwork or klepto.\n\nHopefully when the bruiser rune is finished we'll have another option.\n\nand don't underestimate how good free boots and stopwatch are, I've won level 6 all ins off of it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-01-20T19:22:01.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiora's Q applies on-hit effects, including Klepto.","replies":[{"poster":"Oakleaf Ranger","date":"2018-01-20T20:23:20.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Votable Jester,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bo1WaP7w,comment-id=00130000000000000000,timestamp=2018-01-20T19:22:01.868+0000)\n>\n> Fiora&#x27;s Q applies on-hit effects, including Klepto.\n\nbut it doesn't enhance her laning strengths or cover up her weaknesses.

Although I did get a Kleptomancy Ezreal game earlier and good god I had to shower after because I felt *dirty*.\n\nNasus really doesn't make use of Kleptomancy except as a \"win more\" rune, but damn it's effective when it works. His Siphoning Strike isn't up enough for it to be consistently procced early game, where it really matters a heap.\nBecause of its cooldown and how comparatively rubbish he is in early trades, he's not got too much incentive to consistently dump effort into getting a klepto proc. Most times it's used it was incidental, I find.\nOnce he starts aggressing, though, then he starts properly raking it in. You know how it is, when after he's gotten over his early hump and he's actually a lot more willing to trade hits. And that, on top of the fact you can't bully him away from the farm now, *on top of* the occasional kill he gets... Whew.\n\nWhat is *really* exacerbating his win rate right now though is the Ancient Coin start that's popular. We can all agree that he's pretty pants until he gets a component item or two but after that small step, good lord.\nIt's super super hard to choke him out of money with that.\nBecause of pretty much the coin alone in one game (and first tower gold from bot), I was down 30CS, and a kill vs a Darius.\nBut I was 150g **ahead**. He'd played everything super well up to that point, but because Coin was in my pocket (actually upgraded to Nomad's at that point), I was *ahead*. I was super surprised when I looked through the replay.\n\nThat should resolve itself some with the changes to support items, I know a bunch of folks are more apprehensive about the sightstone being given to them than the super strong Talisman.\nBut I'm just as excited for the nearly-free sightstone.
