His Splash Art Could Be a mock up of Draven, Morgana (she is next), and Annie in the backyard of some house. Dragen could be flexing his muscles while with a hammer and nails in one hand while annie swings from a makeshift swing hanging off the bicep of his other arm.\r\n\r\n*Number 1 Mom Morgana:* Coming from the last idea, this one is based more off of a Mothers Day Skin. Morgana could be seen sporting a old Nuclear Family Esque Red Polka Dottted Sun Dress while throwing what deems to be glasses of lemonade. In the Splash art, she could be coming out the house to lay glasses of lemonade out of the table for their backyard picnic antics they were preforming.\r\n\r\n*Baby New Year Gnar:* We all know Gnar is that little fluff ball critter we all grew to love for his cuteness. What else would make him cuter then a skin that turns him into a baby with a sash and top hat which when he rages, turns into a big burly clock worker (since baby new year was centered around Father Time).\r\n\r\n*FiddleStitiches:* Yes, Yes Fiddlesticks has a bountiful amount of skins but as ive seen Shen and Kennen both have Doctor skins so why not him aswell? This isnt holiday based but i was thinking of a Fiddlesticks dressed in full Doctor attire sporting the classical old doctor headgear and everything. He could possible throw a bonesaw, or scalpels, anything medical related. His splash art could be him in an operating room, stitching up Annie's torn up bear on an operating table. Annie is worried looking from the background teary eyed from a surgery examination window. you can even have an appearence of the other doctor skins roaming the halls outside the window aswell.\r\n\r\nThough none being actual good ideas, i felt like showing them to the rest of the league community to atleast have a good laugh along with me to these though lame, equally awesome sounding ideas ^_^ Happy New Year to all, and may the Rift be ever in your favor.","replies":[{"poster":"Kamiroo Wolf","date":"2015-01-06T09:16:26.147+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually rather enjoy Fiddlestitches and Baby New Year Gnar. So many champions need skins and Gnar, I feel, needs one most...next to Jinx and Zac. Lot of mine aren't serious either xD. Groovy Malzahar came to me in a dream...was smoking Groovy Maokai.\n\n\n**Holiday Skin Concepts(Bold ones are ones I really want to see):**\n-Battle Bunny Fiora\n**-Saint Braum(St. Patrick's Day)\n-General Azir(Veterans day. His soldiers are real soldiers with bayonets on the guns, he looks like a sergeant, and his ultimate is one of those war barricades with soldiers stationed behind it.)**\n**-Gravekeeper Gragas(Harrowing. He throws a casket full of ghouls)**\n-Groovy Maokai(Earth Day, idk)\n-Spicy Tryndamere(Cinco De Mayo. That pepper sword tho and Mariachi outfit)\n-Triste(in the lack of a better word) Sona(Dia De Los Muertos. Sona with a sugar skull face that plays much more somber tones that are slightly uplifting because people get to be reunited with their lost loved ones on this day. She wears a beautiful Mariachi dress)\n-Trick Or Treat Gragas(Pumpkins and bags of candy...all while dressed up as an adorable fat and...slowly rotting pumpkin!)\n**-Get Jinxed!(Jinx' s Birthday Skin. Candle minigun...cake launcher...festive outfit...cute little temporary tattoo on her cheek that says “Anarchy\" surrounded by a heart. Her splash art: She captured Vi and Caitlyn and holds them hostage as Jinx blows out the candles on her cake...more like she tries to shoot the flame out...)\n-Groovy Malzahar(Earth Day. Rainbows, dogs, peace signs!)**\n(I get that that China has something against skeletons but how about skeletal Zac for harrowing. He bounces around as a skeleton, punches people with arms he detaches, leaves piles of bones behind, and his body parts try to crawl back to eachother when he dies)\n**-Sparkly Jinx(Chinese New Year. FIREWORKS AND “DRAGONBONES\" BRUH!)**\n-Heartseeker Varus\n-President Jarvan IV(Presidents Day)\n-President Swain(Presidents Day)\n-Hacker Ezreal(Cyber Monday. Source of power drawn from code)","replies":[{"poster":"Fut1leJudg3","date":"2015-01-06T09:35:20.529+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like most of your ideas, but i always found like a Heartseeker Singed would be better than Varus. i know, i know he isnt a ranged character, but imagine a box of chocolates for a shield and like a bottle of champagne for the bottle with little alcohol bubbles trailing behind him.","replies":[{"poster":"Kamiroo Wolf","date":"2015-01-06T17:08:55.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fut1leJudg3,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=a7cXPTjG,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-01-06T09:35:20.529+0000)\n>\n> I like most of your ideas, but i always found like a Heartseeker Singed would be better than Varus. i know, i know he isnt a ranged character, but imagine a box of chocolates for a shield and like a bottle of champagne for the bottle with little alcohol bubbles trailing behind him.\n\nHis W could be a spread of rose petals in the shape of a heart :o I like this idea alot","replies":[]},{"poster":"slipstreem","date":"2015-01-07T01:40:14.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"JUST GIVE ME GINGERBREAD SINGED ALREADY!!!!
