Not everyone is perfect and while there will always be \"op champs\" and flamers that blame everything on you guys because they can't climb I think you guys are doing a great job! \r\n\r\nSecondly I want to be a part of making this game better, with the amount of time I spend on this game and how much I think about it it would be amazing to be able to resolve my work life around it as well. The problem is I don't have a college degree or any technical backgrounds in computers. What I do have is communication skills, creative thinking, critical thinking, and I am very good at writing when I sit down and try. So I guess my question would be, is there any sort of job at riot that would allow me to be a part of this great game from the inside or am I out of luck and just get to enjoy the game as much as I can with the little amount of time I have to play? I know it's a long shot but I just thought I would ask anyways! \r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-05T06:35:03.716+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! \n\nOne of the best resources that I found when considering Riot as a company I'd like to work at was [this LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Inside-Riot-Games-People-Game-3544410?gid=3544410&mostPopular=&trk=tyah&trkInfo=tarId%3A1423117947845%2Ctas%3Ariot%20games%2Cidx%3A4-1-8)!
