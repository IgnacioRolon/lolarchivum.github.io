I agree with your previous statement, but it is absolutely irrelevant to the discussion at hand and the point I'm trying to make.\n\nHaving contradicting information because of different viewpoints and unreliable narrators is NOT the same thing as having contradicting information because Narrative changed their mind. And readers are smart enough to know the difference.\n\nSo why is this Rakan line here, hmm? Because of different viewpoints, really? In the entry point of the Lore, the only thing you can be sure most players will be exposed to? The thing that should clearly convey the very basics of the characters and their dynamics? I highly doubt that's the case, and if it is, I think it's a misguided decision. You want subtleties in the longer form stories, not in the one-liners that someone will hear by happenstance as their only source of information if they don't dig deeper.\n\nBut what Scathlocke does, when a player points that out? He tells a joke. Well sorry, but from someone who made the community such big promises, while dismissing all the previous promises made as not made by him personally, I expect more than jokes when a serious issue relevant to his discipline is raised. I'm not gonna berate Sparkle or Katey when they post memes in GD, but when the **\"Lead Narrative Editor\"** post jokes in **Story & Art**, that's a different story altogether. \n\nWhen you talk big, you need to back it up.

Then half the champs will lose a bunch of lines\n\nPfff, as if. Can you give me another line in a VO that gives outright false information? We have a few mysteries, some ambiguous references, but nothing is outright false, far as I can tell. I'll grant you I may have missed a couple exceptions, but mostly, the facts fed by VOs are accurate. There is much more than enough room in feelings and relationships to get depth in VOs without providing wrong facts. So don't pretend I'm arguing to remove a significant \"bunch of lines\".\n\n> any misconceptions a champion could have is thrown out the window.\n\nThey are not \"thrown out the window\", they are relegated to more long-form and elaborated media, that can do them justice and not mislead the majority of the player base.\n\n> Maybe the lore team made a mistake, but they can work around that or even use it.\n\nWell, maybe they didn't even make a mistake at all. Maybe Rakan is referencing something else than the demonic powers Swain got from his pact in Noxus. The problem here is that Scathlocke didn't came and profess caution, he didn't tell us to not read too much in a VO line. He treated the statement by Oleandervine as true, and proceeded to make a joke about it. So yeah, \"Riot can tell jokes\". But there is being aware of context and able to read the mood. Did you miss that part of my previous post: \"I'm not gonna berate Sparkle or Katey when they post memes in GD, but when the \"Lead Narrative Editor\" post jokes in Story & Art, that's a different story altogether.\"","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2018-03-06T23:08:26.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't say you were hostile in your first two comments, It was when you started getting angry that I said you were. And I tried to give you actual responses, if you want to dismiss those as platitudes I can't stop you, but I could just say the same about your argument because dismissing the opposing argument adds nothing.\n\nChamps can lose a lot of character if any misconceptions they have are left only to long term stories, though. The way I understand it, correct me if I'm wrong on this, is that if a character thinks another character killed someone, but that character didn't, that couldn't come up in the dialogue because it would be misleading. \n\nI think you're the one who misread the mood. Unless I read it entirely wrong, Oleandervine was making the comment in a joking matter, and Scathlocke basically backed it up in a similar manner. The story art and sound page isn't some end all be all serious place, people can still make jokes here. You might be taking all this a bit too seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-03-07T02:42:43.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The way I understand it, correct me if I'm wrong on this, is that if a character thinks another character killed someone, but that character didn't, that couldn't come up in the dialogue because it would be misleading. \n\nYeah, I see where you are going with that. Du Couteau's murder. Except that's alluded to, but never explicitly mentioned. Not who did it, at least. And even after a potential rework (since most of the champs involved have minimal VO), it doesn't need to. You can show Katarina's anger towards Swain, she can talk about revenge, she can call Swain a traitor, there are tons of way to make a good VO without ever mentioning \"Swain killed my father (or at least I think so)\".\n\nAnd I'm not preaching for the way I'd like things to be done. I'm saying they are already done this way. Again, can you point me at a lot of dialogues with clearly contradictory facts? Where a Champ claims A, and their Rival claims B? I don't think so. And it's logical, you don't want to give players some alternative facts just for them to learn it was all a lie when they go and dig deeper (in \"long-form media\", not in \"long term stories\", 'cause that's not what I wrote).\n\nSo why this Rakan line? We can find tons of plausible in-universe explanations, sure. But what I think happened is that earlier in Swain rework, he was supposed to get his powers from a bond or pact or whatever with Vastayans, possibly after being betrayed by the previous leadership during the Ionia invasion. This was alluded to in Rakan's VO, but finally it was decided Swain powers were demonic, and it was too late to change the VO.\n\nI'd very much like to be wrong, I swear, and that it's not yet another sign that Riot don't know where they're headed with their lore. But still, right now, that's what I fear happened. And as I said in my original comment, when a player is pointing that contradiction and Scathlocke answers with a joke, however nice, that's not reassuring.\n\n> I think you're the one who misread the mood. [...]\n\nMaybe. Still, you paint me as an angry no-fun-allowed idiot who doesn't understand how storytelling works, and that irks me a little. Well, you got the angry part right, at least, but it's only because you caused it yourself. I'm not saying people can't joke or that this sub-board must be the most serious place ever. But Scathlocke is one of the top guys in Narrative. He's one of the two people responsible for the overall quality and consistency of the Lore. It's his job and his responsibility, very specifically, to make sure the lore is \"Good (tm)\". So **people** can make jokes, but it's not **his** place to make a joke when someone points an issue.\nMeddler or Katey or Sparkle also make jokes and memes and funny comments. But Meddler doesn't come and make them in a thread where someone is complaining about Voli being OP this patch, or Katey when someone's angry because they couldn't see the VFX of the latest skin and lost their game because of that. You know, because solving those problems is part of their job.\nIs it really that hard to see the parallel I'm drawing here? That looked pretty damn simple to me, which is why my first comment was a one-liner, but you keep subtly misinterpreting everything I say, so this one became a fucking wall of text.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-03-06T01:44:26.342+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Birdbrains and all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-03-06T01:55:35.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=b4qKlnew,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-03-05T23:56:40.938+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, and Rakan implied Swain was part Vastaya, and we see how that turned out.\n\nI mean, it's possible Rakan is addressing the demon instead of Swain, or that Swain is indeed part Vastayan somewhere far back in his family tree.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2018-03-06T08:04:00.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Eww no just make him a Demon.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-03-05T23:16:01.987+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well his short bio still calls him a scarecrow,so I think it is more likely that Fiddle is a ghost that is bound to a scarecrow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Camille FerrÃ¸s","date":"2018-03-05T22:38:07.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG noooo i missed the rioter commment that is now deleted...maybe he said something that he shouldn't lore info ...and i missed it ..","replies":[{"poster":"Rilgar55","date":"2018-03-05T22:47:16.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreatDevouer,realm=EUNE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=b4qKlnew,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-03-05T22:38:07.413+0000)\n>\n> OMG noooo i missed the rioter commment that is now deleted...maybe he said something that he shouldn&#x27;t lore info ...and i missed it ..\n\nHe just said that they werent going to make fiddle a walking corpse.","replies":[{"poster":"Camille FerrÃ¸s","date":"2018-03-06T00:28:51.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rilgar55,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=b4qKlnew,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2018-03-05T22:47:16.711+0000)\n>\n> He just said that they werent going to make fiddle a walking corpse.\n\nOh ok...but why did he/ she delete it after Â¿ hmmm","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2018-03-05T22:35:32.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of what they do, Fiddle should still be a scarecrow or some sort.\n\nI'm more interested to see what direction they push him.
