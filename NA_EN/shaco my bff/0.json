Did your game recently crash or was the client closed mid update?  It sounds like your patcher is scanning your game files for corruption.  If that's the case, it has to finish performing repairs as restarting it would start it all over again.  I'm assuming that's the case here!","replies":[{"poster":"Shaco my BFF","date":"2016-12-14T18:34:39.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no, such problems. Everything worked fine. Just this morning it scanned for files and downloaded ~470 MB worth of data and \"updated\" the game. I've played fine since then as well.","replies":[]}]}]}
