(Rounded up) The price with Leona was 3600 RP. (I round up a lot when it comes to buying / renting.) \nAnyways, I went to work figuring it out. The Bundle, should be 3401 (With out Leona.) This is based on the 1900 (Rounded up) For the first Skin, the 1001 for the Second Skin, then the 500, (250 per Icon) next. \nSo it should be 1900 + 1001 + 500 = 3401.\n\nJust to double check and make sure I was not going crazy, I rented one Skin (PRAISE THE MOON!)\nand saw the price of the bundle drop to 2102.\nWhich leads into 1001 + 500 = 1501 which is Less then 2102. \n\nMy Dudes, what is going on here? We are paying more for a bundle that should be a little cheaper if not equal to the face value of it.\n\n(Also if you have not read the TOS in full, we only Rent the Skins. Unless you are in the UK, then you own them.)\n\nTHERE IT IS! The Borders were missing from my Numbers. That becomes roughtly 300 RP per Border with the rented Skin before hand. \n\nOr 100 Each with the full Bundle. \n\n(The border info needs to be added swiftly my Dudes)","replies":[]}
