If you ever see that LPQ timer resetting for no reason, be sure to take a screenshot like this and shoot it our way. Once we can see this, we should be able to get it fixed up.","replies":[{"poster":"DarthDDD","date":"2017-12-15T19:48:33.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I sent it in and guess what I got NOTHING for wasting my time.

Things do not happen in an hour. When you submit a support ticket, it gets placed in a queue along with *all* other support tickets that have been issued. This being a weekend (in the USA) as well as being submitted at a non-business time likely means you will need to wait for tomorrow *at least* for a response. If you continue to submit more tickets or comment on your existing ones to \"bump\" them they will move back to the end of the queue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarthDDD","date":"2017-12-11T01:42:26.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please upvote this so riot can see because i submitted a ticket and they do not respond!
