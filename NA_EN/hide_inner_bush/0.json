You were punished for misbehaving in _two more_ games, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the logs that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several logs. You might see three logs, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.\n\nGame 1: you spent the entire time arguing and whining.\n\nGame 2: you spent most of the time accusing teammates of trolling, talking about how they'll be banned, and arguing.\n\nYou weren't anything _but_ toxic and negative.","replies":[{"poster":"Hide inner Bush","date":"2019-08-11T08:53:12.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-11T10:02:38.554+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hide inner Bush,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=La1K6AfV,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-08-11T08:53:12.265+0000)\n>\n>..Removed by Moderation..\n\nHey!\n\nI don't work for Riot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hide inner Bush","date":"2019-08-11T08:56:29.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Upgrades","date":"2019-08-11T09:07:43.222+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro calm down lol","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hide inner Bush","date":"2019-08-11T08:55:14.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-08-11T09:02:41.263+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":">snip\n\nYou say this for human beings over a silly ban?
