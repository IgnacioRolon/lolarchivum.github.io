In my opinion this was the case but isn't anymore.\r\nI'm Playing league of Legends since season 4, and there is clearly something different and it's not just that mages deal less dmg, that i don't think that this statement today is wrong. Adcs in season 4-5 had no waveclear whatsoever. Today they have huge waveclear and extra dmg (shiv) for no reason at all.\r\nThis indeed makes the mage midgame WORSE. Why? Simple, a adc can just 1aa click and the entire wave is gone that the mage tries to push in, at the same time, since the adc only has to click once, he is much saver and it's way harder to engage on him, this allows the adc Player to do alot more things on his own, but at the same time, this feels unfair to the mage Player. \r\nSo riot made a update on the Ap itemization, and yes there are some good things, however it's not adressing the real Problems that our class has. \r\n\r\nFirst off i have to say Goodjob riot you indeed helped us slightly with ludens as a starting item, or archangel staff, but there was no way you could honestly make it even Worser compared to Season 6 or 7.\r\nI want to count one certain thing out that makes our class being So weak to solo carry games.\r\nAp &lt;- Almost every item today gives us only 80AP on average, while back in the day we could shift our build to snowball mod, and we could buy 120Ap items. Meanwhile riot thinks mages are to weak lategame, so they keep shifting the power into voidstaff and rabadons which is not the Problem.\r\nThe changed rabadons build path is good. the 40% ap scaling however is garbage, rabadons should give less ap Scaling, and voidstaff should give less penetration. At the same time there should be much more Ap items that give us around 100Ap on average so that it balances out for 6 items. \r\nWe are currently way to weak with 1-2 Full items in our inventory. \r\n\r\n(i feel much stronger lategame compared to midgame as a mage right now, and we are suppossed to be bad lategame, i think alot of Players have not realised this yet, but i think that the midgame is just even worse now)\r\n\r\nDo you Guys think you are stronger midgame or lategame on a Mage currently?","replies":[{"poster":"Disembark","date":"2018-02-27T13:55:45.428+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mage item rework pushed them from mid game to late game.","replies":[{"poster":"Jmman","date":"2018-02-27T19:46:59.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are mages really late game compared to Tanks/adcs/bruisers?\n\nMy opinion is they are a shell compared to the \"other\" late game types.

Even if it's just a little it does indirectly nerf the Mage. To top it off almost every Ap item as a Single item has lost ap, while rabadons keeps getting stronger and stronger. If i remember correctly in season 5 rabadons gave only 30% Ap and we still reached the same amount of ap in total, this is because the power of a Single item kept getting shiftet towards rabadons, and this makes us weaker on our first two items, like it or not. it's a fact and we can't deny that, if u read the items numbers past season you will clearly notice of how much Ap we have lost lol.\n\n(this is why i said mages aren't strong anymore midgame like alot of people still say)\n\nAll i want is a 120Ap full damage item, can't i ask for that one thing that allows me maybe to dominate the game by makro and right decision making? because i kept solo Killing my laner 4-5 times? I think it's unfair that a Adc is allowed to do exactly that, but the mage is so much harder limited in fear of toxic burst and much more. If riot would give us a 120Ap item and reduces rabas passive to 30% back, it would be WAY better.","replies":[{"poster":"Geshultz","date":"2018-02-27T23:18:53.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean they did do it this patch.

In my opinion they should change the active or remove it. \nFor example (capped at 50Stacks/duration increased to 7 second)\nOr u remove the active entirely and just add 20extra ap on it. \nI don't think that it's a good snowball item, but yeah it is in some kind of way a snowball item, i still dislike it, and think riot could have made it work better for mages, without making it broken.\nThere is also still a huge difference when shiv get's purchased as a third item rather then being the first item^^ I know that it doesn't get rushed as a first item every time. but mostly of the time Adcs build {{item:1038}}  followed by {{item:3087}}  and then they start to heavely waveclear already at 12 minutes. Can we just ignore shiv for a moment and talk About the other thingys XD. I only mentioned shiv for being one of the reasons why mages aren't that impactful Midgame currently. I'm not completely blaming shiv. One item does not break everything, It's a bit of everything that has been changed in the Past.\nFor example i do agree that mages were to Strong and that their items like \"dfg\" had to be removed or that \"zhonyas\" had to be nerft. However i do not think that almost every item that once gave 120-100Ap had to be nerft and i think that this all adds up to a very very bad Snowball effect for the Mage class.\nThe current ludens also get's overated by alot, While yes, it indeed does help mages, but the effect is not as big as alot of Players think, the reason for that is the Cost for the Items.\n\nOld {{item:3165}}  for example costed 2900 gold\nIt gave us 100Ap, same cdr, and the mana on kill back.\n\nWhile {{item:3285}} costs 3.3K gold \ngives 90Ap, 20% cdr, instead of mana per kill back 500Mana, and the passive of Ludens.\nIf u just look at the gold difference you could basically say, to get ludens now, you would have gotten {{item:3165}}  and a {{item:1052}} \nthat alone together gives us 120ap vs 90 AP. So ludens Yes it is better, but Players keep thinking we deal 200extra damage, when the damage actually is more like around 50-60 full combo, and that isn't enough to fix it.\nAlso riot wanted us to go either ludens or glp, however they guttet Glp. I was one of the only Ahri mains that always buildet glp on the old patch. Now it's just worthless, the same cost, no hp anymore which was a big + before update. 200Mana more that a burst mage doesn't want anyways, and the active is just worthless. it doesn't pierce through enemys anymore, which means in alot of situations you can't land it on alot of targets + the ap scaling got almost halfed, it basically deals no damage compared to before.\nRiot wanted to archieve that we can rush different first items with the changes, but all that we do now, is building ludens instead of morello, and dps mages like ryze cassio, rush seraph.","replies":[{"poster":"Geshultz","date":"2018-02-27T23:41:29.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's kinda the point of the item.

The issue with Hextech GLP in the past was it was a generalist item giving health, mana, sustain, average abilitity power ontop of a good build path with an active to get stickiness, waveclear and extra damage. Meaning the item couldn't really get buffed by riot without making it mandatory on every mage in the game. Overall, the overall ability power count went up for mages that want to scale; well, more snowbally champs got an item to increase their burst potential with luden's echo and help with mana.
