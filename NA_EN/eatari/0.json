She has the best passive in the game, getting hit by an enemy champion grants 100 MS until out of combat, she has a low cooldown dash with no mana cost, and has some of best out of combat health regen. She just gets hit once and runs away to full heal, it’s so toxic. Riot, please fix this mobility creep, I can’t catch Rift Scuttler anymore. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nIrelia","replies":[{"poster":"KatMainWannabe","date":"2019-06-26T20:29:22.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And don't forget that they have BASE 100 Armor and Magic Resist AND 1000+ base health.
