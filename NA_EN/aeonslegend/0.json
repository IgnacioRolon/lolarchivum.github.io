In the settings I see MB2 for movement and I can't change it back. I deleted the config folder and started and exitted a custom game as per RIOT advice elsewhere but that didn't work.

I managed to fix it by following the advice of another player. These were the steps:\n\n1) Login\n2) Delete your Config folder (this includes PersistedSettings.json and input.ini)\n3) Go into a custom game (you should now have default settings)\n4) Change left click attack to some random button to create input file (I.e N)\n5) Ext game\n6) Edit input file:\n\n[GameEvents]\nevtPlayerMoveClick=[Button 1]\n\n((Include two blank lines for spacing from the top and none on the bottom.))\n\n7) Save the input.ini file.\n8) Log in to the problem account\n9) Start a custom game for testing\n10) When the game is running and you're in game, delete the PersistedSettings file\n11) Log out and Ext game\n12) Log back in ((The client should now automatically reload the PersistedSettings file with the same info as your input.ini file to reflect your proper mouse keybindings.","replies":[{"poster":"AeonsLegend","date":"2017-03-17T05:20:56.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I somehow get the feeling I mixed up my keybindings in my head from playing Diablo 3 too much lately.
