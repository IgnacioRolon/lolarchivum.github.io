I was recently banned on my new account, TopOfLobby. It was the account i made after my main Takesl1l2win was banned. So, i have been reading that you need to have warning to be perm banned but i was permanent banned without a suspension like 2 days or 2 weeks on takesl1l2win. All i got was you have been perm banned, I did have some chat banns prior but never a small suspension. Now on to my other account TopofLobby, yes i can be very salty in games but i usually apologize and have a great game after (not saying I&#039;m good or anything). Well after a game one day i got 2 week banned, then perm banned after. And i believe i deserve a second chance, I have been being a better sport and trying to be better but it&#039;s frustrating when a master yi hit&#039;s q and 1 hits me when I&#039;m 15 kills up. Now agway&#039;s off that topic, I&#039;ve spent 500 dollars total on all these accounts and 100 on this one because i really do try to help out Riot because i believe they&#039;re a great company. It is just that i think i can be a better player and really just want my account TopOfLobby back. If you guy&#039;s have any idea of what i can do, would be very appreciated. Thanks :D\n\n\nEdit 1) Nightstick24 (NA) - about 10 hours ago\n\nWow, I don't even know what you would have to say in chat to get perma-banned, I know someone who literally tells people to drink bleach, hang themselves and he'll tie the knot, threatens and actually does DDoS, and generally wishes cancer and death upon people and the best he's gotten is the \"you've been reported for inappropriate language\" popup. If that doesn't even warrant a chat ban, I don't know how you'd straight to a perma ban.\n\nOK, so here's how it's gonna go I didn't swear once. And I get reported for offensive language?? Ok, and how weren't my teammates ever reported for saying get cancer and kill your self, when I never said anything like that. So RIOT its gonna go like this , I pay 500 dollars to help you guys out and get treated like a piece of dog shit. I really don't care about the money I lost I just care about how when I make a ticket or when I email I get no response. Thanks for nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-02-03T21:31:03.476+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"> i have been reading that you need to have warning to be perm banned\n\nThis is untrue.

I have controlled my anger. stopped using drugs that escalated my anger in games and towards other players. I know I was being toxic back then and was not good for the league community. I'm wondering if you can give me one more chance to show that I really have changed. I don't curse, blame others, rage, let things bother me when it's just a game. I hope you are able to give me a chance. My name is DrugsandPaper(which I plan on changing if giving the opportunity). I played a few seasons and made it to plat 3 was the highest rank. I miss all the champs I had and it's hard to enjoy the game when you have to start out fresh. I've been playing on Kevint123 if you want to review any last games to make sure I was playing fairly and not saying any choice words. I'm starting a new account-- 21savageNosnitch so please review these and hopefully you will give me the opportunity of getting back my account! thanks for taking the time to read this.

If you play a champion like with no escape, and not meant to 1v1 lets say ADC you can pull off play. you play caitlyn he jumps, you set up traps under you and he gets bind. but I doubt you can kill him since adc are meant to have peel, but enough to run away unless you crit like crazy or like draven lol. NO champion is op, they are just strong when fed. If noone in your team has cc with no damage of course it seems like his OP but really you guys are just 3-4 levels under with 0 cc. NO SUCH THING OP CHAMPION EXCEPT SKILL every champion takes skill regardless if you just press R and Q and thats it, positioning, timing its very essential but if you team is low elo of course his OP lol hue hue hue heu hue","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rendexes","date":"2016-02-04T14:59:36.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait Riot, so people are saying that they say get cancer etc, I didn't swear once in my chat logs?
