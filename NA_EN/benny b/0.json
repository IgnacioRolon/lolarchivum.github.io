Zeke&#039;s is one of my favorite items even though I rarely buy it. It feels like a really good/strong item when I have a team comp that makes good use of it. What&#039;s wrong with having niche items? Build variety is one of my favorite aspects of the game and it feels like each role is slowly being pigeonholed in to &quot;one size fits all&quot; builds.\r\n\r\nDo you guys have a problem with aura items? Are they considered &quot;hidden power&quot;? First you took away WOTA, now Zeke&#039;s, next will be Abyssal, and we will be left with only Frozen Heart and the Aegis items. Are they next? Or is it only offensive auras you have a problem with?\r\n\r\nSame deal with Runeglaive. Why can&#039;t we have Magus as well? Why limit our options in lieu of giving us more? Are you worried  about our options becoming too convoluted? Because I&#039;m starting to worry about having no options at all. It&#039;s starting to feel too casual. Why not just go full HotS and just give us loadouts to choose from?","replies":[{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-06-29T21:30:30.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason they are updating, not removing Zeke's is because no one buys it... or rarely buys it.","replies":[{"poster":"Benny B","date":"2015-06-29T22:20:48.311+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's wrong with that?

Especially in AD heavy comps, Zeke's is a very decent and fairly cheap way of giving everyone a nice little boost to their overall killing potential, especially in big team fights. That's what it's meant to be, and niche item or no it does the job very well!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-06-30T01:51:08.385+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed","replies":[]}]}
