Then as soon as you hit promos, you get people who literally seem like it is their first ranked game EVER. I mean I go Annie mid vs. Swain and our Irelia is struggling against Riven top. I camp for him, kill riven 3 times and she is 1-4 and I&#039;m 6-0 at this point. He proceeds to then feed her 4 times in a row. MEANWHILE BOT, our Miss Fortune goes 1-13 (THIRTEEN). How is that even POSSSIBLE?!?\n\nI feel like it is set up in the code somewhere that they find people who are absolute feeders, and they put 3-4 of them in with someone in their promos to make them have to attain a tryhard level of over 9000 just to have a chance at winning.

Nobody ever climbs the ladder, everyone stays at bronze forever, despite the fact that there were two teams in your game and someone had to win, but let's disregard that and agree that only your perspective matters and Riot specifically programmed your account to be matched with trolls and feeders while the enemy team gets challenjour.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-04-25T01:44:13.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"must be plat promos.","replies":[]}]}
