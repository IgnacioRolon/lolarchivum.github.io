I was outfarming the enemy Kalista Thresh about 40 to 29 CS and we got in our first fight. Kalista flashes and goes down to 7%ish and I use heal to give us a speed boost and then flash to go tag her. My FULL HP Nautlius support runs behind the minions towards turret and literally sits back there dancing back and forth while I&#039;m fighting a 1v2 against them. Literally for the rest of the match I see him constantly run away full hp every fight.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know if its cause I can&#039;t stand sissies in real life or what, but fk this pisses me off. For the life of me, I cannot understand how hard it is to see that you have FREE kills sitting there, and yes your flash will be down for a few minutes-- but we can go ahead and snowball instead of them being able to if you would just HELP. This is my least played role because I don&#039;t like having to depend on anyone else to have my back and this is the reason why. Grow a FUCKING SACK SUPPORTS. STOP RUNNING WHEN YOU HAVE FULL FREAKING HP.","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2015-04-13T15:16:27.727+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"It may have been a risky kill. You don't need to burn your flashes for kills as a squishy, very squishy ADC, as that just asks for ganks you are going to have trouble with. You already won the trade hardcore by denying Kalista farm if she backs or a much easier kill that doesn't need flash if she stays.\n\nFurthermore, Nautilus is an extremely heavy engage support, who tends to blow his cool downs upfront with little followup, unfortunately resulting in one moment of awesomeness followed by multiple seconds of staggering around. If he backs off, it's because he can't do anything, I would think.\n\nNo but seriously, if you're not experienced with ADC, just remember this tip: You being alive is more valuable than the enemies being dead. Wasting flash to get a kill leaves you for 5 minutes way more vulnerable as usual, which as the class who relies on DPS damage and farming the most, wasted time from being dead or injured is the absolute worst thing that can happen to you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-04-13T17:23:18.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a former support with quite a bit of experience, one thing I have noticed is there is a stark difference between supports and ADC's perception of kill potential, particularly speaking, supports seem to recognize when something will result in a kill, whereas ADC for some odd reason have such an incredibly pigeonhole vision of whether or not they can get a kill. \n\nIf your support backs off, chances are you should back off, even as a Jungler, I've noticed consistently that ADC has no concept of kill potential whereas the support usually does. I.E. the support usually tends to know better if something will result in a kill or not. I can't tell you how many times I'll be top lane finishing a gank or clear, and observe as my bottom lane attempts a 2v2 and not only am I able to tell if the battle will result in a kill for them, the support does...but the ADC does not for some reason. \n\nThe ADC's damage is constant, support usually is not, so once the support's combo is used up, its very easy for the support to tell if something will result in a kill or not.\n\nAlthough, I will digress, from the sound of it, you just had a pretty bad support Nautilus. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Camped by Dad,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=j2LTv0IJ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-13T16:56:20.725+0000)\n>\n> support circlejerk here will prove you wrong, they think they cant tank if they dont focus them thats why cinderhulk tank in this game is useless according to them\n\nSo you expect an Annie or a Morgana to tank up turret shots or retribution damage for a long amount of time? If its a Nautilus, sure I can understand, but even the heaviest of tank supports have their limits as to how much they can take. Supports need to stay in the lane as well, you can't be trading half of your hp in one go every single time. \n\nIf you're forced to B after every trade, than your support is going to be even more useless than if they just back off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Salidfingers","date":"2015-04-13T21:28:30.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A circle jerk can be a reference to a group or counsel that have decided to acknowledge what is right and wrong versus an individual judgement.\n\nSo if i fall under a circle jerk for following a vast majority, because my opinion follows so called circle jerk....

As a bot lane main (both adc and support), it's not worth to blow all of your summoner spells aggressively as ADC unless you are guaranteed the kill without any further help. Even then, it can be better to hold onto them and just let the Kalista go back and lose farm while you push to turret. It can be just as effective as \"snowballing\" because ADC does not NEED to get kills early to come out ahead, though it's always welcome.\n\nAlso she support doesn't always have to react to your engages (or simply can't), but you sure should react to theirs. Support is the one who carries the lane. If you have a bad support, the lane will obviously suffer, and all you can do is stay even/ahead in farm and don't try to make plays that require their help. A lot of people are inexperienced supports and dislike bot lane just as much as you. You can always encourage them to be more aggressive if they are being super passive, but you have to work with what you've got.\n\nFull HP =/= able and ready to fight, because cooldowns exist. And supports usually aren't the best punching bags during laning phase.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kariu Rena","date":"2015-04-13T16:56:20.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"support circlejerk here will prove you wrong, they think they cant tank if they dont focus them thats why cinderhulk tank in this game is useless according to them","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-13T21:10:30.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god forbid people have varying opinions.
