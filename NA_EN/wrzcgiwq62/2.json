I cannot tell you how many games I lose because I get so strong that the enemy team knows all they have to do is focus me-- and then my tank decides that he&#039;s never going to engage them and just hide waiting for me to do something. Yes I can kill them, if you allow me time and protection. All I need is for you to be a distracting meat shield and let them HAVE to focus on you instead so that I can do a shitload of damage and win the fight. Yes you might die, but if you keep them on you long enough-- chances are we will win the fight because I&#039;m getting to focus on their damage dealers. If you continue to hide behind me, then they are going to dive and focus me and even if they lose 2 people-- with the rest of the team not being fed you are going to lose us the game. PLEASE START ENGAGING, I am so sick of losing games because you play like a sissy and won&#039;t go in.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-04-22T21:04:16.694+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know, there's a nice way and a wrong way to go about bringing up this issue.\n\nI agree with the issue, but your delivery could be a little bit more polite.","replies":[{"poster":"Rebel Xayah","date":"2015-04-22T21:12:18.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yuuup, if you try this in team chat(The phrasing I mean), you'll just have them get upset and it could put them on tilt.
