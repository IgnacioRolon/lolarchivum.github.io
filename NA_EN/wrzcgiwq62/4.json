If they really are checking these reports...","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just finished a 70 or so game chat restriction, and I get one game restriction free and not only during these times have I received MANY +Teamwork +Honorable Opponent +Friendly +Helpful votes, I have not trolled or been toxic during these games. I keep my mouth SHUT unless it's to say what I'm doing or maybe call an objective. I did have a game where a quadra que reported me because they wanted to back up their friend who thought I was a bad jungler, who actually verbally abused me the whole game. \r\n\r\nSo is this kind of a once you have been selected as a chat restriction, if you get reported ONE TIME.. they triple the chat ban automatically? I think this is ridiculous. I really want to start playing ranked again and I CANNOT COMFORTABLY DO SO WITH MY CHAT LOCKED. Even if I just mute everyone for these next 150 games and literally don't say one word, there will be someone who doesn't like the way I play, or I might have one bad game and get reported-- then I get a 300 chat restriction game? Come on. This is a fail system.\r\n\r\nI find it hard to believe that instantly when I get out of chat restriction that tribunal has already looked through reports and tacked that on. I guess there's no innocent til proven guilty in this judgement system, huh?","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2015-03-19T03:15:45.047+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fun fact: Tribunal has been down for quite awhile and the punishments have been doled out by automated systems.

People who spam reports for no reason usually have their report 'weight' count as next to nothing. Obviously that doesn't help you right now, sorry, not much I can do personally.\n\nBut yes, if you're just recovering from a ban you may get a harsher punishment if the system registers you as crossing the line again. Not saying that's actually what happened, just explaining why the scale. Iirc, metrics such as honors do also play a role in the 'parole time' (for lack of a better word) but I'm not 100% on that.","replies":[{"poster":"wRZcGiWq62","date":"2015-03-19T03:41:33.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, well thanks for the info.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-03-19T17:35:30.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say people who spam report should have that button removed.
