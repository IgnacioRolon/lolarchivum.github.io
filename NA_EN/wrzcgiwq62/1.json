You know he's OP and instead you nerf champions who arent, why?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":7,"down_votes":24,"body":"He is the one of the most OP champs in the game. He is basically the equivalent of LeBlanc pre-silence nerf. His damage is absolutely insane, I can&#039;t think of a character who snowballs harder except for maybe a REALLY  fed Riven. It is time to address it. You can&#039;t keep nerfing champions who don&#039;t deserve it and keep overlooking abominations like this. An invulnerability, gap closing escape damage buff ultimate, and another escape on top of it, basically capable of 75%-0% anybody at level 6 with a cutlass or brutalizer and able to get out UNTOUCHED or maybe one turret shot if that player is underneath a turret. Dude is an absolute joke, 1 kill and then every 60 seconds this clown is going to get you no matter what. As a mage you are basically left to try your best to rush a Zhonya&#039;s but just trying to farm that up after he&#039;s got 1 or 2 kills ahead means every second you are risking snowballing him more. Not to mention unlimited harass from miles away, dude sits under turret and throws shurikens with his ghost that hit the other player at THEIR turret. Be real, it is time to nerf this clown-- people have had their fun. You nerfed LeBlanc, let&#039;s nerf Zed.","replies":[{"poster":"HAIL WHYDRA","date":"2015-04-12T00:52:11.239+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"And, if you don't mind me asking, what do you propose Riot should do?

Her kit counters a lot of things in his kit. She has 3 \"peels\", her slow, her heal/speed buff, and intervention. The only down side to Kayle is that in theory, she beats him. In practice, I have beat Kayles in ranked that choose her just to counter me. They ult too early, or they go too deep to poke. Then again Im bronze, but there are errors on both sides could do to win. Just because a champion or item counters, doesn't mean you cant work your way around it.
