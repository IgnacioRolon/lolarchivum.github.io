Wtf Rito how about you find a fix. Going from 100 + fps to 8 fps cause sound is on is absurd.. So my question is are you guys at Rito actually trying to find a fix or you just hoping if you ignore issue long enough it will go away? Cause from all my past experience with Rito support that seems to be your standard go to.","replies":[{"poster":"eroliko","date":"2017-06-28T17:16:21.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fixed that very easily, just instal \"realtek high definition audio\" and it's done.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-22T18:26:10.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was an issue a number of patches ago that affected FPS with specific configurations on Macs.

I went through your fps guide and the only thing that made it better was disabling the sound. I know Rito's go to is it's your provider or computer when they don't know the answer to a question. Well it's not my computer, I've run multiple trace routes which were fine and everything else Rito support tells ya to do.. The problem is most assuredly on Rito's end, and has to do with game sounds.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-23T22:03:12.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the steps taken so far to troubleshoot this!
