As a Lulu Support main, or as I'm sure many Janna, Karma, Thresh, Lux, Morgana (did I miss anyone?) can also attest, a HUGE portion of their impact on the game is completely ignored. While it is true that playing well has it's own merits, having something to point at and say, \"Yeah, I did that.\" is nice too.\r\n\r\nWe can calculate the amount the shield absorbs, we can track whether enough damage is dealt to break it. Can we track how much damage is mitigated if it doesn't break? I'm no programmer, but w/ the amount of detailed stats that are kept track of, it would seem possible to tack this one onto the list.\r\n\r\nI for one, would be pleased to see this added to end-game stats.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n- A devoted Lulu Supporter","replies":[{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2015-03-19T21:03:17.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"but lulu is top not support kappa","replies":[{"poster":"Kitten of Evil","date":"2015-03-20T00:21:54.394+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"lulu goes where she pleases","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2015-03-19T19:47:41.165+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be good for {{item:3190}} {{item:3401}} too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-03-19T19:56:22.580+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"This would be awesome because supports, especially Lulu's, usually get the whole 'wtf, you were useless the entire game' 'No, I bubbled you and everything.'
