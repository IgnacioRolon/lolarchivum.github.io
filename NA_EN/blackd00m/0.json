I know that I am not a pbe player but please consider my opinion as I saw a lot of pbe players playing with her. The thing is that this skin has a yellow/gold particles and it is so good but the passive of Kalista W when she hits someone or her ally hits the passive procs in green as her default skin. Can&#039;t U make it proc in yellow like her spears and everything else. Also when they use runnans hurricane the extra spears are green not yellow like the real ones so please consider these bugs please. Another thing to notice that this Skin has no SKT T1 icon neither in the outfit nor in any ability animation and thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-01T21:55:20.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey XxBLACKD00MxX - \n\nThanks for the report! \n\nThis has since been resolved. the particles are now yellow/blue.
