I&#039;d love to get some feedback on how I could improve it (asides from the gloves and hair).\nAlthough I wasn&#039;t too pleased by my hair color, I was going for a style like in the first photo (I despise wigs.)\nNo gloves because of time constraints.\n\nOut of everything the props are my favorite. I decided to add led lights thanks to inspiration from [Kadu Out Cosplay](https://www.facebook.com/Kaduout).\n\nCredit to [Kiyouko](http://kiyouko.deviantart.com/) for the artwork.\n\n{{champion:245}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-08-04T01:33:34.742+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man, the Doctor would have been _very_ displeased with Ekko's time-manipulating shenanigans.

Doctor would more than likely dislike the Z-Drive more than a Vortex Manipulator.\n\nThank you! I'm glad I have been getting positive responses, especially since this was a last minute project.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kayakninja","date":"2015-08-04T06:33:18.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I want to see that episode now. :P Maybe not with Capaldi, though.
