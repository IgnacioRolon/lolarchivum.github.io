The Duo would not listen to him, and kept being toxic towards me. In the matter of 10 minutes, the players were extremely negative, and I was positive again. We could easily win the game if they would just focus, and infinity told them this. When he said that we could win, they started talking trash about him saying he wasn’t even doing that well (even though he was) but they would not stop. Before we knew it, one of them was like 1/9 and the other was AFK, but the rest of the team was doing ok together and we won a team fight. When we started winning fights again, the AFK player came back, tried for like 2 minutes, died, then decided to repeatedly kill himself in game. Towards the end of the game, Infinity said something with some sort of slang attached with it, and one of the players said Something like “lol are you black?” Infinity responded with yes, and the player started to make fun of him in chat because he said he was. \n\nOf all the things I have seen in this game, what infinity did is the last thing I would guess would end up in a Ban.
