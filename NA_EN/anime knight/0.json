With league sometimes things happen, we are all human and sometimes weither it be toxic behaviour or using cheats we all make mistakes, its in our nature. I really think Riot should Create a Earn back your account system Where you have to play like 1000 games or something without getting one report, in order to get back a perma banned account.

Everyone on the forums has said they have had multiple prior punishments, or Tantram has come down and corrected them and disclosing the number of prior punishments.\n\nNo one should ever be permabanned for one toxic game unless it was the most extreme of extreme cases. \n\nI'm not sure where you're getting your examples from but LOTS of people on the forum lie about their punishment history and claim they're getting unreasonably punished by either editing their chat log or lying about their punishment history. They think that getting the forum's sympathy means they'll get their punishment reversed, but we don't have that power. Player support does, and they can see full chat logs, full punishment histories, and what not. We, the forum, only see what players post and what Tantram posts to correct lies that players have made.","replies":[{"poster":"CubanThund3r","date":"2018-05-15T00:13:36.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what No i was saying that they can have this 1000 game challenge or w/e and then if they pass and get their account back. if they are toxic on their main just once then they can get instant perma banned. so that after getting their 3+ year old account back they can only ruin one game maximum\n\nand yes if a person who's all bark and no bite says if you don't stop i'm going to punch you, sure you deserve the punch but in almost any situation one of them would end up apologizing and they would both be on... neutral terms    it's not arguing whether or not the punishment was deserving or who's fault it was but like it's 3+ years riot can just unlock the accounts and have them on thin ice (as if they just came off a 14 day ban)     it gives the player one chance at their account that was made before season 5 and all in all it really doesn't affect riot or the community because the banned person either is still playing or has quit forever","replies":[{"poster":"YerroFever","date":"2018-05-15T04:54:06.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CubanThund3r,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=deov8VPV,comment-id=000900000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-15T00:13:36.689+0000)\n>\n> what No i was saying that they can have this 1000 game challenge or w/e and then if they pass and get their account back. if they are toxic on their main just once then they can get instant perma banned. so that after getting their 3+ year old account back they can only ruin one game maximum\n> \n> and yes if a person who&#x27;s all bark and no bite says if you don&#x27;t stop i&#x27;m going to punch you, sure you deserve the punch but in almost any situation one of them would end up apologizing and they would both be on... neutral terms    it&#x27;s not arguing whether or not the punishment was deserving or who&#x27;s fault it was but like it&#x27;s 3+ years riot can just unlock the accounts and have them on thin ice (as if they just came off a 14 day ban)     it gives the player one chance at their account that was made before season 5 and all in all it really doesn&#x27;t affect riot or the community because the banned person either is still playing or has quit forever\n\nRiot already tried it and based on their numbers, 95% of permabanned toxic players that contacted player support and agreed to 1 on 1 counseling on player behavior with support specialists didn't reform. So, that's just the people who contacted player support and said they wanted to reform.

I just want to say that in this example the accounts would probably be older than 2 months - 2 years(seasons) giving a good amount of time for that player to have reformed. second, the game is way bigger than it is today and probably way less fun to grind lvl 1-30 so in season 1-2 Unless they had already been high in the ranks or REALLY wanted the money they spent on the account they were probably just playing the game for some stress relief and to direct their anger towards others, and not thinking about the possible rare skins they would be losing and stuff so it'd be like making a new account in Fortnite if you spent no money on it. you really don't care about the levels you'd lose in fortnite\n\n5. @BeatzBoyFTW I can tell you from personal experience that after getting 1000 game chat mutes (yes legit those happend back in season 1-4?) I never once thought that I would get permanently banned, honestly I thought it was like as long as I don't threaten your family tell you to kys. use racist stuff that I would just keep getting chat restricts or like 7 day ban. if it's your first account and it's way back when nobody in those days actually expected a permanent ban because we had our own opinions of what is deserving of a permanent ban and it was unheard of.\n\nagain what reason is there to NOT bring back all old accounts after some appeal or 1000 games programme and then when you finally get the account. you have to go for like 6 months of (regular) playing without saying a SINGLE negative thing or you get instantly banned?  again It would only affect one game.","replies":[]}]}
