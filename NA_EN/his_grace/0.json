If I let my mouse sit still for a few seconds, the entire display freezes, but it reverts to normal with no lag/anything if I move the mouse even a little bit. If the mouse keeps moving, all is good.\r\n\r\nI've looked for solutions (I tried unchecking the shake to find cursor option - it was already unchecked), and nothing's working. Please help. It's maddening trying to play and having to move the mouse constantly for fear of the screen freezing up.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-14T20:15:36.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We found that this issue occurred as a result of the shake mouse to locate feature, so it's strange that it's still happening.  Hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so our tech team can take a closer look into this with you.

I reinstalled the game, and the issue went away for a few minutes before returning and staying. At the moment I'm playing in 'Borderless' mode, and that's working, but it's hard to adjust. I've submitted the ticket.","replies":[]}]}]}
