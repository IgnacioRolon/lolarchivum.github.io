When i play at home i dont have any issues connecting to games or playing but if i go to a friends house and try to load onto rift to start a game, it crashes and i get a bug splat (everytime) no matter what account im on. Ive disabled all firewalls, repaired client, and updated drives but no matter what, i cannot get into any type of game (normal, bot, custom). Any help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-11T03:25:06.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you play at your friend's house, are you using the same exact computer and display or are you using a different display when you play there? We've seen some crashes like this happen if there's a difference in the Display Resolution between two different displays being played on. If this is the case, we should be able to resolve this fairly easily.","replies":[]}]}
