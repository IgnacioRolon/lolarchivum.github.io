Maybe some of us have been that problem.  I personally have definitely been that problem.  The response to this behavior runs the gambit, but it almost always makes the problem worse.\r\n\r\nI want to help you guys out.  Here&#039;s how to deal with a flamer:\r\n\r\n_**OPTION A**_:     Give him what he wants.  What does he want?  I&#039;M SO GLAD YOU ASKED.  He wants someone to understand where he&#039;s coming from.  Someone to see his point.  Someone to acknowledge the unfairness that has made that person temporarily insane.  I know this because I&#039;ve been that flamer, and nothing is more calming than when someone listens to what you&#039;re saying. \r\n\r\nIf you give them what they want, chances are they&#039;ll start to calm down and play the game.  A good example: &quot;hey man, I totally get how you&#039;re tilting off that laning phase.  Some machups are total BS in the top lane.  But lets try to turn this game around now.&quot;\r\n\r\n_**OPTION B**_:     Sometimes you can&#039;t stop a person from flaming.  So mute him, and encourage your teammates to do the same.  This won&#039;t always work, but at least you can stop worrying about it.\r\n\r\nI know this advice may seem obvious, but it&#039;s shocking how few players utilize these options in their games.  Leveraging these tips, especially option A, will most certainly result in a greater quantity of W&#039;s.\r\n\r\nThank you &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"CloudedLogic","date":"2018-04-10T17:16:46.162+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I disagree completely with option A. At no point am I obligated to agree with someone for harassing another person as it will never be called for. If someone can't handle losing a GAME for 20-30 minutes without breaking down and doing some awful things (harassing/insulting people, inting, etc) then imo they deserve the report/ban. Using the terms \"temporarily insane\" is just an excuse to justify their crappy behavior.\n\nIn my opinion the only reasonable way to deal with a flamer is to first mute them, that way things won't get (that much) worse. Then once the game is done report them.\n\nBelieve it or not there are players out there who see people inting, or see them basically screaming in all chat to \"report X player\" and realize what is going on. Some will also report you for doing stuff like that.\n\nIn fact last weekend was the first time in a long time I had to deal with someone like that, and I got the pop up that he was punished by the end of my next game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-04-10T16:34:02.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great guide! But you forgot to mention to report them after the game so that other people won't have to put up with their bullshit in the future. Also, often politely asking them to calm down can help as well when you aren't the person they are directing flame at.","replies":[]}]}
