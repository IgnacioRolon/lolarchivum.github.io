Given that, what item combined with spatula should they give?  Considering blademasters' central bonus is increased attack speed, the bow fits.\n\nThematically, it would make more sense to turn into a ranger, but the ranger buff isn't built to be able to easily add other champs into it.  For one, the increase happens every 2 champs (instead of blademaster's 3), so it would be OP if you could easily get 4+ Rangers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Werdi","date":"2019-08-28T11:12:17.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should, have been wondering the same","replies":[]}]}
