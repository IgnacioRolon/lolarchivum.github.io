When I try to reconnect to the game I instantly get bugsplats and it's impossible to load in. I tried submitting a support ticket but you can't log in to the support website right now so I figured I would post here for a faster response.\n\nI can post my logs if it helps.\n\nThanks\n\nEDIT: I have updated my computer, my graphics drivers, repaired my client, uninstalled and reinstalled the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-24T01:14:14.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When a bugsplat happens, it's usually because of a poor interaction with your display drivers or a problem with your hardware.
