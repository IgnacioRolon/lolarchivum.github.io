That Discord is open to *nearly* everyone, even permabanned Boards accounts, as that is the official mechanism to request case reviews.  EDIT:  However, as Djinn tells me, you can get yourself banned from Discord too if you violate the rules there - so it's best to approach with kindness and courtesy.\n\nYou *can* get banned from League and all of its affiliated programs 100% forever if you do *really* bad things - any actionable threats fall under that line, as does serial ban evading, or any kind of hacking, and certainly any criminal behavior not otherwise covered here -  so I do encourage people not to ever try.\n\nFor the overwhelming majority of cases however, Discord review is possible and encouraged for those who genuinely feel they have been wronged.\n\nContrary to a lot of public opinion, we are not power-mad and unreasonable people.   We are just generally speaking people who simply want to help keep the Boards free of bullying and to create a positive space for the game.  And like every person in every environment charged with keeping the peace - we do the best we can, but we're human, so we make mistakes too.  We are frequently overworked, having to resolve dozens of cases in just about every moderation session we undertake, so what may seem like \"power-mad\" behavior to some is frequently just either omission by exhaustion or very simply our own human failings coming into play - because we *are* human beings too, and not perfect.\n\nAppeals happen fairly frequently, and we always try to be as reasonable as we can in this process.\n\nThis is the link for that Discord server, for those interested in starting the process.\n\n\nhttps://discord.gg/6JevFSb","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-09-08T15:34:54.411+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just correcting a few inaccuracies.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=CaliCoastReplay,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=4tFwGAda,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-09-08T15:20:18.153+0000)And Riot's Boards Developers oversee Heralds and the modteam generally, though there are fine points of distinction there relating to the general volunteer nature of the team.\n\nThis is inaccurate.

The closest attribution I could find to Socrates is a dialogue recorded in Republic wherein he said that the watchmen would, as Kanazler said, self-police based on what he called a \"noble lie\". Also as Kanzler said, though, this is an idiotic thing to try and actually bank on. Moderators should be public servants, not pubic oppressors. As such they need public oversight.
