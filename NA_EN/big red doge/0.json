I submitted a support ticket and haven't received any assistance in almost 72 hours. Is there a reason support times are so long or am I just being blatantly ignored?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-18T15:30:00.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of details about the on-goings of merch but you did the right thing by submitting a ticket.  We can look into this for you and see what's up!  I see that you have quite a few tickets on this, so keep in mind that two will likely be closed to prevent delays and confusion towards responding to your specific issue.  The tickets were escalated to our merch team who will help you out individually.  Hang tight!","replies":[]}]}
