Picked her up at about level 17, and have loved her gameplay. The marksman rework did wonders for her, making her actually a lot more skillfull to play, especially when managing your traps and keeping the zones controlled. However, the rework did something that Riot didn&#039;t intend. Caitlyn&#039;s power was shifted from early to way late game. Riot acknowledged this and nerfed her late game _slightly_ and buffed her early, but it didn&#039;t do much. The real reason she is weak in the early is in part the masteries.\n\nHeadshot was her early game pressure passive. Because of its 150% damage, enemies would lose cs because she was holding it. People were afraid to farm. However, with these changes, it scales with crit chance. It eventually outscales its former self, once you grab 2 crit items but until then Caitlyn&#039;s headshot just doesn&#039;t hurt. Furthermore, in league of Thunderlords, Caitlyn had a harder time because she isn&#039;t about burst damage. Sure it works alright with her animation cancel combo of E Q headshot, but thats only relevant when enemies engage on you, because its a defensive play. Caitlyn has much better synergy with Warlords because she wants to go into the late game now.\n\nHonestly, Caitlyn is a bit underwhelming right now. Her late game is amazing with 5 traps and headshot hurting, but at the cost of her early. While this isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing, if you want Caitlyn to be a strong early siege champ, I would recommend toning down the crit scaling, and making headshot a base of 150% bonus damage. Thank you for reading ^^\n\nEdit: I was wrong about Headshot, the wording was just changed.

She was the first champion I ever really took seriously and wanted to 'main'. I'm also one of the people that worked on the Champion Update team helping mold Caitlyn into what she is right now. \n\nWith that being said, I do feel that Caitlyn changed a bit of her early game power to her late game power. I max Q first then go to E. I do love the traps but I find more reliable damage with the other two. I also get Warlord's in the mastery tree because I feel that I am banking for that late game fight more than just doing the early game trade. This changes who I want to support for me. \n\nAnother thing I'm finding hard is that Caitlyn has a hard time securing kills in a team fight. She tends to hope that an auto kills them and doesn't really have the ability to take them. \n\nI was hoping you'd be able to tell me what masteries, runes and ability order you are going. I'd like to talk about this more, see how you feel more compared to certain match-ups. I think she should lose early to MF and Lucian. They have early game steroids and ultimates that can be used effectively mid trade compared to Caitlyn where you are charging something. \n\nExcited to hear back from you :)\n\n\nRanger XIV","replies":[{"poster":"NapaIm","date":"2016-01-09T03:55:49.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Riot Ranger!\n\nGlad to hear from you, and I agree with you on a lot of these cases. Like you, I max Q, E, then W. The q is for laning, damage, and farming, and E is because the escape is so vital in the meta. Disregarding damage on E, I max it just to see the cooldown go lower. Because traps are maxed last, her seiging power and defensive capabilities diminish. \n\nCaitlyn's teamfight isn't really about kills, the only time I seem to get them is saving ace-in-the-hole to pick off low health targets fleeing. Her DPS and safety is her team fight, as well as choosing where your team wants to battle, via traps.\n\n\nFor masteries, I go the ferocity tree, taking Warlords as my keystone. 5 ferocity, feast, 5 Vampirism, 1 bounty hunter, and warlords. I then spec into the Cunning tree with 5 Butcher, Total Biscuit, 5 merciless, and Dangerous game. my runes are a bit odd, but I am finding success with them. I 9 marks of flat damage, 9 seals of armor, then 5 glyphs of attack speed, and 4 glyphs of magic resist. Lastly, 3 Quints of attack speed. The extra little oomph from the glyphs is very nice, and helps make up for slightly less attack speed on her. \n\nAs for her laning, the issue is I agree, she shouldn't beat them in lane. I believe Caitlyn shouldn't really be able to duel any adc. The issue is its too easy for them to get in her range, and out damage her. I think this is in part because of how strong thunderlords is on them, but also how available sustain is. I feel the main issue is she needs a support like Janna who can prevent aggression. Prior to thunderlords, enemies had to be careful about just dashing into Caitlyn. Although, Caitlyn's defensive combo has been nicely buffed. E Q Headshot does hurt, but again, the other burst adcs just do it better, and scale much like her.\n\nI feel the best direction to helping Caitlyn would be making her traps slightly better at only one point. The traps are her siege power, and late game seeing 5 sprout under your tower is terrifying, as well as when they cut off choke points. Currently, she only reaches this fantasy late game. Maybe drop the cool down a tad while only at 1 point?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ranger XIV","date":"2016-01-09T23:27:05.345+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely will be looking more into all this.

I feel like now _she_ gets easily bullied in matchups that she used to go even or do well in. I never get to lategame with her because my early game is so awful. \n\nI don't have any reason to pick her anymore, and that makes me sad.\n\nI actually think she lost a decent amount of damage with the new traps, at least early on. People seem to avoid them, wait until they can snap them out of headshot range, or a tank steps on them and you tickle them. \n\nI had a strategy of hiding traps in sneaky places and slowly whittling down enemies that insisted on breaking them (using its magic damage). Even put some traps in choke points that would get me kills on fleeing enemies. That simply doesn't happen anymore. :\\","replies":[{"poster":"NapaIm","date":"2016-01-09T19:25:27.323+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Going off this, the smaller traps are sometimes frustrating.

Countless times I set them up around an objective, but enemies spring them when I am just out of range to follow through. Whats more is it still doesn't dent tanks. \n\nRegardless, the traps are still useful in holding objectives. After clearing vision around baron, traps can cut off the entire entrance to baron from Blue side's blue buff, or that odd zone next to it. If you are on blue side, they cut off the entrance from tribush/wraiths. Although that utility is amazing, but it can only be utilized at max ranked traps.\n\nTraps help a lot in certain match ups. Against Vayne, they are a life saver. I often place them in bushes, and if she makes the mistake of tumbling into one of them, her invisibility ult gets crippled. Similarly, they help keep Twitch in check because they remove his ability to use the bushes. But, they don't do much against tanky opponents. Its so frustrating having a tank step on your trap, then a headshot tickling them. More often than not, the regen the damage. At least, in the early they do.\n\nI can't help but feel like stronger traps would make all the difference. I recently played a game with  support Morgana, and that is when traps truly start to shrine. If morg's snare is followed up by a trap, it results in huge damage. Especially with 90 cal net and peacemaker thrown into the mix. But, Caitlyn's laning feels more on her support now. If she has one that can dissuade aggression, its much easier to scale into late game.\n\nAfter playing a bunch of new Caitlyn, from PBE and on live, it feels like most of her power stems from the traps. Since they are maxed out last, her power comes late game. Unfortunately, I find little wiggle-room in her maxing order. Its too important for waveclear and safety to max Q and E respectively. Following that point up, since a lot of power is in her traps, the enemy can simply avoid them, or send undesirable targets into them.\n\nFor a final notion on her, it seems everything in her kit works with each other, except her ult. Q does full damage to trapped and netted targets, w and e mark someone for a headshot, headshot has synergy with her autos, but my personal favorite tool she has, her ult, doesn't seem to fit in so snug like everything else. Ace-in-the-Hole has always been my favorite ult, and it was what drew me to her in the first place. Alas, with each new champion that comes out, there seems to be another way to negate it's 'snipe' feeling. Maybe it can deal headshot's bonus damage to targets ensnared by a trap? Just spitballing ideas here though. \n\ntl;dr: Her trap centric gameplay is fun, unique, and does its job once they are maxed, but until then she misses a lot of power from her kit. Her Q and E are important to her survival, as Piltover Peacemaker gives waveclear, ranged harass, and guaranteed damage, while .90 Caliber Net provides a good source of magic damage, and an escape for her. Traps provide situational damage, and zoning. Given the choice, traps get maxed last. Maybe a shift to make them slightly better early game is in order, even if its a mana cost reduction? Lastly her ult is fun, but hard to utilize, and doesn't work with her other abilities like they do with themselves.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2016-01-09T23:31:20.571+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've never identified myself as a Caitlyn \"main,\" but I am an ADC main and she's been one of my top-played champs for a very long time.  I feel like Cait is better than before, but she's also more difficult now and I've had difficulty figuring out her optimal playstyle.\n\nThe changes to Headshot have been great, free triggers off Cakes and Nets with bonus range have done a lot for keeping enemies at the range you want.  The nerfed early frequency to every 7th shot from 6th in addition to the removal of armor pen have been markedly noticeable both in-lane and mid game.  Whereas the new reliance on crit dmg and crit chance has made itemization confusing.  A lot of her damage I feel is reliant on spamming traps and hoping enemies step on them, so ER seems like it SHOULD be the best first item, but in truth enemies will never step on your traps unless they aren't paying attention.  Because the armor pen was removed, it feels like she NEEDS to rush IE to do any damage, but its AD is now inferior to BT and her Q and R do not scale with crit, meaning less AoE damage and more kills barely escaping with less than 20 HP.\n\n---\n\nThe nerfs to Peacemaker are very noticeable, but the recent buff has made up for a good portion of the lost power.  Still it's not what it used to be, but the new interaction with Headshot has put more emphasis on her old E Q combo which while increases her difficulty, also separates the more experienced Cait players from the usual rabble.\n\n---\n\nCupcakes have lost **A LOT!** of inherent strength in favor of POTENTIAL power.  The charge system has been great for placing down the zone you need when you need it, but between tripling the CD(wtf...) and reducing the duration by an **entire 62.5%**, sieging and anti-sieging has become very difficult.  She's able to zone a lot less frequently for a considerably shorter amount of time.  Additionally, the complete removal of their damage(I'm confused how having metal teeth puncture your leg does zero damage) has made it so that enemies never think twice about stepping on them literally the moment you need to take even a few steps back, like say while waiting for the next minion wave.  Also, maybe I'm imagining it because she can set up more, but it feels like their hitbox is smaller...\n\n---\n\nWith the slower travel time, smaller hitbox and shorter travel distance, Nets feel very awkward to use, but they provide a lot more damage.  Which isn't their primary function: making escapes, kiting and wall jumps a lot more difficult, in exchange for better dueling potential on the less common occasions these occur.\n\n---\n\nHer nerfed AS and 10% reduced AS effectiveness are both very noticeable until she has AT LEAST a complete AS item AND either Zerkers or a partial AS item.\n\n---\n\nObviously I'm not saying all of these need improving, you're already aware better than I that many of them are done as tradeoffs for more potential strength or future buffs, but those are my own personal observations as to the changes to her kit thus far.","replies":[{"poster":"NapaIm","date":"2016-01-10T07:30:11.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hit the nail right on the head.

I also wouldn't mind some kind of interesting buff to her R as it allows for a lot of counterplay so it isn't likely to be oppressive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2016-01-09T23:47:35.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a huge fan of her new power curve.

On top of that, Piltover Peacemaker deals more damage, and while there's a steeper initial falloff, it deals more damage than before when sniping through the enemy minion wave on average. If anything, I'd say her early game was significantly buffed while her late-game has become even worse, since even with the crit scaling on her passive she ends up with much less raw AD (the stat she scales the best with) than before due to the itemization changes, as well as less attack speed. If Cait needs a buff, I'd prefer to remove her 10% reduced attack speed scaling, but in any case I don't think her early game specifically needs improvement.","replies":[{"poster":"NapaIm","date":"2016-01-08T00:59:59.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://champion.gg/champion/Caitlyn/ADC\n\nAs for the passive, before the rework, Headshot did 150% damage to enemy champions, and 250% to minions.

I recommend you check Caitlyn's patch notes [on the wiki](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Caitlyn/Background), which confirm this. The bonus armor penetration was also only truly relevant late-game, and the stacks required got brought down to 7 / 6 / 5 (now 6 at all ranks) for a long time. Her Q and E may be narrower, and she doesn't deal damage with her traps directly, but she's now able to Headshot instead, which increases her overall damage. She may be capable of late-game burst, if she comboes her abilities and attacks right, but I still think she's weaker there than she used to be overall, and stronger early.","replies":[{"poster":"NapaIm","date":"2016-01-08T18:36:27.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I-I don't understand what you're trying to say...at the start of the game when you have no crit chance, Caitlyn's headshot deals 50% bonus damage +0 because there are no crit modifiers.
