I've mained every role, but I excel at support / adc. Last season I got 3 separate accounts all to gold 5, all the way from bronze 5. So I have seen it all.\r\n\r\nHaving saying all of this. This is what I need to say.\r\n\r\nElo Hell is real. It is in EVERY rank / tier within this game. It doesn't matter if you're bronze 5, silver 5, gold 5, plat 5, dia 5, or god tiers.\r\n\r\nIt has nothing to do with a certain tier or rank.\r\n\r\nNo matter if you get boosted, buy a high tier account, or do it the old fashioned way like myself, you will get the same nonsense in the same amount of games regardless how good you are.\r\n\r\nWhat it really comes down to, is if you're good enough to carry, it may really only be possible if your teammates GO EVEN in lane. They don't have to win, but as long as they don't feed, you should be able to carry the game. If you get LUCKY enough to not get qued with afk's and people who go 0/12/0 by 20 minutes and rage quitting, you can carry.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as far as it goes for me. I have played probably around 1k ranked games in divisions from bronze 5 all the way to low plat; it never ends.\r\n\r\nSo if you are bothered by this fact, stop playing now. Getting out of ELO HELL is impossible because it is omnipresent.","replies":[]}
