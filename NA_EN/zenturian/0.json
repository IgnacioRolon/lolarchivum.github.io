You warn, punish and ban them, and they begrudgingly make smurfs polluting the low level player base and turning some new players away. Worse, they&#039;re still here but spending less or no money while driving away some new customers that would spend.  Eventually the toxic player gets bored, behaves to get to 30, and either reforms to not be banned again or repeats. How do we curve this?\r\n\r\nStep 1. Bans rarely remove the Banned Player from the game. They certainly punish well, taking skins, champions, IP, RP, Rune Pages, and rewards from the player and forcing them to relevel. Knowing this, create one day a year where forgiveness is possible.\r\n\r\nStep 2. Forgiveness would include a fine and terms to have a banned account unbanned. If Forgiveness were on Christmas day, anyone could likely afford the fine. Say $ 50 times 10,000 banned accounts per year pay. You&#039;ve just earned a million dollars. Furthermore, these players have Christmas money, see your sales and spend more since the main account with the content is restored. This is profitable.\r\n\r\nStep 3. Terms. Forgiveness must be that one day a year only. An account can only be forgiven once or after X amount of days. Say a ban cannot be forgiven unless at least 6 months of ban time passes. A forgiven account would need a clean slate as far as reports go, because the player could hypothetically play great 30 games and have one mildly bad game, and that trigger re ban denies the player the chance to re assimilate properly. The player should have to complete x normal wins before being eligible for ranked. Say, 50.\r\n\r\nStep 4. Sit back and watch the statistics to decide if this model should occur more than once total and of course enjoy the extra Million+ dollars you just made. You&#039;re welcome. I&#039;m betting at least a third of these guys over come the mouthing off problems and ass showing them do out of anonymity simply because they had to literally pay a fine, go without an account months or years, and ended up smurfing ever since. Face it, they didn&#039;t leave, the community didn&#039;t become a better place, but maybe it can and Riot can make even more money while doing it.\r\n\r\nOpinions? Any counter argument, concerns, or agreements welcome.
