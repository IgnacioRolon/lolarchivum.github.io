If Cho Gath doesn&#039;t do 1 point of damage to a minion, monster or champion from minute 6 to minute 17, but inputs commands to dance while in the fountain and laugh while in the fountain and moves slightly in the fountain... guess what? He&#039;s afking and taking the slight time to evade leave buster.\r\n\r\nRiot can surely recognize said Cho is contributing nothing based on raw data from minute 6 to minute 17, but had time to input dance and laugh spams. In said scenario, they can surely immediately, automatedly give Cho&#039;Gath the next elevation in his punishment towards perma ban. Safely as well, it&#039;s uncontestable in these types of scenarios.\r\n\r\nStep it up RITO.","replies":[{"poster":"SSJTribe","date":"2016-12-29T00:21:03.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do detect this and if the guy does it often enough he will get some kind of punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-12-29T03:58:45.563+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Actually, Leaverbuster is capable of detecting and punishing certain behaviors even if the player doesn't physically disconnect from the match, and the behavior described in the OP is on of them. If you run around in base doing absolutely nothing useful, you may evade being automatically kicked from the game, but you won't evade Leaverbuster itself. Now, they may not necessarily be punished by Leaverbuster after that particular game since the system does have some leniency to it, but if they continue running around in base in future games, then they will indeed get a punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Discord","date":"2016-12-30T20:45:13.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot only cares about riven mains feelings insult one of them u get banned","replies":[]},{"poster":"Touch My Box","date":"2016-12-30T20:26:53.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo + Bami's Cinder + Kruggs = Win","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheyLetHerTalk","date":"2016-12-29T22:13:23.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The AFK leave buster is the worst designed system in any game I have ever played. I got 5 20 minute qs as a penalty for not being able to connect to the game for 3 in a row and guess what due to the new rule if you don't play for the first 3 minutes it washes game and wastes everyone time. Those games I could've easily gotten back into after a few minutes by resetting router/computer/ checking network ect. The days of playing 4v5s is also long gone you will no longer ever get to play them. Today I was sitting in q for the 20 minutes accept it go through champs and I forget to lock in and guess what? game drops puts me and my friend in a 6 minute wait time so the que went from 22min to 28min then after that another 20 minute wait til to get into another game. It is just ridiculous and beyond me that this system is suppose to punish people who intentionally afk or troll yet it only punishes people with computer and connection issues. I will no longer support riot by buying a single skin, champion, or piece of merchandise. The company has gone from a fun community driven game to a money hungry automated system that does nothing but take away from the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"vOmvbrawfU","date":"2016-12-29T00:00:51.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My favorite is putting a pink ward in the golums, standing on the other side of the wall, and autoattacking it. The camp resets before it even gets to you to do damage and you'll never kill the camp either.\n\nSo many players I've reported for doing this. I have yet to see 1 single player punished for it (yes I have their names on op.gg and occasionally check to see if their still playing or got banned).","replies":[{"poster":"omegaarab","date":"2016-12-29T05:29:40.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how would this work if jg clears the gromp?","replies":[{"poster":"vOmvbrawfU","date":"2016-12-29T14:15:12.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I make it a point to clear the entire jg if I get one of them in my group.
