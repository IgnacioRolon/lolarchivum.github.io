(Reminds me of the scene from Independence day when they were talking about Area 51).\n\nAnyways, there was an issue with Ultimate Game Cards in which they printed \"League of Legends\" as one of the games supported by their product, when this was in-fact untrue.  We worked with this company to have all of these cards pulled from retailers to prevent further confusion.\n\nIf you have recently purchased one of these cards, and it does say \"League of Legends\" on it, make sure to submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) to us here in Player Support.  In this ticket, make sure to take a picture of the front and back of your specific card, and include them as attachments.\n\nWe should be able to help you out!  :D","replies":[]}]}]}
