RIto plz halp","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:429}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:429}} \r\nHello, my name is Best Renekton NZ and i represent the Oceanic community. (I could not find bug report for OCE boards, how bout that?)\r\nUnfortunately I do not come to you on good terms, no, for I just played a game of ranked as the champion Kalista where my ult did not work, and the item the black spear half worked. When I attempted to bind with my trusty support Morgana it would make a spooky (2 spooky 4 me) sound, and nothing would happen, this caused me to presume it was flat out broken however upon reaching level 6 I noticed I could in fact ult. This lead me to believing that only the visual aspect was bugged, e.g i could not see the binding light thingy. THis was the case for the entire game. Next, when we were attacked by my lane opponents I did the natural thing of ulting with the intention of morgana flinging herself into the blood bath as my own human sacrifice, this did not work however as she said she could not control where she was thrown, she couldn&#039;t move at all, and unfortunately this also was the case for the entire game. This resulted in my ult being RENDERless (Pun intended) and thus we lost the game. But this is not the worst part. As a result of this I was demoted . Tragic, and career ending for someone like myself with high aspirations of bringing OCE to worlds 2k16. \r\nNow lets skip this small talk and get onto the good stuff, looking back on this, i could feel anger, frustration, sadness, or I could come to you riot games. You see, I know you don&#039;t want me starting up a blog about the hardships ive experienced in my life and how Riot games ruined my career by allowing one tiny bug through its otherwise flawless system. Fortunately for you, I can be bought off. I will accept bribes of the following:\r\n147129412 RP\r\nFree trip to LoL world finals in Berlin\r\n2x Mystery Skin\r\nKalista Skin (Preferably that blood moon one, but championship is neat too).\r\n\r\nYou may think these are steep requests but please do not forget how bad it would be if this bug were to happen in the world finals (TSM vs cloud 9 final, i&#039;m calling it (ha) ) and imagine the law suits you could be eligible for.\r\nHaving said this, i have actually changed MY mind and i now request either:\r\n181248128713 RP\r\n2 tickets to LoL world finals in Berlin\r\n3x Mystery skins\r\nKalista Skin plus Kindred and her skin (when she is released)\r\n\r\nYou have 72 hours Riot Games.\r\nRegards\r\nBest Renekton NZ\r\n\r\n\r\n(Please don&#039;t think I&#039;m black mailing you)\r\n(This was a joke)\r\n(the bug did actually happen though)\r\n(And a skin plus kindred would be nice)","replies":[{"poster":"Big Horse","date":"2015-10-05T23:55:09.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Mr/Mrs Riot Personal,\nJust to clarify, (sorry i probably didn't make this clear) I was actually using the default Kalista skin, not championship.\nI guess the only other information i can give is i forget to tether right at the start of the game so i tried in lane multiple times but it just made that spooky (2 spooky 4 me) sound. \nIt was kind of weird cos the tether would show up VERY faintly if i was a certain distance away from morg but would then disappear. \nI'm also not color blind, so it can't be that.\nIts a tough one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-05T18:46:24.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Best Renekton NZ,\n\nUnfortunately, I'm unable to accommodate your request, but we do appreciate your bug report! ^-^ Also, super sorry about the demotion. D:\n\nI am unable to reproduce the bugs you've mentioned. \n\nYou'd mentioned you were unable to see the tether between the two champions while using Championship Kalista. I pulled down all the settings to very low, and the tether was still visible. (Usually lower settings drop layers of particles, which can sometimes lead to a particle not displaying properly.) [This is what I'm seeing on those settings](http://imgur.com/sLFzl8W). Players who are yellow/blue colorblind may have issues seeing certain particles, too.\n\nAs for Morgana not being able to ult, this would be something linked to the champion itself, and not something that's skin-specific, as the skin. I'm able to ult successfully and move Morgana to a targeted spot. If you have any additional information about what you were doing before the ult, that'd be wicked helpful. \n\nThank you!","replies":[]}]}
