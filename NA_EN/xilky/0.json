I've tried all work arounds and nothing is fixing the issue. Not even a complete full reinstall of everything... if you have any other ideas come back to me when yah do cause until then I'm just not going to play because it is a waste of my time in trying to do so when the client is being a pain in my ass...","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-01T03:48:24.732+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We deployed a hotfix last night that should have resolved this for you.
