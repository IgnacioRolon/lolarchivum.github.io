There are repercussions to making a false police call, while in League there are none for a false report. The Police also need to treat each call as if it is true. In League this happens as well but gets divided up, because a report flags the game for review. Depending on the flag, it goes through different systems. Again, the system is designed so 1 report does the same as multiple so premades don't have power over non premades. (Outside of surrender voting).\n\nOne system, the IFS, usually handles the verbal components. This is a quick handler due to the ease of being able to check logs with an automated system.\n\nThe other system, Feederbuster (handles griefing in general), most likely checks for more obvious forms of trolling/feeding. If it fails to find anything, it gets forwarded for manual review. This system is most likely backlogged much like the Tribunal was back in the day. This is due to False reports by people who think a 0/3 top is inting when they are just being dominated. \n\nSo, while it may seem like 9 people calling increases the odds the bank is being robbed; it doesn't make it certain.
