I \n\nmy other reason for stating the copy ability being the ult with probably a charge system is because of how the 2v1 panned out\n\nZoe casts her sleep bubble then flashes (three bubbles appear around her) - there is a proto belt activation sitting on the ground - taric flashes leaving a ball where his flash takes him that looks almost like a sun(later looks like a randuin's omen). \n\nJinx gets hit by the sleep bubble and a flash drops behind (further from zoe) the proto belt ball. Zoe walks into the proto belt ball and while the ball starts a neat looking collection animation she flashes again (the flash ball that appears from the sleep is still there) \n\nZoe then pops the picked up proto belt ball which hurts jinx and maybe taric. Zoe then cast her bounce bubble behind her to pop taric. at this time Jinx starts to fall asleep and she pops cleanse and tries to snare the zoe with the zap ability. \n\nJinx is standing in between the flash ball from her flash and above her is the cleanse ball. Taric gets dominated from the bounce bubble and the bubble fire. Zoe then walks up to the jinx collecting her flash bubble (and her hands turn a funny color) while a projectile fires from her towards jinx.
