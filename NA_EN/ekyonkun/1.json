You are a bit less likely to have that person raging because they got what they perceive to be a weak ARAM champ and they have no rr and no one will trade with them (even though I don't think there are any weak ARAM champs...just some champs that may not stack up well against the enemy teams comp or champs that you don't know how to play). \n\nI found Butcher's Bridge to be a bit jarring at first because I am so used to The Howling Abyss but by the end of the night I was really loving it.
