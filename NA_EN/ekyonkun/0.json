I just wanted to share some Poros I drew with **Broporo** and **Porocle** while I was doing nothing all night. You don't actually have to give RP, I just wanted to say thank you for being so awesome by helping others and loving Poros so much &lt;3 \n\n(This probably isn't the right board, but I didn't think you'd see it anywhere else. I'm sorry! D: I just wanted to share Poros)\n\nBonus image: https://imgur.com/gallery/wYXmf \nArcade Annie Summoner Icon","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-09T01:48:16.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HNNNNNNGGGGGG THIS IS SO CUTE OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!\n\nP.S. I really wanna be that Super Sneeky Poro. Das me I'm da sneeky poro.\n\n{{sticker:sg-kiko}} \n\nP.S.S. Let us know whenever you need that gift RP for reals! I'd hate to give you this 1 when you didn't really need to only to not be able to get this again in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"EkyonKun","date":"2017-10-09T11:43:37.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a very stable income, so I should never really need small amounts of RP. I'll never have an issue spending a few more dollars than I need to (I'm already buying Super Galaxy Annie AND her Icon the hour they come out THEY MUST BE MINE)\n\nActually if it was possible to use my one-time offer thing on a friend that'd be great. I don't have any in need of it right now, but for the future it'd be awesome if I could surprise them with something like that. I know to keep it under 100 RP. If there's a technical issue then that's fine! I was just asking. \n\nLastly, thank you so much for being awesome both of you. (Hoping Porocle has at least seen this) You two are my favorite Rioters :D","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-09T20:20:39.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's incredibly generous of you!! I could probably work something out to be able to do something like that if you wanted ^_-\n\nThe goal isn't to save people money exactly, but say you're only 20 RP away from buying something, doesn't make much sense to buy more RP and then have some sitting there again that you 'can't use'. So, we take that opportunity to bridge that little gap with a small amount of RP! We try to help where we can ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"EkyonKun","date":"2017-10-09T21:24:29.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great!
