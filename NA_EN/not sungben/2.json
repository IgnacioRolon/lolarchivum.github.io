I kept a lot of the advice from the previous two posts in mind while making these new emotes. Finished some requests, too! :)\nI tried to make most of these emotes less BM educing by using self-deprecating humor and emotions people feel in certain events that many people can relate to. I also avoided using text. Hope you like em&#039;, guys.\n---\nhttps://sungben.deviantart.com/art/Cool-Zeds-don-t-look-at-explosions-Emote-698207412\nOkay, this one is a bit BM. But the feeling when you get that fade away kill with your ult is just awesome. \nRequested by: ItsTragicYouKnow\n---\nhttps://sungben.deviantart.com/art/Flirting-Ahri-Emote-698207005\nCute.

The remaining saplings even brought flowers :(\n---\nhttps://sungben.deviantart.com/art/Panicking-Zac-Bloblet-Emote-698206646\nYou know that feeling. That feeling when you&#039;re Zac and there&#039;s that one bloblet left, panicking to revive you while you cross your fingers and clench your butt cheeks praying that it won&#039;t die.\n---\nhttps://sungben.deviantart.com/art/Aurelion-Sol-Safe-Space-Emote-698207117\nSome champions have swords, some have the ability to one shot people no matter what. Aurelion has a safe space to hopefully fend off assassins and other champs. And no, not in the SJW way.\n######Heh.. Safe SPACE. Heheh..\nRequested by: Itsbeghdev\n---\nhttps://sungben.deviantart.com/art/Dead-Shyvana-Emote-698206484\nIt&#039;s a dead Shyvana face.
