After beating them a {{champion:11}} came with his ult and I died but I had &quot;Guarding Angel&quot; So I came back and killed the Yi.. In my panic after seeing the the Quadra kill I couldn&#039;t find the 5th but my luck he was running past the bot inhib turret hugging it also he was a {{champion:26}} so I would risk him ulting himself.. And he was full health! But the Gods smiled upon me and a {{champion:76}} spear came out the part I can&#039;t see and hit the Zilean for half his hp. So, I flashed in with my ult and got him, got the penta and died..
