Here are my thoughts on your thoughts.\nYou named, ironically, Coast as your example of a bad team. The funny thing is the team was once named GGUniversity, and under that moniker, actually shocked the league when they made it to the finals where they pressed TSM to five games. \nNow, if you could provide an example of a team that ceased trying and started to troll in LCS like in the days of when Curse and Dignitas held a colluded ARAM at an IPL tournament, then maybe you'd have a point. But as far as I can tell, all teams, losers and winners, have been putting in their best in each of their matches in the LCS. \nYou say relegation is needed to encourage winning patterns, but I say that winning itself is enough of a reward for teams to give it their all. \nIn every sport you have disparity. Even in the day of Salary caps, both the NHL and NBA has more than its share of bottom feeder teams. In addition, due to the way the draft works, some teams purposely tank to have the best shot at the highest draft pick. \nPatch timing is a clear issue. It's not about picking the least of two evils. It's about WHEN you choose the least of two evils. Sure, lane swapping isn't very interesting. And when the meta is stale leading into the worlds it can create a less than exciting experience. But it is a fair experience. Fair trumps entertainment IMO. \nExperimenting should be for early on in the seasons. Major changes should stop happening after the first split. If anything, an entire season ought to be played on a single patch. That might sound extreme, but it would be the fairest way. Now, I can't honestly say this would be the best system for viewers. I think small champion balancing changes should continue throughout the season once we see certain champs overwhelming other picks (ahem, reksai), but changes like first brick and juggernaut patch should be kept for the time between seasons. \nOne cannot help think that by changing things drastically in a fashion that helps particular teams while hurting others, that Riot is meddling and determining who has the biggest advantages in competitive play. \nAnd considering Riot, and in particular Mark Merril, has a list of who's naughty or nice, who do you think they'll be trying to help out with these patches? Hmmm. Do I think they're being neutral. I think not. \nAnd those are my thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-08-24T22:49:51.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=hotarse,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=Zq99WMIb,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-08-24T11:26:23.346+0000)\n\n> Now, if you could provide an example of a team that ceased trying and started to troll in LCS like in the days of when Curse and Dignitas held a colluded ARAM at an IPL tournament, then maybe you&#x27;d have a point. But as far as I can tell, all teams, losers and winners, have been putting in their best in each of their matches in the LCS. \n\nI am confused what you mean by this? The LCS has always been under the regulation system so there aren't any games he could point to and say \"This is what the bottom of the barrel teams look like without the threat of regulation.\"\n\nIt is my opinion that the LCS is at the point where they no longer need the regulation system because the threat of being fired is enough to keep each individual player performing and the organizations themselves have too much invested to allow their players to troll in LCS matches.\n\nIn fact I have been saying that they should get rid of them since early season 4. It has been pretty clear for a long time that players don't qualify for the LCS organizations do. And those organizations have no problem replacing players who qualified anyway, so why even have the promotion tournament?\n\nSo I don't disagree with you here, but there is no evidence of what the LCS would actually look like without regulations.\n\nI do, however, disagree that Riot should stop patching. There has never been a season of league without monthly patches. The LCS players should know by now that adapting to changes is just part of the game.\n\nMaybe the turret changes were mis-timed **(although let's be real Riot has been trying to get rid of the laneswap meta for over a year they just finally succeded right before playoffs)** but messing up doesn't mean they should stop trying to make the game better even if they frequently make it worse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"anonymous119","date":"2016-08-24T21:25:49.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You say relegation is needed to encourage winning patterns, but I say that winning itself is enough of a reward for teams to give it their all. \n> In every sport you have disparity.

In addition, due to the way the draft works, some teams purposely tank to have the best shot at the highest draft pick. \n\nYou have teams, usually the most successful franchises, that make immediate changes when they start to struggle.  It isn't necessarily hiring/firing, but a lot of the time it's the owners getting involved to make sure problems are actively being worked on.  TSM, clg, and c9 the biggest teams in NA have all had their relegation/worst split scares and for each team it prompted big responses from their owners that made the teams far stronger over all.  \n\nI don't see this from a lot of the bottom tier teams.  I did not see a change in echo fox from week one to the final week of the split.  I'm aware of team coast's history, but the doesn't change their performance during their final split.   I am not arguing from the point of how it should be, but realistically looking at how it has been in the lcs.  Most of the time the absolute last placed team is just not competitive with the rest of the teams in that split and they stay stagnant in that position.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mazariamonti","date":"2016-08-24T17:53:06.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wouldn't be as big of a deal if relegation didn't mean losing basically your entire LoL business. The only way you can make money is off of sponsorships, and you're not going to keep sponsors if you get relegated. You need a decent amount of money to fund a challenger team, but you can't pay that amount if you have no sponsors (especially since player stipends only apply to LCS players). Look at this year's promotion tournament, the teams with chances to actually move up were Team Liquid Academy and C9 challenger, both had a primary team and brand which served to fund the challenger squad. These two teams dominated the challenger scene and no one else really had a chance. \n\nWith this environment, where you must be in the LCS to have a competitive league team, but where there is no stability with the relegation system for major investment from sponsors, a patch change which completely alters the way the game has been played for a couple years is a HUGE deal. Right now league teams are basically at the peak of how successful they can be, and the only way to improve the scene is for Riot to implement major changes to the LCS itself. \n\nAt this point either eliminate the LCS and have a sort of CS:go style where you just play in tournaments, but are free to pursue business any way you please, or actually take the time and effort to turn LCS into an actual professional sports league which is capable of expanding in ways which go beyond simply having more viewers. \n\nRiot could monetize the League itself, which could then in turn improve stability and increase everyone's profits, as opposed to right now where the reality of the situation is that the LCS is just an advertisement for Riot and LoL themselves. If you wonder why leagues like the NBA and NFL seem to have more money than they know what to do with, and Riot is telling off team owners for not pointlessly investing an even higher percentage of earnings into the league, it's because it's not simply a matter of viewership. The difference is that the NFL is open to the idea of selling broadcasting rights, having advertisements from major corporations like Coca-Cola all over everything, basically selling out as much as possible to earn every cent that they can, which does make it back to the players and owners, and Riot is more interested in selling skins and champions. While the truth of the matter is that Riot could easily do both, they are completely sold on this idea of owning everything and having absolutely nothing which could distract the viewer from the game itself. It would be like if the NFL and the teams only made money off of ticket sales, selling replica jerseys, and streaming revenue from YouTube. A decent amount of money sure, but many levels of magnitude less than they could be making.","replies":[]}]}
