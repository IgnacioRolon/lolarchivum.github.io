I feel like they added these changes to the lesser played champions to create hard counter picks in the game without regard to the champions actual design and identity.\n\nW - His W doesn't need to be changed and the new W doesn't do anything different besides having to waste time to ramp it up to engage but you end up {{champion:25}}  rooting yourself. It already slows you at the end of the duration and you should be using it to engage most of the time. If anything his new W will make disengaging more reliable while making engaging more of a gamble. Since if you take a bad trade engaging with W you will most certainly die before 6. Why is Riot Obsessed with blitzcrank self ccing himself? When these champions Get far better engage and disengage tools while also doing being able to 100-0{{champion:38}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:555}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:92}} \n\n\nR - The increased CD on his ult early will hurt his early game a lot, you will see far less roams, way less W-E-Q All ins. Especially when one of the main reasons you pickup blitz is to snowball the early game. Also, Blitzcrank isnt Leona he doesnt just W-R into the entire team you want to play off his hooks. \n\nI honestly think riot just added these changes because they wanted shieldbreakers in the game so picked lesser played champs, so no one would care.","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-07-02T23:43:49.618+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"They reverted the whole multi-cast, self-root thing, and reverted the ult cooldown increase while keeping the cool new shield shredding and cleanse. \n\nBesides, Blitzcrank's identity is the whole, \"grab you from across the screen into certain doom\" thing.

Gving him more flexibility in how he can use his speed boost in exchange for a harder self-CC doesn't change any of that. The functionn is the same. Speed in close to get someone in range for a hook, or run the hell away. This new version gave you the option of a momentary root if you only needed a small gap closer, rather than a longer slow. That doesn't change when he's strong, what he's trying to do, or what you use the ability for. It was a sidegrade at best.\n\nI thought it actually made him seem more robotic to suddenly break down and freeze in place after pushing himself. It looked more fitting.\n\nThese things do change a champion, but not their identity. You're all bent out of shape thinking I don't understand that _changes change things_, but all I'm doing is pointing out that \"destroying his identity\" is a hellacious overexaggeration. He would have been different, but the identity of \"crazy robot that runs around grabbing people\" would have remained intact. The fantasy and playstyle of Blitzcrank would have been virtually unaffected. You're blowing thing way out of proportion.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Coffee","date":"2019-07-05T22:43:29.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's obvious you don't play the champion or this game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2019-07-03T00:55:23.534+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of the changes.
