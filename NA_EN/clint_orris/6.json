Would reducing the XP penalty on duo lanes help diversify the game a bit more?","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2017-02-12T17:39:42.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think going in the opposite direction would be a bit more interesting.  Go the Dominion route and divorce XP completely from minion and monster deaths nearby.  Then create a selection of new gold generation items that are attractive to a wider range of champs.\n\nAt that point you could have things like double jungle, a tri-lane mid, or roaming gankers without XP being an inhibiting factor.  You would still want at least three people laning, but the other two positions would be free to apply map pressure in a variety of ways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2017-02-12T16:43:48.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Likely we would end up with 2 duo lanes that took smite on the side and are just 3 levels and an item ahead of everyone else.\nFrankly, that sounds awesome come to think of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-02-12T16:54:09.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Dota 2?","replies":[{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2017-02-12T17:30:35.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Limmie,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1KGveyiH,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-02-12T16:54:09.487+0000)\n>\n> So Dota 2?\n\nIf getting to know all those champs all over again didn't seem like a hassle, I would probably play it.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-02-12T17:53:49.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget the items.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dasdi96","date":"2017-02-12T17:35:55.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That will make low level 1v2 top lane much harder.","replies":[]}]}
