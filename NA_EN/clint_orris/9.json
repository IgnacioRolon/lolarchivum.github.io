As TehNACHO pointed out, Herald set the bar kind of high for fight interaction; I almost feel like drag and baron aren't living up to that bar anymore.\n\nI especially love the idea of cc on these monsters. Baron has one only, but that's it. It could make those fights feel much more epic for them to be disabling the big damage dealers and stuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xelaker","date":"2018-01-21T21:08:32.743+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"HotS kinda does this with it's boss camps on different maps.

It would make dragon / Baron fights more meaningful and interactive. It would also stop derp junglers from soloing dragons at early levels since more planning and team work would be need to involved.","replies":[]},{"poster":"greekvandaL","date":"2018-01-21T20:40:07.122+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"Nah too busy buffing Jinx for such great ideas.
