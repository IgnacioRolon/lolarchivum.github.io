Champion mastery then becomes \"How many games have I won on this champion?\" rather than \"How good am I with this champion?\" which IMO isn't the point of the system.  If someone on my team is high ranked with a champion, I don't want to have to wonder if they just got carried by better teammates/friends or if they're actually good (I already have to do enough of that with ranks), and it's destroying my trust in the system.\n\nI agree that there needs to be an incentive to WIN and not just to fluff up your KDA, but 6-7 times seems a little high for these situations.  Either grade needs to be more of a factor or win/loss needs to be less of a factor (2-4 times should be enough).  As is, the system is just weighted far too heavily in favor of winning the game, regardless of personal performance (this from someone who only focuses on winning the game and has yet to get below a B rank).\n\nLosing when you're doing well already feels bad enough, this feels like adding insult to injury, taking that loss and making your grade mean so little that it doesn't really matter how well you did.","replies":[{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-05-15T18:46:54.208+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"The scaling is just shot to hell between wins and losses, and then the grading doesn't even tell you how you managed an A+ or a C or whatever you got out of that game.

I was under the impression that it was based on Deaths, overall kill participation, and CS (averages for the champion), which are all stats where you should have at least done modestly well in, even as a tank.  If AD/AP were all that mattered, magic pen bruisers and tanks would get absolutely shafted, which IMO means that Riot didn't implement those into balance, as they're usually not complete idiots.  If I were to guess from the info I have, you likely didn't get as many points (you should have still gotten over 1000 due to having won) because you lost lane and ended up with lower kills/CS and higher deaths, but since you turned it around and won the game, you get your wonderful payout, if not a great grade (once again due to your lower kills/CS and higher deaths, not your build).\n\nAs a side note, do you mind linking the game where you played as tank Kennen?  I'd love to see your build and the overall teams, just for my own learning purposes.\n\nAlso, Lee's shield scales off AP.  The best Lee build I could think of going AP would be a tanky AP/CDR build to shield for dayyyyyyyyz on your allies and hopefully proc Lichbane every once in a while.

I was originally trying to do an ADC build with Kennen (top), before getting shafted in lane and getting ganked multiple times.  Full tank (it's been like 2 months, but I didn't even attempt getting MPen or APen items; just straight tank) with like Thornmail, Sunfire, Randuin, Banshee, Visage, and Tabbi.  I had reasoned that since I was a yordle champion, and the enemy jungler singled me out several times despite being pushed to my tower (over, the much more dangerous mid who was getting the same fate), that going full tank to deal with the full tank Gnar would be more beneficial to the team overall than an Anti-ADC build, which is what I normally run for my Kennen builds.  So for a Mage/Marksman, I had very little actual kills (discounting KS's) and a gigantic number of assists.  People would probably target me like they go after every other yordle champion, so massive tank and AOE charging CC would probably allow my team to win the game.  We did, by acing them late game in our base.  Like all Bronze to Platinums, they focused the tank, who proceeded to five man ult them and for the rest of my team to jump into the fray.\n\nMy concern is playing a champion to a role they're not officially supposed to be in.  For example, Blitzcrank is a Fighter/Tank.  So using him as a Support (as 99.99% of Blitzcrank games go) may push your Fighter and Tank mastery up, while not touching your Support mastery.  Or using an actual support as a fighter or marksman (during the Nemesis mode, my team ran into an ADC Soraka who proceeded to crush us mercilessly).","replies":[{"poster":"Adrian Umbra","date":"2015-05-17T01:52:30.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're misinterpreting how the system works.  Having high kill participation, low deaths, and good CS will likely guarantee you a good grade.  On top of that, Riot should have a system in place for detecting the support (especially \"normal\" support picks like Blitz, Thresh, or Morg), and will grade them more on their kill participation and assist scores versus their CS, giving supports a way to get high ranks as well.  If you take a \"support\" into an ADC role, you're likely to have higher kills and lower deaths than normal on top of an excellent CS score for average, meaning you're likely to get a high mastery score (again).

You didn't win the game, so you shouldn't get a ton of mastery.  You chalk it up to just team comp, saying they had the better team, as though all your lanes did well, but you still lost.  How did they prevent you from pushing your advantage?

How did a total of two possible teamfight wins lead to their victory?  For them to lose for most of the game and win off that, it would have to mean that the game went longer than 40 minutes, since they'd have a lot of pushing to do during your dead time.\n\nPlain and simple, winning matters more than anything else in the game, since winning is the goal.  If you didn't win, you didn't deserve to win, and that translates directly into not deserving much IP or Mastery points.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Klodrik","date":"2016-02-15T11:27:49.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Know the feel bro, got S still lost\n\nhttp://matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/EUW1/2521479857/202753705?tab=overview","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Darius KR","date":"2015-05-18T10:17:54.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2015-05-17T15:41:23.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clearly LoL doesn't care about performance, only w/l.\nWhy do you think the ranked system works how it does?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unpaladin","date":"2015-05-16T04:44:51.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just went 22-0 as {{champion:81}} and got a A+. Nothing skillful here, as the enemy just goofed around and ran right at me. I exerted pressure and focused towers down at opportune moments when no-one else would. The point is, I got an A+ for that. \nThe Grading system seems to be massively CS-driven, which is outrageous. This needs to be fixxored, unless I'm just not understanding it right.\n\nThe whole \"you absolutely must win to get good XP\" thing is definitely an issue with the system. It makes it a chore to play characters continuously when you end up losing some of the matches you play. It can feel like you did all that effort for nothing basically. Even if we just get a static XP amount for meeting certain criteria, that would be excellent.","replies":[]}]}
