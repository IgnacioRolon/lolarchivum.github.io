Sometimes I can play a game with zero lag at 22 ms.  However sometimes the game will decide to put me at 500-800 ms consistently for the whole game.  I would say half my games have this problem.  This all began when I took a break from playing due to work back in May-ish.  When my workload laxed, I started to play again and since then, it's been consistently problematic to the point that I play it roughly once every other week because it's so unplayable.  I used to play LOL daily.\r\n\r\nThe lag seems to happen right at the start of the game.  I've tried rebooting the game when the issue arises, rebooting my computer, putting all the visual settings at the lowest possible and no relief.  It completely ruins the game for me as well as my teammates as it is completely unplayable.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any recommendations on what I can do to mediate this?  I've done my fair share of googling.  Thanks for any help...","replies":[{"poster":"FredtheFruchtbar","date":"2017-08-02T00:13:12.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking at the game that triggered me to write this request, you're right, it was clearly a packet loss issue.  In prior games, the packet loss didn't necessarily appear to always be causing the issue.  I will try the packet loss solutions and see what works.
