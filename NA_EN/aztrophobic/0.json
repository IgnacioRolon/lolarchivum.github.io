{"poster":"Aztrophobic","date":"2015-12-08T18:14:48.896+0000","title":"Riot, could you please check on bots' AI?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":63,"down_votes":1,"body":"I&#039;m talking mainly about intermediate difficulty bots, as I do not play against beginner ones.\nI usually like to play a custom game to try new things or just to pass some time when I can&#039;t really play normals (eg, when I don&#039;t have enough time to or just don&#039;t feel like it) and I put bots on the enemy team to make a little bit more of a challenge. Well, after the last update to their AI, they have become gradually dumber as the patches go on. For starters, they&#039;ve forgot how to use most summoner spells besides heal, exhaust and ignite - and even when using those they can be sometimes quite stupid (using ignite when all they needed was a basic attack, for instance). \n\nSecondly, I LOVED it when you guys &quot;taught&quot; them how to combo. It was nice seeing Annie bot pulling off those flash tibbers combos for instance, or lux bot 100-0 someone with her full combo as well. Right now, they can&#039;t even do that. Annie bot started using tibbers randomly, mostly just to secure kills (instead of beginning the combo with it), and I haven&#039;t seen lux bot combo in ages. It is worth mentioning that some bots still use their respective combos (Cassiopeia for instance, or Zilean).\n\nThird, what about their builds? They seriously need to be updated. It&#039;s annoying watching graves bot rush bloodthirster as if it was still core on him. Or kog&#039;maw bot building trinity force when it&#039;s not even good on him anymore. ;(\n\nFourth, they don&#039;t have masteries. I&#039;m pretty sure they did have masteries in the past, but they don&#039;t anymore. It&#039;s feels like they could do much better if they did, it would also make them much stronger and cooler overall. I&#039;d really like bots to be both more human and a little bit more challenging. \n\nFifth, their behaviors are weird overall. They go in and retreat in a way that looks pretty random sometimes. Sometimes if you are standing in low health right besides them they will ignore you for no apparent reason and other times they will ignite, exhaust and use every single ability they have just to kill a 10% health Caitlyn. And they can&#039;t siege, they will just stand there doing nothing by the tower if there&#039;s at least one enemy champion standing there, too afraid to attack the tower or dive them. Their pathing also has some problems - if they are in the second tower of mid and they want to go to the inhibitor tower of top, they will go down the lane back and forth while taking hits from the mid lane tower until they die, instead of just going through the jungle. Oh, Shyvana bot also randomly dives into the enemy base until she dies for no reason (I&#039;ve only seen Shyvana bot do this, I can&#039;t say about the other ones)\n\nLastly but not least, Sona bot is deactivated from custom games ever since her rework. I remember she got back for some time but then was deactivated once again. Will she ever come back? And also, will Riot ever make more bots? It&#039;ll be nice if there was, say, a Jinx bot or a Zac bot, which I think are simple enough to code and it&#039;ll bring different options for Coop vs AI lovers or just people who play customs, like me. c:\n\nI hope someone from Riot reads this and answers some of my questions and suggestions! And English isn&#039;t my native language, so sorry for any mistakes.","replies":[{"poster":"LuluInWonderland","date":"2015-12-08T18:20:54.833+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.

They're very exploitable. \n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/vvMnYQIH-rewrite-rammus-bots-ai\n\nThey also did away with them warding efficiently maybe a year ago. Once the trinkets came out every bot was warding bushes instead of facechecking. That alone made them harder to fight and made newbies realize the importance of warding. When I went over to PvP I immediately saw that the PvP players were warding consistently in every game. But they removed that feature overnight and now the only bot that wards is Jax and only to hop away from a fight.\n\nThere's also the factor where the bots no longer use flash nor do they use teleport. Two years ago they were programmed to use these spells. They didn't use flash 100% effectively but they used it. And teleport they would always teleport into a lane and sometimes those teleports were pretty clutch for the AI team. If not they got back to lane faster and they didn't get outleveled as heavily as the ones who didn't take it. Reprogram them to use these spells again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RisenDarkKnight","date":"2015-12-08T21:35:48.127+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they dont' want to work on the bots ai, they should just add doom boots again.
