Only difference is you can repeal the punishment, but you can still get it as punishments are almost solely automated ","replies":[{"poster":"Sinful Succubus","date":"2019-11-04T07:13:00.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot literally doesn't punish** just** for telling someone else to stop pinging.\n\nthe problem here is that you don't understand what the word \"toxicity\" means","replies":[{"poster":"Tokishi","date":"2019-11-04T17:46:35.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sinful Succubus,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Liot0For,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-11-04T07:13:00.857+0000)\n>\n> riot literally doesn't punish** just** for telling someone else to stop pinging.\n> \n> the problem here is that you don't understand what the word \"toxicity\" means\n\nthey do though. if it happens enough. I've done A LOT of investigation into the process lately. It's the most outdated shit I've ever seen. It's a whole checking system that is pretty much determined by the blitz bot and can get a player punished for a lottt of reasons. But you can contest these punishments later on, but the fact they can happen initially is bs. The comments in your report as first highlight by the bot and only read by a player once the punishment has been put on your account and then if you bring it up to a support staff","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-11-04T05:12:59.704+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's not fair is when the rest of us who have to deal with ragebabies who can't follow the rules.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuthillick","date":"2019-11-04T00:05:32.403+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Permanent bans are almost always preceded by multiple other punishments that should act as warnings for you.
