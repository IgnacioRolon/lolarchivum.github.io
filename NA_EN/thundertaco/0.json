It isn&#039;t a revert. A revert shouldv&#039;e given Kog everything he had. And it didn&#039;t. It&#039;s lipstick on a voidling.\n\n-W. Currently has a mana cost. This skill, before the marksmen update, was no cost.  Why was this left out? Being able to Use W at no cost gave Kog at least some staying power in lane phase. \n\n-R. this has been covered, but any Kog player, not just ap mid, but ADC as well, knew that being able to throw R barrages for Trinity forc procs was a big part of his damage. I&#039;m sorry but the reasons given to the community to keep it what it is simply aren&#039;t supported by facts. It served the same role as Corki&#039;s R. Currently it has no place anywhere in his kit. It hurts too much to use. It&#039;s useless. \n\nRegardless, the proof&#039;s in the pudding. his win rate is pathetic. He&#039;s been Kalista&#039;d. Best part? All this happened RIGHT AFTER pledges at better Game Dev transparency. I&#039;m calling you out, Riot. Make good on your pledge to be more forthcoming and address this.\n\nI know this will probably get buried under Worlds Posts. Whatever. I&#039;m calling you guys liars. Don&#039;t lable something a &quot;revert&quot; when you know what it really is. \n\nTL;DR\nthe Kog update is not a &quot;revert&quot;, it&#039;s a lie.\n\nEDIT:\nIt appears that some have taken this statement to mean I am wanting the Kog from marksmen rework back. I do not. I did not like his rework. It was too binary. I was really happy to hear about the revert. That's why I'm so disappointed. I am asking for a FULL revert, not this trash.\n\nI recognize that this rework needs time to \"sort itself out\" but I'm confident that this state of Kog will not climb much if any. \n\nMy whole point is Meddler stating that \"pre-marksmen Kog was balanced\", but when questioned why the R or W weren't getting full revert treatment, a contradiction was stated; \"they were too oppressive\". That doesn't make any sense and isn't based on any facts. Old Kog, ap or adc, was never a dominant pick in Solo or competitive.

This isnt the meta where he farms against a Trist for 25 minutes anymore. He gets utterly annihilated by armor pen ADCs. Constant 4 man gang bangs in bot lane every game while Kog has no hard CC or escape to deal with them. Games very rarely reach the super late game where he is relative at all and he's not even the greatest late game ADC. On top of that he is **massively** team dependent and a free kill by himself. \n\nThere are dozens of reason to not play Kog and very few reasons you would want to. He has range, but its about the same as Jinx or late game Trist and he only gets it half the time? Still not as good of a tank buster than {{champion:67}} and not nearly as independent as her. His poke with ult was gutted yet Riot refuses to change it back even though they called it a \"revert\"\n\nIn the end you have a champ who is absolute garbage early, still garbage mid, and *meh* late game.

One of the reasons Kog is perhaps on the weak side is that he depends on his team's composition and like you said, can't survive the early game thanks to the early armor pen in ADC builds.\n\nWhen Riot makes adjustments in the pre-season, they'd said Youumu's and Duskblade are on the table for changes. The only question is if people are willing to wait for Kog's natural incorporation into the meta with the upcoming item changes or are they going to demand buffs to artificially inflate his winrate and then suffer through inevitable nerfs when he rises to the top, once these items are nefred.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2016-10-01T14:21:48.455+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, their is a huge reason you are neglecting.

Which means any damage or crit/AS he gets only gets amped with longer range and % HP damage that his W already gives. Where does it state that by having % HP damage in his kit, you are required to build on-hit items on him and that nothing else works?\nThe fact that this on-hit build has become the norm does not negate the existence and viability of his other builds that are more akin to Marksmen.\n\nHe uses armor pen as everyone else who uses Youmuu's.\nHe uses AS boost, just like everyone else who uses Youmuu's.\nHis primary method of attacks are his AAs, which Youmuu's boosts.\nHe uses the MS boost, because he's immobile.\n\nSounds like a perfect item for him. Despite the popular opinion, Kog does not need every on-hit item to fill his inventory. A traditional Marskmen build works just fine.\n\n\nAnd what about his AP damage on W?\nThat's always been there. And yet, no Kogs when played on bot, ever attempted to build any AP ever. So far, the only thing that ever gets popularity as a viable build is what goes on in pro play as many of you never think with your own heads but simply adopt the meta.\nLucian and MF were never built with BC or Youmuu's and yet, here we are. A product of Korean \"outside of the box\" logic. Whoever invented that build didn't \"invent\" it at all.\nThey attempted something different and it worked. Then it spilled over to all regions.\n\nThat's the whole reason why Vayne was a trash pick for a long time.\nPeople keep forcing BotRK on her for no reason (when there are no tanks) and choose to boost her Silver Bolts when in fact, they need more damage with less attacks. Then when they fall behind, the game needs to last a full hour so that they can catch back up and buy the actual AD items in order to be unstoppable with a 1/10 score. Literally turning around the game all by herself and having done nothing the entire game.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2016-10-01T20:56:09.145+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Youmuu's is garage on him because you are stacking AD on a champ with a single AD ratio.

That left all of the item effects intact so Kog was literally having to build only on-hit items as any stat that boosted his damage suffered when his W was active.\n\nAgain, there is no reason not to build damage on Kog as he no longer has these penalties.\nDon't let the popular opinion cloud your judgement. How do you think Korean MF and Lucian builds came into existence in the first place and then suddenly, it became the norm for these champions?

It's like you're deliberately forgetting that Youmuu's isn't a commodity of an item that only the fastest of Marksmen can use.\n\nKog Maw is a Marksman.\nAnd he isn't forced into on-hit itemization anymore, which his update brought up that has now been reverted. What you're all doing is appealing to popular opinion of Kog and refuse to accept that there are more items he can use but no one wants to because it's not what the meta dictates. Unless someone else makes this leap and spreads it around because it actually works better and earlier than his current on-hit builds, you're just going to accept the reality and his weaknesses and ask for buffs, without exploring any other options.\n\nMF and Lucian have never built Youmuu's as all of the Marksmen have built the same items designed for them. Youmuu's was essentially an assassin item before Marskmen started picking it up.  A few of those switched to Korean builds and they originated not long ago in Korea. Those builds certainly weren't off meta or even recognized as builds before that exposure.\n\nJust to keep you informed, i've played Ashe (pre-marksmen update version) with a Youmuu's and i've found the item had a lot of uses, especially when i was looking for maxing CD in her build. That was even before the ER changes and crit CD scaling.\nYoumuu's is not at all that different now and it most certainly works on all Marksmen, no matter who they are. Even a Vayne with a Youmuu's instead of that dumb BotRK build has more success in the early game, which is exactly what Youmuu's was designed for.","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2016-10-03T05:29:48.347+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Youmuu's was actually re-purposed into an assassin's item. It was originally an ADC item back when it had crit chance on it. It's just that no one found it worth building because it had shit stats and it built out of the shit Avarice Blade. Very few assassins built it as well, and they usually only did it in IE+Ghostblade builds on Talon.\nQue Preseason of 6 (after Ashe's rework) and it gets turned into a proper assassin item. Oodles of AD and an active that makes it extremely efficient for a few moments. Which is why it was finally finally picked up on ADCs; because caster-marksman that do a lot of physical damage in a short time period can take advantage of it.\nGuess what Kog does? A lot of hybrid damage over a longer period of time. Corki does his own hybrid damage faster, yet not even he builds it.","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2016-10-03T11:06:00.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except that Corki is a caster Marksmen, even more than Lucian and MF and he avoids buying items that require of him to duel, if he doesn't have to. Trinity Force is a much better item for him. Corki even has his own Valkyrie, enhanced with his Package even further. So he doesn't even need it for the mobility purposes. If he buys Youmuu's for 3200 gold, he wastes 1790 gold because the active is not efficiently used at all.\n\nHe also sports a really balanced hybrid damage, as his AD is equally split across the board into physical and magic damage. He usually avoids crit items such as Runaan's, PD, Shiv and goes for straight AD items to boost his poke and burst. RFC may be built on him as it can enhance his burst with a TF proc from a longer range. He can also ignore any armor penetration as he deals half of his damage in magic damage. His opponents can't protect themselves  unless they equally build two resistance types to counter him.\n\nNo Marksman does damage over a longer period of time.\nThey are a DPS role and this strictly depends on their crit, AS and damage at how much they can dish out. If you build on-hit items, that's exactly why you're not doing more solid damage earlier into the game as you need a few of those effects to stack on top of each other to be considered good. And you need AS to do it faster.\n\nWhile AD items function better from 1 or 2+ item buys, depending if you have a steroid in your kit or not. Kog has a steroid and Youmuu's gives him one as well. On top of the flat arpen, the squishies he fights against don't stack high armor, which further increases his damage potential.\n\nSo again, his Youmuu's purchase may not be in the meta but he loses nothing if he builds it and attempts building more straightforward items than wanting to be the late game wet dream that's currently not working. And it's not just the Youmuu's, it's his entire build that needs some real damage, not pseudo damage through on-hit effects.","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2016-10-04T02:41:50.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Corki wastes the Arm.Pen., not the active portion, since only 20% of his damage is physical damage.\nHalf of Kog's damage is physical, so even though he still has some gains from the Arm.Pen., they don't make up for his lack of AD scaling.\nLet's compare that to Miss Fortune and Lucian, who both deal around 90% physical damage and have insane AD scaling on their abilities.\nAre you starting to see the pattern?

He&#x27;ll get some quality of life stuff in 6.20, and we&#x27;re looking at some buffs likely for 6.21.\n\nPlease don't treat AP Kog as a second-class citizen. AP Kog wasn't a gimmick, makes a lot of sense with his scalings and is what many Kog players found most fun. AP Kog was viable every season before the rework. He wasn't OP even pre-rework so not having his old ult. while having higher mana costs on W and R as well as a longer reset time is just too much.\n\nWhile, I loved AP Kog as a poke mid and have over 1000 games on him, I understand there are some concerns about that style. I think he was a very healthy poke mid despite his range because of all his other weaknesses and the ramp up time but regardless of what direction is taken, he should be on par in strength. I've lost hope in his identity being maintained but I still want to play him mid. Although, in the future, I hope you guys only rework champions if you maintain the same playstyle. If it risks becoming a totally different style (AP Kog now is more burst than poke), you're better off creating a different champion than alienating the base. I guess exceptions can be made for unhealthy and really out of date designs.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMy suggestion:  \n\nI can't give specific numbers but if the ult. were to scale linearly with missing HP instead of having hard breakpoints at <50% &<25%, it would make AP Kog more viable. He still wouldn't have anywhere near his old poke ability but it also wouldn't feel like a waste of mana using R on someone at 70% HP. Right now, it isn't even worth spending the mana if you're not aiming for someone below 50% HP.

Ezreal passive rewards you for hitting your abilities, Lucian for weaving spells in between autos, Irelia gets tenacity for diving the back line of enemy teams, and most mages have some form of mana regeneration. \n> \n> If you need any more reason to change Kog passive just look at Zyra update. Riot listed various reasons for having her passive changed and the community generally agreed with them. \n> \n> * It wasn&#x27;t as fun as it should be\n> \n> * It was the weakest part of her kit\n> \n> * The ability held Zyra back more than it helped her\n> \n> * It had a long windup and a slow missle speed\n> \n> All of these gripes that Riot had with Zyra passive also apply to Kog passive.\n\nOstensibly, Kog's passive is supposed to allow him to trade kills when he's still weak.\n\nProblem is, everyone has a plethora of mobility skills these days that renders Kog's passive largely irrelevant.  I'm personally a fan of turning it into a flat, stacking resist shred that interacts with *at least* his Q in some interesting way.  Devoting Kog's Q and Passive to crushing enemy resist would give him a pretty unique identity among Marksmen and a clear reason to be picked.  You want an ADC who amps the damage of your whole team rather than just being a selfish damage dealer.  That would allow him to support teams that would otherwise lack sufficient damage threat.  Or help his team's Mages and Assassins deal with a hard front line.\n\nI've been running MR shred Kog in various forms since Season 2 or so and it has consistently been my favorite way to play him.  Back when Q shredded flat resist, Q/Wit's/Abyssal ate 70 MR and results in a deceptively resilient Kog.  It was funny baiting people out and then having an AP assassin jump the shredded target and just pop them instantly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-10-01T04:05:05.059+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"The execute Ult sorta made sense with the absurd power of Kog's double attack speed W.

That would hit the potency of a Wit's rush, too, since Kog's W damage would be lower.  Remove the flat OnHit damage from W and give Kog attack speed on Q again.  Kog's power early/mid was explosive due to the changes the Live team made.
