Also, please rate them on the following reasons:\n> - Level Of Fun\n> - Level Of Toxicity\n> - Level Of Trolling\n> - Level Of Difficulty\n> - Level Of True And Total Despair In Elo Hell\n\nThis is a good topic, but I would say that GOLD is, by far, the worst Elo to play in.  I've never played in Diamond or above so I can't tell you, but sweet, feathery Jesus is Gold frustrating.  \n\nLevel of Fun:  2/10 - Every once in awhile there's a really good game where everyone plays at a decent skill level, but those can be counted on one hand every month.  \n\nLevel of Toxicity:  8/10 - Gold is ten times as toxic as Bronze or Silver.  There are several reasons for this, not the least of which being that many gold players are MMR boosted accounts to get the free border/special skins/etc.  As a result of MMR boosted accounts and the fact that some people just get way too complacent, Gold has the most mismatched games you'll generally see and this leads to a pretty toxic environment.  \n\nYou know how many people will say that Silver has that guy that always promises he'll \"carry\" on an off-meta pick or claim \"I main Ahri, I'll carry\", well imagine that you have at least two of these assholes on your team EVERY single game.  Yep.  \n\nLevel of Trolling:  4/10 - Trolling isn't quite as bad as it is in Silver/Bronze, but the difference is that in Bronze there are players that just don't know how to build their champion properly and so it may appear to be a troll.  In Gold, however, players should know the basics of what to do and yet you will still see the occasional top laner building damage despite being 3 kills and 50 cs behind or the slightly fed Fizz trying to 1v4 in Dragon pit.  This isn't neccessarily \"trolling\", but it's pretty stupid and gives the appearance of trolling.  \n\nAgain, there are the off-meta hero types that make crazy picks (always in my promos) and swear that they went 22-1 in their last game as Sona top, but in my game they go 1/8 and rage quit.  \n\nLevel of Difficulty:  7/10 - Games get sideways often and it's either an easy win or a horrendous loss, not much room in-between.  Now that Rift-Herald is a thing, the team that gets ahead, stays ahead and it's nearly impossible to come back.  On the other hand, if you're ahead most teams don't generally throw as much as they do in Bronze or Silver.  \n\nLevel of True and Total Despair in Elo Hell:  9/10 - I'd much rather play in Silver or Bronze than Gold or Plat, period.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2017-05-05T10:05:30.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably Plat in my experience.

They have nothing to lose since you can't drop any lower.\n\n-The level of fun is actually in the negatives at this point.\n-Level of toxic is off the chart\n-Trolling, see above.\n-Difficulty is actually harder than Diamond. I have played enough games with Diamond players to be able to say this. At least the Diamond guys don't die 5 times in the first 5 minutes making a fed champ that can't be killed. \n-Definition of ELO hell. Even pro players have said Bronze is stupid hard to get out of.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TonsOfGains","date":"2016-02-16T15:59:53.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plat.

I've played with plenty of players from all divisions but master and challenger and these 2 are by far my least favorite. Silver players are terrible and flame and plat is a mess of different forms of skill with some players that honestly I don't know how they're plat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dukues","date":"2016-02-16T15:10:16.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Silver, specifically low silver. Now you have really bad players who think their ok because they are silver. Silver still has the low elo hell aspect combined with the highest population of players in mid to late season. It is also where most plat or gold new smurf accounts land. So each game there will be some generally good players, sometimes horrible players, and then average players. Gets to be a real clusterfuck. \n\nAt least in bronze you can assume your team is bad and realize you have to carry and the game is going to have a team death match aspect to it. The farther you get in silver the better players get on average and although not great it can be a little harder to carry. Silver 2 is the worst of the worst in my biased opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Owltears","date":"2016-02-16T00:46:07.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion though Bronze has a lot of people who rage, are toxic, flame ,feed etc, there is also a lot of good players who get held back because of the other said players, leavers, and AFKS. This makes the good players upset at their denied higher ranking and renews the cycle of hate/toxicity. \n\nAlmost any rank above Bronze is bad, yes people play good, coordinate better, etc...But if I am to be made fun of/yelled at for not being ranked/bronze/silver and they mess up and blame me or my lower rank teammates it's the worst. I've had matches even in ARAM with plat players and they DC because two or three people are not gold+ on my team or because they \"dont want to play with low elo\" and it's VERY sad. I've had NORMAL non ranked games with gold+ and they rage because the bronze/silver/whatever messed up once; almost as bad as Bronze people do.","replies":[]}]}
