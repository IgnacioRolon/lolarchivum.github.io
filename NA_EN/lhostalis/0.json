But holy shit annie is just stupid. Why is her damage so high AT ALL STAGES OF THE GAME?? It&#039;s just stupid to me that she can f*cking nuke a tank w/ 250 MR late game WITH NO MAGIC PEN ITEMS. And then she takes so little damage from carries because she has a f*cking built in braum W?? And to top it all off she has the range of a backline ADC, WHY?!?!? Oh, and some of the highest base damages in the game.  I&#039;ve just looked at the OP.gg stats for annie and her win rate is 53.5%, isn&#039;t that really high?? She&#039;s f*cking cancer and i&#039;d love to see this stupid midget c*nt get r*ped by the rework team.","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2016-08-28T00:02:50.144+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">she has the range of a backline adc\n\nlolwut\n\nlooking at your match history, I'm assuming you're talking about your game where you played vlad. the one where you didn't build any mr except for a spectre's cowl, and annie was _20/2/5_\n","replies":[{"poster":"Lhostalis","date":"2016-08-28T00:08:37.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Duh, it's pretty difficult to build anything when this little %%%% is just raping you as soon a you move up to CS cuz range. 625, more than 90% of all ADC's, the ONLY ADC that has a higher range than her without ability modifiers is caitlynn.
