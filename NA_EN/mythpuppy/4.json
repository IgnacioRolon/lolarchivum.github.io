It's been 3 hours and i'm only at 43 percent.(and it won't move!) When I installed the game the first time, It didn't take anywhere near this long! I have no clue if this next thing is related but i'll point it out anyway. I've had to restart the client 4 times (And by that I mean turn my comp off and turn it back on, Because the client will get stuck and then won't close) and every time the patching gets to around 39%, ALL types of media shut down for me! Youtube videos won't work, all of my video and music apps go on lock down. anytime I go on ANY media website, it just won't work. What is even happening??? I JUST WANT TO PLAY MY GAME AGAIN! HELP!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-24T00:35:15.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Issues after 33% during patching is typically caused by a poor connection to the patching servers, but this may have been caused by the live service incident that *Allenah* mentioned.

I can't be 100% sure, but this problem that Riot is experiencing/fixing could be affecting downloads as well. I would suggest keeping an eye out for the Service Status page updates, and try again when they have everything resolved.","replies":[]}]}
