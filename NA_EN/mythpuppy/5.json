It never lags and everything responds the second I prompt it to. My friends say it's either my computer, or my internet. But my internet connection is always as strong as it can be, and my computer is actually pretty new, so I know it's not that. Players have actually threatened to report me for bad/slow connection and \"sabotaging their game\". Is there a way to fix it, or is it gonna be like that forever?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-30T17:52:49.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, I'm fairly sure you cannot be banned for being the last one to load in, or even taking a long time to do so. I would not pay any attention to those players who are threatening to report you for such a reason.\n\nMost of the time, your loading time is influenced by hard disk speed or its read/write efficiency or other system factors. A good place to start in troubleshooting this is to work through the steps outlined in our [FPS guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting)\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change to your loading time.","replies":[]}]}
