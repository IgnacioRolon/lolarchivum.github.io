Help?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes when I play, this thing will happen where everything I do gets delayed. Everytime I try to move or attack it gets delayed by about by a few seconds. ( sometimes my character would stop while moving. other times I couldn't move AT ALL) and before you write this off as lag:\r\n\r\nI could still see everyone moving perfectly instead of everyone just stopping like it would with lag.\r\nChat still moved in real time\r\nThe frame rate stayed normal all game\r\nThe screen never froze or even slowed\r\nThe game never disconnected me\r\n\r\nThis happens mayebe 4 times a month I think? I really want to know what this is...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-21T19:26:02.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you don't want to hear it, but this definitely sounds like it might be lag.  Your network may be having problems communicating what's going on between you and the game server, so you can see some things happening but you can't relay what your actions are.  But we can find out what's going on for sure by running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader).  Run some logs for these matches so we know what's really happening.  Let me know your results.","replies":[{"poster":"Tampeax","date":"2017-01-21T22:00:17.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, i am macuser,(bought a new one 2days before the last patch and i got the same issue than everyone since the day i updated 7.1 patch. I tried all ur advices and then nothing worked. I decided to check my CPU monitor and it appears that when the fps drop down, LOL client is taking 121.7%. It could help u to know that cause all of us are just trying to find a solution with u. This is clearly unplayable due to the lagg...droppin from 60 to sometimes 08 fps. After all that i did read from all players (and apparently we are a LOT), i def think that our common issue is due to the client. Hope u ll answer. Thank u.\n\n\nEDIT : Its not the LOL client it is League of Legend. The game is taking actually 131.7%  CPU now.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-21T22:21:46.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The updated client is independent of the game so it wouldn't impact in-game experience.  FPS issues are also usually caused by issues with pc settings or hardware, and not your network connection.  Connection problems would like like input delays, and not your screen locking up for a few seconds.  If your issue looks like it's being delays, run through the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to see if that does the trick.  Make sure to go over each step and select Mac for instructions specific to your OS.
