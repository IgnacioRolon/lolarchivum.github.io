If your account was banned that means you were given plenty of warnings, chat restrictions, etc. And basically Riot eventually gave up on you because you've made it apparent there is no hope for you to improve despite being given many chances.   \n\nSo you prefer leveling up a new account, and not buying skins just so you can be toxic to your teams? How is this even worth it? What excuse do you have other than to blame Riot for something that is 100% your own doing... and yet you are trying to make it look like Riot is the bad guy in this case, wtf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kisamesan","date":"2017-06-28T01:04:20.370+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Right they should IP ban some one instead just so they cant create any new accounts and ruin the fun for others!{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"SecondAirbane","date":"2017-06-28T01:39:38.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"he said nothing about ip bans lmao\n\n??? \nwhats 9+10?","replies":[{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2017-06-28T02:15:36.319+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SecondAirbane,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=TtAXqvag,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-06-28T01:39:38.270+0000)\n>\n> he said nothing about ip bans lmao\n> \n> ??? \n> whats 9+10?\n\n19","replies":[{"poster":"Paquay","date":"2017-06-28T17:42:43.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"9 + 10 = 910.
