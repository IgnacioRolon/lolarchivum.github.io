I already have Kayle and the Riot kayle skin before the event started. I had her since the pax code that she was given in. So about 2 years or so? Whenever she first came out anyways.... Well today I got my summoner icon but no mystery skin with it? I looked through all my skins and purchase history but there is nothing here D:! Was not sure if they missed it or if they are deploying icons separately then the skins? Here are some screenshots! So if a Riot staff member could help me I would be grateful :D!\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2QLtBXL.png\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vpU1ROb.png","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-17T18:26:53.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gifts are being sent separately, so you wont' get everything all at once.
