Disconnects, etc...\n\nBut when TWO people go AFK at LEVEL ONE, and I still lose 23 points (23!) because of it.... \n\nAnd this happens FREQUENTLY. It's not right. At all. How does this reflect my skill as a player when I am playing 3 vs 5? \n\nIsn't that the point of ranked? To be competitive? How the hell do I get out of SILVER 5 if I am losing 23 LP on a 2 AFK match?\n\nAnd it's every 3rd or 4th game! There is someone who never connects, or someone just gives up, and starts charging in and dying. \n\nPLEASE FIX THIS. It is destroying the ranked experience.\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/JBEOcbB","replies":[{"poster":"Weedlayer","date":"2014-12-25T04:22:17.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunatly, as riot has stated many times, adding an incentive to force players to d/c is a potentially toxic dynamic.\n\nAlso, you can't remove LP loses from one side without removing LP gains from the other side, you understand this right?\n\nThere are potential solutions, like employing loss forgiven for players who never connect, but in that case, the cait in your game wouldn't qualify for this, you understand this right?\n\nUltimately, this falls afoul of the problem any solution to \"fix the lp system\" has, once you decouple lp gains/loses from winning/losing, abuse cases can exist.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2014-12-25T10:26:56.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly riot does not care for those hurt by this.
