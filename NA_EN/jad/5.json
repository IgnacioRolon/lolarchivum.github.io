I can't select 1600x900 in alpha client, while i saw some people posted screenshot where they have THREE resolutions to select: 1024x768, 1280x720 and 1600x900. \n\nI have only two - 1024x768 and 1280x720","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-16T21:29:43.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Alpha Client cannot be fullscreened, and the players that have 1600x900 have that option because they're running a higher-resolution display such as 1920x1080 or 2560x1440.\n\nI hope that clears up the confusion.","replies":[{"poster":"Vel Existor","date":"2016-11-16T21:47:24.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=r2mdWGnN,comment-id=00020000000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-16T21:29:43.683+0000)\n>\n> The Alpha Client cannot be fullscreened, and the players that have 1600x900 have that option because they&#x27;re running a higher-resolution display such as 1920x1080 or 2560x1440.\n> \n> I hope that clears up the confusion.\n\nThen why some users reporting that they have 1600x900 and have 1600x900 resolution in options?\n\nWhy that \"tier-less resolution\" is a thing at all? Why not let us to have \"1600x900 minus 10% scaling\" for example?
