I&#039;ve played thousands of games on her. I am excited about the new runes. I&#039;ve tried several paths for zyra. I want to maximize my damage.\r\n\r\nI find Domination/Sorcery to be the most rewarding for damage.\r\nI go: Electrocute, Cheap Shot, Eyeball Collection, Ravenous Hunter - The Ultimate Hat, Scorch\r\n\r\nElectrocute, Cheap Shot, and Scorch all help with damage.\r\nI find zyra gains very little from eyeball collection because she doesn&#039;t scale well with ap and finds more damage from magic pen.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to my next point. I know I am still missing damage. My trades are not doing the damage they did before. I have been so excited about the new runes I couldn&#039;t put my finger on the problem. Then I realized, it is magic pen.\r\n\r\nI am missing my full magic pen rune page! My abilities did significantly more damage when I had magic penetration. Especially, the amount of magic pen you can get from a full magic pen page. I realize the enemy adc might have carried magic resist runes which they don&#039;t have now. However, adcs only take magic resist blues (if at all) and usually scaling. My magic pen page always outweighed any MR runes an ADC would take.\r\n\r\nIs there any way we can work in some magic pen for the new runes? Zyra doesn&#039;t work as well with AP. That or Zyra is going to need some kind of AP scaling buff or base damage to return to her former damage.\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\nI know sudden impact exists. However, it does nothing for zyra. \r\nI&#039;ve tried Sorcery/Domination, and Electrocute &gt; Comet.\r\n\r\nI can think if a few other magic pen champs that might be struggling with the same problem. Comment if you are experiencing similar struggles.","replies":[]}
