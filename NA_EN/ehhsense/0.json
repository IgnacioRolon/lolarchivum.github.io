I have ran speed tests and also played other games similar in location the Leagues Chicago servers and every single time my ping is 30-40 on speedtest even though my ping on the League servers are 130ms+.\r\n\r\nI have tested my ping on multiple speedtesting sites. I also play H1Z1 and play on their US East servers which are very similar in location to the Chicago League servers. My ping on H1Z1 after 8PM is 50-60ms. I normally play League at 40-50ms constantly. Once 8PM comes around my ping on League goes to 120ms+ and my H1Z1 ping stays the same at 50-60ms. Like I said, I have ran tons of speedtests while this is happening too and nothing is showing me that my ping increase is global. It is only increasing on League.\r\n\r\nBefore a Riot employee messages me and asks for my Network Logs, I need to note that I have deleted every single log since like 2 days ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2017-09-17T04:57:28.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey RÃ¸asted,\n\nWell that's no fun, I had to test something on the OCE server just last night and playing with high ping sure is a bummer--don't worry, I played a Coop v AI Game and still managed to win. It definitely sounds like an ISP or routing issue; since you don't have issues with other games, more likely a routing issue where a certain hop is being congested or rerouted after 8:00pm CT. Can you [send a support request through the Support Site](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) and give us all the details you've noticed along with 2 [tracerts](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674#wq2) to the NA server?\n\n1. The first one should be before 8:00pm CT so we know what \"good\" looks like.\n2. The second one should be after 8:00pm CT so we know what \"bad\" looks like.\n\nThis will help us determine where things seem to be broken and provide some solutions as to how we might be able to resolve it--whether it requires contacting your ISP, having your ISP reach out to a partner, or something we need to escalate on our side.","replies":[{"poster":"EhhSense","date":"2017-09-19T01:01:22.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, I made a ticket and uploaded a tracert + my NetworkLogs so hopefully my issue can be resolved soon.","replies":[]}]}]}
