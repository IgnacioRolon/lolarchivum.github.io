He also told me to stfu, fk off and fk my mum - amongst many other things. You can see from my in game chat that I was even quoting him and asking other players to report him. I would say that I was sarcastic at worst and hardly toxic to him, when I told him to stfu it was because he told me to kill myself. Beyond that I didn't even swear at him.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is, if this chat was from a game that happened before my 2 week ban, surely I don't deserve a perma ban? I literally haven't done anything since my 2 week ban as I haven't been able to play and wasn't able to until Monday at the earliest.","replies":[{"poster":"HotarÂµ","date":"2019-09-05T23:08:00.403+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":">However, I have now received a perma ban for in game chat from a game that I played before I received the 2 week ban.\n\n Hmm, this is really odd. I've never seen this happen before.\n\n Maybe KFCeytron is right, a Rioter might have seen your logs and administered a manual ban. Either way, you should definitely [**file a support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you haven't done so already, they'll remove the ban if it was placed in error or explain why it was elevated to a permanent ban.\n\nGL!","replies":[{"poster":"Calvo4R","date":"2019-09-05T23:20:49.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks! I have submitted a ticket. Just to be clear I was banned on Monday 26th August for 2 weeks. I managed to login 1 week into my 2 week ban to check the unban date, it confirmed I would be unbanned on Monday 9th. I logged in again tonight to make sure it was Monday 9th that I would be unbanned on and thats when I seen the message that I had been perma banned for the chat I posted above, but the chat posted above was from a game that I played in prior to Monday 26th August. So hopefully Riot would class this as an error?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Calvo4R","date":"2019-09-09T18:58:18.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: Riot confirmed it was an error with the ban system and my perma ban has been reversed!

You can submit a ticket if you want.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlueThingamajig","date":"2019-09-05T23:34:57.214+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"It is entirely possible (but very rare) for the system to issue a permanent ban to a player currently serving a 14-day ban. Generally how this works is that the system hands out a 14-day ban after you've already started another game. Then, the game you're playing also gets reported and the system assesses a punishment. Seeing that you've \"not reformed\" from the 14-day ban, it then gives out a permanent ban. I've seen it a couple times before.\n\nI don't think a Rioter manually escalated, simply because I don't think the behavior shown in the log is deserving of such. As such, a support ticket to Riot *should* revert it to a 14-day ban. \n\nAs for your logs in particular:\n\n>Calvo4R: oh stfu\nCalvo4R: muted already\n\nJust mute to begin with. Try to avoid continuing engagement. It doesn't matter who is right or wrong. It's a waste of your time, effort, and certainly your account.  Consider even turning off allied chat. Mute all. You'll be happier. You can't control your teammates. They might be carrying, or they might need to be carried. You can only control what you do. Insulting teammates just sets yourself up for a ban. \n\nAlso, the report system does not consider how many reports a person gets in a single game, only a binary yes/no whether anyone reported; therefore it is not necessary (and is considered harassment) to ask for reports.","replies":[{"poster":"Calvo4R","date":"2019-09-05T23:38:51.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thank you very much for taking the time to respond. I believe what you have described here is exactly what has happened. I appreciate your tips, I fully recognize I shouldn't have acted the way I did to receive the 14 day ban. Hopefully, Riot will revert my perma ban to a 14 day ban and I will seriously get to work on being a better player by not retaliating to trolls.","replies":[]}]}]}
