I hate people and I can't keep friends even online, what do?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"My hatred of people doesn't extend into any type of violence towards them, it's just a silent, passive hatred.\n\nAlso I can't keep friends, even when I try they always leave me. The best friendship I ever had was actually 2 years of mental abuse that I'm still getting over before the people involved dropped me.\n\nAnd as of now I thought I finally found someone who was very similar to me and we got along and I really liked this person as a friend, but I already ruined it and he/she doesn't like me much anymore and might drop me soon as well.\n\nWhat's wrong with me?\n\nWhy can't I change? (I have no will to change, nor do I feel like I would be happy if I did change, this to me says I cannot change)","replies":[]}
