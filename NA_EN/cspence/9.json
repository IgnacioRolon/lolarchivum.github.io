Help me.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"He's a big loser, a literal weeb (dead serious, fat neckbeard, stupid and a psychotic love of anime, even tried to start an anime club), he's VERY stupid and skips class a lot and he just happens to be my partner.\n\nSo I got this shit down packed right? It's just us having a basic conversation in spanish, SUPER basic. So I gave him an outline of what we're supposed to do and I'm going to lead everything so all he really has to do is play off me, he has no real work.\n\nSo tonight we're supposed to call each other to practice, I don't need it but I sure as hell know that this moron does and he said he did, and this is how the texts went:\n\nHe texts me and says: (H is him, M is me)\n\nH: Hey man when we doing the interview (that's what the project is called, we're \"interviewing\" eachother but it's really just a conversation) project on the 29th?\n\nThat text was on the 27th, my sleep schedule was bad this weekend and my phone was dead, so on the 28th in the morning I text him back and say:\n\nM: Oh my bad dude. I didn't have my phone and I just woke up. We can practice later tonight if you feel like you need to.\n\nH: Yeah would help xD \n\nYeah he actually used xD.\n\nLater today around 5pm\n\nM: Just text me later when you're ready.\n\nH: OK what time frame would be best for you??\n\nM: Like an hour or so.\n\n2 Hours later I text him because he's a fucking dumb ass.\n\nM: Yo u ready?\n\nH: Yeah hang on eating dinner with my family\n\nM: Ok just tell me when you're ready\n\n40 minutes later..\n\nH: Family emergency got to go to my grandmothers. Will see you tomorrow man. \n\nK what? He's full of dog shit if it's a family emergency that's so bad that at no point tonight he can call me for a 10 minute practice session then he shouldn't even be showing up early in the morning for spanish. \n\nI wouldn't even be surprised if he didn't show up at all anyway. I know theres no family emergency he's just a socially awkward weeb. Fuck. FUCK.\n\nFuck me man. What do you guys think? Honestly?","replies":[]}
