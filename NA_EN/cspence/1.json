They fight a lot, they force enemy team to fight a lot (or roll over and die), and they do it in ways that make it so they can win.\n\nThe off-meta picks aren't random or ill-considered.  They picked Udyr into an enemy team comp that had low damage and couldn't kite away from him.  They picked Shaco and ran him like he was a Zed, just coming from the jungle lane.\n\nThe only concern I have is that they took a while to adapt to 5.5, because they have 4 people who want to play carries; 5 if you consider that Hylissang was a mid player who mained Orianna before he joined them.  When they build all comfort picks they don't have any tanks.\n\nThey will break your heart sometimes (9-9 during the split) but when they are on they are amazing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Valhalla Rising","date":"2015-04-06T12:54:43.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What i want to know is if kikis was going to sell his skirmishers sabre in place of a better 6th item.\n\nI want to know what he was going to build after tri force, would it have been ie? gb? lw?

It's been months since that one TF jungle game, and it's kinda unlikely that he will do that again ?\n4. they have played what you would call \"meta\" champions for most of the season? \n\nThey are a good team, and its great that they look beyond what everyone plays to find good champions (a lot of them are overlooked until people like them find them **AND** play them when the teams compositions is appropriate to bring it out), but i cant help, but feel people only like them because of a few unusual pick and their team name, instead of their actual players and their plays.","replies":[]}]}
