Even Aatroxx, 3 releases prior to Yasuo, has as many skins as him, both with 3. If you're going to complain about a new champ with a lot of skins, Gnar is your best option, and even then he only has one more than Yasuo/Aatrox.","replies":[{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2016-11-03T14:07:38.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Son, I don't need a reason to complain about Yasuo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Romtheguy","date":"2016-11-02T12:39:38.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shots fired\nshaclone gets dunked","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-11-02T04:58:53.472+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you remember Season 2, before the shift from red and blue buff XP to the smaller minions in the camp? \n\nNunu, Shaco and Shyvana could just invade the enemy jungle, steal the buff from the enemy, get level 2 instantly and kill them or run away.\n\nNow, after four long years we're going back to that, with red and blue buff being solo camps that get you to level 2 instantly. If Shaco remains as strong as he is, his invasions would decide games at level 1. The new jungle is very punishing to try and go through while you're down a level, down a buff, it's honestly just too strong and it's going to take a long time for people to get used to it. And Shaco would thrive in that confusion and make people just quit the game.","replies":[{"poster":"TheOvermind","date":"2016-11-02T05:29:10.735+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"That is a lame excuse to gut shaco.

The inclusion of \"plants\" is also probably slightly power positive since his boxes (which now last longer) can be placed to watch for or royally mess up an enemy attempt to use the plant)\n\nAdmittedly, the shaco changes seem a bit skewed towards AP, so if you prefer ad I see how the box and ult changes are less than thrilling.\n\nI agree that yasuo is one of the more frustrating champions to face. I wish there was some way to make him less frustrating to face without removing his ability to lane mid, but frustrating machanics seem to be the most effective mechanics to enable a melee to function vs a ranged, especially in such a short lane.","replies":[]}]}
