Today I sign in and it's at zero so I looked at the history and the 695RP was NEVER spent. There is zero history on where it could have gone other then it was taken and my account put to zero. Does anyone know how I get a hold of them to have this corrected or do I just have to ask Paypal for a investigation?\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2019-04-19T03:37:56.386+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, if you're mysteriously missing RP, I recommend starting with resetting your password to something different first (in case there's something suspicious going on) and then reaching out to my colleagues via a Support Site ticket so they can investigate what's going on: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
