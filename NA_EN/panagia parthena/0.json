Right now aside from needing a new model, I think the biggest complaint people have about her is how unpredictable her E stun is.  \n\n\"Telekinetic blades\" sounds less like a fix to her main issue but a delete and create a new champ that shares a name with a deleted one.  If you want a telekinetic blades champ, that isn't something you should do with Irelia and it was a mistake with Shen as well.  It's just too far off of her current gameplay.  Gameplay is important too.  \n\nIf you want a telekinetic blade champ, you need to do that as a new champ, not a rework.  Irelia is her current kit and play style as much as it is her theme.  Aside from her ult, telekinetic blades just isn't a part of her kit and they shouldn't be.  \n\nThis is why I think riot's reworks fail.  You guys want to make a new champ in some cases, but reworks aren't for that.  Riot seems to be looking at reworks as focusing on what you can do instead of focusing on what you should to do.  There's a world of difference in the two.  Telekinetic blades isn't really a part of live Irelia so it shouldn't be a part of her rework either.  It's just too drastic of a change.  Telekinetic blades is what you can do and it is the wrong way of reworking irelia.  What you should do is ask what does irelia do now and how can you make the things she does now more healthy.  \n\nNew ideas generally don't belong in reworks.","replies":[{"poster":"Hinagiku33","date":"2016-08-30T03:16:07.814+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair...\n\n* Irelia *already has* telekinetic blades, they float in front of her constantly and she shoots them for her ult.

Ever since Season 2 we've called it the \"Irelia Problem\" where she's just a big ball of stats that becomes impossible to fight if she's ahead, combined with just enough utility that she generally has an answer to everything (the answer is usually \"stun\").\n\nI'm still salty from Karma getting deleted and replaced, but it's not like I can't see where Riot is coming from. And Riot has be very vocal and forward that Irelia's kit is going to have a lot replaced when they finally get to her.
