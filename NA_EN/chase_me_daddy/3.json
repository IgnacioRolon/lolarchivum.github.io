I'm asking because the hair is a huge point of contention and has been (for me at least) since the original release of this skin. I love the way the hair looks in the Splash art and other official art but the in-game model for the hair fails to meet expectations. I was hoping that Ezreal's VU would be a second chance for the hair to get fixed but it's not looking like that's the case. [I made a quick edit of what it could look like](https://imgur.com/bbOKhSq)\n\nNow that he'll be coming to the PBE again can you guys _please_ consider taking a second pass at the hair model to make it a little more accurate to the art?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-09-24T18:47:31.573+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"THANK THE HEAVENS!
