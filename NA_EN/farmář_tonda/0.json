I don't recall exactly, but isn't there an option on OBS to set your region?  It's possible that it reset to a hub that's further away from you, so it's taking longer for your network to transmit data.  Double check your OBS profile (might be same area you input your stream key) to make sure you're using the closest server. Also tune up your [connection ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) a bit to make sure it's not unstable or degrading.  :O  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
