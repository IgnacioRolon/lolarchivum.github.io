Back in 2011 is when I started LoL. I had just gotten done my first semester of college and was catching up with friends from back home. My closest friend told me about this game she was playing with her boyfriend at the time, and at first I was skeptical. I wasn't much for PvP games, they were always so intimidating to me. I was much more of a PvE MMO style player. \n\nHowever one day over Christmas vacation she sent me a link to the old League website, specifically to Sona's champion page. She simply said \"I think this character is someone you'd really like.\" So I read her lore, back when they had the whole \"League Judgments\" as well, and immediately was hooked on her before even knowing what she did in the game. The fact that she fought on a political battleground by silently weaving music with the Etwahl (which I have made so many theories as to what exactly the Etwahl is) was just mesmerizing to me. I'm not one for 'baddass' characters. I like graceful characters who are simply baddass because they survive in this world by being powerful and beautiful. And to me Sona fit that like a glove. \n\nOnce I started playing the game I unlocked Sona as soon as I could. I learned the support role and would play nothing but Sona just repeatedly. (This was back when maybe three people in the game played support, so no one argued when I called it.) As time went on I bought all of her skins, and basically just became a Sona main. Even now, especially with Teambuilder I tend to just play Sona all day. \n\nI'm glad that Sona came before the whole Lore ~~Trashing~~ Revamp. It's the personality they created for her back then that drew me to her, and subsequently she is the reason I still play today. \n\nTL;DR:  It's Sona","replies":[]},{"poster":"ActuallyArrow","date":"2015-03-25T22:00:55.378+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:107}} \n\nShort version: I liked Rengar before I started playing League.\n\nLong version: About a two years ago my friend told me about the game, and I dismissed it for the same reason anyone dismissed MOBAs at the time. Eventually she brought the game to my attention again, and I eventually gave in and started looking at the roster of characters. I am one of those gamers that love unlocking characters (Its an addiction), so I was interested in that. I started reading about the lore, etc. None of it really caught my attention until I came across Rengar. His lore, his looks, his attitude, everything about him made me want to play the game just to own him. So of course I downloaded the game, and played a few matches as Ashe. I was quite upset at how much Rengar cost, and how long it would take to unlock him. To say the least, I watched videos of him, read lore on him, drew him, etc. for a good while before I actually started getting into the game. \n\nI got to lvl 8, had about 4900 IP, and was excited about how close I was to getting him. My internet hit a rocky spot, then my computer gave up on life, and I had to stop playing for 6+ months. About 3 months ago I got a new computer, and the first thing I did was continue saving for Rengar. He was the second champ I owned, and I grinded through it all with Ashe. \n\nNow, I hardly use him because I suck with him and at jungling. But no matter what, he is still my favorite champ and I am pretty happy I have him in my collection.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronChefBoyardee","date":"2015-03-26T20:58:32.745+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:86}}  Because Garen's just a dude. \n\nHe's just a military grunt from a military family, no special powers (his ult isn't really part of his lore anywhere, best I know), no magic; just a dude and his sword up against gods and monsters.  Garen stands against the overwhelming might of a creature born and bred of fire, an ancient sorceress helping to cause the next ice age, a woman and a yordle with near unlimited potential, void creatures that could swallow up the world itself, reborn ascendant God-kings, beings of pure energy, unknown fey magic and numerous others.  Garen stands for what is right is the face of overwhelming power knowing damn well he's just a dude with a sword and the skill to wield it, rushing into battle to protect innocents and willingly put his life on the line.\n\nThat is why Garen won me over, that is why Garen is my favorite champion in League.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sythriel Draken","date":"2015-03-26T03:52:08.574+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would have to say {{champion:222}} or her \"Sister\" {{champion:254}} .

At the time, I hadn't really found a main yet, and I just kind of jumped between Master Yi and whoever was in the free rotation that week. Then, one day I spot TF in the shop, and I'm immediately interested. At first, it's mostly because of his character design (let's face it guys, the hat and jacket are all kinds of awesome), but then I started looking into him more and I found out he could do cool things like teleport. I initially got a little scared out of buying him because of his difficulty level, but eventually I caved. Thankfully, because of how difficult he allegedly was, I decided to not blindly charge into battle with him like I had previously done with other new champs, and actually do some research instead. Thankfully, it paid off and my transition to TF wasn't as rough as it could've been. Once I started using him, I absolutely loved him. I like being able to farm, so his Q was appealing, and once I figured out his W, I was a very happy summoner. Plus, even though it's not global, I get a thrill out of using his R to surprise other champs and gank them. I'm not going to say I'm great at him yet - this whole story dates back to probably about a month ago, so I'm still learning some of his technique.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-03-26T00:34:12.169+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:117}}\nI am sorry, but you are a squirrel.

I tend to like card themes, so I liked the guy's design.\n\nI looked a little bit into it, and it turns out TF was on the free champion rotation on that particular week. So I thought \"Well why not, it's a free game so if I decide I don't like it I can uninstall later\".\n\nAnd here I am now =|\n\n---\n\nAs for other champions, I liked {{champion:117}} Lulu because turning a rampaging enemy beast/warrior/demi-god into a cute little harmless fuzzy thing is more hilarious to me than it should be, even today. Honestly, if Whimsy was the only skill on her kit, I'd still try to play her for that reason alone.\n\n{{champion:68}}  Rumble, because he was rarely played, and his Heat mechanic meant, to me, that he would play differently than any other champion, which was the main thing I was looking for my first few months in playing League. I considered him my main champion for the longest time.\n\n{{champion:28}}  For a similar reason as above, permanent stealth meant she'd play differently. Although I very rarely played her in any PvP games (outside of ARAMs), so it was mostly playing against bots, but I did play her a ton with a group of friends I had at the time (Who i don't talk to as much anymore). Now that I think of it, I don't think I've ever tried jungling with her, only trying her mid (in the aforementioned bot games).\n\n{{champion:222}}  She was the next champion to be released when I started playing, she had a music video that built up tons of hype for her, I needed an ADC anyway, you do the math. Strangely enough, in the two Mystery Gifts I've ever used in my lifetime, BOTH of them have been Jinx skins. So I think RNJesus wants me to main a certain champions =|\n\n{{champion:150}}  I'll say this as many times as I need to, I have a weakness to cute, fuzzy things. And while some would find it a hinderance, I LOVE the semi-random transformation mechanic: I've said this a few times, but I like champions that have a mechanic that makes them play and approach fights in a different manner (Rumble needs to be careful with silencing himself, Evelynn can gank from angles that no other champion can, etc.), and Gnar's passive means that you have to be aware of your Rage, which decides the difference between \"Stay back and kite\" or \"Go ham and break faces\" and getting into position at the right time (Get closer to the enemy when Rage is getting full, for instance)\n\n---\n\nAs a side note, I feel like I enjoy playing {{champion:48}} more than I should for a champion who, admittedly, would be kind of be the poster child for a champion who just 'out-stats' you to death, since most of his kit is just improving his stats. I actually wish I could try the old classic champion, but unless I get lucky with a mystery gift (The only way you can get Traditional Trundle now), that's probably not going to happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2015-03-25T16:05:33.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:34}} The only champion I played from ~level 10 to level 30.

Haven't seen one for a while though.\n\n **Swain** makes me cringe. His damage over time capability is nothing to laugh at. Now with Athene's buffs, he'll see BUNCH of play. \n\n**Annie** is so cute in general, I never tried her though. Her ultimate combined with stun is just devastating.\n\n I also picked up **Malzahar** in the beginning. I played him 2 or 3 games then realized he sucked. But he didn't. I could melt tanks with the pool+ulti alone. Devastating results.\n\n **Trundle** is also very fun. Very underrated. His split pushing capability is amazing.\n\n Ooh, another Cho player! Isn't it amazing how he's so easy to understand yet so hard to master? Q positioning is very hard to learn, but if you do: they don't stand a chance.\n\n **Ahri** I never played, but I got rekt by a lot of them.\n\n **Warwick** I still play today. Idk, whenever I play him I feel like I have a 'killer instinct'.\n\n I found **Veigar** so badass I bought his Final Boss skin.\n\n I think Riot has done enough in buffing him, he doesn't need buffs now.\n\n **Shaco** creeps me out **always.**\n\n**Jinx** is also amazing. I never played her, but she's really strong and I almost always lose to one (I also suck at ADC D: )\n\n**Yorick** is *very* rarely seen. I've seen one 3-4 times and every time they almost do the best in their team.\n\n**Irelia** . Absolutely hate her. Always rekts me. Her tankiness and damage dealing capability is amazing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khazmopolitan","date":"2015-03-25T13:15:09.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:31}}  too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dearg Doom","date":"2015-03-25T12:31:23.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:45}} Veigar was just the coolest champion I saw when I first began playing.
