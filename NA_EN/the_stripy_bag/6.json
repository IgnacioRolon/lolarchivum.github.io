So Riot basically want to sell a glorified chroma for the price of a full skin to which I respond are you shitting me?! Sure if you own the regular guardian skin you get a 30% discount but even so with that price you could buy either Primetime Draven or Surpise Party Fiddelsticks which are both legendary skins! for the price of a glorified chroma! Are you for real Riot in trying to milk that much money out of your customers and you still won't fix the game of crash inducing bugs and stuff?!\r\nP.S. F the Star Guardians,all who use them,all who willingly buy them,f the dumbass hamsters,f the sparkles,f the bs 5 man missions,f me for having to censor myself.\r\nP.S.S Riot you do know there are more animes right?","replies":[]}
