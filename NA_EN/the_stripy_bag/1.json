I mean jesus f#@$ing christ she's not even on PBE yet. Same on yall for being shallow if someone's appearance is enough for you to not play them though considering the champion involved it doesn't matter anyways since none of you play her in her current form,s#!%, and I'm one of the first people to say f#@$ you to Riot but it tends to be for a good enough reason rather than just how someone looks.

I'm sure it just looks better in-game than the current classic one, which is heavily outdated.\n\nAnd, no, it's not comparing two different characters.
