If you're a mac player, the current workaround is to tap Alt+Enter while in-game to switch to a windowed mode.  The inherent issue may be caused by a custom resolution, so double check your settings in-game and see if you can change it to a standard resolution.  I hope that helps for now!","replies":[{"poster":"WintÃ«r","date":"2017-05-03T23:15:03.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found this a little too late and lost one of my promos R.I.P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Timisto","date":"2017-05-03T20:48:10.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you Porocles, the ALT+Enter trick brought me to the windowed mode and from there I could change it back to Fullscreen.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GymLeaderJP","date":"2017-05-03T17:41:46.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same exact problem! I have not played in months and then I just tried to enter a game after downloading the new client. Everything is fine up to champion select and then when the new game window opens and begins to load, I can only see it in the top right corner of my screen. The other 3/4 are black. I am on a macbook pro and not able to use the escape button to leave the full-screen nor can i press F3 to open other windows. I have no idea how to fix this and just had to leave a game because I physically could not see more than an inch and a half of the map. Since I am on Macbook Pro, I don't have an ALT key. Not sure what the fix is here but as soon as someone finds one, please let us know!","replies":[{"poster":"GymLeaderJP","date":"2017-05-03T18:11:05.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, actually this ALT+Enter trick did work for me.

I fixed it by pressing ALT then Enter many times while in game. It all of a sudden worked. Although it doesn't work completely. It still won't allow me to move my screen up so i just had too play borderless. Its frustrating and inconvenient because I'm not use to playing like that but it is what it is until Riot fixes problem. Im on mac as well. Hope this helps!

You can fix it in game by using the settings. So in game you see only a quarter of your screen. Press esc and you will see the settings but only like the bottom left or just a corner, you can drag the setting screen so you can see the video settings and change the screen settings so its like windowed or something like that and it fixed my problem, but im still having some troubles trying to play it on just the regular full screen. Windowed is very similar to full screen and you can play no problem. Just try it out in normals or even practice mode. I am also using a mac. Hopefully this helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"OPGxCommando","date":"2017-05-05T10:41:36.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same problem.
