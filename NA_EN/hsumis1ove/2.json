But, unfortunately, you have to keep in mind that team fights DO matter.

I am sad to say that the latter is far more often the case in my experience.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I really do not feel strongly against or for Graves. He's just a pain to deal with. But I do not know if being a pain to deal with is what makes a champion broken. A lot of champions are a pain. All of them, in fact. \n\nYou're right. He has an incredible burst. But if they WERE to do something to balance him, I would think that the best thing to do would be to make his Q (his gunpowder boom boom thing) have the same delay if it hits a wall as it does when it doesn't. Unless that's changed recently, I don't know, I so rarely see him. \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2016-07-23T19:17:18.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jhin is an ADC not a duelist.
