If you name a champion, I can go onto my smurf and get a high win rate and KDA on that champion with no effort.\n\nI don't understand why Orianna gets so much hate. I've never had a huge problem with her overall, and watching the LCS, it's pretty easy to see that she's fairly well balanced for competitive play as well. My guess is that people don't bother learning how the champion works, and don't put effort into keeping track of her ball, and just complain that what they don't understand is broken. A magic trick seems to break the laws of physics until you take the time to learn how it works.\n\nIf you look at Apdo's quote again, he says\n1. He can CS more than enemy Oriannas, Taliyahs, and Syndras.\n2. His only problem with those champions is that he can't just stomp the lane (and _not losing_ lane is what those champions are literally all about).\n3. There are no champions that can _defeat_ Orianna mid lane. That doesn't mean you can't win against her late-game. It doesn't mean you can't outfarm. It doesn't mean you can't roam. Just that you won't defeat her in laning phase, meaning getting kills and/or taking the turret in lane phase.\n\nAnd lastly, maybe you should either A) put time into getting better at the champion before heading straight into ranked with him, or B) find a champion you _can_ play well already who is also fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Handin Out Naps","date":"2017-07-16T21:00:13.592+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well first off I have been playing Zed since I started the game.

Read what you are typing, the best mid laner in the world cant beat Ori's in lane because the champion is too hard to do anything to in lane.  He is a better player by a large margin, but he cant pressure them because they picked a champion.

She's not going to win lane in most cases, if the player is of lesser or equal skill. She just doesn't lose lane. That's what the champion is about. Why wouldn't he take Orianna mid if it's \"overpowered\"? Because it's almost impossible to _win_ the lane as Orianna, just as it's not very hard to _not lose_ lane as her, against a similarly skilled opponent, or even one of lesser/greater skill.\n\nAgain, she's not overpowered, and Apdo never said she was. He said it's difficult to win _lane phase_ against her. The (second) best mid laner in the world can't win lane against a safe pick by someone who's Master tier with 400 LP. I don't see a problem with that, seeing as he _outfarms_ them.\n\nSo, yes, it is okay, because no, he wouldn't lose if he were slightly worse at the game. Even if he were much worse, and also Master tier, he very likely wouldn't _lose_ the lane.\n\nI'll say it one more time. Orianna is a safe pick. That's why she's chosen.

Most mid mages outside of Syndra and Ahri aren't even worth mentioning. Orianna's counters (longer ranged mages such as Ziggs, Lux, Azir, etc) are nerfed to where they aren't even good picks in mid. So is there any reason why people are flocking to a safe pick where it wouldn't be a clown fiesta in mid lane? \n\nAs for mana arguments, Lost Chapter needs a nerf.\n\nBut I wonder if nerfing Orianna is going to solve anything. It might make her less picked, but it doesn't fix the fact that mid mages has been slowly forced out of mid lane and into either the trash can or bot lane, leaving mid lane open for assassins, ADCs, and bruisers to take over.

In this case you have an extremely aggressive midlaner who's halmark is stomping the hell out of his opponents and carrying games bitching about champions who's halmarks are being extremely safe laners who are hard to kill during the laning phase.  Gee I wonder why he could be complaining about them.\n\nThe same reason pro ADCs complain about assassins, the reason pros that favor tanks complain about ADCs, the reason assassin mains complain about champs like Janna and Lulu, I could go on.  People who favor a specific playstyle or champ bitch about champs that counter those playstyles.  \n\nI would be willing to bet he would bitch if mid lane Morgana became a thing again, because if you think Orianna/Syndra/Tailyah are safe laners who you can't crush mid Morgana has been the poster child for safe mid laner since she was created.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-07-17T18:33:24.579+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Isn't Orianna vulnerable to longer ranged poke such as Xerath, Lux, Vel'Koz and Ziggs?","replies":[{"poster":"Hyperiön","date":"2017-07-17T19:01:49.878+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HalcyonDweller,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7gjZIN5B,comment-id=002c,timestamp=2017-07-17T18:33:24.579+0000)\n>\n> Isn&#x27;t Orianna vulnerable to longer ranged poke such as Xerath, Lux, Vel&#x27;Koz and Ziggs?\n\nShe is.\n\nOr anyone with the slightest mobility.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-07-17T19:12:24.425+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thought so.

Sure, she can hard pressure at lvl1 and 2 due to her zoning potential, and deny farm because of her Ball being such a threat, but her weakness is instant burst with escapes. Orianna's Ball doesn't instant move, so she will have a lot of issues with Mobile enemies who can also deal a decent chunk of damage, and Zed is someone who does both in it's perfection.\n\nZiggs as far as I am Concerned possesses the stronger Siege Potential and Harrass Inlane, his Q's can chunk absurdly hard once you hit lvl 9 and got maybe half of your Morell done with boots, which actually is not that much AP to consider. His AoE ranges make it further difficult for Orianna because she Needs to position herself in order to possess the range for positioning her Ball, and Ziggs can deny her that Self-positioning with his W and his E, whilst harrassing her inlane with his Q and push Towers hard with his passive and his W Tower-execute.\n\nLong Story short, Orianna is a threat, she is very strong, and she does not require an otherworldly skillcurve to Play. She is hard to master, but she is incredibly easy to pick up and make first steps with. However she has defined Counters, they are just not popular as of right now, but that does not make them non-existent.","replies":[]}]}
