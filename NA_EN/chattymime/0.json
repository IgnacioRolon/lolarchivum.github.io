And it gives me a warning about leaving, and won't let me continue unless I click I Agree. I do not agree, although, I had to click that. Just to let you know. If my keyboard and mouse are messed up again, I'm going to leave. And that's stupid that that's how that is set up, because that's not my fault.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-15T01:45:20.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chermorg basically hit the nail on the head here. It sucks that your keyboard and mouse were messing up, but sadly there's not a whole lot I can do from here to prevent that. What we can do however is try to make sure that doesn't happen again by resetting your config files with these steps.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-14T14:25:35.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I regret I can’t bring better news, Riot and many other organizations consider an error in equipment not owned by the company to be the responsibility of the end user. For example, your keyboard and mouse are your decision and maintenance is your responsibility. If there is an issue with your equipment, it is not Riot’s fault, it is your own responsibility (not necessarily your fault, but your responsibility).\n\nLikewise, if you’re driving on the road and your headlight goes out, the police will pull you over and issue a ticket. It wasn’t your fault your headlight went out, but it’s your responsibility to ensure that your equipment (in this case your automobile) is in working order before attempting to utilize it in public.","replies":[]}]}
