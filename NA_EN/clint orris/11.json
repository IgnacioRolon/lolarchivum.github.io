Also, as above, most tanks are either top laners which are either in the mirror match where the resist isn't ENTIRELY relevant or in an AD match up which they want armor. Outside of Swain there are next to no AP top laners in the current meta so the top lane tank usually don't have to get it first or second item. Meanwhile the jungle tanks NEED to get cinderhulk first and then transition into Warmogs in almost ALL games according to na.op.gg (Sejuani goes Warmogs second in over 50% of her games played with Zac having the exact same trend). So my point still stands that a tank on 2 items is going to have next to no magic resist in almost all scenarios.\n\nAlso, even if Maokai/Ornn does opt for an MR item (which is almost ALWAYS second item) its going to be a 55 MR item that is not adaptive helm because they synergize way too much with Spirit Visage/Abyssal Mask respectively so they will still get shredded by Cass because the opportunity cost of going adaptive is too high.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2018-03-31T19:32:15.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"mf dodges sej's ult.
