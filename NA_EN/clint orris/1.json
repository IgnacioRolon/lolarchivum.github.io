Only a few assassins are focused on killing their lane opponent.  Most designs are like Katarina or Kassadin, and aim at killing in other lanes.\n* Most assassins have a pretty solid poke move.  The ones who don't have ridiculously obnoxious 100-0 potential, and players find that to feel more unfair.  It's good for assassins to have to do some setup work before making the kill.\n* It is almost definitional to the role that the assassin can get out again after making the kill.  Riot really dislikes Diana's design of getting in, assassinating something, and then relying on tankiness to not die.\n\nHe is pretty healthy, as far as assassins go.  You get a lot of windup on his assassination combo to plan your defense. He can juke and be juked.  He's not overbearingly strong in any phase of the game.  You can more effectively itemize against him than most assassins.  Note that \"healthy\" is not a term about power level; it's quite possible for a champion to be healthy and OP, or healthy and UP.\n\nZed might be OP.  I'm honestly not sure.  He's quite good, but mostly I just think we're seeing the effects of Chalice nerf.  Everybody wants to play something without a mana bar, and nobody wants to play the waveclear mages that were keeping Zed in check before.","replies":[{"poster":"rinsujo","date":"2015-01-15T19:08:35.223+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"This, ladies and gents, is how you disagree with someone effectively.

LB has a double dash and un-dash blink, but she sacrifices her stronger burst combo to do so.

You obviously don't play both of the champs, because you know so little about one of them.

Talon takes considerably longer. \n\nPlus, Talon can TRY to use his ultimate as an escape but sweeper/pink counters that, and he can only go so far... while Zed can hop and escape out of juts about any situation, still making him vastly superior IMO.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hawkefire","date":"2015-01-16T08:24:47.343+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Uhhhhh.....Zed doesn't scale with attack speed....like at all.\n\nThe only reason, and I do mean ONLY reason, Zed builds a Botrk is for the ACTIVE.\n\nYoumuus is build for the Armor Pen and movement speed boost (mostly for the armor pen)\n\nZed usually doesn't autoattack more than 3 times if he pulls his burst combo off correctly.\n\nThere are 3 things Zed scales with (in order of favorableness)\nArmor Pen\nAD\nCDR","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-01-16T15:59:18.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well actually Attack speed will likely help Zed quite a bit if he is in a duel or in a scenario where he can auto attack since his auto attacks can hit really hard with the whole 30% increased bonus AD and especially so if it get's \"amplified\" by his ult\nThough yes it certainly isn't the most helpful for his burst","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ashes Arise","date":"2015-01-15T23:43:59.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I would also argue that he is the most well designed pure assassin champion in the game.\n\nI would classify the following champions as pure assassins, and I will give a reason/s why I feel they aren't designed as well as Zed. I'm not calling these champions unbalanced or OP. I'm just stating why I feel Zed is better designed, and should be rewarded for it.\n\n-Akali\nI don't need to go into detail on this one. Pretty universally agreed that she is one of the worst designed champs in the game. From the synergy of over the top spellvamp and heavy stealth to being un-kiteable due to R\n\n-Evelynn\nConstantly being nerfed to unviablility because of the lack of counter play. Her nearly infinite stealth allows her to pass by wards and sneak up on people a little too well. When she does ambush a person she has very strong chase and misleading escape. Chasing an Evelynn is very similar to chasing a singed. She can damage you with hatespikes by spamming it during her escape, and can turn on you with nearly unparalleled chase.\n\n-Fizz\nMassive aoe damage and one of the highest bursts in the game (Veigar exists). Extreme mobility, burst and high sustained damage. He is also one of the most difficult champions in the game to attack even in meelee range. He has no stealth, but does that really even matter with this champion?\n\n-Kassadin\nR R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R\n\n-Katarina\nOh dear god. The Queen of aoe assassination. When I hear the term \"assassin\" I picture someone quickly taking out a single target. This champion can assassinate an entire team. Her resets give her power in ways that it shouldn't. There are situations where 1 person can easily duel her but the presence of a squishier team mate can put the odds in her favor instead of the other team. It is really strange that there are situations in most games where she has a better chance of going 1v3+ than she does in a 1v1 against one of the same champions.\n\n-LeBlanc\nLeBitch\n\n-Shaco\nThe King of deception and stealth. This champion laughs in the face of Riot's philosophy on clarity. His entire kit is based on destroying clarity.\n\n-Talon\nHis single target assassination has the least counterplay attached to it of any other assassinate in the game. Not to mention his initiate and escape are even beyond Zed's That is pretty much it. Rengar used to be a close 2nd, but since his rework he can be viably played closer to a bruiser. This is why I'm leaving Rengar off this list.\n\nRemember, I'm not saying I have a problem with these assassins. I'm merely showing how Zed is the most well designed champion in the role that has most of the worst designed champions in the game.\n\nIn the end, Zed is a single target assassin, without stealth, that has very well established counter play. He can be frustrating to play against, but that is because of his role. It isn't because his individual champion design.","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2015-01-16T00:07:41.504+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Ashes Arise","date":"2015-01-16T01:53:11.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't say the other assassins were weaker.

Even if it can be done, it shouldn't be done. The last thing anyone wants is a game with all champions being homogenized clones with only insignificant differences.
