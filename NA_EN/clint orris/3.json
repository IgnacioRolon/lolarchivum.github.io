Back in the day, Magnificent TF was expensive, but was a pretty big deal. Same with Udyr's skin. It was a big deal at the time and one of the first \"major\" skin with a ton of visuals and what not added to it. \n\nWith all the technology Rito has now, the expectations are a lot more.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-03-08T04:16:19.914+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"> MF's skin is literally 4 Chromas\n\nNo it is not.

Lots of people bought into that player made thread that suggested a top lane ultimate skin. It's gotten to the point people are believing riot actually promised it, when it was really just a fan theory the whole time.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Perfect Hunter,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=7J7rWQ82,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-03-08T04:19:49.857+0000)\n>\n> Are you serious, they have legit arguments that does make sense and you just brush off as banter?

Your skin's colour then corresponds to that element. Moreover, you can then mix elements for secondary elements. Moreover, these are permanent. GGMF's colours could have been anything. Switching at will between colours doesn't feel \"earned\", and moreover the colours themselves are arbitrary.\n4. MF has MANY skins already... quality skins at that. I know riot has an analytics team, and the higher ups get the report and say \"MF sells most skins, we need more $$\". It is what it is.\n\nNot an awful skin, but nothing original, funny, scary, sexy, different, risky about it. Just a very safe \"goliath mech\" skin.
