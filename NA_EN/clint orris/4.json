This is demonstrably false and rewrites NB history in favor of making it seem like the fun mode. The fact is TFT isn't for all league players: It's for those who like DAC-style games and who enjoy games where the focus is less on mechanical skill and more on critical thinking and manipulation of odds. \n\nIt's fine if you don't like TFT, it's not for everyone, but coming in here and blatantly sharing false information while praising a ton of subjective things about Nexus Blitz isn't telling anything.

Or another way to put it - Nexus Blitz wasn't bringing any extra profit - other than the general gains from Skin sales.

Tho, beyond the basic mascots - you also have the commercial part - or more like a \"gambling scheme\" - which can generate profit from users who want their mascot to stand out, collectors and people who struggle with gambling additions. Not to mention - this mascots are far easier to put together compared to a champion skin.\n\nAnd  that's basically the story behind TFT - and why it's here to stay.

NB was great and insanely fun but could grab enough audience from SR or ARAM since it directly competes. \n\nTFT benefits from appealing to both the currently league audience if they like the style of game and the otherside audience as well for new players that will only play TFT. Nexus blitz could never do that because it remains to be still league  \n\nWhat people find fun in subjective and frankly unimportant if people are finding something fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jennifer420","date":"2019-08-06T15:13:53.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i called it the second was tft announced and i still call it. tft will lose its hype very quickly (mainly due to riot ignoring feedback as they always do) and riot will remove it with the same excuse as they removed dominion, nexus blitz and soon 3v3. \"not enough people played it and we are too lazy to constantly update it\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trias000","date":"2019-08-06T14:02:09.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Clint Orris,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=kp9wKV5p,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-08-05T17:35:37.246+0000)\n>\n> The only real strategy in tft is just luck\n\nLuck is when preparation meets opportunity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-08-05T18:06:33.731+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":21,"body":"The problem is you dont even understand tft, given you think it is luck based.\n\nYes, rng plays a part of it, but it is entirely skill based given you have more than enough tools to influence what happens.\n\nAuto chesses are the new current fad, and tft does it really well. Its also something entirely different from a standard league game so it fills a niche that an entirely different game would fill.\n\nOf note, i preferred nexus blitz, but i can see why this will just straight up do better.
