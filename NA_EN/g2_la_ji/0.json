What happens is the queue tells your client that it's found a match, but your network doesn't interpret that signal fast enough to tell you, then the timer runs out. \n\nLet's adjust your network settings to make sure you're able to get those messages in time so that you don't keep missing your queue's. Typically, updating your Port Forwarding and DNS settings can give you a cleaner connection with our servers, but make sure you do the other steps listed in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) if those don't seem to help. Also, make sure to test these changes in a custom/practice game so you don't get hit with a leaverbuster for missing those queues.","replies":[{"poster":"G2 LA JI","date":"2017-10-16T04:39:28.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just failed my promotion on B05 cuz of it, Cant see anything pop up then a message shows I failed my promotion by not ready up.
