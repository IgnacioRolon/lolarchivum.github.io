Please do HELP  in asap.  Super annoying, I can't play any games in any type right now. And it's getting close to season end.

Hit up the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and linked and try the steps I explained in your last post, which you linked here.
