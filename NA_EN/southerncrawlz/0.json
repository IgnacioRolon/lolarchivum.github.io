I know there are plenty of new players that have likely made the same post I am now. But, I really would appreciate some honest feedback. At the risk of simply being told “git gud”, I am having a really hard time EVERY time I play a ranked match in Solo/Duo Q. And sadly, teaming with players I’ve played with before does not tend to help. \r\n\r\nI am a level 35 summoner with level 29 mastery score and Bronze II rank. I have played up to Platinum Rank in games similar to LoL, but frankly those games do seem easier than LoL. I’m FAR from being the most skilled player, but I think that I at least know enough to not be a complete idiot when in the rift. What I find so crazy, is that I actually do well in unranked matches. That may not mean much, but I get A to S scores there fairly consistently. I go to ranked Solo/Duo and I feel that I struggle the entire game. The skill difference of the players from ranked to unranked seems skewed. \r\n\r\nNo matter how I have performed, I have yet to be told that I’m trash or had much wrath focused my way, which I’m pleasantly surprised by. However, I was in a game today (playing as Swain top lane) in which I was told by a teammate (Fizz mid lane) who was smurfing that I would perform better if I could actually hit the enemy with my skills. I was vs. an Aatrox who was smurfing as well. Admittedly, the Aatrox was more skilled than I was, but I was at least doing ok. I was not constantly being slaughtered by him, but I was playing the lane very safely which did effect my CS.\r\n\r\nI replied to the Fizz, that I agree, but I am still a relatively new player. I said further that I was doing my best and if you look at our teams performance I was obviously not the only teammate having a hard time (our jungler and mid himself were getting outplayed as well). The Fizz then replied that if I’m a new player that I “don’t belong in Solo Q”. The convo ended there, we kept playing the game and ended up winning it. \r\n\r\nWhat I’m confused by, is that the point of a ranking system and the solo queue is that new players are able to play the game and rank up against players of a similar skill level... This is why I’m new and in BRONZE rank. Again, I’m not the best player, but to expect me to perform well against someone else who is smurfing is a little unfair. Right?\r\n\r\nSo, I’m now finally to the main point of my post... I know smurfing exists and will always exist. I guess there will never be a truly fair and balanced solo experience. But, how am I to prepare for those experiences? Does an enemy player that is a smurf really make that big of a difference? Should I learn to play only meta champions? Was the Fizz right and I should only play unranked until I am more experienced? If so, when is a good time to dive into ranked play? \r\n\r\nThanks for your time","replies":[{"poster":"COBRA C0MM4NDER","date":"2020-01-07T00:35:32.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked is ok if you like a bit of competition and climbing.

Ranked is the best way to improve. You never know what kind of fuckery youre playing against in normals. They may be drunk, trying a new champ for the first time, distracted in real life and playing normals instead of ranked because they know theyre gonna play like shit. So you get a completely inaccurate idea of how you are performing. You could think oh hey im definitely improving, and then go to ranked and get completely smashed again, because now youre playing against players who are playing their best champs under optimal conditions with no distractions. I know this could still happen in ranked exclusively, but its less common to have first timers and people who just dont care so much.\n\nSo I'd say, let people bitch and moan. Play ranked if you find it more fun and you care about improving. If youre just casually playing a game or three on the weekends, then yeah, maybe avoid ranked.

One, ask for advice at the start of the game (in ranked), perhaps admitting what your weak point(s) are. Inexperience is a weakness- in not being familiar with all the roles and champions. Many don't really know what Yorick can do... or what Taric's passive is. Honestly, going to the wiki for every champion is a trudge, so just ask others what to look out for against champions you don't really know.\n\nSecond, try expressing positivity, and be a little personable with your teammates. Hand in hand with the first, you're sure to get more support both in chat and on the field. It's more impactful in ranked games, as your teammates want to win and have incentive to help you perform better when they know you're trying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Itirpon","date":"2019-12-28T18:56:11.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Foremost, it's important to realize that the ranking system is garbage: It's too volatile, measures outcome instead of agency in a game where ability to win by/for oneself can be stripped from a player by one mistake or counterpick, and doesn't measure the actual hallmarks of experienced play (like CS/m, vision scores, objective taking).

(See diamond vs a gold player). Then, against a player of their own skill, not only WOULDN'T they maintain that godly level of statistic, the other player, who also understands fundamental league of legends mechanics, unlike the gold player, will be able to pressure them off of getting that statistic.

MMR = ??? \n> \n> I should make a habit of doing one Normal and then one Ranked?\n\nMatchmaking basically only takes into account your winrate, if I understand it correctly.\n\nWhich means at first it sets you at a baseline skill leve, which is somewhere in silver. And then, when you lose you get lower, when you win you get higher. It moves a lot at first, and then it stabilizes around an mmr level such that you get a 50% WR. Of course no one actually gets to 50% winrate, because of your evolving skill and other uncontrollable factors, but that's how it is.\n\nAnd personally I think you should start playing ranked when you start having fun in this mode. If it's so hard it's frustrating, then keep playing normals. However, if you really want to learn and improve and don't mind the difficulty of ranked, go for it.\n\nAnd you're not supposed to beat a smurf, it's just plain unfair as you said. Best you can do is try to figure out what makes him so good. What does he do differently ? Don't feel bad if you don't know, most of what they do better is far from obvious, it's a lot of subtle things.\n\nAnd as what to do, I don't know. When I played a role that required last-hitting, I always did a 10-min last-hitting practice session in practice mode. That helped a lot. Now I play jungler so I generally go straight into ranked and only play a few games, and I do a 30 minutes break minimum if I lose to avoid tilt (losing one game makes you more likely to lose the next one because of the impact on your morale, even if you think you're not that tilted). \n\n\nPersonally I also got into ranked as soon as I hit level 30, because of the anticipation as well, and got really destroyed, but I sticked to it even though I was at 10% winrate at some point. After a few dozens games I got put where I belonged, which was bronze 4, and I had better games. And I don't regret doing that. Overall, matchmaking adjusts more quickly in solo/duo, and I'm also finding that games tend to be more balanced there. \n\nAnyway, just my personal experience, do with that as you will.

This is for 2 reasons.  The first is that autofill exists and you don't always get the roles you like to play.  The second and more important one is to understand what the other players in your game are doing.  If you have never played jungle before, you won't understand when the enemy jungler will gank you or why your jungler won't help you at times.  If you've never played support before, you will have a smaller understanding of good warding spots or why your support doesn't int with you when you go into an unfavorable fight with them in range to help you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-12-28T17:28:07.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Understand that Normal (or unranked as you called it) has its own mmr and ranked has its own separate mmr.  If you do not play an equal amount in both modes (for both mmr to be appropriate level to you skills), you will most likely experience different teammates/opponents set in either modes.  Maybe your Normal mmr is not very high so you tend to play with or against lower skilled players and your ranked mmr is higher so you play with more skilled players.  Or maybe it's the other way around.  My point is that it is not all that surprising if you find your Normal and Ranked games to be drastically different experience if you don't play enough games in both modes consistently for matchmaking to put you at appropriate and same levels in both modes.\n\nThere is SOME truth to what the fizz said.  If you are not very well experienced with the game or more importantly the champion, Normal tends to have less stake (being there's no LP to lose for yourself and your teammates) so it's a good place to practice your swain skillshots for example.  As far as when is a good time to dive into ranked, different people will have different opinion on this.  Some will think it's better to grind out the experiences in Normal (where you don't lose LP and such) until you are Challenger before going into ranked.  Some will think ranked is where people are the most competitive and is the best place to learn (you don't learn much where people think \"it's just Normal\" and won't try as hard).\n\nPersonally, I'm all for practicing champions you've never played before in Normal where you'll probably cause less toxicity due to your teammates more than likely to use that excuse to make you the scapegoat should you lose the game.  However, I find consistently playing ranked so that you are always at your appropriate mmr skill level to be better if you are someone who cares about the experience of climbing the ladders and ranking.  But always remember that at the end of the day, this is just a video game.  Whether you win or lose, it's still just a video game, not real life, not real job.  The point is to have fun.  If you are not having fun in ranked, go play Normal.  If Normal is boring because people don't try as hard, go play Ranked.  Play the mode you enjoy more than the other.","replies":[]}]}
