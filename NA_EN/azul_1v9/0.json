I personally do not think is grounds for a permanent suspension, though I have received one. I had tried my best in both games but despite this I had played poorly along with my teammates. I try to learn from every game I lose, and had fully intended to do the same with these games, though this was not possible as to my surprise I had been permanent suspended the next time I logged in. I am sure that I had not griefed these games, especially not intentionally. I had off games. Despite my ticket to Riot, all I had received in return was that I had griefed with no explanation. This would be my second suspension, and the first was fully my fault and I accepted that, I had been especially agitated that first ban happened. Though recently, I have been making progress in reaching my goal of diamond, coming closer than I have ever been before. I am not denying I had played poorly in these games, and I am not denying I have been previously been banned for griefing a game, though I do contest the 2nd suspension I have received unfairly. These are the two games in which I had “Intentionally Griefed”.\r\nhttps://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/3221815342/93631246?tab=overview\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/3217437531/93631246?tab=overview\r\n\r\n\r\nIn both games I had played very poorly, along with some of my teammates despite my best efforts. I had never queued with the intention of losing, especially with the goal of diamond in my mind. I have been building mobility boots more often as I wanted to try the playstyle. Following my ban I wrote a ticket to Riot Support, and in a couple of days I had received a  response that stated the ban would not be revoked as I had griefed plain and simple. This extract shows this.\r\n\r\n“Your account received a permanent suspension because you were intentionally feeding/griefing in your recent game. Intentionally Feeding/Griefing creates a negative experience for those other players in the game. They are trying to have a fair, competitive, and sportsmanlike game. But by intentionally feeding/griefing takes that away from them and we don't want to encourage that. Since this is the second offense of intentionally feeding, we had no choice but to escalate this to our final penalty because we have warned you about this kind of behavior before and it continued.”\r\n\t\r\n\tAgain, I do not deny that I have griefed before, I learned my lesson from the two week suspension. I understand now that griefing can only create negative experiences for those who are simply just trying to enjoy it, and I deeply regret that I had once griefed. Please believe me when I say I did not grief these games. From the match history itself, and VOD replays if you choose to watch, you will see I did not grief at any point in the game. I simply played horribly. I am a passionate League of Legends player, and have been for three years and I wish to continue to play this game and try my best to model a positive attitude and environment. I am genuinely sorry for previously ruining the experiences of my teammates, and I swear I have been on the tight and narrow since.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSincerely,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     Jeffery (Azul 1v9)","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-12-05T03:06:38.555+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"At first I was pretty skeptical, the games didn't look _too_ bad, but I did some more digging and I'm leaning towards this ban being warranted.

Doesn't seem like that big a deal on the surface, but here is why it's important:\n\n The only other time you've done this was [**in this game right here**](https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/3201824740/246169660?tab=overview), which I assume was the first time you got punished for intentionally feeding.

You walked up, underleveled, Q'ed into the entire enemy team, and then died instantly. This was towards the end of the game, so you should have been playing much more defensively and/or, at the very least, not jumping directly into the entire team. \n\n\n- **Walked directly into a fed Nautilus + MF** - Honestly, at first glance this looked like an honest mistake. Maybe you didn't realize they were strong, but either way it seemed a bit fishy and I began to rethink it for various reasons. More on that below.\n\n\n- **Walked directly into a fed Nautilus + MF X2** - This is what made me rethink the above point. The area was warded, your team was not around you, you just walked directly into Nautilus and Miss Fortune again. **(EDIT: And while there's no sound in this video, throughout the majority of this game I can hear your team pinging you to back off.) **\n\n- **Walked directly into a fed Nautilus + MF, danced, then walked back in and died.**- Same as the first point, this one is really bad. You walked up into lane, danced, got caught in a combo, flashed out, then kind of half-walked into the enemy team. Something that _everyone_ should be taking into consideration: OP is Plat+ and [**is a 673k mastery point Kindred main. **](https://championmasterylookup.derpthemeus.com/summoner?summoner=AZUL+1v9&amp;region=NA) These just don't look right to me knowing all of that, even if I were to give you the benefit of the doubt and say you weren't intentionally feeding, you clearly weren't trying here. It shows.\n\n__________\n\n#Update: Volibear game reviewed\n\n[](https://.)\n\n Nothing too bad in this game. Sifted through once on 8x speed, another time on 4x speed. Looked at all the death and teamfight bookmarks, nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n The only thing that happened was OP left at 31 minutes after a teamfight death, the game ended at 33 minutes. Honestly, that's a mistake anyone could make (thinking the game is over and preemptively leaving) and while it's not ideal, it usually doesn't get flagged as griefing. _Maybe_ it was included because OP was punished for it previously in that above Kindred game, but I'm leaning towards it just being a mistake.\n\n Either way; yeah, OP's first game was super suspicious and given that they have a history of intentionally feeding, I personally am very skeptical. I encourage you to research and decide for yourselves, however. Please just stay on topic and keep your comments civil. \n\n Have a great day y'all.

Each for a separate small violation, they grow so as to prevent future violation. When you hurt someone the penal laws kick in, since the administrative measures were ineffective. Cummulation is possible between civil penalties-paying back money back to those who have been negatively impacted, administrative-fees and bills for violations, and penal-getting punished with jail. Also disciplinary-getting fired. However you can't combine administrative-penal and penal punishments, or penal with penal, or civil with civil.\n Here we have, metaphorically 14 days \"in jail\"then after that \"life in prison\". In both cases, the same proof was used( same game, albeit not directly).\nAdditionally, if this is a court, then it is violating constant practices and established precedents(in the countries where such a thing exists, but even in my country, there are rulings which are mandatory, albeit not quite precedents). You can't rule that Nubrac is innocent, despite constant trolling games on end, but permaban this person for 2(1 really) games. The intensity of \"the crime\"is much weaker than trolls who are meant to be banned. \nIf we take disciplinary punishments-before you are fired you have recommendation from your manager, then a warning and after severe disobedience you get kicked out. Additionally, you can be kicked out if you caused a great problem and displayed severe incompetence, but this instance is not that. We have 2 if-ish games. The person was tilted and underfed. In no world was there a way to win. Him jumping in the enemy team was making one final desperate attempt. His bot was shit, mid and top not too hot either, but not really that bad, and he was being invaded. It was doomed. With this context the punishment seems stupid. \nSome Challenger streamers fuck up and feed like dogs some times, but we don't ban them(and we should NOT). If we were to be banned for such small offenses Rito can go ahead and permaban all of us. \nEveryone has tilted(been camped, failed a crucial combo, lost drake, died in a close fight).

Now with the 2nd clip of the mf and naut again, another misplay due to my lack of knowing that naut had ult, I Qed away from his hook which I did indeed dodge, which after he just threw out his ult, you don’t expect me to actually get away from that? Now with the Third clip, I do not always look at map, and I was looking away at the monitor for a split second because my brother was calling for me, which then I ran into naut which I was death either way, I was extremely behind AS a kindred, you have never played kindred so you would not understand kindred because useless past 10 if she can’t get ahead or stay with her team, you also don’t question anybody else that played poorly, just me, pretty unjust. Now with the 4th one, I dance every game to bait, every single game I will do this, this was a winable fight, but our team were playing passively, so I was forced to flash out after I failed to attempt a side step in my reaction time, may I also say that I play with over 90+ ping every day. In NA. Now when I went back in I started dancing again to of course, bait them to me, I did not expect a KATERINA to come not, no MIAs, and such. None of these plays you showed me justify my ban, you are also ignoring my other games where I built tank kindred, just because I succeeded, And again you have never asked for my side of the story, I have been 14 dayed not to long ago, of course I’m not going to INT my games just to get a perma ban on my main account.

I think that maybe a temp ban is more worth than a permanent one seeing as neither one of these games looks like an absolute clear intentionally feed.
