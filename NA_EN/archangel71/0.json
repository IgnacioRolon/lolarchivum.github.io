He was my cousin, young and healthy full of energy. Just 24 years old.\r\nHe was killed by a complete stranger with a heavy punch in his face which left him breathless and unconscious to later die.\r\nHe liked the game and I wanted to ask you to share the grief with me and his family in this dark moment. \r\nFor all you youngsters out there, enjoy life but be careful. there are evil people around everywhere.\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nArchangel71","replies":[]}
