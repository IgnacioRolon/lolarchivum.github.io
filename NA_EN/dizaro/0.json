This number is (laughably) false.\n\n0.06%, you mean. It's hard to really consider your facts when you start off with the wrong number.\n\nBesides that, simply saying it's \"false\" doesn't actually serve as an argument. By what math do you suppose that it's false? What data do you have to support it?\n\nLet's take a rough number and work from there. So, League's playerbase numbers in the millions, so let's say that the playerbase is roughly seven-million. 7,000,000 x 0.06 = 420,000. And this is just rough numbers, the actual value could vary, and this isn't taking into account any special factors (like individual accounts per player), and there isn't any public-facing data with which to compare the math to.\n\nSo unless you somehow have access to data that the community doesn't have access to and are willing to actually go into detail about how the number is false, your claim cannot be regarded as factual. It's just a claim.\n\n> Fact 2: High elo players the get banned, simply play on other smurf accounts and ruin the game experience for others (I particularly enjoy crushing gold4-> plat1 on smurfs - see the numerous nonstop posts about this happening and crying about smurfs/matchmaking as evidence).

In point of fact, it'd be difficult to argue that any one thing serves as a root cause, because the reality is that people flaming is the result of several potential stimuli and triggers compounding into the event.\n\nReporting flamers is the only legitimate recourse players have to deal with them. Reporting the flamer ensures that they'll eventually be punished for their misbehavior, and if the flamer doesn't reform, they'll eventually be banned.\n\nBut surely, if it doesn't solve the issue, you must have the magic bullet to do what the IFS can't?\n\n> I'd actually like to see statistics on average number of report per game for losing team, and winning team.

I don’t feel there’s a ton of toxic players in my games. And I don’t feel like people venture too far off from the average-that most players in a game aren’t being negative. But some do.

The flaw is why is doesn't work.\n\nThe flaw (some toxic players returning on new accounts) is not universal.
