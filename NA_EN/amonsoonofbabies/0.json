I have a story written for my champion concept I'm making, and I need people to tell me what they think! I want this lore to be the best it can be, and I can only do that with **YOUR** help and criticism! It may be a bit long (1555 words), but it should be worth your time. If it isn't, I encourage you to tell me why in the comments! Say why you liked it, say why you hate it, or say what could be better. Thank you all who decide to take a look!\n___\nAlright, so... I have a story for you. It's actually, as I mentioned, some lore I have for my champion concept. I don't want to set up any potential spoilers, so I'll put a little of the champion information at the bottom of the story, for comprehension reasons. You can do one of two things:\n\n* You can read through the story, look at the information, then look back to try and connect some things.\n**OR**\n* You can check the champion information first, then read through the story prepared with all the information you need.\n\nWhichever way you prefer is fine; just be mindful that what you do could drastically change how you initially understand the story. As I'd like to get feedback about both perspectives, I suggest reading first, then looking at the related champ info. You can read it, but you can't unread it; that's why it's best to read first, since you can always look back.\n\nOkay, enough of this, here's the story!\n___\n\t*“Dad, where are we?”*\n\n\tI asked, though I knew he wouldn’t answer; he didn’t respond the last three times. My mother wasn’t herself either; on the other side of me, she was staring at the woman speaking at the front of the crowd. This woman called herself the Spider Queen. She looked underneath her hood at the large group of us standing in front of her; the Queen’s cold lips moved methodically as she sized up each person with her blood-red eyes. Her gaze caught mine, and she looked right through me with a sharp-toothed smile.\n\n\tI quickly looked down and gripped my father’s hand tighter. I knew I was old enough to stop holding my parents’ hands, but I really didn’t feel like being a “big girl” at that moment. I turned my head up again to see my father, staring just like my mother, with the same possessed expression.\n\n\t*“Dad, I –“*\n\n\tI just stopped there, as I didn’t see any point in prying. I pouted a bit, and I released my hold on his fingers. That, too, went unnoticed. I let my gaze wander while the bug-eyed woman continued her chant. While I didn’t know where this was, I did know that it was unnerving; it was a cold and dark island with a thin bluish fog that wrapped around the charred branches of the huge, bare, and gnarled trees. The foliage and dirt were a dreadfully deep black, and if there weren’t thick entanglements of ashen wood and bark, there were jagged rocks like teeth in their place, licked by the mist and worn to sharp points. There was only one landmark nearby: a cave in a hillside, the gaping maw of which towered over the forest and imprisoned all light that entered. An uneven staircase of cold rock led from the lip down through darkness; the only thing marking its path being some strands of luminescent mist. Jagged shards hung down from the arch overhead, marred from what looked like generations of wear. This we stood in front of, with the Spider Queen between us and the mouth of the cave.\n\n\tShe must have finished speaking, because the Spider Queen had turned around and was facing the cave. She made a gesture with her hand at her side, and she began walking down the steps into the darkness, her figure fading more with each tap of her feet. I stood frozen; she expects us to go in there? The group moved forward to watch her descent. Her robe slid along, dusting the path which brought her down into the empty abyss.\n\n\tGone. I searched for her silhouette, dug with my eyes into the darkness, but she was no longer there. Thin wisps of mist floated in free-fall slowly downward, loosely twined like ethereal spider webs, falling softly and disappearing just as soon into the dark. There was a low murmur through the crowd, concerned about the queen’s disappearance. One pair of feet stepped forward, moving steadily toward the stairs. More followed. I started to worry; I didn’t want to go down there. I reached to my side, but I found no one there. I looked up and saw both of my parents moving with the rest, uniformly taking turns going down the steps. I shouted:\n\n\t*“Mom, Dad, please! I want to go home! Don’t go!”*\n\n\tNo response.\n\n\t*“Please! Don’t leave me!”*\n\n\tBut they didn’t hear me. The two of them took the same steps together with everyone else, following their queen. I shouted but made no noise, and I watched them disappear from my sight, one after the other, their fleeting bodies fading downward to become one with emptiness.\n\n\tAfterward, I found myself standing there, stoical, looking into the cavern. I was still alone in the surrounding forest, accompanied only by low-lying dead roots and floating strings of mist. I was slowly absorbing how alone I had become. The chilled air gave me goose bumps with how it slid underneath the sleeves of my robes and lightly stroked my skin. The hollow ground of the blackest night echoed back to me the whispers of a thin wind. I could even smell how cold the fog was; it was a blue so frail that I thought it might fold under my hand if I touched it. A small patch in front of me parted past my fingers and dissipated.\n\n\tI heard a snap. I twisted around to look behind me. Nothing was there. The only things there were the blackened, gnarled trees and low, sharpened rocks. No longer suspicious, I turned to gaze back up at the cavern, at a maw that reached more than twice as high as any tree and teeth that were more than twice as sharp as any rock. It had a vacant stare that gave away nothing of the souls it had taken. For a moment, I thought it looked taller than it did before; but then I thought, if nothing was behind me, what made the noise?\n\n\tI slowly looked over my shoulder once more. I looked again into the consuming darkness. A long ways behind me and past a few trees was a stump. In front of that stump was a single severed grey twig, and above that stump was a pair of eyes so deep and so red and so sharp and so boiling angry –\n\n\tI threw myself into the maze of trees nearest to me, bounding around spades of rock, leaping over stretches of roots, and shoving through tendrils of mist, running for all I had left. The ground shook with reverberations of the monster’s chase, each step a thunderous echo to my own. I ran harder, pushing past fog that dragged itself across my robes. A scream escaped through my lips; the monster gave a percussive answer, its booming screech shaking branches and rattling my soul. My legs pulled me faster, frightened of the ground on which they tread. I stole what courage was left in me and dragged my gaze backwards into immediate regret. The grotesque arachnid crushed the earth with every bound of its eight legs. Its gigantic bulbous body crashed against every tree in its way and shattered every one of them to hundreds of pieces. It had a blood-red hourglass on its abdomen, and its numerous eyes held a familiar luster – she even had the same sharp-toothed smile.\n\n\tI dug my heels deeper into the failing dirt, dodging falling branches and flying shards of rock from behind me. The world was breaking apart at its foundation with me at the center, and the Queen was not too far behind. Ropes of mist pulled taut across my path; I slid underneath and advanced my stride, hearing the ropes snap not too far behind me. Charred roots burst out from under the ground, but barely missed my feet, shredding my robes instead. My bare legs shoved my body forward faster than I could comprehend. The blur of obsidian forestry on both sides of me felt like it was closing in, narrowing my path to destruction. I’d never felt this shear level of terror; every aspect of my being screamed so hard that I felt my throat bleeding. My willpower began to fade with my strength as the darkness called for me.\n\n\tBut, far ahead, I saw a clearing through the trees. Ocean waves glimmered with unseen moonlight and shined in my eyes. This was my chance.\n\n\t I bolted through the trees, the world howling after. With inhuman speed, I crushed my feet upon the ground and sunk my soles in deep, cracking darkened earth and spraying broken rock. The very air had faltered in my wake; it trembled back and out of my advance, my will too strong to ever stop. The Spider Queen increased her speed as well, but nearly nothing on this island could have ever caught me in my stride. Fueled by mortal fear and terror so unlike that which I’d felt before, I set my sight on nothing else but shining hope on the horizon. Walls of rock then burst up from the ground ahead of me, obstructing my escape. I braced myself and charged with arms in front, prepared to break whatever necessary on collision. None could stop me. Nothing in that forest full of darkness and despair could pull me back. Everyone was gone. Everything was gone. It was my turn.\n\n\tI broke through the wall of stone. I mean, I did, but my body didn’t. Passed a loud crunch, I slipped through the wall, tumbling softly and slowly in mid-air. After about a minute, I took a moment to look down; I was floating over the edge, and below me I saw the glistening waves crashing against the wall of the cliff. Looking back toward the edge, I only saw a large wall of obsidian with a deep dent in the center. I no longer heard the monster; it was quiet aside from the soothing ocean waves below.\n\n\tDespite the calming silence, I couldn’t help but feel unusually anxious. Floating there, I looked around, feeling like something was about to happen. Floating there, my translucent skin glowing light blue, I felt nothing but fear. Floating there, high above the ocean, completely alone, afraid of nothing, I screamed.\n\n\tFear is my life now.\n___\nAnd there you have it. I won't give *all* of the champion information, but I will provide what is relevant to the story...\n\n> Basic champion concept: **Banshee**\n> \n> *  This champion is meant to have a theme of being terrified of everything and screaming all the time. This is meant to be what she becomes at the end of the story.\n> \n> Place of Origin (Homeworld): **The Shadow Isles**\n> \n> *  This champion, like many, comes from the Shadow Isles. The setting of the story takes place here.\n> \n> Rival: **Elise**\n> \n> *  This champion has no friends, but has one rival, who would be Elise. Elise is the \"Spider Queen\" from the story.  Elise's official lore also has to do with the plot of the story, as hers is about luring unsuspecting cultists into her lair to be fed to her spider god.\n\n___\nSo, now that you have read everything... Do you think I conveyed everything correctly? What do you think about the story overall? Any (constructive) comments are appreciated!\n\nAnd thanks again for taking the time to read!","replies":[{"poster":"Keithan C","date":"2015-03-11T04:43:35.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before I say anything else, I'd like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the story!  Everything else is hyper critical because I think you are both skilled enough and interested enough in what I feel are for the most part minor nitpicks.  By all means take my suggestions with a grain, or a shovel full, of salt.\n\nMy two more 'major' complaints are... I don't really feel I know how old she is.  All references seem to center around just after adolescence, but the distinction isn't 100% clear.  there are some passages that suggest just reaching adolescence and wanting to avoid parental guidance, and others where her mental fortitude is far greater than I'd expect of a child of the age suggested by my initial expectation.  \n\n2nd.  As much as I thoroughly enjoyed this character origin, I didn't really feel Shadow Isles from it.  Mostly Shadow Isles characters feel somehow corrupted by power or death and this really didn't invoke any of that feeling.  Even when characters at odds with the rest of the general populace (Riven for example) they still feel a part of that culture.  This character feels a bit too at odds with at least my perception of the Shadow isles to feel truly integrated. I think her seemingly  untarnished innocence is to blame for this feeling of mine.\n\nFrom now on the 'complaints' are smaller  Again I will freely admit that I'm being overly critical.

And by no means should you feel bad about giving critical feedback; I want as much information as you're willing to give, especially if it's nitty-gritty. I'm hoping to take all the feedback I gain and use it to break down my story; by doing so, I can give it a glorious rebirth, turning it into something far greater than the last! Even then, it will not be perfect... so I will merely have to do it again, burn it and rebuild it as many times as I need to reach its maximum potential. People like yourself are my key to that state of perfection. And so, for that, I thank you immensely for your contribution!\nNow, allow me to begin my reply...\n\n> \"I don't really feel I know how old she is. All references seem to center around just after adolescence, but the distinction isn't 100% clear. there are some passages that suggest just reaching adolescence and wanting to avoid parental guidance, and others where her mental fortitude is far greater than I'd expect of a child of the age suggested by my initial expectation.\"\n\nThis has been an interesting problem for me, actually. I'm not entirely certain how old I should make this champion... At first I thought I would make her a little older than Annie, but then I thought she would be more of a teenager. Ultimately, my indecision appears to have shown in my writing. Once I manage to solidify her physical appearance, personality, and age, I'm certain I'll be able to make that clear.\nYour confusion could, however, be a result of the combination of the high diction and the portrayed age of the main character. She is quite young in the events of the story (or at least she appears to be), but the descriptions in first-person past-tense contradict that. I made this decision mostly based on the idea that she is retelling this story years after the fact, so she is older and more mature by the time she describes these events. I suppose you wouldn't expect that a ghost is aging, but if you consider it in terms of increasing maturity, it makes slightly more sense.\n**Nevertheless...** This contradiction is, to an extent, problematic. I will add this to my list of important aspects to consider during revision.\n\n> \"As much as I thoroughly enjoyed this character origin, I didn't really feel Shadow Isles from it.

This character feels a bit too at odds with at least my perception of the Shadow isles to feel truly integrated. I think her seemingly untarnished innocence is to blame for this feeling of mine.\"\n\nThis is an *extravagant* point you've made. As much as I enjoy being creative, it is vital that Runeterra's archetypes are respected. This actually gave me an idea as to how I can fix this conflict...\nThe solution would probably be in the form of molding how this champion looks or acts. Her appearance would certainly have to be creepy-Shadow-Isles-y (avoiding recreating Kalista, of course), but she would also have less innocence and more... fear, I suppose. It's somewhat difficult to explain. I would need to have less emphasis on innocence and more emphasis on how she is... *corrupted by fear?* Her perpetual terror could become her Shadow Isles corruption and \"power\" (as her screams are meant to be her main weapon). This would also somewhat solve the problem with the excessive innocence. As long as I put more emphasis on the terror and how it affects her, this could work out quite nicely...\n\n> \"As evocative as this is, I really feel it sounds odd as you have smell dictating touch and then color again dictating touch.\"\n\nIndeed, my descriptive words certainly diverged at that point. I think I was attempting to be creative... I just wish I would do that at the *right* time. I'll make the imagery more tangible, for certain; I have enough abstract stuff happening later...\n\n> \"Again very evocative, but very much out of character knowledge. What does the character at present know of the history of this cave?\"\n\nI *was* going to argue to support the description, but then you made that point... she wouldn't know the history of the cave, would she? I mean, as I explained previously, the story is meant to be told from the perspective of the character's older self, but that's a terrible excuse to include something confusing such as this. This is another classic case of me being overzealous with the cave. Again, I'll try to keep it more tangible.\n\n> \"this passage leads directly into the chase. Too directly imo, the transition is far too abrupt and is very jarring.\"\n\nYes, the transition... I'm not sure if I want to keep the change from \"eerie\" to \"high-blood-pressure-oh-mah-goodness\" sudden or gradual. I kind of like the sudden approach, as most of what the character does is run in fear without much question. I suppose I attempted to justify the suddenness with a menacing description of the eyes... but now that I think about it, I could make that far more effective by adding another sentence or two of description. That would increase transitional effectiveness *and* keep it feeling sudden, but the additional sentences would make it a less jarring approach. Very nicely mentioned, I'm glad you said something!\nAnd, by the way, I talked with some of my friends about this passage... I'm removing that grey twig. Too much cliche. I'll think of an even better reason for her to turn around; perhaps some rocks scraping against one another?\n\n> \"this passage suddenly shifts from 'a monster' to 'elise' with no real initial suggestion. For a while I wasn't sure if it was Vilemaw or Elise and while this section made it clear, it was also not as well shadowed as other revelations.\"\n\nWell that's no good... I need that connection to be clear and effective. That's an important part... *perhaps* I could further emphasize Elise's connection with spiders earlier in the story, so that the reader can subconsciously suggest to themselves that it could be Elise before it's even stated? That way it feels like a grand revelation... right? Eh, I'll try that first, and if it doesn't work, I'll try something else. I'm glad you mentioned this, too!\n\n> \"You've written far better/more descriptive sections throughout your work. I feel as though you could really make this evocative and hope you do!\"\n\nWhy thank you =3\nI think by that point I just wanted to get in some more personal feelings of the main character among the excitement... I could have also wanted to simultaneously drag it down into simpler terms after some crazy descriptions. It may not have been a good idea to do that in the middle. I'll certainly do what I can to elevate her terror to a tier at the edge of what is fathomable. I wouldn't want to go beyond, because then the reader can't relate or understand.\n\n> \"This feels entirely out of place. It feels as though suddenly trundle/J4 appeared. To my knowledge no shadow isles character raises obstructions.\"\n\nIndeed, I have to admit, rereading that one part, the rocks feel out of place. I wanted to continue the whole \"the world is against me\" sort of feeling, but rocks are *not* the way to do it here.\n\n> \"I feel as though you could replace this with being caught/slowed by webs (keeping in line with Elise chasing her) and having her still escape her body...

I think you can achieve a similar effect with less disconnect.\"\n\nNow, this... **THIS** is a *SPECTACULAR* suggestion! Like, I can't even describe how excited I am about the mere *idea* of incorporating this into the story. I can FEEL this happening. My fellow summoner, you are **GOLDEN.** Thank you. Genuinely, thank you.\n___\nAnd yes, thank you for *all* of your input and suggestions. I'm not certain if you realize how helpful you've been, but please believe me when I say that you are one of many miracles that have happened upon me while working on this concept (just like Bioluminescence over there). I'm sorry I can't give anything in return, but one thing I can promise, is that I will eventually fix up this lore of mine with all of the feedback I've accrued, and will continue to accrue for as long as summoners like yourself come along to help. I imagine I'll get to working on this again in a couple of weeks, during Spring Break. In the meantime, I'll solidify what I want her physical appearance to be, so that there are no inconsistencies in the story. I feel like the next version will still require at least one more revision afterward to become ready... But based on how much feedback I've gained, if the next version isn't perfection, I'm almost afraid to know what is!\nAgain, thank you for your critical feedback. You are an indispensable asset to my work, and I will not forget it. I may just have to include an \"Honorable Mentions\" with the summoner names of those who have helped me... Of course, with their permission. ;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-03-10T04:45:54.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey AMonsoonofBabies!  (what a name ;)\n\nI don't work directly on League - but I *can* read!  So that's my qualifications for my feedback.\n\nOverall concept is pretty cool - though, I'm more familiar with banshees being harbingers of death than terrified girl ghosts.  The way you write her makes her out to be first special that Elise's powers do not affect her - and then really determined and focused in the subsequent chase.  If her defining feature is supposed to be fear, then I'd almost be tempted to have the rest of her special qualities emerge from that.\n\n---\n\n\n> This woman called herself the Spider Queen. She looked underneath her hood at the large group of us standing in front of her;\n\nI was a bit confused by this turn of phrase - perhaps saying that 'she looked from beneath her hood' would convey your meaning a little clearer.\n\n> I quickly looked down and gripped my father’s hand tighter. I knew I was old enough to stop holding my parents’ hands, but I really didn’t feel like being a “big girl” at that moment.\n\nI liked these lines!  They quite clearly gave me an idea of what sort of age the narrator was, and that she was already scared beyond mere pride.\n\n>I just stopped there, as I didn’t see any point in prying. I pouted a bit, and I released my hold on his fingers. That, too, went unnoticed. I let my gaze wander while the bug-eyed woman continued her chant.\n\nTwo things here - first, the cut off statement didn't seem to be coming across as prying.  I'd imagine that the narrator would be pleading, or even wheedling - but the \"Dad, I...\" doesn't imply a question yet.  I could imagine \"Dad, I want to go home.\" or \"Dad, I don't like this.\"  Next - is Elise actually bug-eyed?  She's arachnid related (and of course, spiders aren't insects ;)) but her eyes are frequently depicted as red, but not particularly bug-like.  You could instead use this time to play up how commanding she is, how calm and assured of her power?  Set the stakes high.\n\n>Jagged shards hung down from the arch overhead, marred from what looked like generations of wear.\n\nLiked all the description of the cave, though some of it got a bit confused in my head.  Is the arch marred by generations of wear?  I could imagine the steps being so - but an arch doesn't get much wear, imo.  Perhaps describe it a little more cleanly - but add in more elements of foreboding.  Are there the echoing clicks of hungry pincers?  A preponderance of spiderwebs?  A disturbing lack of any other wildlife - not even birds?\n\n>For a moment, I thought it looked taller than it did before; but then I thought, if nothing was behind me, what made the noise?\n\nAw yiss!  Chills.\n\n>I threw myself into the maze of trees nearest to me, bounding around spades of rock, leaping over stretches of roots, and shoving through tendrils of mist, running for all I had left.\n\nI was going to start arguing for a 'beat' of time where eyes were locked, where the primal parts of the human mind seize up briefly in the face of a pure predator - but I actually like your way better.  If this champ concept is all about running (and I can imagine this would have some mobility, from the description) then avoiding any messing around with cliche timewasting is a good idea.  No idea what a spade of rock is though!\n\n>The grotesque arachnid crushed the earth with every bound of its eight legs.\n\nMaybe 'stab' of its eight legs?  I never think of a spider bounding.  Except maybe those jumping spiders.  \n\nAlso, it's occurred to me that running while screaming is damn hard.  Maybe this is an indication of her eventual powers that she can do both at once, but I've often found (lazy bones as I am) that if I run all out - I've got no lungs left for screaming.  I'm not sure what you can do about that without fundamentally changing the story - so maybe you can make it work.\n\n>I broke through the wall of stone. I mean, I did, but my body didn’t. Passed a loud crunch, I slipped through the wall, tumbling softly and slowly in mid-air.\n\nA mix of things here.  The \"I mean, I did, but my body didn't.\" actually comes across somewhat conversational - almost funny.  It's just the turn of phrase.  Maybe, instead, you could write something like:\n\n> *I broke through the wall of stone - though I left my broken body behind when I did.*\n\nNot sure what \"passed a loud crunch\" means - possible typo?\n\nThe last paragraph seems a strange mix of calmness and screaming.  I think I get what you were going for - that fear was the only thing she had held on to from her mortal life - but the post-death sequence just conveyed such peace that it seemed at odds with the statement that fear was all she was now.  I can see the issue where you were trying to build up to a climax of fear - and then pay that off with the death - but that level of terror is such an active emotion that I'm not sure how to do that and keep it going.  Hopefully you can get some more feedback on it - and better minds than I can offer suggestions!\n\n----------\n\nOverall - I think it's pretty cool!  Visually I wonder if a female shadow-isles ghost will overlap too much with Kalista's look.  How do you imagine this champion interacting with other champions - she has a rivalry with Elise, yes - but does she have any allies?  Is she effectively a creature of instinct like Rek'Sai (fear overpowering all else) or does she have lucid moments?\n\nWhat would you call her?","replies":[{"poster":"AMonsoonofBabies","date":"2015-03-10T07:39:48.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, I'm very thankful that you took the time to read my lore and give extremely thoughtful feedback!

She shouldn't be bug-eyed, since that's a sort of comical description of someone who's meant to be menacing. I'll certainly take your suggestions for this part!\n\n> \"Liked all the description of the cave, though some of it got a bit confused in my head. Is the arch marred by generations of wear?\"\n\nYes, about the cave entrance... the thing I was going for was to make the cave into a gaping mouth of a creature that swallows Elise's cultists. Specifically, the marred \"teeth\" on the arch are supposed to be from \"eating\" countless souls over the time Elise has been doing this. I admit, the implication was a bit much... I'll need to change up some descriptions, for sure.\n\n> \"Are there the echoing clicks of hungry pincers? A preponderance of spiderwebs? A disturbing lack of any other wildlife - not even birds?\"\n\nThat is a VERY good suggestion; I was thinking of ways to bring the reader into the scene more, and wildlife never crossed my mind (probably because the Shadow Isles are a *very* dead place; perhaps too dead). I really like that idea, so I think I'll include that, or use it to replace some descriptive sentences that are otherwise lacking or not useful.\n\n> \"If this champ concept is all about running (and I can imagine this would have some mobility, from the description)...\"\n\nIn fact, for her current ability set I have for her *(work in progress),* she does have one ability called **Veiled by Fear** which has a passive component, but also lets her gain a boost of speed for two seconds. I'm thinking that the three basic components of being scared would be *running, hiding,* and *screaming,* so I made her abilities like that. I'll eventually post a full champion concept on the boards, but I really want the lore to be as *flawless *as possible so that people connect with her. Summoners enjoy playing champions with *character* (like Jinx, for example), so I want something similar for my champion concept as well.\n\n> \"No idea what a spade of rock is though!\"\n\nHeh, I just wanted the rocks to sound sharp, maybe a new noun is in order...\n\n> \"Maybe 'stab' of its eight legs? I never think of a spider bounding. Except maybe those jumping spiders.\"\n\n*VERY* nice point; if I recall, I was a bit hesitant to use \"bound,\" but I couldn't think of anything else at the time. \"Stab\" does have the more aggressive connotation with it, so I'll try using \"stab\" and see how that works. Thanks!\n\n> \"Maybe this is an indication of her eventual powers that she can do both at once, but I've often found (lazy bones as I am) that if I run all out - I've got no lungs left for screaming. I'm not sure what you can do about that without fundamentally changing the story - so maybe you can make it work.\"\n\nThat's an interesting point that I never considered... maybe I could play it off as being just a product of her, as I described, \"immortal\" level of terror. I did mention she felt her throat bleeding, so I *could* try to be lazy and leave it as is... :P\nOf course, I'll still take a gander and see if I can bring some logic back into the story without taking out the fantasy.\n\n> \"The 'I mean, I did, but my body didn't.' actually comes across somewhat conversational - almost funny.\"\n\nWell, I did intend for there to be a noticeably abrupt transition right at that point, and I did get a similar feeling when I read it over... but it may have transitioned into the wrong kind of atmosphere. Thanks for noting this, I'll work on that too.\n\n> \"Not sure what 'passed a loud crunch' means - possible typo?\"\n\nALAS, THE TYPO, MY MORTAL FOE, ONCE AGAIN-- nah, I'm kidding, that was intentional. Still a mistake, however... I admit, that's a bad attempt at grammar on my part. I'll patch that up.\n\n> \"The last paragraph seems a strange mix of calmness and screaming. I think I get what you were going for - that fear was the only thing she had held on to from her mortal life - but the post-death sequence just conveyed such peace that it seemed at odds with the statement that fear was all she was now.\"\n\nNow, here I *was* trying to make a juxtaposition between calm and fear, just in an attempt to convey how she is now essentially afraid of nothing. Of course, if it just confuses the reader, it's a bit useless. :|\nEh, I'll try and see if I can get what I was trying for with some more explanation. Adding a few more sentences couldn't hurt if it means wrapping up nicely. Thank you for noticing this and letting me know!\n___\n> \"Visually I wonder if a female shadow-isles ghost will overlap too much with Kalista's look.\"\n\nThis has been my fear since the very beginning, you have no idea! DX\nI was so afraid that she would just end up being a combination of Kalista and Annie that my obsession with originality was absolutely screaming. **As a result,** I believe I want to make her into a Yordle. A kind-of-creepy-looking Yordle. I'm still not 100% on her appearance (not even 50%), as I'm going slowly with this concept. I only started working on her a few weeks ago, so (for me at least) that's still pretty early. I feel like once I get the lore together, and out of my system, her appearance will stem from that.\nBut seriously, this lore has been consuming my life for the past ten days; I can't think of anything else! It's awesome. :)\n\n> \"How do you imagine this champion interacting with other champions - she has a rivalry with Elise, yes - but does she have any allies?\"\n\nI don't think she'd have any allies... she might just end up being too afraid of anyone to make friends. Kind of like Amumu, but instead of everyone staying away from him, she stays away from everyone else. Still not sure though...\n\n> \"Is she effectively a creature of instinct like Rek'Sai (fear overpowering all else) or does she have lucid moments?\"\n\nBased on what I've pulled together so far, she's a bit of both. She tries to not be afraid, but ultimately her fear is far too strong for her to overcome. I'll give an example...\n\nHer /Joke I have set up now goes as follows: she says something reassuring like *\"I-I’ve been working on my confidence--\"* but then she feels a gust of wind from behind, and she cowers in fear. You know, she acts like she's a bit better, then she gets startled. Other quotes have her so scared that she's on the verge of tears; those make more sense with the activation of her abilities.\n\n> \"What would you call her?\"\n\nRight now, I have her named as **\"Mimi, the Voice of Terror.\"**\n\nI know it doesn't sound too good... as a Yordle, she needs a sort of Yordle name, but she needs the dramatic title, too. I like the title, but I'm not sure about the name.\n(Title not my idea, by the way; credit to a friend who's helped far more than she needed to.)\nI'll keep the name for now until something more amazing shows up later...\n\nAnd, just a little note, I got \"Mimi\" from the \"screaming meemees\" used to describe German artillery. Not sure if I'm overstepping bounds here, so I'm a bit on the fence with that.\n___\nAlright then. So, thank you again for taking the time to read and help me out! It sounds like you enjoyed reading my lore, so as long as I didn't waste your time, I'm happy! I'll continue to have as many people read this as I can (without bothering them), so they can flesh out all the issues. I'll keep revising until it's perfect; this idea deserves nothing less in my eyes. Of course, perfection can't happen in a day, or even a month. I'm going to keep at it for as long as there are people such as yourself willing to lend feedback! Again, **Thank You!**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bad arcade kitty","date":"2015-03-10T04:53:43.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Do you like reading fan-fiction?\n\nyou don't want to listen my answer","replies":[]}]}
