So awesome!!!  Except I am awful at playing by ear......\r\nI heard that there would be sheet music released for this at some point and I was wondering if anyone already wrote sheets for the violin solo or if official sheets were floating around that I have yet to find because, like all of us probably would agree, that theme is hella sweet.\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2016-11-17T16:56:27.963+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Venixa,\n\nWe're still trying to find a good way to distribute sheet music to our players.
