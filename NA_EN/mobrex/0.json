I play ranked and was on the client last night when the missions appeared.  It was not clear to me at the time that playing the game would lock me into a chain.  So by just playing a few games I got locked into \"Be Naughty\" then i read just now that there is a pathway.... I would like this reversed as I have no interest in the Draven reward since he is one of my least liked champions.... There should have been better communication with this rather then quests just appearing and playing a few ranked games which i do every day committed me to something before i was even aware of it.  kinda bs.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-13T22:19:35.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I def understand picking an unintended path, but I can't make any guarantees!
