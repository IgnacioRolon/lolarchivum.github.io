Sylas can take an enemy's ultimate whenever Hijack is off cooldown, but can't hijack the same enemy for a while after.'\n\n**How long is this 'a while' between using ult on the same enemy?**\n\n**Is it static? or is it based off the enemy champions R CD? Or a bit of both? Is the CD effected by your CDR or your enemies?**\n\nIf there is a static CD if its too high that would suck for less impactful ults like Karma's where he gets to get 1 empowered ability but if its too low it would be OP into Taric/Karthus/Shen ect.\n\nThus having an it scale off enemy ultimate CD makes sense to me. Something like...\n1-1.5 x enemy ult CD affected by your CDR.\n\n**EDIT. Another question does the ULT's he steals get any scaling or are they just base damage? Do they scale off enemies stats or his own?**\n\nPS.\nIt would be cool if he could use teammate ults too but i guess even more exploitable.\n\nPPS.\nThat team fight where both teams are taric ulted and you literally afk for 2.5s xD","replies":[]}
