I launched my anti-virus and it cleaned my computer and forced a restart mid-game, and I couldn't cancel it. After the nasty programs were manually uninstalled I relaunch the game, which my friends won for me thankfully :) , and I'm set in LPQ. Can you please take it off? I didn't want to leave and it only happened because of a dumb accidental download. I'll take the blame but I'd rather not wait 20 minutes per game with my friends. Won't happen again. Thanks!\r\n\r\nIGN: Flamerenter","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T20:32:50.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh snap that sucks that you caught that virus. Even moreso that it started affecting your gameplay in League!!\n\nI understand this crash was no fault of your own and your teammates were even able to pull through without your backup, but they were still left with trying to 4v5 which could have ended rather badly. You also shouldn't be getting hit with a 20 LPQ timer after only one left game, so that might have come from a history of left matches.\n\nThere's not a whole lot we can do about LPQ's in these cases, but it does look like you've already played through most of them and won't have to wait for matches much longer. I'd be doubly safe, and run another scan as well just to be sure that doesn't happen again!","replies":[]}]}
