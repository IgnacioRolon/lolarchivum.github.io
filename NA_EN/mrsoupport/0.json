I want to know how can i get a PBE account. I really really want to do some testing in this game. I already applied my application in the https://pbesignup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/pbe , however it's been almost two years and i still did not receive any invitation link and it says \"Application Received\" in My PBE Status. \r\nTwo week ago, my friend got his PBE account and he applied his application around 4 months ago. \r\n\r\nIs there something else I have to do other than applying in the link above?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-07T17:02:11.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you've applied a while ago, but we can't force or guarantee an application.
