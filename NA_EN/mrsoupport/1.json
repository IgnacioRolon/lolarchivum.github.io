Suddenly, the client went all black, I couldn't do nothing (the sound was playing though). I wait and I wait. Around 2 minutes later, I close the league client. I launched the old client and I see i lost 10 LP. I know that when you dodge Queue in rank you lose 3 LP if it is your first time in the day, then if you dodge after your first time, it will be 10 LP. I dont understand why i lost 10 LP when it should have been 3 LP since it was my first time dodging today. What the reason behind this and is it possible to get my 7 LP that i should not have lost?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-06T02:53:40.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What you experienced is a [**known issue**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/MihNFhcV-black-screen-during-champion-select-beta-client) that crops up specifically on the Beta Client and happens between the transition to champ select from the lobby. I recommend using the Legacy Client for now, while using the instructions in the post I linked to send us some Client logs so we can look into a permafix for this known issue.\n\nRegarding your LP, I'm sorry to say, but there's nothing we can do in that regard. We aren't able to make modifications to your LP for any reason, as the system was designed this way to prevent any chances of abuse. I hope this information cleared up the confusion you had about this issue.","replies":[]}]}
