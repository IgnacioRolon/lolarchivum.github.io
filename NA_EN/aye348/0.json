Now I do understand there's gonna be thousands of tickets sent a day, so I get it takes a while but, I literally cannot access my account, and I'm stressing about potentially it being gone, and the amount of time I have to wait to get any response at all is getting on my nerves. Anyways I hope this doesn't put rioters on tilt too much if they see it just a point I feel needs to be made.\n\nP.S. this an NA account I made years ago and never used my actual account is on EUW","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-09T00:45:23.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically, this kind of post would be deleted as there is nothing for us H&S agents to actually take action and help with....\nHOWEVER!\n\nI noticed that you've been constantly submitted more and more updates to your ticket. While you might think that would get the EU agents attention a little faster, it can actually bump your ticket to the end of the line due to how the system is built. Your best bet for getting a response sooner is to first: wait on their reply before commenting on the ticket any further.","replies":[{"poster":"AYE348","date":"2017-10-09T02:02:28.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the info","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sh1be","date":"2017-10-08T21:48:59.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you still don't get a response just try to re-submit a ticket.
