This week - with the free rotation - became a trollfest on the non-SR maps - the change I propose would allow Kalista to be played just as it is now BUT the target would have a word in whether he wants to be oathsworn or not.

Because no one fucking noticed the spear. Kalista kept going into games on PBE without an oathsworn, and having to bind in lane because people would ignore her spear when she tried to bind them. It ended up being a worse experience for everyone than the way it is currently. The 15s gate at fountain is a godsend for kalista, allowing her to instantly bind her support without any worry of getting ambushed by the enemy team. Unfortunately, at the start of games, people often aren't paying attention to the other champions yet. I've had countless supports say \"you binded me already?\" Every single one of those times, it would've been \"rejected\" simply because the support wasn't paying attention; if the oathsworn had to accept, it would ruin games for both of them, a lot more than the current system does. If you *did* let a player reject the pact, it would have to be opt-out, rather than opt-in, and even then it would have to make intuitive sense and be something you couldn't do by accident.","replies":[{"poster":"Mahautsukai","date":"2015-01-31T21:24:20.258+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if it was a pop up on UI instead of a pick-up item they need to notice?","replies":[{"poster":"Ryu the first","date":"2015-02-01T00:09:18.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this.

I strongly resent the idea that another decides what I \"want\" to do.

A Kalista who decides to play the champion or the other 4 players who can be taken hostage against their will? I do believe that it should be the Kalista.\n\nPresently I was bonded as a Jace (obviously against my will) and flung into the enemy team in cannon form.. you say that it is fair I couldn't say a big NO for this stupidity because \"poor Kalista would lose spells from her kit\"?

A good team will - but grudgingly. and with one stroke many picks become suboptimal. Same goes with enforcing this on someone. starting the game with a grudge is not very healthy. If the offer happened in the lobby and the game started with a voluntarily accepted oath (from the support who has no reason to deny it) noone would get hurt only the possibility of trolling ceased.

You don't have time to type out commands to your oathsworn, and you can't feasibly have voice chat with everyone in random matchups. She's just not easy to play cooperatively in any mode that isn't ranked if you're alone.\nFor this reasoning, her ult needs rework. It's too codependent and this cripples her if the team is uncooperative. The passive on Sentry is OK because it doesn't actively change her kit that much, it just adds slight power which isn't missed too much if her oathsworn isn't engaging. However, the ult requiring a specific ally to know when and how to do things when you snatch them up so jarringly is problematic if they either botch the ult or don't cooperate. \nShe needs something that is decent by itself, but stellar when her oathsworn can participate. Maybe something like Lissandra's Q; Kalista pitches a large spear that does things. Then, if it passes through her oathsworn, it splinters and flies farther. Something like that would be fun and encourage participation from your ally but not completely neuter Kalista without that ally around.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2015-02-01T18:58:36.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kalista's Ult and her oathsworn stuff needs reworking so as not to castrate her and your team when you pick her.
