You're trying your best, winning vs lane oppenent/enemy jgler. Everything is fine right? WRONG, some %%%%%%%%%% keeps feeding and then ruins the game you're working hard to win. 5 minutes later, afk. Then each member of the enemy team promptly puts their dick into your ass untill you lose. Switch over to top? Bot lane feeds. Play support or adc? Top mid and/or jungler feeds. FUCK YOUR RANKED SYSTEM, FUCK BEING PAIRED WITH INTERS AND FEEDERS AND MOST OF ALL FUCK THIS HIGH DAMAGE NO COUNTERPLAY META. When I play an early game jgler, the team doesn't end the game, BUT when I pick a late game jungler, the games ends before 20 minutes. I'm tired of taking it up the ass cause you idiots at riot games don't know how to balance anything. That's why you dumb asses need to keep posting updates of how bad you fucked up this season and how you're going to \"change\" for the better.\n\nAt Riot HQ:\n OMGLUL LET'S MAKE CHAMPIONS STRONGER AND TURRETS WEAKER SO THAT NO ONE CAN FARM UNDER TOWER AND WATCH THE KIDDIES RAGE!\nGENIUS\n\n Every game is a meme at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-10-13T03:29:31.549+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good points, poor delivery.","replies":[{"poster":"Tracker57","date":"2018-10-13T03:34:06.108+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8U8HR9h2,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-10-13T03:29:31.549+0000)\n>\n> Good points, poor delivery.\n\nIll edit this later until it has enough down votes, cause that's the only way this post will get popular.
