Your config may have become corrupt, and may not sync up with the server anymore either.  You'll have to redo your bindings, but I suggest resetting your config to make sure it saves:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
