Like i occasionally have to leave games and it really adds up. about a month ago i had to leave and got a punishment having to wait 5 minutes for 5 games, now its 10 for 5 games... Does this mean next time i have to leave a game i will need to wait 30 minutes? Is there no reset after not leaving for x amount of games. I think we can all agree we need to leave sometimes.\r\n\r\n...Or its just me","replies":[{"poster":"SmokedAlmonds","date":"2016-06-26T04:02:51.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Next will be 20 minutes and that is the cap.\n\nIt actually does go down if you play enough games without leaving. There is a pop up that will tell you when your status improves. Since you are continuing to get punished that means you are still leaving games at an unacceptable rate.\n\nEveryone does need to leave sometimes. Your sometimes is just too often.","replies":[{"poster":"ÁrYaN","date":"2016-06-26T04:05:57.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well thanks for the reply, i guess i will have to work on that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dadimplayingrn","date":"2016-06-26T19:29:57.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"get an autoclicker so even if you have to leave you least are semi moving at your nexus. and thus won't get a leaverbuster. i do it alot actually","replies":[]}]}
