The skins laugh emote plays both the no skin version and infernal version pretty much every time you use it. Don&#039;t know if it makes a difference how you use it. I use Ctrl+4. But simple enough while I&#039;m on the rift, it just does both infernal and traditional laugh at the same time. There was one time I was playing around with the laugh to see if it happened every time and it stopped doing the infernal laugh altogether and just stuck with the original. That was only a one game thing though. Most times it&#039;s both laughs. Small problem but should be easy.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-04T00:20:17.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report!
