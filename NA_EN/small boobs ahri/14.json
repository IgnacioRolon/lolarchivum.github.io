They didn't give us a definite answer that we will be getting a Ahri x Wukong ship though, keep that in mind. They just asked \"why do you ask\" with a winky face. I'm thinking that it's just a playful nod and not actually a confirmation.\n\nI am slightly nervous about a Ahri x Wukong ship, but I don't know if Riot will actually go through with it. It's based from the fan community, but doesn't have any lore origins, and I think Riot is hesitant to follow through on ships that weren't hinted at before by old lore. So if you're worried about it becoming canon, I don't think you need to worry much.","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2019-03-30T01:10:49.216+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot's not shipping anyone.

Honestly, Riot tends to be good about relationships in this game. They know (more often then not) that they need to keep characters as romantically open as possible cause people do like to ship them with themselves. Yea, anxious is fine. but out right jumping the gun and trying to force the idea of \"RIOT IS TRYING TO FORCE THIS SHIP, DON'T LET THEM FORCE THIS SHIP\" is just getting overly worked up for nothing and will just end up making EVERYONE wait longer on lore for both champs because of it.","replies":[{"poster":"AnotherPurple379","date":"2019-03-30T02:07:19.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, alright then.
