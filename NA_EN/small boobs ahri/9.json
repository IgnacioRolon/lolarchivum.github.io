I know this, I've been to life drawing classes.

You nailed Riotâs style and even made in-game assets!\n\nSadly, I have the same complaints about the style and theme of this fan Taliyah splash as I did about the last one (https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/pnYBVUcA-warring-kingdom-kind-of-inspired-taliyah-skin-conceppt?comment=000d).  Let us start with fanservice.  Taliyah is not supposed to have any, or barely any, if you count her leggings as such.  Itâs not just that sheâs 16.  She would just never dress or act like that.  Itâs out of character for her, both in-universe and as the poster child of Riotâs commitment to design female champions that are not, as they put it, âSyndra, but in a different cosplayâ.\n\nSo, please give Taliyah her big eyebrows and boyish figure back because they are essential to her design.  Moreover, consider that Taliyahâs outfit is symbolic.  Its has two layers: a Shuriman shirt and leggings from her youth in a nomadic desert tribe and an Ionian tunic bought during her training with Yasuo.  It represents the layers of the identity she developed on her journey.  She also wears a mantle of stone, representing the burden of her powers.  Her femininity, appearing in her stone bracelets and a Shuriman tiara, is part of her character rather than defining it.\n\nAlso remember that she is a roaming mage.  She needs thick clothes to protect her from cold, wind, weather, and weaving debris.  Her boots should be simple and tough for the journey ahead.  The Shuriman outfit is lighter and thinner because she needs to survive the heat; the Freljord outfit is bulky to keep out the frigid northern chill.  Make sure that her skirt goes all the way around her hips to protect them from falls and, again, weaving debris.\n\nLastly, remember art direction.  Taliyah is almost tomboy-ishly brave and fast, and these attributes are best shown when she surfs.  The original skin is just her surfing.  The Freljord skin shows her laughing and cradling a baby deer while surfing.  Try to build your splash around her riding her elemental surf-board.  The rest, like how her back is impossibly twisted in your splash. should work itself out surprisingly well.\n\nHope you like my feedback!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"BjÃ¸rnetjenesten","date":"2018-02-02T17:42:28.726+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Looks great and all... but the nose is too small","replies":[]},{"poster":"DianaIsMyWife","date":"2018-02-02T17:34:40.817+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANN and i dont even play talyah","replies":[]},{"poster":"Parallelity","date":"2018-02-02T16:53:26.969+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"this would legitimately make me main Taliyah.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2018-02-02T15:50:35.818+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Really cute.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Senteth","date":"2018-02-02T16:25:44.241+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}\n\nWhat is this?\nWhy is it so awesome?\nThat splash art, is better than some of the official stuff!\n\nPlease tell me this is a teaser, and not a fan thing?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Envonyx","date":"2018-02-02T22:03:08.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"gotta dislike, eyebrows aint big enough","replies":[]},{"poster":"HÃ¨ntaÃ® ","date":"2018-02-02T20:07:40.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That is absolutely beautiful.
