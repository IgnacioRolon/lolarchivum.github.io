I have followed ALL of the steps from the permissions guide that is constantly linked as a fix to this... Nothing has worked. I reinstalled multiple times (even though I know that shouldn't be the reason it wont work).\r\n\r\nIs there any way to run the patch through the legacy client? Has anyone else found a way to fix this error for themselves?\r\nJust want to play... thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-20T20:30:06.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear you've been dealing with this for a week now.  :(  Since the permissions guide didn't help, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so our tech team can help out individually.
