Once the new season starts you'll be able to start earning those mastery chests again, you can only get one per champion per season.","replies":[{"poster":"ArkenStorm","date":"2017-11-14T09:00:49.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a mastery chest, a Mastery token.

Those matches don't give tokens, well....because you didn't *actively* pick him. It could have been a lucky coincidence you did so well, but overall ARAM just has too many different playstyles and scenarios that it wouldn't be right to grade them the same way other matches are graded.","replies":[{"poster":"ArkenStorm","date":"2017-11-26T03:55:20.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem. :D\nThanks for the explanation, that actually makes a lot more sense. \nThanks again for replying!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2017-11-14T18:38:17.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">However, I didn't get a mastery token on him.

And yes, it is incredibly silly that tokens are available in Blind Pick SR, but not ARAM or even ranked TT. Maybe if enough people bug Riot about it, they'll finally enable tokens drops outside SR.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mara13","date":"2017-11-14T03:06:17.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.
