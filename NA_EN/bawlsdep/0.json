You got yourself banned.\n\nWhy does everybody on this board act like they're white knights who never do any wrong. Everybody seems to have such a hard-on to defend Riot (although they do get blamed for bullshit that is the player's fault quite often). A purchase of funds for a game is final, and pursuant to the terms agreed, but they're is plenty of legal precedent that would classify this whole \"accepting your money for our igc until we decide that you're being too mean\" thing as very illegal without a proper refund system in place. People often act like the company has a right to essentially steal money if a player gets caught by a toxicity system that is ill thought out and poorly structured in the first place. The timeline isn't the issue, the player's actions aren't the issue, the rules of Riot's system aren't even the issue. The only issue here is the legal and ethical question of: should some multi-national company be allowed to pocket your money if you purchase their product but access is revoked due to behavior and language. If you agree that Riot should be able to do this with RP, it is no different than a typical video game company doing the same thing: revoking rights to their software and pocketing your money because you misbehave with their online features. You can support that I guess, but it just doesn't sit with me. Not to mention it unfairly targets children or anyone else less equipped to deal with frustration in a game. Boiling this down to: \"uh, didn't you read the ToS? You deserve it for being \"toxic!\"\" is simple at best, if not moronic. I'm sure, to some degree, people who dislike Riot and view the company as, just that, a company on these forums tend to either not bother with the forums anymore or get banned off them for a variety of reasons, but it's still just astonishing to see how one-minded these forums are when it comes to issues like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-02-23T07:29:51.022+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to have some misconceptions and assumptions. \n\nAssuming people act like they have done no wrong. Some have prior punishments and some are simply assholes who pay attention to the rules.\n\nYou can disagree with someone without defending or attacking Riot. People like to think it is A or B though and then permanently label a person as such.\n\nIf the system was a one strike design, I would be mroe inclined to agree. However, to get permanently banned you go through at leadt 1 punishment prior, if not 3. The punishment before the perm specifically states that the next punishment may be permanent. Yes, other game companie do have the right to strip a license of use from a player if they break rules; even paid games. League is a free to play game in which you don't need to actually pay real money for a single thing.\n\nUnfairly target children? Disagree as most players theoretically can read. So even if they don't read the ToU, they can read a punishment card. No different than if I were to be banned in Habbo Hotel or Runescape after spending money for eother of those games.\n\nRiot is a company and we are part of their assets. If they believe their assets are better with them punishing \"toxic\" players then they will punish \"toxic\" players and hope they learn to behave properly or at the very least, shut up and play.","replies":[{"poster":"Northseeker","date":"2019-02-23T17:16:47.161+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude it's not white knighting, do you know what I've never done, been toxic in chat during a match.

That's why legislation needs to be updated for the digital purchases. Because in the real world, you don't \"buy\" currency with another currency.

Gotcha lol\n\nI can admit I was 100% overly triggered in my response, but that's after spending game after game that night getting yelled at non-stop for being a new player. I say nothing, i take it, and it makes my games miserable, but if I leave - I get punished, and it's just not my personality to yell and curse and rage at ppl in-game, so it's just 40minutes of being beat up and accused of throwing or being stupid or garbage when I'm honestly trying my best to learn these champs and improve.\n\nI love hearing that Riot takes these reports seriously and I loathe seeing someone play off their toxicity as if it wasn't that bad or the other person deserved it.\n\nNo one deserves to be called names by you, or OP, and you two deserved your bans for that and op more than deserves losing all the money he put into the game, just like my super triggered post shouldn't have stayed up because it was more me being aggressively triggered by being beat-up nonstop vs. me actually providing constructive feedback.\n\nIt is hard being beat up non-stop and never wanting to full-on push back against it, but wrong is wrong, so i take that.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=ooshawn,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Ohl11E2z,comment-id=000e,timestamp=2019-02-23T07:08:47.018+0000)\n>\n> My question to you internet friends is why are you investing 25 dollars in a free to play video games where the company punishes you not for game play, but words.
