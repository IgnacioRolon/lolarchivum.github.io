What I want to know is if they're all part of the same universe, and if so, is it one we already know or is it one that will have more thought put into down the line? Personally, I'm sort of an Elf fanatic, so, I'm all for more Elves and Elf skins.\r\n\r\nFrom what I've gathered so far, mostly from the bios of Viridian Kayle and Blackthorn Morgana, the Elves once had a powerful kingdom built on the foundations of magic, that as Blackthorn states, \"evil power that some once considered the cornerstone of their magical supremacy.\" In Viridain's bio, it mentions that for those who can find some of the ancient Elven magic \"are gifted with incredible power over the natural world.\" If \"over the natural world\" is anything to go off of, it could be assumed that their magic is less arcane and more primordial, stemming from the world itself rather than from some well of magic or other outside source. From both of their bios, we discover that the Elves since the time of the ancient empires have split into two groups, the Forest Elves and the Dark Forest Elves, the Forest Elves living alongside humanity while the Dark Forest Elves remain in their ancient homes, guarding whatever magic is left of the old empire. However, the Forest Elves are also known to go exploring for remnants of their lost civilization.  \r\n\r\nWith little to go on, and just my imagination, my theory is that ancient elven empires were your typical over controlling evil fantasy empire, and the original descendants of the Forest Elves were those who rebelled against it. Once the empire fell, the split was between those who were willing to live alongside humanity, and those who weren't. This is just a side note, but I think it can be safely assumed that Nottingham Ezreal is a Forest Elf and not a Dark Forest Elf. \r\n\r\nHowever, none of this answers the question of what skin universe they belong to.  \r\n\r\nMy guesses would be either Dragon World or Elderwood/Coven skinlines, just because they're the only fantasy themed skin lines with a flushed out story and background.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2019-03-22T18:36:18.042+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Indeed they are!

After all, Emerald Taric exists in this world, is mentioned _directly_ by Eclipse Leona as hailing from the Emerald Chapel, and Taric here is as much of an elf as any of them. It doesn't make a ton of sense to me as to why you'd have so many deeply similar themes, one of which you have established in one world, but decide to splinter them apart in their own world. Ezreal, Kayle, and Morgana could _easily_ be fitted into the Coven world, since it already encompasses a magic forest and elves already.\nhttps://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Taric_1.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2019-03-22T20:56:14.368+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really wish I could answer this in detail, but I can't.

Sure, a similar case recently happened with Popstar Ahri vs K/DA Ahri, but with those two skins, it was shown how Ahri's popstar life literally got an upgrade from her Popstar to her K/DA skin. These would be totally different versions of Kayle and Morgana with a very similar theme. \n\nI'd be for it, as long as they get their proper places in the Eclipse universe, but it still might feel somewhat repetitive and unnecessary. I think all of us Eclipse fans would love it if those two skins got into Eclipse sooner rather than later. {{sticker:sg-lux}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ir Abelas","date":"2019-03-23T15:02:27.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you read the bio for Emerald Taric, it states that they are actually just humans, that were then gifted power, which is why he looks all Elfy.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-03-23T16:59:36.370+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ir Abelas,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=mEKsmEVj,comment-id=000400010001,timestamp=2019-03-23T15:02:27.940+0000)\n>\n> If you read the bio for Emerald Taric, it states that they are actually just humans, that were then gifted power, which is why he looks all Elfy.\n\nYeah, but, it's easier to modify Emerald Taric's bio to make him an actual elf in the Coven world than it is to remove voice lines from Leona. They have a world right in front of them prime for fleshing out with these skins, but they're choosing instead to make a new, similar world. It's the reason why Marvel Comics has Earth-626, Earth-19999, Earth-3488, etc, and why DC Comics has \"Infinite Earths\" and why both companies tend to compress all the random, splintered universes together into one every 5 years. It's clumsy writing in my opinion to make redundant worlds and universes for no reason.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-03-22T20:32:33.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm from an Albion ^-^\n\nThough I was under the impression that Nottingham Ezreal was supposed to be his Roleplaying universe skin?\n\nHe says to those in the skinline he's be an elf paladin.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2019-03-22T20:57:33.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"(that's the joke)","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-03-22T21:13:48.988+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"..I'm stupid and don't get it.\n\nOr maybe I do?\n\nI don't know I'm stupid.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2019-03-22T22:30:40.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I was wondering if it was possible for Riot to share a diagram showing all the alternative universes that currently exist and all the skins/skinlines that are part of them.

For some reason, Elderwood Kayle and Blackthorn Morgana are in limbo, so that they can be added into Eclipse \"later if they want\", according to Riot Stellari. I am hoping they get into Eclipse very much, since Elderwood LeBlanc and Dryad Soraka's lore makes mention of forest spirits like fae, sylvans, and dryads that used to be much more numerous than they are currently. Elves, of course, are another famous brand of European forest spirits, and it would make complete sense if they were part of the Elderwood denizens.","replies":[]}]}
