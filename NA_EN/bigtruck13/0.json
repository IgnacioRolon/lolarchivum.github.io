So I've been trying to uninstall League because I figured reinstalling couldn't hurt me, but I can't uninstall it. I have tried everything I've seen on the forums and multiple other sources. The only problem is, I can't uninstall, delete files, or do anything. I even tried to delete League while in safe mode. The uninstall process on windows not only stalls but can't even cancel the uninstall process, the Hextech Repair tool did nothing to help. Has anybody else had this problem? If so, how did you fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-25T03:00:49.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed you mentioned having tried the Hextech Repair Tool already, but you didn't mention what settings you used. Make sure to run it with **reinstall and clean uninstall** to do the most beneficial reinstall.","replies":[]}]}
