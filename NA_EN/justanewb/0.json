Many older designers either quit or left. Now mostly a new team.\nOld Dev Team - Under Morello.  Came from over a decade of experience in champion design even before they started RIOT.\n-------------------\n\nOld Dev Team - Said things like True Damage is a bad game mechanic due to driving an HP heavy meta, ADCs should be limited in both mobility and CC, and that overly complex itemization and champions looked flashy but were bad for game health.\n\nNew Dev Team - Threw all of that in the trash.\n\n>&lt;\n\nOld Dev Team - Used to be on the forums, every single day, discussing changes, reworks, and even designed a few champions WITH the playerbase, using Player creations for both skins and champion design.\n\nNew Dev Team - Screw you players, we will do what we want.  We know what is best. (I.E. Karma, Morde, Shaco, etc)\n\n>&lt; \n\nOld Dev Team - Had a rich, and ever expanding lore system, including a weekly 'news paper' to tell you about the goins on in Runeterra.\n\nNew Dev Team - That's stupid, people don't really care about the Lore, this is all about competition and tournaments. (Again, Recent example, Karma.)\n\n-----------------\n\nWhat we basically see is a newer Dev team, lacking the decade and a half of design experience, and wishing to 'Prove they know how this game can be improved.'  They no longer interact much with the playerbase, they make what ever changes they wish to see based on only Pro Player ideas, and somehow think that the E-Sports is what drives the economy of LoL.  They ditch the rest of the 95% of the playerbase (where ALL OF THE MONEY COMES FROM) in exchange for their adamant idea that E-Spots will be the future of RIOT.  Despite the fact that other games have vastly surpassed RIOT when it comes to E-Sports.  A Single Minded focus on the pro-player base, whereas the Old Dev Team had never HAD a pro player base, and thus based their decisions on everyone.\n\nWant to know why your complaints are never fixed?

Add rageblade to varus. Add shiv to draven. Shields invulns stealths low cd ROOTs.\n\nOld Dev team nerfs: \"holy shit draven is insanely overperforming, scrap his bleed completely and replace it with something not damage oriented\"\n\nNew Dev team - Kaisa Q .05 ad ratio less will fix it LOOOOOOOL , Xayah - 25% less dmg to minions on one ability will fix it.\n\nOld dev team - caitlyn has an oppressive lane phase and also scales incredibly well into late with high range and mobility, so her weakness should be mid game and overall low dps.\n\nNew Dev team - lets make every caitlyn ability do extremely high amounts of damage , higher ad ratios than assassins on her passive , Q, W, E, AND R!!! (objective fact, she has higher ad ratios on all her abilities than assassins)\n\nOld dev team - Support's lack of gold is what balance's bot lane power levels compared to other lanes. Support role focused on playmaking , engaging , setting up fights (madlife aphromoo season 3/4) \n\nNew dev team - insanely overpowered items like ardent censor , redemption, locket, etc etc to transform support into a stat check shielding enchanter role will make it more popular!!!!! oh they will also get close to as much gold as solo laners cause more popular!!!! Freelo is popular.\n\nold dev team- balanced AD assassins by limiting the level of total flat armor pen available. It was only available on one item which was brutalizer which built into ghostblade. That was it. Attack speed on ghostblade was alot healthier and smoother form of damage than duskblade. brutalizer + old LW were WAY healthier for AD assassins because they did less damage to squishies in the mid game but did more damage to raw tanks and didnt fall off as hard as lethality does. \n\nnew dev team- lets add the most failed and cancerous stat called lethality which required multiple reworks and has the most unhealthy powercurve in the entire game. Early mid game it completely destroys everybody!! late game it sucks!!! Buy armor and its useless!! Totally better than Old ghostblade + old lw + brutalizer right?. Then lets balance the lethality champs (that we ourselves broke) BY ADDING NEATO DELAYS in the assassin rework. Lets make zed RNG , some games he will reap 90 AD and become a god , some games he wont have any reap target and will only get 20-30 ad #GOOD mechanic.\n\nAnd most importantly of all:\n\nold dev team - something is blatantly overperforming ? Address it ASAP. Remember \"scarizarding\" champions? Morello was not afraid to slam the nerf hammer.\n\nnew dev team - oh lets just let it be overpowered for ABOUT 5-6 months before we decide to nerf it. 5 damage off of Janna. .05 ratio off of kaisa. couple attack speed off of ardent censor.","replies":[{"poster":"Shåwn","date":"2018-04-11T09:38:24.609+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":9,"body":"You know its gotten bad when the live design team decides to scrap brutalizer , Old ghostblade , and Old LW. Only to replace it with lethality stacking cancer. Alot of people think crit is the worst designed stat but I actually think lethality is the worst designed stat not only in all of league but in all video games I've played thus far.\n\nIts mind blowing how incompetent they must have been to introduce something that can cause AD casters to be so extremely overpowered in certain scenarios (early/mid game, vs squishies/lack of armor, when you are snowballing it becomes even more oppressive because you get more based on level). But then becomes absolute worthless trash in other scenarios: (late game when people have their armor per level, any armor stacking item, exponentially lower damage when enemy has armor). I play alot of zed and in the current state of the game at level 13 if I have 2 lethality items completed, I can instantly delete a squishy that has no armor with just W E Q swap auto. Never in the history of season 3-5 was that possible. But when it reaches late game, not only does damage to squishies go down awkwardly, but anyone who buys the slightest armor on top of it will just take extreme amounts of lower damage. In the level 13 scenario, a double Q can take half of a squishies hp, but at level 18 vs a tank or a squishy that built tabis + armor from GA + shields , those same double Qs wont even get the squishy below ~85% and wont even dent less than ~7% of the tanks HP.\n\nIs there anyone who wants a powercurve like this? This is the reason why the live design team somehow managed to make it aids to play against lethality stackers while also making it aids to play AS lethality stackers. Who wins here? If they would just remove dusk, edge of night, and ghostblade to replace them with old LW, old GB , and brutalizer then I bet a large portion of problems surrounding these champs would go away. If they are worried about old LW and old GB being abused by ranged champions, they can simply make old LW only purchasable by melee and make it so old GB's attack speed only activates if you are melee.\n\nWhat a time to be alive, when some of the best design decisions for the game currently , are simply reverts to older designs.

MMOGs in general make the same mistake, not just MOBAs - they try to make the game more \"accessible\" and faster paced thinking they will widen thier potential playerbase. All they end up doing is alienating the existing players. They end up killing off their game quicker. \n\nThe same flawed logic behind what appears to be happening to LoL has led to the death of everything from MMORPGs to MMOFPS to other MOBAs. \n\nIn some cases, yes, the games are already in critical condition and think they have nothing to lose. But in some cases they are viable and profitable playerbases, they just choose to gamble that on trying to grow to be bigger. They end up losing who they have.\n\nHow you win customers is how you will keep them. \nDance with the one that brought you. \n\nStrategy MOBA gamers are what have been the core of LoL's success.

Ignorance of negative impacts of the game for periods unheard of, more distacts between the devs and the player base in general(still better than WoW) \n> \n> Thing is, ambiguity is a powerful weapon and armor.\n\nHey, I never said CertainlyT was better than Ghostcrawler, quite the opposite. I just want people to know that CertainlyT is far from the biggest problem to do with LoL and Riot games.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2018-04-12T11:39:33.329+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lovesick,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=L7p7Gpwq,comment-id=0006000200000000,timestamp=2018-04-12T11:00:19.806+0000)\n>\n> Hey, I never said CertainlyT was better than Ghostcrawler, quite the opposite.
