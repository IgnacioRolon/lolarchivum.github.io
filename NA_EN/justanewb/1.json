I thought the policy was chat restriction and a 14-day ban at most.\n\nWith that said, this is only true if you are honest about your in-game behavior. Personally, I believe you.

To my knowledge *actual* death threats are the only (toxicity related) thing that can escalate you to an immediate permaban. \n\nAnother possibility (in which case you'd be lucky because that kind of stuff has been reversed in the past) is that you actually did receive a 14-day ban... but that you received it **while** you were in this game. There have been cases like this in the past, so I wouldn't be surprised if you actually received an email regarding a 14-day ban around the same time you got permabanned.\n\nEither way, I highly recommend writing a support ticket.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JeffNumbers","date":"2018-05-09T06:33:47.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People keep posting things like this but does anyone who can actually do anything about it ever read these or reply because we don't even get to see the reason this chat happened so people just assume you deserve the punishment when that could've been a raging  0/20 zac jungle for all we know lol.
