Fortify would passively give AD, and rally helped you take towers faster by AoE buffing AD and attack speed, additionally, wards were prioritized over champions by tower so you could keep dropping them to tank tower aggro and essentially free push down the nexus for safe and easy ip/exp farming in under 5 minutes.  Sounded totally troll, and might look like an int feeder from the start, but then it ends up being the most efficient strategy.\n^This strategy would work against players as well, by the way, but they would react and respond well before you got to the nexus.  In essence you could have as little as 2-3 champs start like this and cheese down a single tower with only one person taking rally, but it wasn't really worth the starting gold you'd give up on 2-3 people just for a single tower.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Thegreatxiu","date":"2018-04-13T19:14:43.621+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"My favorite thing is that I go AP Ezreal mid, people ask in pregame lobby if I'm going AP or AD and I tell them I'm going AP, but still once we're in game and I have AP items people get upset and spam ping my items.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-04-14T01:40:53.255+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait...
