What gives?\nI think most rational people don't inheretly dislike Neeko because she is lesbian, but because of the fact that people are focusing only about the fact that she is one. I mean, she is also a shapeshifter half-lizard!! A curious chameleon! I think her aspect of curiosity can make the younger audience coorelate with her, no matter who they are. But people (including Riot, to a degree) are putting her sexuality on a pedestal. Diversity is always nice, but for many, sexuality is rarely a part of their personality. I personally think It's always interesting when characters aren't defined by sexuality. And Neeko isn't that, she is just childish.  Though I do understand where people are coming from, it's nice to have representation. But this, for me borders on kindergarden.
