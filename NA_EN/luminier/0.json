If Death Lotus looked and sounded like Surprise Party Crowstorm, it's not going to help you any.\n\nOn the other hand, Kat has a TON of room for a legendary along the lines of Forecast Janna or Aetherwing Kayle. Not necessarily flashier but with an obviously-improved model, animations, and voiceover. Toss in a few Akali or Kai'sa style animations on a Kat skin, and it will definitely stand out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KatScript","date":"2018-10-30T16:52:36.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed Katarina recieve muuuuuuch love after the mini rework. She was so op and fun that no one doubts. \nBut after the non stop nerfs she stoped beeing that fun and thats why we felt that riot dont care about Katarina. \nI understand that you try your best to balance things.  Katarina right now she is ok -- bad. The big problem is that people overlearnt how to counter her and i think its a bit unfair. I have faith that you will succed when you decide to do some changes that benefit Katarina without making her unstopable again.\n\nAs for the legendary skin i kind of agree that her abillities dont help that much but they are ways to do something different with the ultimate, w preparation and maybe with her e.  \nIm glad you support the idea of a Star guardian skin because many people are so hyped for this! ^^  Her ult could shoot magical stars, when she picks up the daggers to do an \"explossion of magic dust or stars idk.  Have you seen the Star guardian Katarina art bt Z-Duke ? That fuchsia hair is amazing and i think that color or red are the best she could have.\n\nI understand hehe. I personally after death sworn and project skin i have faith in you and im looking forward to see the new one ^^","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2018-10-30T18:28:19.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=0iqEJqZA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-10-29T19:10:40.782+0000)\n>\n> Got some folks looking into it!
