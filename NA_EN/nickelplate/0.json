In case this is caused by a hiccup in your network, I'd recommend rebooting your PC, then your home network. You can reboot the network by pulling the power plug from your Modem/Router temporarily (~60 seconds) and plugging it back in.\n\nLet me know if this caused any change for you!","replies":[{"poster":"Mauxxi","date":"2017-01-26T03:30:11.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issure here.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Artirian","date":"2017-02-06T08:54:14.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is still an issue. All other games I currently have downloaded as well as browsers and internet-reliant apps all work without any hiccups. League can still work for me, with extreme patience. Normally I get the issue every time I try to log in. Waiting about 15~45 minutes usually allows me to click the log in button. Only to wait another set of time waiting to click the Play button. Sometimes being unable to create a game lobby or accept invites to such for another set of time.
