If we shape Frozen Heart up to be an armor counterpart to Abyssal Mask, we get something that looks like this:\n\n{{item:3110}}\n**Frozen Heart**\n+350 health\n+50 armor\n+300 mana\n+10% CDR\nUNIQUE Aura: Reduces attack speed of nearby enemies.\nUNIQUE Passive - Eternity: Damage taken from champions is gained as mana. Spending mana restores health.\n{{item:3082}} + {{item:3010}} \n\nI think it would be cool to have an armor counterpart to Abyssal Mask with the Eternity passive to turn tanks durability into mana sustain. It would still be a niche item, but more universally appealing, and unless Riot changes its passive so that it no longer has to compete with other Warden&#039;s Mail upgrades, this is about the best we can hope for.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2017-10-12T19:51:47.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frozen Heart isn't unappealing because it doesn't have health, it's the oversaturation of CDR.\n\nFor example, all MR tank items have CDR. All of them. {{item:3001}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3194}} \n\nAll tanky-Support items have CDR. {{item:3109}} {{item:3050}} {{item:3800}} \n\nFinally, a lot of Fighter items have CDR. {{item:3071}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3812}} \n\nAnd also Warmogs has CDR. {{item:3083}} \n\nMost Tank items without CDR also don't have Health. {{item:3193}} {{item:3190}} \n\nFrozen Heart was a good item because it provided a LOT of Armor, a lot of Mana, and a lot of CDR. Now that one of it's special niches is gone, it's underwhelming as a whole.\n\nCombine that with the fact that other Armor based items don't have CDR, and Frozen Heart is even less attractive over those options. You get all the CDR you need from the MR/Supp items. {{item:3075}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3068}} \n\nFrozen Heart doesn't need any more buffing (The 10 Armor was warranted a long time ago), CDR needs to be reduced across the board.\n\nPersonally, I'd take CDR out of Warmogs, Adaptive Helm, and Righteous Glory.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhearBunny","date":"2017-10-12T19:45:32.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frozen Heart.\n\nGlacial Shroud, Catalyst, MR Cloak.\n35 Armor.\n45 MR.\n350health\n300mana\n15% cdr* oooo new\n\nPassive- abilities apply a stack of glacial freeze on target or targets, each stack slows the enemies movement speed by 15% per stack. up to 3 stacks or 45%.

The unique passive is fine as-is since it combines with the other {{item:3082}} upgrades, but the other two upgrades are what I think could use adjustments.\n\nCurrently, {{item:3075}} and {{item:3143}}  together are really gold inefficient for the redundant passives, but are often too necessary for lifesteal and crits of marksmen. To combat this, it would be nice to see each of the two offer something extra from the passive, so the best of both apply when stacked.\n\n{{item:3075}} is still weak compared to bramblevest, so it could stand to have its coldsteel apply a stronger attack speed slow. It's meant to strrongly discourage attacking its wearer afterall. Give it a 30% AS slow when procced.\n\n{{item:3143}} has an active movement speed slow, so maybe give its coldsteel a 15% movement speed slow when procced as well.\n\nWith this, all three {{item:3082}} items could be used without wasting gold.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-10-12T17:07:47.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would love to see it be a bit more expensive and build out of tear honestly.","replies":[{"poster":"SzGamer227","date":"2017-10-12T17:54:44.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like that would alienate the item even more. Having to stack the mana passive would make it an even more inferior pick to Iceborn Gauntlet as an early item. Tanks buy their way out of their mana problems by taking IBG and get some waveclear as a bonus. If they're running into an AP-heavy comp, they'll take Abyssal Mask.\n\nWhen tanks are considering how they'll manage their spell costs, they're taking more immediate benefits. Why take a AS slow aura before teamfights start when you could get bonuses that are more impactful in lane/jungle and then buy a different Warden's Mail item once your earlygame is sorted out?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nanuk Pihoqahiak","date":"2017-10-12T17:17:30.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should rework it to give some kind of stacking movement speed decrease, up to a cap.
