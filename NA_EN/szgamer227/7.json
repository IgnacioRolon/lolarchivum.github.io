It is all about what is being used. Example: Lux's Q is called a snare because it is a sort of cage. Zyra's E is a manifestation of plants, so it makes more sense that it would be called a root. Basically, if it surrounds you like a cage, it is a snare, and if it grips you like vines, it is a root. Logically, this applies to all forms of snares and roots, not just vines and cages.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shiznyte","date":"2017-10-14T02:11:16.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Suppressions also need to be Channeled and during that time Champions cannot move or the CC is broken. after the Stun a champion is free to do as he pleases.
