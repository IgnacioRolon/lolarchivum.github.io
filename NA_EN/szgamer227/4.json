Two Comets will deal more damage than one Electrocute. You take Domination primary because it works regardless of which form you take, but having a choice of 3 minor Sorcery runes is really nice since so many of them work well.\n\nAnyways, I took this screenshot when I was playing Blood Moon and took the wrong runes. Those are actually just midlane runes with Manaflow Band and Scorch, and when you're playing a mode where you have insane mana regen and need burst damage that scales hard with AD, Comet, Band, and Scorch are some of the LAST runes you'd want to be taking.
