I just looked through a few different, both old AND new, discussions about how trolls never get punished in champ select. Literally at 8:35 AM Wednesday my account I decided to play some ranked and I ALWAYS know as a darius main I gotta hover over darius first thing so people know not to ban. There was a Jihn with the name M4e30 or something. He decides oh I gotta ban darius. after waiting for several seconds before he bans. Then he is just like \"ooops my bad I have downs\" and starts trolling in chat and everyone is mad at him since then yasuo was picked and I couldn't counter with darius. So of course instead of instantly losing almost certainly by a troll I decide to leave after asking them to dodge for me since it is my second dodge.\n\nI then lose 10 LP cuz I did a dodge last night and it apparently does a 24 hour or so wait in between and have to wait 30 frickin minutes. \n\nThis doesn't even scrape the bottom of the barrel here it is a HUUUUGE problem for ANYONE in series because what if someone trolls like this Jihn? Jihn is not as good as say tristana or twitch right now and on top of that banning whatever you have selected? At least give people a frickin refund riot. If is a concern for abuse make is something like this.....you can RECORD names from champ select and champ select sessions!!! If a player abuses the system or attempts to by constantly reporting a person and getting a free dodge go ahead and make it max 3 free dodges per day and if they are making false reports just to get free dodges then you apply the punishments all at once if they were actually in the wrong.\n\nI know your bot that checks reports isn't perfect and that it possibly can't determine this kind of stuff but PLEASE so SOMETHING about it instead of making it so that if you're autofilled and don't like that posistion just ban whatever someone is hovering and furthermore threaten to int and so on.\n\nPlease think about it and actually take some course of action.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-09-20T17:58:59.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't have enough time to read all this right now, but to point several things:\n\n1) I was jesting with my post, saying mods would delete it, but Laughing Fish is a moderator.\n\n2) You must acknowledge that Board Moderators are not the same as those in charge of punishing in-game.
