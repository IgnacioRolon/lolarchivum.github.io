Only thing she lacks really is sustain in lane (despite the most of the time negligible heal you get from coming out of R, but that's only noticeable if you took no damage at all during the R) which honestly would just make her busted, so I'm definitely not asking for that to happen lol. \n\nRakan on the other hand works nothing like Lulu and has maybe a third of her auto attack range on top of the fact that his E would only be of use to him when a jungler shows up. And if your argument is that he would be in the jungle, his cooldowns and costs are too high early for anyone to really want to reasonably play him in the jungle without getting counter jungled out of their mind. \n\nI just wish Riot could release an \"ADC/Supp\" duo and have people leave it at that, nothing weird. Especially considering there's very specific things that ADC's and Supp's are meant to possess and lack that make them very strong in their lane and very weak in any other lane because 99% of the opponents they go up against are going to have different (note: better) tools at their disposal to either get off the damage faster, easier, and in a more mobile way or just sustain through anything you throw at them.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Verdade","date":"2017-04-05T20:13:54.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":22,"body":"Yeah, let's fuck up the only lane not fucked up by mobility creep, just so that Yasuo and Lee Sin mains can pick up their flashy champion.
