Or have bought all the champions that are worth buying so you can trade in Drafts? Or any champion that you would buy for any stupid reason, just because its more worthwhile than a Rune page that only fits one or two champions?\n\nAll I can say is if Riot wants any sort of creativity in their Rune pages, they need to make them cost less, and probably buff the overall amount of IP earned by playing in general, because holy crap, unless you&#039;ve been playing League every day for several months you&#039;re not going to want to spend your IP on anything but general rune pages.\n\nI&#039;d also like to plug my idea for receiving the two Rune pages above as free, fixed, default Rune pages at level 30 so that new players have a reliable set of Runes to use once they enter Ranked, and so more involved players can use their two Rune pages to create specialized Rune pages for the champions they play the most.","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2017-01-28T06:47:33.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">So basically you can play every champion in the game with these two pages:\n\n>9 Marks of Attack Damage\n>9 Seals of Armor\n>9 Seals of Magic Resist\n>1-2 Quints of Attack Damage\n>1-2 Quints of Attack Speed\n\n>9 Marks of Magic Penetration\n>9 Seals of Armor\n>9 Seals of Magic Resist\n>3 Quints of Ability Power\n\nThat's exactly what I do, and all you really need to do, yeah.

Doing so would be tantamount to Riot  admitting fault; you would have an easier time squeezing blood from a stone.\n\nHell, it took them an entire season to cop to the fact that forcing everyone into DQ was a huge mistake. In fact, they spent the entirety of that season reassuring us that it was the right decision and that the major criticisms we as players had were uninformed and ignorant of Riot's brilliant plan. I vividly remember a certain round table discussion with a distinctly non-round table in it. I wonder how all that crow tasted when Riot begrudgingly brought SQ back.\n\nIn addition, Riot will never admit that it's bad enough to the extent that players should get some freebies. If that were to happen, players wouldn't need to waste IP on runes and pages, and instead use that IP to buy champions with instead of RP. When players start buying champions (especially newer, more expensive ones) with IP, Riot twists in pain.\n\nBecause you've hit them where it hurts the most, their wallet.","replies":[{"poster":"SzGamer227","date":"2017-01-28T19:24:05.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just going to ignore your pessimistic criticisms and respond to your last paragraphs.\n\nIf giving out free Rune pages is going to hurt Riot's revenue somehow, it's going to be in Rune page sales.

Assuming this is true, Default Rune pages wouldn't affect how much IP is spent on champions, it would just mean less people pay to skip and get Rune pages faster.\n\nI don't know how much RP people spend on Rune pages, but I imagine it's inferior to skin sales very simply because Runes aren't important once you have a couple of standard pages set in stone.","replies":[{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-01-28T20:13:00.920+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's be real.\nHow many people actually ever bought rune pages for RP?\n\nI personally only buy runes when there's that bi-annually 2-for-1 IP deal.","replies":[{"poster":"SzGamer227","date":"2017-01-28T21:00:21.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I imagine the people who have enough money to drop $100 on RNG Hextech crafting would have enought money to burn on Rune pages whenever they please, provided they are serious about the game and want to perform well.","replies":[{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-01-28T21:23:06.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a bit different though.\n\nHextech is gambling.\nRune pages are just content.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Weasel Kensei","date":"2017-01-28T20:20:05.259+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His tone is a bit over the top, but not completely wrong.\n\nWhen a company is in the business of providing a product or service, they are invariably going to get criticism.\n\nDynamic queue got  a ton of criticism, and so do other things. Companies often dont admit mistakes because as soon as they do they admit theyre not perfect and this validates peoples criticisms which just emboldens them to make more criticism.\n\nIt would also affect consumption. Market test show that consumers avoid companies that continually make mistakes. So if Riot came out and said they were fucking up 40% of the time, that alone would make people not trust them and avoid their services.\n\nNo, the corporate mindset says its just best to never say anything, and if they do fuck up and get caught, they have to say it was unforeseen and a miscalculation based on bad data. To avoid trust loss add something like now that we have new data, we wont be doing that again. If they do do it again though, just let the consumer know that they were very close and that last fuck up was a near miss but we got it now.\n\nDue to trust loss, that corporate mindset isnt completely wrong, but Rito fucks up enough that at this point they would probably endear more respect just admitting it.\n\nThe pointless buffing of Xin to a 60% win rate when everyone said dont hes in a good spot, then they buffed him anyway and... well 60% win rate happened because...

I used DQ; there's the wildly unpopular Morde rework that broke Worlds 2015, the incident that lead to the term \"sejuani'd\" becoming a thing, Azir being released with more bugs than an ant farm, Kalista and the balance team's futile attempts at making her kit fair, that Harrowing events are no longer obliged to coincide with Halloween, the half-assed \"Draven Day\" for April Fools last year, the champion favoritism both in balance and in skins, etc.\n\nThose are just the recent ones, you go back even further you discover the Renekton Bar fiasco, and Kassadin's 98% banrate for an entire season, and giving supports AP scaling on their abilities, and invisible spears of death AP Nidalee, and so on.\n\nThe Xin thing in particular confused everyone. Xin was fine, and then we saw two or three buffs hit the PBE for him out of nowhere. When questioned, Rioters often said something like \"We're testing some stuff for him, and that changes on the PBE weren't written in stone\". Turns out, those changes were indeed written in stone.
