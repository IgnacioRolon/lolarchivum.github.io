But specifically after this patch it has jumped to 120 and doesn't fluctuate much from that. I checked my router and everything seems fine. Any other game I play has no issues with the ping being high (Still sticks to 40 ping and doesnt get much higher). I've tried everything from shutting down every other program  that uses internet to completely un-installing league and doing a fresh install/update but the issue has persisted (Though the fresh install did make the client run more smoothly for me so there's that)\n\n{{champion:27}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"koroshli","date":"2017-03-17T13:05:32.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i used to have 79.. after patch7.5 it become 104 .. every thing else is fine{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scorpion","date":"2017-03-10T20:05:28.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and today my client downloaded the same patch on its own for the 4th time, i see some other guys are having the same issue too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-10T18:41:43.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"150 is pretty high on it's own, so it sounds like you've got some kind of network issue that's been degrading and finally giving out (unless you're physically playing very from from the NA service).
