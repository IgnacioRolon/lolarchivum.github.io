I just think its total crap that 1). you can get a ban timer for remakes and  2). the timer never resets even after a month or so of no leaves or even play.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T23:59:09.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me take a stab at clarifying things on Leaverbuster/Remake. \n\n 1. Yes, you can get an LPQ (queue timer) for **consistent** disconnections from matches within a short span of time. Regardless of intent, a disconnection negatively impacts everyone in the match, so disconnections are all treated equally by the system.\n\n2. Your standing in the Leaverbuster system decays over time, but requires a consistent trend of *not disconnecting* from matches. Time isn't the only factor, as a player could play sparsely, but if they disconnect every time they play, they'd still be negatively affecting other's gameplay.\n\nCheck out our [Leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) or [/Remake](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) FAQs for more information.
