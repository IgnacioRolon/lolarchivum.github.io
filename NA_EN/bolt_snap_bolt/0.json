While in champ select the animations for picking and banning will freeze, and it will result in me dodging. I am able to edit mastery pages, select runes, summoner spells, etc. but I can't see who people locked in or if they locked in at all. It then goes through champ select until it unknowingly reaches me and results in a dodge because I am unable to select my champ. Sometimes I reconnect in time, but most often the bug happens for 2+ minutes. I am still able to use chat and communicate with my team, as well as PM people in client, however the physical champ select ceases to function. It's done this on both my computer and my laptop, so I assume it may be an issue with my internet. I'm currently using Comcast Internet with a dedicated line to my PC (220 Mbps DL and 12 Mbps Up, average ping at about 50 for Riot servers). I've also made sure I have the appropriate firewall settings as well. I just don't understand how chat can work, while my client does not. And after I dodge, it immediately pulls me back to the main League screen so I believe my client is still communicating with the server. I've lost 13 LP in flex today because of this, and the frequent dodge timers are frustrating. I'm currently using the older client. A friend of mine also has the same issue (not as frequent), and is still experiencing it on the new client. I never had this problem with the old champ select either (the blind pick one). I wish that if I was hovering a champion, it would still lock me in when my timer hit zero. I understand why they don't do this anymore, but it's still super irritating. Final note, I sometimes get an error notification when I reconnect, but never when it dodges completely. I've never been prompted for bug splat on this either. Things I've tried so far: Reinstalling the client, and not running any background programs/windows during champ select. Those didn't work. Anyone else ever have this issue? If so, have you been able to resolve/fix it? Thanks for any help or advice!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-06T04:58:18.121+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like your connection to a few of our matchmaking servers (many services or sections of the client rely on different servers) since you're having issues in champ select, while not having issues in other sections of the client.
