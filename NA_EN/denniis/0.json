Is there a way to get rid of the queue? Now I'm at 20 minutes because of my stupid internet ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-04T18:56:13.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) penalty applies to all leaves regardless of it being intentional or not.  It's treated equally because all leaves still cause others a negative experience.  We do not remove these lower priority queues,  so it's crucial to resolve the disconnections to have them gone.  I recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help troubleshoot the unstable connection to the game server.  Let me know anymore details or specifics in case I can help as well.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
