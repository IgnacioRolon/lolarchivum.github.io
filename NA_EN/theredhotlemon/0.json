Please fix this right now, nobody wants to spend more RP than is stated! (And if I could get my RP back too that would be nice.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-06T17:07:13.692+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nThanks for the report! Was this a visual bug with your RP, or was your account charged full price? \n\nIf you were charged full price, please shoot us a [ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we can look into your account and make any adjustments. :)","replies":[{"poster":"TheRedHotLemon","date":"2016-06-11T22:43:06.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a visual bug! I found out that I wasn't visually charged for a purchase earlier, so it appeared that I was charged more than the price of the skin, but it was really just 2 purchases worth of RP being charged visually, sorry.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-13T18:08:03.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Phew!
