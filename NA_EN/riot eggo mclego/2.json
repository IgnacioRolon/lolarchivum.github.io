When the skin hit PBE, we discovered some pretty serious issues with how his World Ender wings interact with certain runes and items.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OPHn3Rf.png[img]\n\n_[Aatrox normal Ult wings, with Conqueror, and Zhonya’s]_\n_[Oof, oops!]_\n\nIn order to fix this, we’ve adjusted the wings to a solid, bulkier silhouette. The initial feedback we saw around him feeling too sleek and lightweight helped determine the aesthetic we wanted to give this new version. We didn’t feel we could successfully add more armor to his look without coming too close to the Justicar skin, but hope the new wings help his most powerful moments feel harder-hitting.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Q0ltaH7.png[img]\n\n_[Aatrox new Ult wings]_\n\nThese changes will go into effect before his launch, so this is the version you’ll get if you’ve reached Gold or higher in non-TFT ranked queues.\n\nRiot Eggo McLego\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Spellfire","date":"2019-11-12T21:22:31.735+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"Even though I understand how important and needed this fix is before it hits live, I still think it’s pretty funny to see how suddenly, when it causes bugs, a skin CAN receive big changes and edits in less than a week.\n\nWhile instead, by some heavy heavy community dislikes and bad feedback on a particular skin (aka PROJECT: Jinx, or now with Pulsefire Thresh), these changes can’t be made because of the ‘lack of time’. \n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ducks are Epic","date":"2019-11-12T23:24:38.027+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Spellfire,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=kBAgbNEk,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2019-11-12T21:22:31.735+0000)\n>\n> Even though I understand how important and needed this fix is before it hits live, I still think it’s pretty funny to see how suddenly, when it causes bugs, a skin CAN receive big changes and edits in less than a week.\n> \n> While instead, by some heavy heavy community dislikes and bad feedback on a particular skin (aka PROJECT: Jinx, or now with Pulsefire Thresh), these changes can’t be made because of the ‘lack of time’. \n> \n> {{sticker:sg-lux-2}}\n\nWhat about K/DA Akali?

He has 2 golden skins already, with 1 of them sharing the exact same colour palette as the victorious line (and doing it arguably better)\n\n2. After 5 years of not giving a vic. skin to supports (if you decide to call s4 Morg a sup, also no too clear as she was also big midlane back then) / 4 years for Adcs you decided to give it to a champ, that has been so incredibly broken (not arguable) that he was to tier pick for 3 positions (top, mid and jungle), atleast for high elo and pro play\n\n3. He was only meta defining because you don't tend to nerf anyone who just got an expensive skin (sounds bad, but works)\n\n4. When writing the 3rd point i also noticed that everytime someone bets a random buff, 1 or 2 patches later a skin arives (eg. Blitzcrack, Ashe), i'm not a big fan (also, Blitzcrank feels far too strong, won all games since his buff (10 i think) )\n\nBut the most important part:  \n\n**Before making a skin, you should always ask yourself: 'Why should someone pick this skin over the others?'**\n\nI'm personally a giant fan of golden skins (my 2 favorite fantasy themes are Paladins followed by holy/angel stuff) and therefor own mane (might be all, not sure) skins that are even slightly going into this direction. 2 of those are [Justicar Aatrox and Bloodmoon Aatrox prestige edition](https://pasteboard.co/IGpYtC4.png) . Normally i'm insanly hyped for the victorious skins, as they kinda fit in with my style, but Victorious Aatrox has a problem, why should someone choose him instead of justicar, or even the Prestige one when they work much better.\n\n\nPro \n\n* Victorious Aatrox is (at least kinda) free. \n\n* Some may totally be into that marble thing (but as i stated in my previous post about his problem, it doesn't fit in with the victorious skin theme of the past)\n\nCon\n\n* If i like the golden blue theming, justicar is just the way to go, works much better\n\n* if i wanna feel like a warrior king, i'll take prestige Aatrox (for those who have it, prestige skins are rediculus)\n\n* if i like the Victorious skin aesthetics, i'll take Justicar, as is comes closer to it\n\n\nSome may see it different, but i really don't think there's a reason players will take it above his other skins, atleast people who play Aatrox as they most likely already have atleast one of the above skins if the like the theme.\n\n\nWith that said, i'd like to say i see Riots side of things:\n\n* Skins are expensive to make, at least the one that aren't kade by interns x) ... oh wait (sry, there had to be one silly joke in here, i'm not serious )\n\n* So... Skins are expensive to make, and remaking them even more. It's not worth for you guys, and therefor if a change isn't that easy to make, it won't be done (vfx are easier and cheaper then a model change to get him in shape)\n\n* Riot won't cancel any single skin, no matter how bad/hated it is! (Dunkmaster Ivern)\n\n* [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), best way to describe a lost of the 2018/19 skin problems\n\n* Riot knows exaclty how to spread their resources to get as much money as possible. \n\n* Highlights: Prestige Skins for the whales, repeating the same skinlines over and over again because they are an easy cashgrab and the strongest of them all **Dunkmaster Ivern** (you know, that skin that was only made so they could get some cash from sport fans since there aren't enough Iver players to make it worth giving him a skin people would actually enjoy (there are like 100 fanskins, every single one of them better quality and more fitting than Dunkmaster ivern (if someone comes up with a better reason for going with that theme, hit me up (spoiler, he doesn't even dunk)).\n\nOk sry, lost my track there, so lets continue.\n\nWhile these changes are atleast a positive developement and **much** more then i ever expected to get (lost my hope on listening to feedback when i had a discussion with a Rioter, he accidently admited he was wrong and then stoped the conversation. (If someone is interrested : 'we don't change 520rp skins too not confuse our players about our pricing model, that's why 520/750 skins don't receive vfx changes, but 975rp+ do', i then made the argument of Battlborn Kayle and Cookie Morgana beeing the exact opposite and.... still wating for him to answer that one :c)\nAnd that's not even the only stupid thing with that Pbe cycle!\n\nFfs, back to Aatrox again!\n\nMany problems still aren't fixed, like his body shape, his colour theme, his voice, the sfx (especially ult), rectangle q... (see my last post to get some more.\n\nI really don't wanna sound like a dick, but pls consider scraping this one and starting all over. (If you're rly cocky you could even choose another champ).\n\nI think that's it, might be a lost of grammar/spelling errors, as i'm writing this at night and a lot of frustration came up while writing this (somebody might have noticed x) ) but if someone from riot reads this and actually would like to listen/answer some questions/criticism, id actually love to write with someone directly since i got a lot of skin related feedback atm (about the current system etc. : )  Katey is sadly unavailable atm (and a lot more busy then in the early days...), so if you may dm me / tell me someone i can give my feedback too that actually reads/responds to it it owuld be really appreciaded!).\n\n\nTl;Dr Victorious Kog'Maw pls! \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Hide on gnar","date":"2019-11-13T15:36:33.529+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://i.imgur.com/ifqEe72.png and we would be fine","replies":[]},{"poster":"Famous Gay Actor","date":"2019-11-20T01:31:02.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"EvilSturmi","date":"2019-11-26T01:22:06.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait what?

Anyways, the game has been an absolute wonder and allowed me to keep in contact with many friends from back home as I was in the US military for 8 years and that's how my friends and I kept in contact and gaming together. I appreciate everything the company has done and the directions you are taking it. Just food for thought. Cheers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KutzPine","date":"2019-11-26T08:17:30.300+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi! Aatrox one-trick here (one-tricktrox). I don't think the skin looks bad in-game tbh, although there are certainly better skins for my boi. However, I noticed his wings during his ult are not centered properly on his back and it's kinda disturbing in a way, especially when moving directly up or down. Another thing about his wings is that they should make his wings bigger and make them flap. These changes would make the skin a lot more appealing.\n\nIn addition, if these wings had to be changed because it was reacting very strangely to runes and items, why are the banner wings still the same. It's like the banner wings were fixed, yet the ult wings needed to be changed because they were buggy. My point is that if Riot could fix the banner wings, as they have the same effects and details, then why couldn't they have fixed his ult wings and prevent these strange interactions from runes and items. Hopefully the team that designed the skin will look into this.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abyz","date":"2019-11-14T07:59:57.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But why is he wearing a blue leather suit and is so similar to Justicar ... This skin is out of line for the Victorious theme. Wings make it better but I'm probably never playing with that","replies":[]}]}
