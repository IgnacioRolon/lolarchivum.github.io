(Bezeq International)\r\nI also tried the connection guide, so please don't send me to search there for an answer.\r\n\r\nthanku !","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-05T02:57:30.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mentioned having gone through the steps already, but we do need to go through the steps in that [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) again as some basic troubleshooting steps first. You've already altered the DNS settings, so feel free to skip those if you want, but do pay close attention to the rest of the steps. The section on port forwarding has a good deal of success, but again, make sure to go through all of them. \n\nTest it in a custom game, and let me know if you're still getting those weird dc spikes. If those steps still aren't helping we can dig a little deeper with you.","replies":[]}]}
