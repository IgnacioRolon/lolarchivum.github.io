These spikes can range from a second or two of input lag and in the worst case an entire minute has gone by where i could not move my champion or cast any abilities, however during that time I was still able to communicate with my team using the in game chat. I've played league of legends on this monitor before with no issues whatsoever when it was hooked up to my 2012 alienware laptop so it is very confusing as to why a much better laptop is performing so poorly with this game. I do not believe this to be a performance issue or that the laptop is not powerful enough because I play overwatch on this exact same setup on high setting and I run it at 120 frames with no issues at all. If anybody has any idea what is going on any help would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-17T16:59:52.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though you're still connected, it seems like you're suffering from packet loss which would result in these input delays.
