Though my math history ended at 6/28, before I left Canada, and all my match history was completely fine （no intentional feeding or left the game, etc.）, so I am wondering that even if my account was hacked, the hacker didn't use it to play any game but changed y email address, so how did I get banned anyway. Is there anyway that I can fix my e-mail and recover my account from suspension? Pls help Riot Game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-28T00:42:59.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries bud!
