When you or who ever did this pc picked up the parts, it was considered that not enough cpu power can' t use properly all the gpu?\n\nI looked at recommended specs, and looks you will be fine. So atm better not change anything if you already bought it. Else get at least a 6-core, from amd there is one really cheap, without too much electric drain and well performing ( but is a 6 core... they have a bit of stigma ). In doubt, go for what you posted.","replies":[{"poster":"Shuyeong","date":"2015-02-06T16:15:20.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure it is bottlenecked because I have problems running the game running it only at 60-70 frames avg on very high sometimes I have to put it at medium to get 80avg steady but I have a Fm2 Socket so that limited me","replies":[{"poster":"Shuyeong","date":"2015-02-06T16:23:16.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I might change out my cpu to a a6 7400k","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"dyehardxen","date":"2015-01-31T05:41:45.659+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your CPU is clocked higher, and you have more RAM than me.
