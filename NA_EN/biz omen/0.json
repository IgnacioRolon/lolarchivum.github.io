KDA plays minor role. U gotta aim for 60-70 CS per 10 mins  and 1 wards every 2 mins if u keep yellow trinket. Try to put 2-3 pink wards. ANd u will be fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-20T20:01:07.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk, when I get S, it's usually with something like 13/1/10.

Game ended in 17 mins, i stayed top entire game. I got 160 CS and placed ward on CD. See, kills dont represent your performance or your skill with champion. All u need is bad opponents to get kills. But bad opponents cannot affect your CS and warding in any way.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-20T20:17:29.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You probably got S that game because you also destroyed a good number of towers.\n\nK/D/A still definitely shows skill on a champion.  It is a basic summary of interaction with allies and opponents.  In a team pvp game, player interaction is generally a display of skill.\n\nSure, bad players can get you fed, but not if you're equally bad.  You still showed that you were better than your opponent.  It's all relative.  The worst pro may feed his opponent in pro games, but he'd probably wreck the vast majority of the community.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-20T19:57:55.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty good, but the S ranks are supposed to be for extremely good games.
