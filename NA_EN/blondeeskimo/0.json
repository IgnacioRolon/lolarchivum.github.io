Honestly, I sure hope he gets a new skin soon...been like four years since his last one and it would be nice to get a new Kennen model in general.\n\nBlood Moon Kennen is another possibility or even a Scientist Kennen could be cool too considering how Shen and Akali got skins for the former, but not Kennen oddly.","replies":[{"poster":"BlondeEskimo","date":"2015-08-27T03:55:02.141+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"on of my buddy's said blood moon kennen and I do agree that would be pretty awesome like a blood red kimono and maybe like a kinda white  hood whith red detailing on it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Westonbirt","date":"2015-08-26T20:45:34.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I strongly favour blood moon kennen, with extra bits of bling on his effects, red and white arcs everywhere and an explosion of fireworks when you kill someone.","replies":[{"poster":"SlyTactician ","date":"2015-08-26T20:49:30.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imagine a shower of fireworks as Kennen's ult instead of thunderbolts!
