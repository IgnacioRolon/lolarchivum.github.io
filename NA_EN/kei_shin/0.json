This is the same case when it comes to the shop or your profile page(not on the home screen or in the party menu)\r\n\r\nAnother problem I noticed is during champion select different icons or labels will be out of place. Go into ranked and get into a match you'll see \"5v5 Ranked\" and the summoner names all shoved downwards and sometimes will be off the screen and if your really unlucky your summoners spells and selected champions are not visible. That being said once the loading screen pops up you'll see everything just fine its only a major inconvenience.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-29T22:48:20.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The client crashing like this, especially during hextech crafting, is a very common sign of a third party program causing issues.  If you have any running like play.tv, overlays, or lolrecorder remove them.  This should fix you up, but this can also be a problem with your network failing to respond and download assets to you.  I would also recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to be sure!  Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
