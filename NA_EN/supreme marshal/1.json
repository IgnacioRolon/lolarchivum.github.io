Why do I have a bad connection while playing league of legend? The connection happen to be good for a couple of hours, but sometimes during the day, the connection suck so bad that I can't even play. My ms goes up from 200 to 5000. It ruin all of my games and it's very frustrating.  If I play any other online game, everything is fine. The problem seem to happen in League of legend only. I also think many other people have the same problem.\n\nI did many internet speed test and my real ms is 8, all the times. When league of legend happen to have a good connection, it has 32Ms and it should ALWAYS be like that. \nIf there is any solution to this, it will be apreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-09T03:22:17.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Different servers or games you access online reside in *different geolocations*. Additionally, any sort of *speedtest* will only measure your connection and speed to that site's servers, not others such as League. These latency issues are either caused by local network settings or poor network routing en route to the server. I'd recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local settings are good before we investigate further.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
