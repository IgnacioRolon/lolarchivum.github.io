I am totally appalled when I saw my account being banned for third party software usage. I geniunely did not cheat, The only softwares that are remotely related to league are twitch and discord. THATS IT! I think this is totally ridiculous. Please upvote this so I can get attention from Riot to retrieve my account\r\n\r\nYES, I made a ticket as well!

It's protection for your account and for other players for a variety of reasons.\n\n1.) If you **were** cheating (just using it as an example - I don't believe you were cheating), it gets a cheater out of the game.\n\n2.) If your account was compromised, which I think is more frequently the case when someone gets a surprise ban (since the real cheaters probably aren't going to come post here), then it actually **protects** your account until you get it resolved.\n\nNot sure if you have a debit or credit card, but this is the same thing that happens when fraud is suspected. The bank locks the card and asks questions later. Frustrating, but it's good protection.\n\nAs AeroWaffle said, check your match history for any games that weren't you, and please, **be nice to Riot support** when you ask for their help. Don't act all outraged. Tell them what happened and work with them.","replies":[]}]}
