Ive seen people use shields, zhonya's, other various untargetable abilities at the wrong times and die for it. This i think is fair, im pretty sure Zed's ult takes 3 seconds to go off right? Add in the .75 second delay so just wait like 2 seconds after he actually applies the ult and then Zhonya's? I also think there is a debuff icon thingy that you can look at right? \n\nIf you want to talk about clarity then look at Garen's ult, it does 30% (its actually like 28.57% or something like that) of the targets missing health + plus its base damage (you also need to factor in MR but you need to do that for all the other abilities too). So you need to do some quick math with random amounts of numbers all in the middle of fighting them. Its not hard math, its just annoying when they survive with like 20 hp because my quicky math was off (im not a math major so i make mistakes often). And if people are complaining about a 3.75 second delay then Garen's Demathian Justice must make your brain cry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nausic√§a ","date":"2014-12-31T03:13:45.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not a 'dot' its delayed damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AFK Push","date":"2014-12-31T00:29:14.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Much like Heimer's ult turret, it shouldn't go off after he is dead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Diostukos","date":"2014-12-30T23:08:00.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it has a little buff icon that ends right when the ult procs; shouldn't that be enough to help you time your Zhonyas?\n\nThat's how I time them, anyways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yoella","date":"2014-12-30T22:27:23.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, if Riot does this for Zed they'd better do it for Karthus ulti too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slushi Simcambi","date":"2014-12-30T20:42:28.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BUFF {{summoner:13}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"FLY Slotmachiner","date":"2014-12-30T19:33:17.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed ult has that Passive right?

Imagine if Poppy's ult had a timer, by the time it shows 1 second, Poppy would be surrounded like a suicide Shaco that just used Q as gap closer.\n\nZhonya, Zed's ult, Lissandra's ult, all those skills have a sound or effect that shows when it's expiring, so the player can counter it properly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2014-12-30T16:42:38.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Zillian's bomb and Fizz's ult deal AoE damage.
