People whined about assassins being able to do their job while fed so you lower burst and extend it by a few seconds? It makes no sense to build like an assassin now if it takes you longer to kill them than it takes them to kill you. Its so fucking retarded. fizz top, tank rengar, bruiser kha zix. All because lethality was broken for a few patches. This has been going on all the way back to the assassin update and its not fun playing an assassin and having the meta be just building some tank items and being virtually unkillable. Its not challenging to play as or against. Assassins can one shot you in a few seconds yes, but at least they were squishy.","replies":[{"poster":"Ben Sharpio","date":"2017-05-11T16:59:26.435+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"even after all of the nerfs we've seen for these champions, they're still being played effectively. it makes me REALLY think about how much broken shit i've experienced playing this game lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-05-11T17:01:10.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because he is getting changes to promote his assasin build in the upcoming patch\n\nFizz\nSeastone Trident (W):\nPassive's AP ratio increased from 33.3% to 40% \nActive's AP ratio increased from 33.3% to 40%\nCharged Active's AP ratio increased from 100% to 120%\nDamage changed from 25/40/55/70/85 to 20/30/40/50/60\n\nFrom: http://www.surrenderat20.net/p/current-pbe-balance-changes.html#balance\n\nFor kat and others building tank has already been nerfed and is no longer efficient.  \n\nSeriously people need to stop posting shit before they look at upcoming changes.","replies":[{"poster":"GoodJobMan","date":"2017-05-11T17:07:46.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and yet rengar and kha zix still exist to be the role they were not made for LOL. There is a higher win rate with a bruiser build on an assassin than an assassin build. Besides i dont know what you mean by no longer efficient. If every rengar in high elo or lcs still builds him as an off tank or still builds kha as a bruiser it seems to be pretty efficient to me lol.","replies":[]}]}]}
