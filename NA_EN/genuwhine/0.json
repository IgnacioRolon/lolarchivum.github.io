If you can't control yours, you should go find some 1v1 game to play since you clearly don't deserve allies. The ability to interact with others should be something you  have to consistently prove you deserve, whether it's in a competitive or otherwise environment. If you fail to prove that you DESERVE to have others around... why should you be allowed around others?","replies":[{"poster":"Genuwhine","date":"2014-12-27T06:23:38.616+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"words are as important as the shit my dog takes. words are what people use to cover up being animals, a dog can bark at you all he wants its doing nothing but if he bites you then you have a problem","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2014-12-27T09:37:33.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Genuwhine,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=rREb55V1,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2014-12-27T06:23:38.616+0000)\n>\n> words are as important as the shit my dog takes. words are what people use to cover up being animals, a dog can bark at you all he wants its doing nothing but if he bites you then you have a problem\n\nyou're a sick sick individual... and now I see why you got banned in the first place. I sincerely hope that forevermore you have a 100% loss rate in normal so you never get your ranked ban lifted and eventually you quit the game and go play something where you don't have to interact with others.\n\nI'd suggest you go get some psychiatric help to deal with your problem, but words don't matter, so I won't bother. I can only hope that someday you recognize how wrong you are...","replies":[{"poster":"Genuwhine","date":"2014-12-27T11:49:53.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2014-12-27T18:43:44.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yep, I was right... you have some real problems. No, I'm not wishing 'bad things' upon you, I'm wishing something that will put you in a place where you can have fun that isn't at the expense of others. You clearly don't respect others, so you don't deserve to have allies. So you should be playing a solo game, and whatever it takes for you to get there is good both for you and everyone else in the long run.\n\nAnd btw, your racist analogies are offensive... again you're misusing words because you simply have no respect.\n\nEdited to remove the quote since moderators already deleted the post.
