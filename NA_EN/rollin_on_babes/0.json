Usually I'll make it into a game okay but within a couple minutes i will freeze up and get \"Attempting to Reconnect\". My internet is fine and still connected but the game will continually disconnect me and reconnect me. Some games are fine and I will play a whole game with one or MAYBE (if I'm lucky) one DC. However, usually I am dcing multiple times throughout the game. It causes me to stand still in lane and get rekt by my opponent or I will run back to base and be in the fountain when I reconnect. Some games I am literally attempting to reconnect longer than I actually get to play and I will end a game with a kd of 1-1-0 or 0-1-0 or something with VERY LITTLE ACTION. I really don't think the internet is this bad because everything else on the computer works without issues. I will even pres ctrl+alt+dlt when im reconnecting to check my internet and it says its fine and connected. What is the problem?! Please help me so I can actually play the game without issues like I used to. \r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-07T16:34:53.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though your internet may seem fine, there can still be issues with your network specifically connecting to our server.
