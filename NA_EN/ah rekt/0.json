Riot, out of tens of millions of players, has singled you, one player, out for harassment.\n\nOr, more likely, your account was a victim of attempted hacking, and when you contact [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com) they will help you recover it. Or, there was an RP purchase on your account which was disputed and thus Riot banned your account until such time as you repay the balance.

Grinding IP for multiple run pages (additional 13) multiple limited release skins, up to $3700 tanked for bogus reports and zero investigation.\nChatlogs should NEVER be the end-all be-all reason for a permban with no chance of reinstatement.\nTrust me...
