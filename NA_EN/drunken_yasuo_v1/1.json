I know how much effort is need  into maximizing her. Its hard especially when you want to animation cancel her Ult. The rest seems to be a bit challenging. \n\nHer whole balancing revolves around her animation canceling. You remove that, Riot will need to heavily compensate for it. With this route,  anyone who can pick this champion will actually and mindlessly faceroll the keyboard. Now you actually have to play smart and not faceroll as opposed to what other people say when she was FOTM. \n\nThe passive buff was to compensate the loss of 4 AD from mastery. \n\nIf Riot really wants to buff her, another 5% on her passive will seem to banaid her but thats pretty much it. Any more buffs and we will have so much QQ.\n\nI don't mind her being buffed.

We need to get it out of our heads that all champs NEED to have a 50% win rate to be balanced. That's simply not the case.\n\nIn a world where everyone is 50% win rate, why would i EVER pick a jungler that ISN'T Lee sin, or an AD that ISN'T Vayne? if you master these champs, you can get the absolute most of them and use their high potential for outplay and carrying ability to run over the whole game.\n\nPeople need to accept that win rate is a representative of player success ON AVERAGE and is representative of how an AVERAGE player who has little mastery of a particular champ does in a given game. It is not an objective measure of champion \"goodness.\"\n\nWatch Box Box's stream and watch him tear assholes on Riven. He can do that because he has a very clear mastery of every detail on that champ. Is Riven annoying? Yeah she is, but the average player shouldn't be able to pick up Riven and immediately destroy everyone with her. Her complexity shouldn't allow her to do that. \n\nLIKEWISE Irelia is actually a relatively complex champion. People like Irelia Carries U and other people play Irelia at a very high level and take advantage of a lot of the nuances in her kit, specifically in her Q and W. If Irelia were to have a 51% win rate on average, she'd start drawing bans immediately. At a point where Irelia has a 51% win rate, any bum can take a semi-complex champion and has just above a coinflip's chance of winning. That's not representative of Irelia's somewhat steep mastery curve. \n\nAs far as play rate, that's just player preference. People are going to pick shit that's strong, and they're going to pick champs that are fun. If she's not overly strong, people that aren't big fans aren't going to pick her. To use pickrate as a measure of her success is also pretty stupid.\n\nTL;DR\nComplex champs with steep mastery curves and high potential for outplay and good use shouldn't have a 50% win rate.
