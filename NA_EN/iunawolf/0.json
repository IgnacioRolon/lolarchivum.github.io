Sorry about that. We've sent a report to the server.\"\r\nI'm not sure exactly why it happens or what triggers it. Mostly it occurs right after I log in or come out of a match. It usually shows up 2 times consecutively and happens quite often. It also only happens on the Legacy Client.\r\n\r\nI've tried power cycling my router, restarting my computer, etc. Nothing has seemed to work so far and I want to try and find out how to fix it. Not that it's preventing me from playing the game, but it's gotten quite irritating at this point.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can help me resolve this issue it would be appreciated.
