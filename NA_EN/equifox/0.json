The color palette is pretty good too.  My only complain is the outfit.  Way too much cleavage, way too short of skirt.   Just make it a standard kimono for crying out loud.  Or maybe a shorter kimono, like cut near the knees, like the male version, so she's not restricted in mobility, and some nice form fitting pants.\n\nI also agree that the silhouette may not look very Zyra when implemented.\n\nEDIT: If it wasnt clear, i was talking about how champs looked, not their actual ethnicity.  You should all know there is no Asia in the game.  I know that Ionia is thematically inspired by Asian culture, but no one from that region looks Asian to me.  Ahri is the only Asian-looking champ, or at least she was before her splash update.\n\nYou can continue to argue with me if you want but i dont care and wont reply as i no longer care about race representation.","replies":[{"poster":"Angel Violét","date":"2015-03-20T02:05:11.458+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=gatchi,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=OIWl3ZsH,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2015-03-20T01:22:02.795+0000)\n>\n>  (there are like no Asians in this game)\n\n\nLee Xin, Yasuo, Xin Zhao, WuKong.... they're crying","replies":[{"poster":"libraryseraph ","date":"2015-03-20T03:22:02.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"plus all the ninjas, ahri, syndra and irelia","replies":[{"poster":"Jamnon","date":"2015-03-21T08:01:04.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as we are being technical, The ninjas are Ionian.\n\nAhri is a Kumiho and therefore not human nor Asian.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylverost","date":"2015-04-28T04:59:23.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Almost everyone from Ionia is Asian.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamnon","date":"2015-04-29T23:25:48.987+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone from Ionia **appears **Asian.\nBut they are Ionian, not actually Asian.\nCause Ionia isn't real, and Asia is.\nSince that wasn't clear.","replies":[{"poster":"BarackOLlamas","date":"2015-05-20T22:46:01.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jamnon,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=OIWl3ZsH,comment-id=00050000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-29T23:25:48.987+0000)\n>\n> Everyone from Ionia **appears **Asian.\n> But they are Ionian, not actually Asian.\n> Cause Ionia isn't real, and Asia is.\n> Since that wasn't clear.\n\n*claps*","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cåracal","date":"2017-07-06T23:56:04.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with the outfit, the sleeves are great, I feel like the skirt and top are kinda killing it, I agree with the kimono, for reference I'd say search or watch some pretty accurate movies like memoirs of a geisha where things are pretty accurate.\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Japan-Kyoto-Geisha.jpg https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a1/7e/1a/a17e1a8bc0dc65392b5a1230e3ce4091--yukata-kimono-kimono-dress.jpg https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/59/8d/65/598d65c8c0b6ae9a0a5165115adbe929--kimono-geisha-kimono-japan.jpg\nBut something more like these (Still has the look but more of he kinda thing you'd see in the game and stuff) may be more suitable : \nhttps://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB152WKLVXXXXbrXXXXq6xXFXXXd/-font-b-Red-b-font-Cherry-Blossoms-font-b-Kimono-b-font-Dresses-Halloween-Heavy.jpg\nor\nhttps://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB14AN8IFXXXXaTXpXXq6xXFXXXV/Free-Shipping-Cherry-Blossoms-Women-Traditional-Japanese-Kimono-Lolita-Dress-Cosplay-Costume.jpg\n\nAlso it'd be nice to include the obi?
