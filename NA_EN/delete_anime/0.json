However, I also noticed how blind people are, and how simple math can be too complicated for many people. If you would like me to explain the BE system for you, here it is. We're gaining about the same about of BE now as we were gained IP before the change, and this is comparable through the disenchanting of shards. When you add the fact that we can obtain bonus BE, this further boosts the new system. When you also take into consideration the fact that you're gaining champion shards rather than pure BE which can then be used to get champions at a reduced price, this makes a dramatic different for people who are fine with unlocking champions randomly, or patiently waiting for the champion shard they want. For example, Shen is a 3150 champion. With his shard, I have the options to disenchant it for 630, or if i didn't own him, I could unlock him for 1890. That's a savings of 1260 compared to the original price, an opportunity that you wouldn't have had in the old system, and an opportunity that was less frequent with the loot system. Prior to the loot system in place, you either paid 3150, bought RP, or waited for a sale. Shards basically act as a personal sale that is randomly acquired and can be disenchanted for BE or used, rather than offered to everyone for a limited time. You can also take into consideration that you wouldn't get the 630 from disenchanting it, but still that's a savings of 630 in the overall price. If you were to look at a 6300 champion shard, that's double the savings. Every little bit saved can be put to use towards something else, and is thus a better system. And based on your previous post, you were comparing the amount of BE you needed to unlock a champion at its base price, and based on one of the least valuable shards. I noticed you were level 9, and that either means you're a smurf, or you're new and unaware of the different values between champions and shards. If you take the time and do the math to learn about the old systems and the current one, you'd realize that the current one favors newer players. This new system is less favorable for me personally, because I already own every champion and can no longer roll 3 shards to unlock the newest champion. When we were able to re-roll shards, this became the fastest and cheapest method of obtaining things we didn't already have. They realized that if we were able to re-roll shards for champions with their update, that everyone would be unlocking champions at an incredible rate, as we're being given many more champion shards, and it would have come to the point where much fewer people would even consider buying champions with RP.","replies":[{"poster":"Cälico","date":"2017-11-30T06:45:28.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_**However, I also noticed how blind people are, and how simple math can be too complicated for many people.

Well... you got a massive boost at level 5, and it's being balanced out. \n\nYou don't create an average based on 2 levels, the sample size is too small and your point that you're trying to make is therefore invalidated. If I were to follow your same logic, I would pull out the highest BE gain from a single level and throw an incredibly high BE gain rate at you. Obviously you'll see that it doesn't hold true when tested over a longer period of time. I wouldn't even waste my time calculating useless and biased statistics.","replies":[{"poster":"Cälico","date":"2017-11-30T19:49:04.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You honestly just proved how bad the system. \n20k BE over 30 lvls. is (3) 6300 champs with (1) 1350 champ.

If you choose to spend your earnings to unlock champions at full price, that's your own personal decision. You're being given an opportunity to make a better long term decision, or instant gratification. Don't complain after you've made your choice. With the same amount, you could unlock champion shards equivalent to 5x 6300 champions, 1x 1350 champion, 2x 450 champions, and have 62 leftover. This isn't even including any potential BE gain from other sources, such as randomly obtained from opening boxes, from keys and chests, and now even from the first win of the day. See how I would have gained about 40% more than you for the same amount? Would you be getting those 6300 champion shards while leveling up to 30? You'll get a few. It may not necessarily be exactly the ones you were targeting if you're a smurf looking for a specific champ. However, you'll be able to unlock 25x 1350 champs by the time you're level 30 using this method. If you want to unlock the cheaper champions, thats -1x of the 1350 champions, and +3x of the 450 champions. If you want to unlock a 3150 champion, that's -3x 1350 champions, and +1x 3150 champion. It's all about your personal choice and preferred playstyle. For a new player, that's quite amazing compared to the old system, assuming they recognized the deal as it's laid out for them.","replies":[{"poster":"Cälico","date":"2017-12-01T04:06:18.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like i said in my previous comment..... **_I can see your point about some people who are fine with getting random champs.
