And why they should be imprisoned.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":10,"down_votes":22,"body":"If we take a look at the past history of the world, one of the many causes of death has infact been starvation. In China as recently as 40 years ago during their great industrial revolution, over 45,000,000 people died from starvation.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-woaDniFQc\nEven today, people in less fortunate countries and even on our own soil struggle to find the nutrition necessary to sustain their bodies and live and happy, fulfilling life. On the opposite end of the spectrum, here in America we can see people that are so morbidly obese that they can't even walk. The landscapes are coated in an armada of fat people riding scooters at Walmart.\nhttp://www.hampoland.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/scooter-300x225.jpg\nhttp://img.4plebs.org/boards/tv/image/1397/06/1397060482075.jpg\nIn the latter image you can even see what appears to be a morbidly obese woman about to run down 2 innocent children with her scooter. The violence, and disregard for human life, the selfishness and contentedness of fat people is abhorent. \nhttp://i.ytimg.com/vi/Er1kTF3smOE/hqdefault.jpg\nhttp://www.kingdomcomputer.info/mykrobinsondotcom/wp-content/uploads/blogger/-8JlrVA49SPQ/UHRGU4HjGyI/AAAAAAAAAnE/AVCggI-h1J0/s1600/starving-children-africa.jpg\nhttp://vizfact.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/starving-child-4-e1325353895275.jpg\nhttp://iconicphotos.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/kevin-carter-vulture.jpg?w=700&amp;h=466\nBecause of the selfishness of fat people, all of the food is eaten and then none is left for those in life threatening situations. \"But wait noteventhatgood! It's not fat people's fault for eating all the food, its the supply chain's fault for not sending food to less fortunate places!\" WRONG. The supply chains that ship food to all areas of the world get their information similar to how office's get their funding. If you only spend 2,000 dollars in a fiscal year, the corporate funders will only give you 2,000 dollars next year, so the office spends more than they need to keep that extra funding. This is the same situation with the fatties. They eat all the food and then the food companies are tricked into thinking that there are more people in this area that need food. It's not their fault for doing this, its the fatties fault. This then leaves no food for the less fortunate areas with starving hoards of people that die on an hourly basis. While the fatties get their beauty sleep.\n\nSo what can be done to punish the vehement and obvious disregard for human life attributed by fat people? I propose imprisonment. Fat people should be placed in fat camps where they will perform vigorous labor until they have lost all of the weight they gained by being gluttonous slobs. The time they will remain will be based on how much weight they are over their approximate average BMI of their age group. This is a fair way to gauge the debt they owe to society, just how much damage the individual has caused to the world community as a whole, and how many lives they have put in geopardy because of their abhorrent disregard for human life.\n\nThis has been another quality thread, brought to you buy\nnoteventhatgood, signing out\nhttp://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x160/thebatusi/motivation_no_fat_chicks.jpg","replies":[]}
