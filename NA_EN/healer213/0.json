For me, normal ping is around 180-200ms. My internet was not out, my router was fine, and after pinging 208.76.153.129 and 216.52.241.54, I still came out with an average ping of 176-189ms ping times. \n\nAttempted to restart match to see if that would fix it. Didn't. Another player in my team had massive lag spikes around the same time and another couldn't stay connected for half the game. \n\nThere was an archived post from 2013 with the same issue being widespread. What is this?\n\nEDIT: Had no issues yesterday playing, but after patching today, these issues occurred. Possible patch issues?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-28T15:49:33.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your network is required to keep a consistent connection with the game server, or you could face input delays.  Your change in ping might be due to a weak connection causing some packet loss.  I suggest running a[ log reader ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader)to help figure out what's going wrong.  You will also see a list of resolutions specific to your case.

And the log reader you linked me to just told me to move closer to the router or try a wired connection. Another solution it gave was for me to switch servers, which is a great pain, as I live in Korea for the next two years. \n\nSo, aside from my living 6000 miles away from the server, are there any other solutions? As I said, until the newest patch, I had no issues playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-28T23:28:04.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For your specific issue then, it's likely that your routing is taking a very long way to our servers which will cause delays.
