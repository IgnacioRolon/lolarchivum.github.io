You recognize a problem, but rather than put in the time and effort to correct that problem or apply an appropriate method to handle it, you instead opt for the easier and short-sighted response of just cutting it off at the knees. Then, you tell anyone that has an issue with it that it was a \"hard decision, but deal with it.\" This isn't an unintended casualty due to an unforeseen issue with how the system was set up. This was a deliberate choice to frustrate the customer experience, break expectations, and lower the value of purchased services for the sake of making things easier for the design/coding teams.\n\nOf course, then you contradict this mentality with your precious Mission and Mastery systems giving me 10 popup notifications after every game that I have to individually address before I can queue again. So it seems you're only willing to put in the effort for the systems you care about.\n\nAnother poster suggested a simple \"experience bank\" that would keep track of overflow experience, but I would have gone a step further. Since you were already reworking the system and discovered this issue, you could have set things up in such a way that the game keeps track of an account's level while the player themselves could \"redeem\" their experience in their own time to claim level-up rewards. This lets players decide when they want to deal with the system while still allowing the account to reflect its level virtually, ensuring they're matched in-game appropriately.\n\nBut I guess that's asking too much, isn't it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GelsominoKiller","date":"2018-11-04T23:47:28.154+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"He used XP boosts (that are paid content) to get more XP and you capped it because of an **unspoken** (and pretty pointless) rule...

It's not about keeping you playing for longer because if you already  want to level to 30, it is assumed you want Ranked or to keep playing for longer.

I'm not talking about the presets. Presets allow you to actually play the game with a full rune page that, in all situations for the vast majority of champions, cover the most basic options for a wide variety of classes.\n\nEven if you're playing your champion suboptimally, Runes are actually quite a significant power budget for champions so it stands to reason Riot is not allowing you to go into a game without a single rune page equipped. And for the level 15 part, this allows you to actually learn about your given selection of rune pages as a new player instead of immediately being burdened to sink time into understanding a system you don't know how it even interacts with any of the champions - speaking from a new player standpoint.\n\nWhich means, the entire reworked runes and your profile experience is geared towards new player experience instead of smurfs who would just want to power through the leveling and stomp players who don't even understand the game yet.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"fattybob","date":"2018-11-05T19:46:11.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mortdog,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EYWd1mno,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-11-04T21:04:53.991+0000)\n>\n> So...I can&#x27;t check for sure from home, but judging on your account level and what happened, I have a guess.
