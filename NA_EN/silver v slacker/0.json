It shows that I have negative RP / less RP after buying a champion / skin when that is not the case, I previously had 1974 RP prior to purchasing the Demon Vi skin. Now it current displays as negative 729 RP. \n\nThe IP bug 2 months happened when I purchased Amumu for allegedly 450 IP but it charged me 1350 IP for it. I thought it was a visual error and thought nothing of it since I do not worry too much over IP. \n\nThe steps it seems to reproducing this bug (I hope it&#039;s not account specific) is:\n\n1) Purchase RP (Which I have not done in months)\n2) Purchase something from the store. (The in store difference calculator was correct for RP, strangely)\n3) Watch RP / IP counter closely.\n\nHere is a current screen shot of my balance / problem.\n\n**EDIT: It appears to fix itself with the correct RP balance (621 RP) after restarting the client. Still a worrisome / annoying bug.**","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-18T18:16:33.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Silver V Slacker,\n\nThanks for the report!
