Tried re-installing, running as admin, low spec mode, the clean boot thing, nothing.   \r\n\r\nWhenever I hit the cancel button while in que, the timer will stop, but the client will semi-freeze.  I can press other buttons, but it just makes the sound and doesn't actually take me to their destination (leaving me still on the que screen and forced to restart.)\r\n\r\nI've gotten a few \"Failed to connect\" pop-ups in the past, where it promps me to close the client.   So frustrating lol never had a problem with the old client :[\r\n\r\nI tried using a different account, and it \"kind of\" worked.  I got into a ranked game, but it froze in champ select after i picked my champ.  So I waited about 5-7 minutes or so, reset the client, and loaded into the game when it was 2:30~ or so in, just barely in time for the game to not get re-made.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-06T04:31:04.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having a hard time getting connected to your matches when the queue pops. It makes a little more sense that your network might be the main cause of the problem since you were able to get connected finally....only for it to disconnect you again in champ select. \n\nTry going through the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure we cover all our bases, but definitely let me know if those steps don't help!","replies":[]}]}
