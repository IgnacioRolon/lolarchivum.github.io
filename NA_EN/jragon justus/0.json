Here is a new spin on the watery little guy: he rides the lava with the aid of a trusty, obsidian staff and a fierce lava dragon.\n\n* **Q** - His \"Urchin Strike\" ability causes liquid/molten lava to flow around him. Fizz moves the same.\n* **W** - His \"Seastone Trident\" ability causes a glowing or fiery effect on the staff tip and a fire effect on opponents (hopefully different from ignite).\n* **E** - His \"Playful/Trickster\" ability uses lava particles instead of water and possibly a cracked lava ground effect. Fizz moves the same, however.\n* **R** - The bait Fizz uses during \"Churn the Waters\" is a lava eel. The pool effect could be made out of a lava texture that gradually cracks as the timer for the ability decreases. A giant dragon head bursts through!\n* The horns may need to use a scaled-down version of his tentacle animations so it appears his horns are more rigid. There shouldn't be any drastic movements on the horns since they're . . . well . . . horns.\n* He eats a lava eel (shown in one of the concept art pieces) for his fish-eating emote.\n* Some voicing will be needed to fit his lava theme.\n* He has a tail as part of this skin which will require some additional bones and animation. The added weight shouldn't change his animations . . . I would hope.\n* Volcanoes are said to \"fizz\" when they are about to erupt. Just a convenient little tidbit.\n* Name ideas include: Dragon Fizz, Fire Fizz, Lava Fizz, Infernal Fizz, Charred Fizz, Salamander Fizz, and Scorched Fizz.","replies":[{"poster":"ToughFluffs","date":"2014-10-07T14:15:20.078+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have to ask, did you make all those concept images?\nEither way, still think it's a great skin idea.

Funny story... the staff was made in a 3D modeling program. I pasted a rendered version of the staff in the splash art. At that point, I figured the lines were **too** sharp (I turned off edge blurriness aka oversampling), so I went over it with some traditional painting methods to get it to look less like a 3D render. I guess I overdid the conversion.
