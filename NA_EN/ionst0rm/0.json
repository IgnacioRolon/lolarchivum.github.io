Riot - If you feel the need to delete this thread, adhere to your own terms of service and notify me for the reasoning or have your legal team contact me directly to explain.\r\n\r\nBesides that, What would you do if you&#039;re playing adc (Lucian) with a Lux support against a Jhin/Vel.  We started the game off right with the lux standing at the tower insteading helping leash for the jungler.  Not gaining vision or positioning, just standing afk at tower.  Upon getting to lane late and losing 3 melee minions, I get there and lux is spamming her lvl 1 E at the waves instead of poking while vel is spamming hers at me.  I asked her politely to stop hitting the wave.  She continued to do this through the third wave forcing me to b from taking endless poke while they just zoned me off.  Push comes to shove, this continues for the first 10 minutes of the game and I got absolutely tired of it.  I started to flame this player after asking nicely.  I was a plat player the prior 2 seasons and now I&#039;m in silver elo (took 8 afks in promos to get brought back down to elo hell).  Was a support main but can play all roles at a gold 1 level.  ADC/Supp being ones i was playing in plat.  I continued to hard flame this player because she kept doing it after the team started flaming me for being down 60 cs at 18 minutes or so.  They don&#039;t realize an aggro lane like that you can&#039;t farm as a medium range while your own support is just screwing waves not allowing for last hitting and not poking opposing lane while they are free aggro.  Team ended up flaming me for being so far behind and why this Jhin was ahead so i flamed right back at them.  Explaining time and time again to watch this lux&#039;s play.  So here is my question to my fellow league players on what I should have done.\r\n\r\n1) Ignore this players behavior, end up losing the game from it being a 3v5 since both myself and lux would be useless, putting me in a position to be reported for intentional feeding which wouldn&#039;t have been the case but the automated system would record it as such giving me a ban.\r\n2) Afk out so my time is not wasted and i wouldn&#039;t have flamed this lux.  I also would have been reported for leaving the game.\r\n3) Flame this player since asking nicely wasn&#039;t doing it.  (This got me a 10game chat restriction which i feel is unjust).  \r\n4) Do nothing and keep playing which puts me in violation of terms of inting as being so far behind as a lucian with no support means i couldn&#039;t even farm safely under tower.  (Team refused to buy vision as well.  I was behind yet the only one trying to keep vision)\r\n5) Do nothing and report this player at the end of the game for something that is not reportable.  This player trolls like no other and is in no violation costing other players 20-30 minutes of their day and riot refuses to punish players like this forcing people like myself to get fed up and take it into our own hands. \r\n\r\nAgain Riot, If you feel the need to be embarrassed about how your poor matchmaking MMR system is along with not wanting your audience to see how you appeal to the masses and not addressing this trolling issue I need your legal team to contact me.  If this is taken down i will put it right back up as this is in no way shape or form a violation of your terms of service as i just read it top to bottom twice to make sure my last one wasn&#039;t at fault for it getting deleted.","replies":[{"poster":"DearPear","date":"2018-07-24T22:24:43.912+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ionst0rm,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=VzfJurYW,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-07-24T21:47:17.829+0000)\n>\n> 1) Ignore this players behavior, end up losing the game from it being a 3v5 since both myself and lux would be useless, **putting me in a position to be reported for intentional feeding which wouldn&amp;#039;t have been the case but the automated system would record it as such giving me a ban.**\n\nwtf?

How far are you into law school? Answer this question and I'll take your comment seriously. Are you an internet lawyer?\n\nI don't have to be a lawyer to understand the ToU. Infact, in the EU it is required for companies to make readable ToUs.\n\n> class actions and lawsuits that certain terms must be met from both parties.\n\nSure, if Riot has engaged in a contract with you, detailing certain terms they have to uphold, then they are legally bound to do so.\n\nProblem is, Riot has NOT engaded in a contract with you that states that they have to do anything. They don't have to give you a satisfiable service. They don't have to provide you with fair matches.\n\n---\n\n> Name any business at all where a consumer spend their time and money at a place of business and get sub par services when it can easily be corrected but they try to find the middle ground and punish players who get absolutely sick and tired of dealing with this.\n\nHighly subjective. You can't prove that Riot has sub-par service for what you paid for, because you haven't paid for any service. This is a free game. They aren't required to give you anything. Except if you purchase Riot Points, in which case they are legally bound to add Riot Points to your accounts. \n\n---\n\n> 100% it's not the second option. If riot wants to pair players of who are not of the same skill endlessly then we have a problem.\n\nWhat are you talking about.\n\nThe two options were:\n\n* The player stops trolling\n\n* The player start trolling even harder.\n\nThose options don't say anything about matchmaking, as even in a 100% fair matchmaking environment, those options would still be applicable. No matter how fair Riot goes, there will always be trolls and people having bad games.\n\n> If you truly do believe it's always the second option, what do you do when this is happening every third game at best if not every other game?\n\nI'm not going to pretend I know the actual statistics of your games, but I HIGHLY DOUBT you get trolls and bad players in every other/third game. You can tell me all you want that it's true, I just don't believe you. Those are unreasonable statistics, not based in fact, but in anecdotal evidence. Not only that, but these statistics come from your memory, and the human brain does not have a good track record of providing realistic statistics from anecdotal evidence, from memory.\n\nAnyway, I'll just mute and report. Because me flaming someone will literally only result in the problem getting worse.\n\n> Do you just quit the game and sacrifice your money? That's not a good investment in which case the consumer has all rights to be livid.\n\nI don't quit. And all money I've spent, I've spent with the full knowledge and agreement that all transactions are non-refundable. So did you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2018-07-25T04:50:14.754+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:267}} No post similar to this thread has been deleted on this account by any moderator unless you posted it on a different account.

No bullshit.  Coming from the words of a veteran and i hold my word to be true this is endless like this.  I've tried time and time again to get someone from riot to explain to me what's going on.  Only response i've gotten is the 50 +/- 1% pairing system which is a fabrication of the truth.  If this was any other business that has monetary gains, they'd be subject to civil litigation from a faulted product.  If this was one or twice a month i'd have no problems.  This is just too highly regular and needs to be addressed.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2018-07-24T22:29:32.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got my 2 week ban for the same thing.
