This I&#039;ve come to conclude from when riot revamped the q timers.  You can go from one game of a team fully understanding the macro play to the next team that will have players that cannot even get 3cs/m at the bare minimum let alone understand anything outside of kills and deaths.  I&#039;ve refused to buy anything else along with telling my friends don&#039;t buy shit from riot until they fix this system.    I would advise anyone else who sees what I see on a regular basis to hold off on buying anything from riot until this issue gets addressed.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-07-03T20:15:10.179+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Why riots losing players and money\n\n*citation needed*","replies":[]},{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2018-07-03T21:55:52.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure about the cause...
