What the 50 +/- 1% means is that if you go on a win streak you will be paired with sub par players to lose games keeping you towards the 50% mark for win percentage.  If you watch high elo players like Gosu who play off accounts lvl 30 for his viewers you&#039;ll see that in bronze/silver/gold you will only climb if riot allows you.  It&#039;s not a skill matchup.  You can win your lane outright every single game yet you&#039;ll be paired with an off lane player who has Sub 5cs/m.  One that doesn&#039;t understand the basic of macro to this game.","replies":[]}
