I do more supporting than anyone else\nCGIMKOS: nah fck it\nCGIMKOS: can ask yu the same blitz, all game u were away from bot, and once u were there u were focusing support\nCGIMKOS: when there is fight 2v2, and both of them attack me. while you attack support and i attack adc. they kill me fast and then kill\nCGIMKOS: if i am bad why u ping me now? carry the game since u know how to play it\nCGIMKOS: go ahead reprot me for not grouping with you. I am so gonna be banned for that &quot;reason&quot;\n\n\nWay to go Riot. I was verbally abused in that game multiple times and yet you punished me for &quot;Aggression&quot;?\nSo let me get it straight. I played a game, was verbally abused, blamed for loss multiple times because apparently i was not playing the way my team wanted me and now you give me the suspension. Hands down the best report system which rewards bullies and punishes victims.\n\n\nP.s. If you think I did not post all log. Here is a link http://imgur.com/a/4Roig\n\n\nYesterday (Sep 3) I submitted a ticket. Here is the answer:\n\nHey CGIMKOS,\n\nIt looks like you are upset towards your teammate in this game and you are pretty degrading towards them. If this was the first offense it wouldn't have resulted in a two week suspension, but as we have already given you two previous chat restrictions we felt the need to resort to a two week suspension in this case.\n\nBorrower\nRiot Games Player Support\n\nI sent another email, asking to clarify because that reply sounded way generic. Seems like they just copy pasting for everyone because there is certainly was no \"degrading\" towards single teammate.\n\nHello Borrower,\n\nCan you clarify and specify exact words which apparently considered \"upset towards your teammate\" and especially \"degrading towards them\" ?\n\n\"If this was the first offense it wouldn't have resulted in a two week suspension\" => I perfectly understand that first offence would not resulted in a 2 week suspension (as I also mentioned in my first email), but the problem here is that I can't understand how regular communication is considered an \"offense\".\n\nI will repeat again my question why do I receive 2 week suspension on a regular communication with a team ? Because I was not all inspiring and motivating? Is only \"positive thinking\" communication allowed? Teammates are not allowed to exchange thoughts anymore? Not a single rude word was used nor any communication had anything offensive. Are we now suppose to play only the way our team wants us to under fear that we will be otherwise suspended/banned?? Because clearly I got reported and apparently now suspended for not grouping with a team to do Baron (that caused all those reports)\n\nBy the way, the most confusing part here is \"upset toward your teammate\". Sorry if my teammate verbally abuses me and blames me for losing the game (although he was far from a good player himself), I suppose to be all happy? What if he really offended me and hurt my feelings and now I was all sad and depressed. But hey, don't worry, \"kind\" riot will give me 2 week suspension on top because that is the way Riot promotes bullying.\n\nP.S. I am not quite sure why do you guys even have a chat in a game. Just turn it off for everyone (leave only pings) because any communication according to your \"system\" somehow considered \"degrading\" and gives away bans and makes people stop playing for good.\n\nP.S.S Or may be it is the way for you guys make more money so you can ban accounts and make people start all over and spend money again?","replies":[{"poster":"Anomander","date":"2017-09-02T22:22:42.123+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like there is more to this then the \"logs\" you posted.
