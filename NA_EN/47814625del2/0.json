I don more supporting than anyone else\nCGIMKOS: nah fck it\nCGIMKOS: can ask yu the same blitz, all game u were away from bot, and once u were there u were focusing support\nCGIMKOS: when there is fight 2v2, and both of them attack me. while you attack support and i attack adc. they kill me fast and then kill\nCGIMKOS: if i am bad why u ping me now? carry the game since u know how to play it\nCGIMKOS: go ahead reprot me for not grouping with you. I am so gonna be banned for that &quot;reason&quot;\n\n[](https://imgur.com/a/4Roig#zUCUUuK)\n\n**I opened a ticket to ask why did I get suspension because it seemed extremely unfair. And here is what I got: \n**\n**EMAIL from SUPPORT:**\n\n_Hey CGIMKOS,\n\nIt looks like you are upset towards your teammate in this game and you are pretty degrading towards them. If this was the first offense it wouldn&#039;t have resulted in a two week suspension, but as we have already given you two previous chat restrictions we felt the need to resort to a two week suspension in this case.\n\nBorrower\nRiot Games Player Support_\n\n**My answer: **\n\n_Hello Borrower,\n\nCan you clarify and specify exact words which apparently considered &quot;upset towards your teammate&quot; and especially &quot;degrading towards them&quot; ?\n\n &quot;If this was the first offense it wouldn&#039;t have resulted in a two week suspension&quot; =&gt; I perfectly understand that first offence would not resulted in a 2 week suspension (as I also mentioned in my first email), but the problem here is that I can&#039;t understand how regular communication is considered an &quot;offense&quot;. \n\nI will repeat again my question why do I receive 2 week suspension on a regular communication with a team ? Because I was not all inspiring and motivating? Is only &quot;positive thinking&quot; communication allowed? Teammates are not allowed to exchange thoughts anymore? Not a single rude word was used nor any communication had anything offensive. Are we now suppose to play only the way our team wants us to under fear that we will be otherwise suspended/banned?? Because clearly I got reported and apparently now suspended for not grouping with a team to do Baron (that caused all those reports)\n\nBy the way, the most confusing part here is &quot;upset toward your teammate&quot;. Sorry if my teammate verbally abuses me and blames me for losing the game (although he was far from a good player himself), I suppose to be all happy? What if he really offended me and hurt my feelings and now I was all sad and depressed. But hey, don&#039;t worry, &quot;kind&quot; riot will give me 2 week suspension on top because that is the way Riot promotes bullying. \n\nP.S. I am not quite sure why do you guys even have a chat in a game. Just turn it off for everyone (leave only pings) because any communication according to your &quot;system&quot; somehow considered &quot;degrading&quot; and gives away bans and makes people stop playing for good. \n\nP.S.S Or may be it is the way for you guys make more money so you can ban accounts and make people start all over and spend money again? _\n\n**Email 2:**\n\n_&quot;lol way to focus support&quot; for starters, is making fun of your teammate for who they chose to focus (which is completely their choice).\n\n&quot;I don more supporting than anyone else&quot; is basically saying that your support is useless.\n\nThat being said, if there are no further questions I will be closing this ticket.\n\nBorrower\nRiot Games Player Support_\n\n**My Answer: **\n\n_We are far from closing this ticket. You just opened the door for quite a conversation. \n\n&quot;&quot;I don more supporting than anyone else&quot; is basically saying that your support is useless.&quot; - What I said is that I do too much supporting, MORE than ANYONE else (did not even relate to support teammate). It is funny how you took my words then &quot;assumed&quot; whatever was convenient for you just to justify your suspension &quot;system&quot; which is clearly not working right way. Player says &quot;right&quot; but Riot decided that word sounded like &quot;left&quot; so lets just give a suspension for that &lt;= that s pretty much what you just told me.\n\n&quot;&quot;lol way to focus support&quot; for starters, is making fun of your teammate for who they chose to focus (which is completely their choice)&quot; = &gt; I am not denying that it is his choice to focus support, that s why I didn&#039;t tell him &quot;STOP focusing support&quot; all i said it is funny that he focused support. So apparently laughing is a restriction in a game? May I ask than what are we allowed to do during the game? Seems like having fun we are not allowed but being upset/sad we are not allowed as well. What other &quot;hidden&quot; rules are there?  Apparently verbally abusing teammate is fine but word &quot;Lol&quot; is &quot;Degrading&quot; towards team. I can&#039;t actually believe that this is your justification for my suspension.\n\n\nP.S. I will make sure to post all this conversation on the forum so community will see how &quot;fair&quot; is your punishment system. Just more evidence that your system is focused not on cleaning community but generating more cash._\n\n\n**Conclusion: \n\nI don&#039;t know how about you but I am shocked with RIOT. \nTheir system is way far now from helping community to eliminate bad behaviour. It just gives bans for anything. \nWhat are your thoughts on that ? \n**","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-10-30T05:20:34.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Locking this post, due to its severely old age.\n\nIf you have any questions about this moderation, feel free to reach out to us in the [Boards Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification) or [Discuss the Boards](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-04T02:19:18.252+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"You spent the entire chat talking either about being tilted or being angry with your teammates for their actions.

If you **still** manage to be picked up as toxic by the system, then that's a pretty bad thing. In your case you chose to use the few messages that you do have available to send passive aggressive and sarcastic remarks to your team.\nTo try to adapt to your analogy: This is more like a cop stopping you for speeding and noticing that you don't even have a driver's license, because you had it revoked as a result of another speeding incident. You didn't even wait out the punishment that you were already given (which should actually limit your ability to committ offenses) before breaking the rules yet another time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Enzos","date":"2017-09-04T02:35:08.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Naw man you don't  need chat for that's why there is ping.\nYou use chat to give advice like not foucings sup on a ADC meat  unless its a {{champion:16}} or give poniters like how to gank when to gank at what time emmy back one etc. \nI don't use chat offent becus it just take time to type plus even if you ain't your like team is going to listen.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-04T03:30:39.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right - chat's for that kind of thing.\n\nBut people like OP who get punished again *before their chat restriction is even up* are not likely to be able to say things like that in a non-negative way.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-09-04T02:25:54.201+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> CGIMKOS: go ahead reprot me for not grouping with you.

Riot has created by far the most toxic game in the world. Not toxic in the sense that people can say bad things. Toxic in the sense that there is actually a reward system for bad behavior and a punishment system for communication that is deemed as \"degrading or unhelpful\" without a system of proving that it's actually degrading except a person's bias'ed judgement.\n\nThe fact is that. In at least 75% of the games i play on my smurf where players are FAR below my actual skill level. Someone disapproves of the way that I am playing the game. Sometimes this means flame, but most of the time it means they just play the game in a way that intentionally causes a disadvantage to their own team.\nSuicide bombing into 1v2/1v3 fights, actually trying to get kills even though it costs them their life 100% so not \"Intentional Feeding\"\nSpending large amounts of time in fountain or base at crucial point in the game where the other 9 players are all at the same place on map. \"good luck, i dont have to group... etc.\"\n\n AND THERE IS NO PUNISHMENT for afk farming side lanes for 15-30 minutes straight. Right? But they know by not helping ,they can tilt other players by making them waste excess energy and if they are even lucky.... the player with verbally harass and receive a punishment.

But the mute button doesn't stop the OTHER person from standing still and flaming you via chat while you need them to still be playing(even if it is just afk farming a jungle while you try to 4 man secure objectives). And it doesn't stop your other lanes from being distracted by those very same comments and losing morale. If they had no chat they definitely wouldn't be wasting all their time on it. As far as what i've read from the riot team in response to this it actually makes me lose faith in humanity. \n\nHow many professional players say degrading comments on interviews with the Riot team? How many riot commentators say things that would be rated as toxic by their own system of judging. I'm not 100% sure that if you typed a few lines of what a commentator said while you were waiting to respawn in fountain and had no opportunity to play, it would be brought back in chat log as \"Toxic\". How many high elo streamers say the most backhanded comments on their videos that are available to watch to the public INCLUDING small kids who are just starting to play. Will they favor a justice system for this or will they favor the attention that these comedians and others bring to the game.\n\n\nPlease just fix this HUGE double standard, \n\n(\"Ashe could have warded the tri-bush here but instead took an unnecessary risk trying to 1v2 at the dragon\") <---- commentary or criticism? You tell me... its a bannable comment and its somehow part of the commentary on a professional game. A reformed player is just someone who plays to the advantage of how to use the chat without actually being punished, while causing unmonitored amounts of pain and wasting huge amounts of time from the players who are actually giving 100% when they go in ranked games.
