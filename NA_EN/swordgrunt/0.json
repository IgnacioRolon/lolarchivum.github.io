The problem with this is, right now, you can cast it on yourself instantly (no cast time or action interruption), while if it does select a target, there is a brief animation throwing the metal shards on an ally.\n\nWhile this change is nice if you cast it on yourself by accident, removing the ability to instantly cast the spell is a huge downside in my opinion. It'd be a lot better if the cast time was outright removed.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-04-14T03:59:38.358+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're on a similar same page - Creeping Death's being changed to be instant cast on allies as well, not just on Morde himself.","replies":[{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-04-14T04:53:48.152+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aL3jkI9E,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-04-14T03:59:38.358+0000)\n>\n> We're on a similar same page - Creeping Death's being changed to be instant cast on allies as well, not just on Morde himself.\n\nHave you guys considered allowing Galio's W to work like Morde/Nunu W?
