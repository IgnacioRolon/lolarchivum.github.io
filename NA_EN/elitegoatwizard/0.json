AFKs are extremely common place in Bronze. I'm not saying I'm Gold, but I would be at least Bronze 3 easy, on my way to Silver instead of struggling in Bronze 5 if not for AFKs.

It is really useful for tanks and just doing the extra bit of damage to kill someone\n-For runes: Attack damage reds, Armour yellows, Mr scaling blues, and Crit damage quints. I take the quints since his passive lowers his crit dmg the runes bring it back up to a normal champion, and the others are for a bit more ad and defences. and for masteries I tale 18-12-0 with Warlord's because it has saved my life so many times!","replies":[{"poster":"DREADN0UGHT","date":"2016-05-13T04:36:43.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Haha yeah I was wondering if you would say garbage like ''Maxing W is key to success'' or something like that. \n\nJust random questions really.
