Wanted to intimate that most of the proposed solutions haven't resolved the issue for me. I am using a corporate laptop so don't have permissions to trigger updates.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, i strongly feel that its not righteous on your part abandoning players  who have been playing from so long and have spent money on store purchases. It's evident that your recent patch has rendered the game non-playable which **was working fine prior to the patch**. So its your mistake and you are accountable for it.\r\n\r\nI request you to either,\r\n1) Revert the changes\r\n2) Transfer the account to a different server, temporary or permanent. (I am fine to play on a different server) \r\n\r\nI am attaching the latest crash dump link.\r\nHoping for your cooperation.\r\n\r\nThanks &amp; Regards,","replies":[{"poster":"Inw√©","date":"2019-07-18T21:17:57.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello! I am currently having problems with this issue as well. I know this thread is about a year old now, but it started last night (7.17.2019) for me. It happened twice over the course of the night, during loading into the game, after champ select. It's frustrating because I have gotten a couple of leaves because of this, even though it's out of my control..","replies":[]},{"poster":"GGLoser1","date":"2019-03-05T20:26:19.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem today and I because of this I have lose in 3 ranking which remake...\nCan you provide some methods for help?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Bugcheck","date":"2018-06-22T23:47:50.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi zoopesh,\n\nThanks for the crash dump. I took a look at it and it seems like we have a fix available for your issue.
