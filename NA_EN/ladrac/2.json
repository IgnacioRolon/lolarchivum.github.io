If I remember good, the Black Cleaver will be 3500 gold instead of 3000. \r\nI think that the tanks will be less effective if the armor items won&#039;t be buffed, at least a little...with all this armor penetration and true damage the tanks will be useless. Also, I am afraid that we won&#039;t people that will play ap carry champions since the ap items were a little nerfed and the prices were raised. For me, it doesn&#039;t seems to make much sense, but maybe someone can explain me if you&#039;re not agree with my idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-02T11:39:21.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gold gain was increased, both in minions, a new item for AD champs that gives 1g per minion kill up to 100 minions and at 100 minions, you'll get a bonus 300g... That on top of shut downs starting at 2 kills, down from 3, shutdowns giving more gold as a whole, plus a majority of the AD items also got nerfed and upped in price with the tank and AP items...\n\nI feel like everyone completely ignores everything. All you guys see is 'OMG, NON-MARKSMAN GOT NERFED' when in reality, everything got nerfed. Everything costs more, everything took value hits, everything. IE lost 15 AD, Essence lost 15, BT lost 5 and became 200g more expensive, BotRK lost 2% current health and is 200g more expensive, Hydra got upped to 3.6k from 3.3k.... Everything got smacked. To complain 'OHMERGERD, MARKSMEN GOING TO BE SO OP, ALL MY NON-MARKSMEN STUFF GOT MORE PRICES OR A NERF'. Yeah. No.\n\nBetween gold gain going up and everything else going up in price on top of the fact that ADC's now having bad mid games if they get behind at all since their AD/lvl got hit like a freight train so they could get 5 more AD at level 1. Like Graves gained about 8 base, but lost 100 range and .8 AD per level, meaning after level 10, he's at a disadvantage. Corking gained 5, lost .5 per level. Cait gained 5, lost .8 per level.... etc. etc. All these AD Marksmen got slightly improved base AD's at level 1 with poor lategame base ADs. \n\nAnd armor items... Everytime I see this crap, it's like... It's like people are just stupid as hell. Tanks have about 90-100 base armor. The new LW and the 7% from Masteries ONLY AFFECT BONUS. Only the bonus. Not the base, only bonus. Bonus. Bonus. Bonus. From items. That's IT. No more touching your base. Your base gives you nearly 50% reduction by itself and the only way it's being reduced is by J4, Renekton, Wu, Vi, Kayle, Trundle, Urgot, or a Black Cleaver. Flat ArP can touch it, but you'd need 0 armor for that to happen. Of the mentioned champs, Renekton doesn't oftenly use a 50 fury double E, Trundle and Urgot are incredibly rare, and Kayle has been in a decline again after the devourer nerf. That leaves us with Vi, J4, Wu, and a Cleaver. Cleaver takes 5 hits to stack and ADC's aren't picking this up unless you have no armor at all. Vi takes 3 hits and she usually dives the back line, just like Wukong does. But even if we ignore all of this. That's ONE item and SEVEN champions out of over one hundred and twenty champions. That's it. \n\nY'all need to calm the hell down and buy Ninja Tabi plus a Randuin's in Preseason. You'll have 60 bonus armor on top of your 90-100 base and you'll reduce their AS by 15% on top of taking 10% less from their AA's and another 10% less when they crit and that's on top of already reducing their damage by about 60%, or if they manage to ignore all 60 of your armor, they'll still be dealing with about 50% from your base armor.","replies":[{"poster":"Ladrac","date":"2015-11-02T15:23:47.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, thank you for you answer.
