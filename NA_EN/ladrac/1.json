He can be a bit toxic tho as is has a really bad habit of taking most the kills, not that thats an issue to winning as a fed brand can really be a boon in teamfights, but that dont be surprised when you adc flames you 4/0/0 score in lane. \n\nMy advice is that UNLESS YOU GET AHEAD by a decent margin, i mean a really good early game, not just a kill or two, dont try to build into AP to much and focus more on CDR, MS, mana and basic support utility stuff. The exception is that L's Torment is suuuuper good on him when combined with his passive as that item alone with it means you will always do solid damage.\n\nOh and always get {{item:3303}}. The tick damage of your passive will give you all 3 triggers of it whenever you land anything, hell he may actually be a champ that can get decent results with full {{item:3092}} even.","replies":[{"poster":"Ladrac","date":"2015-10-28T16:33:05.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played Brand as support a few times and I enjoyed him, but the problem is, if I don't get ahead, I feel useless.

He's definitely not for everyone, but if nothing else I'd say to practice with him just to become more map aware.

Like Brand, he can proc spellthief 3 times with one ability. \nHis voidlings can block skillshots (and dance). \nIf you duo with a Quinn adc you can effectively prevent your opponent(s) from fighting back for 2 seconds (silence + blind). \nVoidlings can tank turrets for diving or pushing purposes. Your ult is pretty much a free kill. \nOnce you get rylai's you have a near perma-slow (4 second DoT = 5 second slow with E alone).\nYou have good base damage so ap isn't all that necessary.\nYour voidlings can tank dragon for easy early dragon kills.\n\nHowever, you have no escapes. You need to push to get mana back but the adc can still last hit the minions affected by your E. You have no hard cc pre-6.
