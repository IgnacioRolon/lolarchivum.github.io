So many times I hear these 12 year olds saying stuff like &quot;Aren&#039;t you like 20? Go get a job and life&quot; or something along those lines. Do they not understand that the people making the games they are playing are between the ages of 20-50 and I&#039;m sure there are some over 50. If people get to old to play games then you must think they can get to old to make them. You are never to old to play game or watch cartoons. If you are 30 and like watching Spongebob and playing WoW then enjoy them and have no shame.","replies":[{"poster":"4ManVotedAgainst","date":"2015-09-11T14:33:54.464+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aren't those people too young to be deciding how others should be making decisions ? =o","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serevas","date":"2015-09-11T13:37:43.882+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't realize that was still actually a mentality people had.
