It looks and feels so bad. I know he will never get a full VO cause he already has one but sadly it's $30. Seriously, he's as out of date as Urgot and Eve at least from a visual perspective.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-28T21:54:11.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bear slaps, man.","replies":[]}]}
