Of course they would, because it's televised.  It's immediately brought to their attention.  When it happens to any regular player they don't typically record it, send in a video which is watched by thousands of people, and then have it documented.\n\nSo, yeah if it happens during a recorded team fight they tend to notice lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Velasan","date":"2014-11-19T21:12:51.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get blocked by them that often, but I frequently get the stuttered run thing where my champion gets stuck on them moving up the lane.

I was playing {{champion:77}} VS {{champion:23}} and I couldn't do the old bear stance to tiger then bear and run out on him because I always got minion blocked hard and at points it got me killed a few times in our fights...

But now that I've just played Mao top, I gotta say I agree that minion blocking seems to be more of an issue than it was.  Maybe it's the new Mao model or a combination of Mao and the new minion models, but I had a hard time walking between and around my own minions in order to last hit.\n\nI haven't had a \"trapped\" issue yet, but I can see how it might be possible based on my melee laning experience so far.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AloneInTheCrowd","date":"2014-11-19T07:27:18.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":15,"body":"Looks like a l2p issue to me .","replies":[]}]}
