Do you know what else increases your DPS by 10% against a CC'd target? Talon's passive that everyone thinks is trash. Not saying Ashe's passive is bad, it obviously has the slow component too but it's really not a huge damage bump.\n\nAs for the \"for free\" part it's only down from 4 mana per second for a good Ashe, since you'd only toggle it on once every 2 attacks with over 1.3ish AS and once every 3 with 1.8ish.\n\nTo put that in perspective Ashe regens almost 3 mana a second at level 18.","replies":[{"poster":"Hypochondria9","date":"2015-06-22T15:14:23.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ashe's passive scales so it's 10% for a small portion of the game, unlike talon's.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-06-22T15:17:26.449+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's 10% all game, only the slow scales.\n\nThe damage scales with crit, but it's still only 10% higher than average DPS.\n\nTalon's DPS also scales up the same if you buy crit on him, it's actually slightly better because it's multiplicative in his case.","replies":[{"poster":"biomaster","date":"2015-06-23T02:32:11.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no it actually scales with crit. \nWhat this means is that the crit multiplier will actually scale with more crit you get.
