That doesn't happen often, I'd imagine, but when it does, it is rage inducing. Fizz is the kind of champion that just makes you feel bad to play against him.\n\nYou can't really go on the offensive because he can easily dodge everything and punish you heavily for it. The best strat against Fizz is to stay away, harass safely and make him lose CS, which is both risky depending on the junglers and more importantly highly unsatisfying. It doesn't matter that I know I've won lane really hard when Fizz is 40 cs and a level behind, it was an excruciating experience because the whole time I had to be paranoid about every single move I make or else I feed him a kill and likely the game. Compare that to laning against an Orianna for example. Sure, if she gets a lead she can bully you harder, but if she messes up, she can be killed easily. She is punishable and it's possible to get a lead on her eventually. A kill given to an Ori doesn't feel nearly as depressing as a kill given to Fizz. The first is more of a ''Shit, I messed up'' or ''Wow, she played that well'', whereas the latter is probably more ''Wtf is this bullshit champion, great now I'll die every time I walk into lane''.\n\nI'm not arguing against what you said, it's very true, all I'm saying is that the perception of Fizz's balance state and the reality are two vastly different things and I'm not sure the former should be dismissed so quickly.

Save your CC for after he's used his pole if you're really having issues. The CD is long enough and he's squishy enough that you're going to catch him if you aim it right. \n\nHe's _strong_ yes, but Fizz is not OP. He's still squishy. He's still got abhorrent mana costs. Without E up (which he has to use for waveclear or if he wants to push) he is pretty damn easy to catch with CC. Try playing a tankier champion who can fight Fizz like one of the Juggernauts.

Yes, his mana costs are high, that is why you start flask. It will take care of that issue until his base mana is high enough to make it a mute point.\n\nSitting under Fizz's pole is about all you can do. It has enough range that he is going to hit you no matter what you do. The CC will work if you have hard CC to lock him down and then also have enough damage to make the trade somewhat even. He is always hard to catch even with his E on CD since his Q is a dash. The Juggernauts would work, but they are all probably getting nerfed next patch.

If you _must_ do this, at least have an appreciable amount of MR to negate the burst he gets from it. Friendly reminder that without his E, he has next to no escape and is so squishy that you'll likely destroy him in a straight up fight if you have any appreciable tank stats.\n\n-Q is a dash, sure, but it's a targeted enemy-only dash much like Irelia. Note where he's likely to take his path and play around it (e.g. he jumps in with E, out with Q so make the direction he has to Q a bad one)\n\n-Flask, as many have pointed out, doesn't negate his mana costs in laning terribly much. It still takes half to a third of his mana early game in order to do a full combo sans ult. The only way he gets \"enough mana for it not to be an issue\" is by buying mana (Frozen Heart, Sheen) which still leaves him without pushing power unless he uses his most expensive skill and also his escape: E.\n\n-Play passive and freeze towards yourself. Nothing more irritating than this as Fizz because his melee means he has to recklessly endanger himself to grab farm that may be stuck under your turret if you've frozen far enough back. Plus, as great as his E is for an escape, it's not the full top-lane's worth of escape if your jungler has an iota of patience for him to overextend for that farm.\n\nThere's quite a bit you can do against Bruiser Fizz if you look for the openings. Again: he's strong, but not OP, especially with the new Juggernaut items that have made his mobility and some of his burst a moot point. Surprisingly one of the biggest counters I've faced is one of the most simple: Volibear. His W has a massive burst that absolutely destroys Fizz, he can build health and Juggernaut items to tank up and get damage at the same time, has the powerful slow on E and Q flip to catch Fizz before/after he poles and his passive means he defacto wins any all-in trade so long as it's up and Fizz didn't get a Morello (which why would you on Bruiser Fizz?).\n\nHope this helps you deal with the Trollfish in the mean time.

Same goes for Fizz here: he has to secure a lead early in order to start a snowball that he can use to stay relevant. In a 5v5 fight, most of the time Bruiser Fizz is very, very weak because even with the tank items, he's just another bruiser who tries to dive in and kill a carry and praying that he can do it in time before the tankiness he's built up is breached.

Problem is, Fizz still lacks the innate tankiness to be very good in a full 5v5 teamfight. \n\nAs I've said before: his mobility and damage types are _great_ 1v1 or 2v1, but much more than that there's just too many people and too much _stuff_ to dodge it becomes a moot point you dodged the Morg Q because there's 4 other people waiting for you and you can perhaps take down one of them before you succumb to the numbers (assuming you've not already snowballed to 20/1/5 for some reason, but even then: it's difficult).\n\nFizz has a very difficult problem of falling behind if he doesn't get ahead in lane because then he's just a squishy guy with not enough damage to win an all-in. Sure if he goes to a sidelane when everyone else is roaming about and farms up he can come back (_just like every champion can do this_) but this is the issue of Fizz: he's reliant on a strong early/mid to be useful late. Enter Bruiserfizz who can splitpush well instead of being an assassin with a questionable late-game.\n\nFurther, as I said before, Bruiser Fizz is like Riven: he gets ahead he's going to snowball pretty hard unless he makes a pretty bad mistake. You ever see a Riven give up first blood? I'd bet you that about 70% of the time those Rivens will be come next-to-useless the rest of the game because they've fallen behind. Same applies to Fizz, but without the AD-scaling shield and instead of brief invulnerability period that costs him a large chunk of his mana bar, especially early.\n\nYou're right that he's sometimes difficult to catch/escape. If you're a tanky sort of champ you know what item absolutely negates that problem? {{item:3742}} Plus, remember that Bruiser Fizz relies on an initial burst to get the %health damage rolling and can't just 100-0 you unless he's _very_ far ahead. Because of this, you can hide under a tower because you know it's going to take him a bit to actually finish you off as he's not AP Assassin lolburst (who has his own set of problems). \n\nAgain: try learning to play it yourself. Learn the mindset you adapt and think about what other people do to counter your early aggressive playstyle. Use that playstyle to defeat other top Fizzes. Learn the points when you feel weak versus the points when you feel strong; learn to play around those when you're against him. This works for _every_ champion in the game and is essential for becoming a better League player.
