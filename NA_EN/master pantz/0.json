Then from the start of the match he kept eating teammates and not letting them leave the base and would follow them if they teleported and then take them into harms way throwing them under towers or into multiple enemies. He continued this the whole match. All the while, taunting teammates in all chat that he was taking them hostage.\r\n\r\nI know there is a reporting system but for something this vile maybe some direct intervention can be done?\r\n\r\nI'm guessing not, but if anyone deserves to be instantly banned it was this guy.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-14T20:42:15.871+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh SNAP, yea that's definitely not cool. I know you're looking for a more direct way to make sure this guy doesn't troll like that anymore, but do make sure to report people when this happens. It's the best way to officially report them, and that way the game is logged as well for reference.","replies":[{"poster":"Master Pantz","date":"2017-08-15T01:09:46.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I believe most of my team did report him after the match. I doubt many of the other team took the time as they were taunting us during the match about it too.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kingpixels","date":"2017-08-14T11:53:29.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well,dont be a tryhard i bet it was fun xDDDD what champion did u play why didnt u just go the opposite lane of him? xDDD","replies":[{"poster":"Master Pantz","date":"2017-08-14T12:32:17.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was not fun or funny. He built all items for speed to chase me and other teammates down, if we teleported he would follow with his own teleport.\n\nPlease don't say that you bet it was fun because it was similar to what terrorists and psychopaths do in real life. Not funny one bit.","replies":[]}]}]}
