Anyway, till I save enough for it ( which will take long ) I would be forced to play on my sister laptop, on top of that, i also moved back to a city after a 6 months on a day my motherboard died ( probably related as we had to travel in car and it was very bumpy ) . So , would changing PC and LOCATION I play from risk my account , or is it totaly ok to play ? I am just shit scared because I recently read a lot of old \"threads\" where people got ban for things that acctualy are similar as this..\n\nUpdate: Somehow, my motherboard came back alive today but with half of \"ports\" for USB dead + fan is dead.. Anyway, i will be back on my PC now so its not big deal anymore i guess, i played only 1 game from my sister laptop and FPS is terrible -.-\" .. ","replies":[]}
