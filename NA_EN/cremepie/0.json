What if for say 500-1000 additional gold it was given an additional passive that negated all lifesteal done off said champion with it? Also since Thornmail is so cheap, ramping up its price seems like it would be easily an okay 3rd or 4th item.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-07-22T21:51:35.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's only useless because its not a must build item for anyone.
