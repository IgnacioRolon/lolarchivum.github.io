After I started thinking this loading is taking a long time I alt+tab and i get a message you have been placed in low priority due to too many disconnects. This was going to be the first game of the day for me now i have do wait 20min to even get into a game because my client crashed. I have never had so many issues until patch 6.17 came out, I have been playing this game since season 3 and I am getting annoyed with the client crashing and I have put so much time and money into this game that I dont want to quit playing but if this keeps up I cant spend 6-7 hours playing to get through these queue times. Riot fix your client during the loading screens. \n\nLINK FOR MY GAME AFTER I WAITED THE 20min q time.
