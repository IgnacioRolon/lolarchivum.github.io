Snowball isnt that great if you have a frontline doing their job compared to the damage poke can put out, especially if one of the pokes is an adc like ashe who can take towers before renekton gets the 3+ items to be relevant.\n\nNot to mention shojin makes them irrelevant for longer, as its not defensive enough to deal with the constant abuse youre forced to take.
