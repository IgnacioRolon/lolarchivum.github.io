Obviously that didn’t happen, that’s fine, plans change,  its more than a little weird though that there was never an announcement about the delay/removal of the wards from Snowdown nor has there been a new release date or eta for the missing wards. Now I’m sitting here with my battlecast skarner skin, my battlecast poro icon… and no battlecast poro ward.   \r\nAn update would be appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-03T17:56:36.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The Battlecast and Dragonslayer poro wards will still be coming out!
