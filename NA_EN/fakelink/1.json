Whats a good route?  right now i'm going smite krug (to get me some stun), wolves, red buff with smite.  I then kind of have too go back cause I down to 35%-ish health.  When I go out I decide where i'm going to gank first after getting blue.\r\n\r\nunfortunately the new patch made my krug start worse and my build path into rangers-devourer slightly lacking in dmg (the -24 dmg start means 12 less stacks...)  \r\n\r\nany tips would be greatly appreciated.\r\n(but I'm sticking with the bug)","replies":[{"poster":"Xenivid","date":"2014-12-13T06:06:07.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're starting Krug I wouldn't smite it, get a hard leash from your team then smite the red buff for HP. If you're starting blue do Gwomp (instant smite) -> Blue - Go apply pressure in mid @ level 2 -> red (Smite) -> Birds -> Back. Krug start can do the same at level 2 with the hp from smiting red. Pressuring mid at level 2 can impact their trades and gives you something to do while waiting for smite. Just don't over commit and lose a ton of HP.\n\nAlso if you want my honest opinion, attack speed runes do give you a better clear time and early clear but I prefer hybrid pen and running devourer/ibg for mixed damage. It makes your damage a lot more effective. You already get attack speed from Q and once you buy the devourer enchant you have plenty.\n\nTry **page 18** of this guys masteries.\n\nhttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/19881925#masteries\n\nOn that note you can run any marks you want (AD/AS/HyPen) and they all \"work\" because they're all relevant stats.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fakelink","date":"2014-12-12T15:59:13.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks guys, someone asked what  my runes and masterys were and I'm following this guys guide except i only have 3 of the attack speed marks ( I have the rest of the Runes).\n[](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/skarner-s5-devourer-beathes-life-into-our-crystaline-friend-403819) \n\nany tips on attacking camps in general?  right now I just right click on the largest guy in the camp and wwqqwqwqwq in some order, should I be moving while i am attacking?\n\nps. had first game yesterday and it went pretty well (we one 4 v 5 as our reksai top quit)  here is the matchhistory\n\n[](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1661913582/211340399?tab=builds) \n\nThanks!\n\nedit: err hyperlinks were not working but the build is the top build from mobafire names \"skarner-s5-devourer-beathes-life-into-our-crystaline-friend\"\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrSc0tty","date":"2014-12-12T12:41:40.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I almost always start gromp with low damage high tank junglers. Smite gromp do wolves smite red then look for a gank or clear Krugs then back for a trailblazer. \n\nSkarner tips:\n\n-Skarner is the best sheen builder in the game. I personally very much prefer Trinity but some people love frozen fist. I usually build Sheen, Phage, finish juggernaut then finish Trinity into a full tank build. \n\n-Remember to trigger your shield before attacking a camp to speed boost into it. \n\n-dry ults are never better than stacked ults. Remember you can add a good amount of extra burst by landing EQ then ulting as opposed to just ulting. \n\n-Amateur Skarners love the ult+drag enemy but I almost always use it just to lock down and attack unless I'm way ahead of my team. If I burst an enemy down and wind up closer to the enemy team after, then I'm not just an ult bot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2014-12-12T05:42:26.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huh, that's weird, I do the same you do, Krugs-Wolves-Red, but I can also clear blue and gromp afterwards, what are your masteries?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Applesaucey","date":"2014-12-12T05:38:42.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"path largely depends on your jungler and what side your playing on. But for skarner i would highly suggest starting gromp with smite. then take blue then got o red smite should be back up.
