A couple of months ago, I decided to take a look around the shop and finally found one of the most prominent features of the whole game : skins. I really wanted to get one(despite only being a cosmetic) but didn&#039;t have the RP. After asking some people, I learned that RP is a currency that is bought with real money and is usable for pretty much anything in the shop. After this, I thought that it was depressing that only people that had extra money could get such glorious skins(Project: Ashe is the best) and wanted to see if there are other people who find this to be annoying. \n\n I also want to ask if there could possibly be a way for Riot to add a way to transfer IP into RP so then all players can get a skin or two after they work hard for a skin rather than just buying it.\n\nEdit:I forgot about hex tech crafting >.<\nI feel like an idiot","replies":[{"poster":"Azure Hamster","date":"2017-05-30T19:23:41.217+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"People can already get skins free through the loot system.\n\n{{champion:51}}","replies":[{"poster":"derpychocolate21","date":"2017-05-31T06:29:15.813+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally didn't forget about that :D","replies":[{"poster":"Azure Hamster","date":"2017-06-01T18:26:31.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=derpychocolate21,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Lpyw15xk,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2017-05-31T06:29:15.813+0000)\n>\n> I totally didn&#x27;t forget about that :D\n\n:D happens to everybody one time or another.\n\n{{champion:51}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-05-30T19:24:12.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"when you don't understand hextech exist which gives you free skins and champs for playing the game","replies":[{"poster":"derpychocolate21","date":"2017-05-31T06:31:34.727+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You see, I am very dumb so I forgot that whole system :p\n\n\nThanks for wasting your time on me :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-05-30T19:30:22.639+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can get skins through boxes, up to 4 per month, and they're 100% free.

All you need to do is being in a premade with somebody who got an S and be using a champion that you own and haven't gotten a box for yet.\n\nI really don't play too many champs well enough to get Ss, but I'm good enough with with Jinx, Zyra and Akali that I'll consistently get an S about once evey 3 games or so. And I have a friend that can usually get Ss with Ahri and Teemo, so what we do is I'll play a few games with her as Zyra or Akali while she plays with champs she hasn't gotten boxes for, and then we'll switch and she'll be in charge with getting the S while I'll play the champs I'm not good with. That way we're always maxing out our boxes somewhat easily.","replies":[{"poster":"derpychocolate21","date":"2017-05-31T16:17:26.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will you play with me?
