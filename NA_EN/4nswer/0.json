Now I'm afraid that the balance team has ruined the game so bad that I would rather eat myself to death with the stuff.\r\n\r\nAnd don't get me started on the skins and lore teams.  All this nonsense about complex character development, building different universes, and creating an ongoing story.  When will they get it through their heads that WE JUST WANT GARLIC BREAD.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-04-22T01:25:45.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Balance/gameplay and lore/story have no connects to eachother, though..?","replies":[{"poster":"PermaJinxed","date":"2019-04-22T03:52:20.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=m2XJelid,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-04-22T01:25:45.083+0000)\n>\n> Balance/gameplay and lore/story have no connects to eachother, though..?\n\nHe never linked the two other than to say both are annoying.... I'm so-so on lore.  Some I dislike, some I love.... There's something about Eve's redone/completed lore that draws me in.... I think they simultaneously made Varus and Annie worse by taking the sadder parts of Varus's lore and dropping then on Annie..... Now Varus is an \"us vs them\" trope instead of being as tragic and Annie is straight insane.......","replies":[]}]}]}
