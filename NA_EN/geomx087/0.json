This causes some unrealistic performance expectations from them, and encourages them to be negative and toxic towards me. \r\n\r\nI understand that players are toxic already, but giving them extra weapons to attack me its just uncalled for.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how I can turn off this feature, so my own team cannot see this information, thus lowering their expectations and allowing me to enjoy a peaceful game.\r\n\r\nThanks. \r\n\r\nTL; DR : How do i hide champion mastery points from my team? They toxic af after i make a small mistake because my mastery is very high.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-07-20T16:10:48.175+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in media, it's not the case for old forum threads.

Sadly there is no way to hide loading screen stats. I would like this to become a bigger discussion and hopefully Riot can implement a way to hide mastery points. I completely agree with everything you stated. A friend of mine is having trouble enjoying playing her 1 favorite champ in a NORMALS DRAFT PICK, not ranked. She only plays one champ and has an insane amount of points on it. We only play Draft Pick and often run into very negative and toxic players that has always something to say about her mastery points. It hurts me seeing my friend being discouraged and hurt when she's just trying to have a chill game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UltrLord","date":"2019-02-21T19:50:48.063+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like riot is trying to encourage toxicity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AJStarhiker","date":"2019-02-15T18:50:05.952+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree.

I know I'm guilty of that as a support player vs an ADC like that.\n\nSeeing the rank is fine.... but seeing the points can sometimes easily show if someones not too good with a certain champ.","replies":[{"poster":"GeoMx087","date":"2019-02-15T04:41:11.778+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"never had a problem with people being EXTRA toxic since this was implemented.

With my 450k mastery on anivia, I'm always expecting some smart ass to comment asking how I can be so bad on a champ I've played so much lol. Hasn't happened yet. I think for now, just laugh at yourself. Don't take skill at league so seriously. Be secure with yourself and know that you aren't a league God, and neither are they. If they make a rude comment, mute and report like you would if that feature didn't exist.\n\nI personally like being able to see their masteries and do not want it to be optional. I will make sure to always be here to argue against it. I love it. Just don't be so insecure worrying about other people's expectations of you. It's just a video game. If you suck, it literally changes nothing about your life.
