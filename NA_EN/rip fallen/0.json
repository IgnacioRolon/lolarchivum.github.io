H","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello all,\r\nI have been struggling for a week trying to resolve this issue and I cant figure it out. \r\nThe problem: I launch league and login into the client normally, at this point everything is OK. Upon queing up for a match in ANY gamemode the que time is endless and I cannot exit the que. I have to exit the whole client and in order to get the launcher to run correctly I have to restart my comp. \r\n_Things I have done_\r\n- Re downloaded and installed twice\r\n- Ran tracert with all good pings\r\n- Ran the hextech repair tool\r\n- Disabled firewall\r\n- Updated all drivers \r\n- Submitted ticket to RIOT\r\n\r\nI do believe this has to do with my internet because none of my steam games will connect to matches either. It it weird i have no packet loss.

I've seen this happen a lot when firewalls or antivirus' get a little too excited about doing their job, and we probably just need to adjust their settings really quickly. These steps are a little lengthy, but please make sure to troubleshoot using this guide-> [**Troubleshooting Firewalls**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq3).","replies":[{"poster":"Rip Fallen","date":"2018-01-18T01:58:14.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Broporo,\nI have followed the firewall guide and completed each step, unfortunately I am getting the same result. \n- I have turned off the private and public firewall on my PC\n- Since its a new build I have not installed a 3rd party firewall/antivirus\n- I even turned off my router firewall to gain the same result. \n\nDo you think that having the wrong network adapters would contribute to this problem? I can surf some websites fine but others will not load. I have posted on steam, tripwire (rising storm 2 forum) and CS GO forums and it seems not alot of people have ideas on whats going on!\n\nI appreciate this time!","replies":[]}]}]}
