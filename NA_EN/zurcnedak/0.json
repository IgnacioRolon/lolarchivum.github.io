Id start a game with 120-180 frames and then whenever I would see an enemy champion or minion the games fps goes down to 30 and freezes occasionally. During mid game the game is unplayable, I have less then 15 frames and game freezes every 5 seconds.\r\nDid anyone else have this same problem and come up with a fix? If so I would like to know what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-24T23:42:30.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've noticed some players started having fps issues again after certain windows updates, and I'd like to have you check to make sure the Game DVR bar wasn't re-enabled automatically again. Make sure it's still turned off, as well as any other intensive programs like Discord (disable it's overlay) or Razr Synapse.
