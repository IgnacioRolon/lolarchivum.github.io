For example last year, we had 2 ADC skins because both Sivir and Kalista were very important in the Solo Queue and Professional scenes. So based on which champions have been very defined in the meta this year so far, who do you guys, the community, think the new &quot;Victorious&quot; and &quot;Championship&quot; skins will be for.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-07-24T03:57:25.191+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bard, because then we can get the worlds theme played by bard.","replies":[{"poster":"DwarvenGiant","date":"2016-07-24T15:09:18.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my, I didn't realize how awesome such a thing could be.\nI need it now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-07-24T12:06:26.513+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Viktorious Viktor.\n\nDo it for the Pun's sake","replies":[{"poster":"Rito Staff","date":"2016-07-24T12:36:15.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"V for Viktorious Viktor.

I just don't think he'll get it between Riot already working on the SKT skin for him (I know esports skins aren't supposed to count for priority but the skins team IS human and will have bias.)\n\nEDIT: formatting","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustMonika13","date":"2016-07-24T15:12:25.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im guessing between Kindred, Viktor, Azir, and maybe Vladimir.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2016-07-24T13:18:27.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are no words for what a gigantic service it would be for Noxus fans if Victorious Swain becomes reality.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rito Staff","date":"2016-07-24T12:35:11.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I vote Yorick.","replies":[]}]}
