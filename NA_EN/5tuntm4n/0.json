I checked Google and my internet was working just fine, though I had to disconnect to see if I could rejoin. Then it took me back to the client without the option to reconnect. I don't see it on my match history, what happened??","replies":[{"poster":"Zecheris","date":"2017-07-07T17:33:15.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has just happened to me as well I got  I got attempting to reconnect so I minimized league and seen i still had internet, opened Firefox and it worked went back to league and still attempting to reconnect so I force quit and re-open league and no option to reconnect","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-06T21:52:31.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a decent chance that the game you were in had some type of bug and completely crashed. It's pretty rare, but if you weren't given the option to reconnect at all then you're free to queue to for other matches. No one in that match should get any kind of penalties since they weren't able to reconnect due to the game not being active any longer.","replies":[]}]}
