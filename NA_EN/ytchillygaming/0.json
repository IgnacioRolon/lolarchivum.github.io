Did you run into any errors and are you on wifi?  Something could be causing a hiccup with your connection to the patching service, so it's skipping files and failing to go back.  Let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"YTChillyGaming","date":"2018-01-04T01:49:18.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was on wifi and didn't run any errors. It shows this tutorial tab and it says,\"Please wait for the game to finish installing before playing the tutorial. In the meantime, you may learn more about league of legends here.\" Still hasn't downloaded :(. I think the problem is that it isn't patching correctly since I checked the files in league and it doesn't have the patch one. It also says that it restored it to an older version and is going to try and patch it to the newest version. The only thing I don't understand is why it isn't working since I'm connected to wifi. It might be because I closed out of the PC but I had it going for probably about 5 hours straight :/.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ã…HFN","date":"2018-03-04T18:19:19.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am downloading the game and while i waiting  for starting the pach update it shows me bug splat.Has got anyone else this problem?If anyone know how to solve that pls answer me  to this coment!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"YTChillyGaming","date":"2018-01-04T22:30:47.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still hasn't downloaded :l","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-04T22:48:09.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, no worries, let's take a closer look and find out what's happening.
