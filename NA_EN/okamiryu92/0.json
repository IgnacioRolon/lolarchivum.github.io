I don&#039;t think hardly anyone is happy with the new system.

That time has been easily pushed out to minimum 120 minutes, and last night I was on for 150 mins for two games. They were admittedly long games, but the champ select takes sooo long to get started typically because people don't pass the AFK check, and then someone forgets to lock in their pick and we have to do the whole thing over again! \n\nTeam builder avoided all these problems; it's only downside was that at times you would have the same champs selected on both teams but that was a small price to pay for a prompt start. \n\nBring back team builder.
