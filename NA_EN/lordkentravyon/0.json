End of the day this is same end result for adc but a nerf to anyone who would buy just an IE (some bruisers assassins) \nor those that would want IE and specifically NOT a PD\n\nSome examples would be \n\nTalon - this guy got hurt with the silence nerf,  but when playing him a combination of Youmou + IE is solid the active for closing in on people, the combined crit chance and damage for taking out targets, the crit damage and the armor pen make a nice little combo for him. New PD does nto fit in there nicely so just a damage nerf there.\n\nGangplank - the good ol tri+ie+shiv core is great on him  the guy can be scary to squshies but isn't in the best place right now overall, for the one who is probably most reliant on crit the nerf hurts.  PD just doesn't work as  well on him. GP loves the on hit proc from shiv and the gold building in avarice for a bit of a bank route is great.  \n\nother effected champs include, trynd, yi, etc... melee champs who favor damage\n\n\n\nEDIT\n5% crit chance is being moved from IE to PD","replies":[{"poster":"Hawkefire","date":"2015-01-13T02:03:30.644+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should just change how crit works.

What it led to, though, was abusing the system by putting 1% crit chance in runes, which the PRNG makes into more than 1%.\n\nThe easy way would be replacing crit with \"+X% autoattack damage\", but one argument against it is that it would make ADC's damage a little bit too stable and reliable. Crits aren't a problem in teamfights at all. All we need is to remove them from lane, and IE nerf is doing only half of the job (nerfing the IE rush).\n\nWhat should happen (IF we're not removing crit altogether):\n\n* **remove crit from lane**\n * no crit runes\n * no Brawler's Gloves (Zeal is dagger+dagger)\n * no Avarice Blade\n* **critical strikes should deal less damage**, and be a tiny bit more frequent - so it's not \"huge spike out of nowhere\", but standard AA variance\n * +50%-75% total AD on crit?\n * OR +100% base AD (just like Spellblade. Sheen effect could be as well changed to \"Your next basic attack crits\") - that one would differentiate between AD builds and AS-crit builds\n * IE would bring crit back to +100% total AD, and not +150%\n * Alternatives to IE: Triforce (+200% base AD), Lichbane (+50% AP) et caetera\n* tweak all ADC items around on-crit effects (like Statikk Shiv) with higher chance of crit, but less damage\n * \"carry item\" would be more or less synonymous with \"scales with crit\"\n * items wouldn't need to provide crit to scale with it - you'd rush a crit-scaling item, and then get stronger with 2nd item that has crit\n* Crit effects don't have to be 200% damage, example effects:\n * 4 bolts from Hurricane\n * Statikk Shiv procs on crits for less damage, fully charged passive guarantees you a crit on your next attack\n * BotRK (without the damned active, by the way): on-hit 6% hp, crit 10% hp (currently: 8% hp on hit)\n * Phantom Dancer granting extra MS or AS on crit (much like the Frenzy mastery)\n * some new items for the fun of it\n\nAnd so on. That could make crit a more fun and less obnoxious build. And please don't tell me that ADC damage output has to be 100% stable.

For instance the crit from the IE components is bought last and it's horrible to buy it first or second because it's underwhelming and unless your really really lucky it won't do anything for you.

They have a boring laning phase. (remember renekton and shyvana in the LCS?) \nTanks even though they only build defence do a shit ton of damage. I mean seriously pick mundo build him full tank and put you W on and through some cleavers and you'll be suprised that while being the tankiest guy in the game you do a shitton of damage. and the only reason these tanks aren't played a lot is because that before you completely ramp up there opponents can impact the map elsewhere and adc's can still do damage to them. People say LW is op and I say it is only because of how op armor is. I mean go play an adc and play a few games and when you get 11 kills and still can't do shit until you get a LW because 2 enemies bought a tanky armor item is a bit absurd. I mean really you have the highest dps in the game and your fed and still can't do anything because against one tank item until you get a LW. People always go on about how tanks where nerfed and all that and it's true buy adc's where also nerfed. I mean people thought adc's would become completly worthless from s2 to s3. I mean have you seen the PD changes from that time they took of like 10% attack speed I believe some crit and about 7% movement speed on it and this was when BT was the first build item. If you think adc's are attack damage carries then you should have played back then when they weren't marksmen but real carries needed in the game to kill the stupidly tanky bruisers who don't build a single damage item but still deal a fuckton of damage.\n\nNow Riot seems to be trying to do the opposite instead of having tanks build tanky and deal a ton of damage they seem to be trying to have them build more damage and still be tanky. So like Rek'sai and Gnar are examples where they can build a lot of damage and there kits still make them pretty tanky.","replies":[{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2015-01-14T18:25:06.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanks are a problem because carries are a 1-stop-shop. If they were actually difficult to build for and make prosper endgame, sure, tanks could be more laxed. However, they're often ready to dish damage immediately after the laning phase, forget farming up from there.\n\nI didn't say IE should lose all its AD, but honestly, it really should. PD and Shiv fit basically the exact same roles, but until this next patch, Shiv was simply better with a real passive. One of them needs to be shifted into an AD/Crit item, and IE should be the Crit/Crit Dmg item, with maybe bits of flair in other areas. Many characters can't even use the Attack speed the other two use (Gangplank mostly, Fiora/Yi are up there since they are melee and therefore it's hard to hit enemies unless they stand still, plus already have AS buffs). Those characters are getting EVERYTHING they need on one item, and nobody should be built so easily. Highest natural AD item in the game, not far off on Crit Chance, and only Crit Damage item... It should not be that good.\n\nRanged Carries are supposed to work for the damage lategame. At the moment, only non-crit ones have to do that since crit ones are ready so early. It's probably an effect from the LCS, actually, since their games are typically much shorter and efficient than traditional games. They want the carries ready early on, and IE helps make that happen.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PrinceOfStorms","date":"2015-01-14T08:54:52.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IE should just be removed outright, like how {{item:3128}} is getting the axe.\n\nGames shouldn't be decided by who gets the first IE crit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fizz is not Fish","date":"2015-01-13T18:44:16.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"BT+PD+LW,Brok or  another PD is the next item.\nI think I'll forget IE after this patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Enraged Piglet","date":"2015-01-14T04:21:07.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya I think unless Dblade can somehow allow IE to be built first then IE prob won't be seem as much. To be honest Dblade might get changed again it would be intresting if they gave it crit with it's lifesteal so that building 3 dblades into IE or the Dblades into SS/PD or some item into IE might be strong on certain champions probably only those with attackspeed steroids since they would have less need to get SS and PD. Which this might be a way to buff ashe for instance if they made it where those with base attackspeed wouldn't need PD as much then mayby she could change her build to have IE where other adc's would have a harder time bypassing the PD/SS.\n\nThough I don't see SS being used anymore unless they lower the price or something so that it might be possible to get IE SS cheaper while BT + PD would still be good.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sebsauve34","date":"2015-01-14T01:51:38.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it's not the first time average/ lower tier champions gets nerfed due to ADCs being overpowered. Every melees got nerfed super hard with Dblade changes in season 4 since it was overpowered on ADCs/ranged champions. Now IE gets nerfed for subpar champions due to ADC being overpowered. Maybe if Riot actually focused on nerfing ADC instead they would make this game balanced, but all they do is nerf everything else.","replies":[]}]}
