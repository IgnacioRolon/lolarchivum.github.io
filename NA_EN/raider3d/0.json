I tried different resolutions and nothing fixed it. I tried taking a screenshot but the screenshot didn't show the blacked out part. I've looked around but couldn't find anything that worked. Tried maximizing it too.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-27T21:17:18.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a strange issue with your game screen.  I'm curious if you're on a 4K or have your resolution set to exceed 1920x1080.  In both cases, you can run into problems like this especially if you often tab in and out.  If this is the case, see if you can try reducing your resolution.  If you have any issues doing that, a config reset can help:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.\n\n\n\nLet me know if the issue persists!","replies":[]}]}
