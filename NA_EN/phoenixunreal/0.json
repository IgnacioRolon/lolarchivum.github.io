A lot of good input already on this thread but I'm happy to jump in and give my personal take. \n\nIt's different for each individual Rioter however I think a good rule of thumb is that each of us tries to stick to what we know. As a UX designer you probably won't find me replying to discussions in Live Gameplay Balance. These types of conversations are generally not something I can contribute to in a meaningful way and I would only be adding unnecessary 'noise'. \n\nThat being said I read through almost everything that is posted on Boards as well as a handful of other channels. There are not any specific defining factors to what I respond to versus not so it basically again comes down to 'Can I contribute to this in a meaningful way?'

Be sure to use proper grammar, stay on topic, and be sure what you say is fact.\n\n2. **Do not flame**. Do not start your thread with anger towards Riot. Vice versa, do not start by saying \"this is not a hate thread\" because it will typically end up becoming one.\n\n3. **Discuss something that is interesting/engaging**. No one wants to be apart of a boring conversation that leads nowhere. Talk about things that draw people's attention. It may not have to be about League!\n\n4. **Visit Q&A's with Rioters**. Asking thought-provoking questions on Riot Q&A's may end up with you on a Rioter's mind at the end of the session. They could be more inclined to visit one of your own threads at a later time.\n\n5. **Use the Boards over General Discussion Forums**. If you think you have something that a Rioter would comment on or something that would become popular, post it here, on the Boards. We have more class here, and Rioters are beginning to turn their attention here for meaningful discussions.\n\n6. **DO NOT BE AN ASSHAT**. Big one here. Riot has made it clear that the Boards will not become the wretched hive of scum and villainy that is GD. Just do not be a jerk to others, and behave with some [Forum Decorum](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/E3WffEGM-forum-decorum).\n\n7. **Experiment with the Boards Editing**.

RiotBaconhawk combs through the Forums and finds posts she thinks everyone should read everyday. If she selects yours, the post will be stickied for the day (if you're lucky, the entire weekend).

I've talked with a few on occasion and they seem to be pretty on top of their chosen mediums (some choose Reddit, other vBulletin, and yet others CB), but they also (again, from what I've come to understand, I apologize if I'm misinterpreting) are keenly aware of the attention a comment can give a thread. A lot of them are pretty cool people but any footprint they make are like magnets and the consequences of that can be very good or very bad. \n\nFor example, an @Ironstylus thread asking about Leona artwork and some sketches would probably get something, because there's no harm in IS showing off some personal sketches and other artwork that's already been done, but an @Ironstylus thread asking about a VU would have to be treated with care because simply having that Rioter fist next to a title like \"@Ironstylus next VU?\" will get people excited,  and some may even be disappointed by a simple \"nope, can't say\", and he will no doubt be bombarded with replies of \"X next X next!\".\n\nUsually I find Rioters prefer to jump into already made discussion. So my best suggestion is to ask and address the community, the players, and try to get some good back and forths going. Not only do you get opinions from other people but you also allow Rioters to jump in on the much more specific topics that are created. This post, for example, is a great example. You could have just said titled it \"@Rioter, what will it take for you to notice me?\" and thus make any comment from a player kinda trivial, but now you have this (and hopefully other) comment(s) that Rioters can confirm/deny/expand/correct","replies":[{"poster":"Cedriel","date":"2014-07-24T20:31:49.702+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ What this gentleman said.

For better or worse, red posts tend to multiply traffic—and the more controversial the topic, the larger the multiplier.\n\nIt's important to address topics that players are really engaged with when you have some insight to share so that people know we're listening, but fuck up on of those and you'll make headlines, disappointing a large number of players and making everyone at Riot look bad for your mistake. It's especially tough when you have some insight about a topic that you think would be useful to communicate, but aren't on a team that works on it: you have to be extremely careful not to contradict their messaging or create false expectations.
