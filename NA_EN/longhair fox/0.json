In the former case, I'll miss the bruiser Yasuo build I was favoring recently, since it helped survive bad lane matchups. In the latter, I'll miss the occasional damage boost that a lucky crit added here and there. Also, building Vi is going to feel a little awkward if I can get to 40% CDR off of just a Cleaver and Tri-Force. Can't really build a Spirit Visage or Warmog's now if I want to use the new Tri-Force.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2016-05-18T05:16:27.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which marksmen are actually buying Trinity in it's current state?\n\nSeveral fighters, Ezreal and corki are the only consistent buyers of Trinity for several seasons.\n\nThe 2 biggest victims of this change are GP and Yasuo.

You decide what would be better for one match, but still have the other options in case you change your mind. The other items still had benefits if chosen over the others, they didnt just simply over shadow ever other options just because.\n\nNow that I think about, they are making the same approach with items like they did with game modes. They are removing option and making the game less about decisions and more about \"we counter/out perform you\". This can be applied with items (ibg vs fh), dynamic que (solo player vs premades), and champions (tons of examples).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaygo41","date":"2016-05-18T04:33:09.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yasuo, and because. Did i answer the question?\n\nIt's not supposed to give crit, it's supposed to be for people that utilize sheen items and base damages. Crit just doesn't belong on an item that has sheen procs. Should skarner be critting? no, not really. It happens to be absurdly good on gangplank, but this change might actually bring the statistically best top laner in the game down right now. Yasuo shouldn't be able to buy this and infinity edge and be maxed out in crit, then just build tank. This is a gutting to a lot of the bullshit that's been swept under the rug as of recent and hasn't found its way to the top. \n\nWhat riot wants to do is remove the 20% crit that the get by happening to build triforce. It's just too efficient to get along with further crit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2016-05-18T04:27:07.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.lolking.net/items/3078#topchampions\n\nIt's primarily a brusier item right now anyways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOvermind","date":"2016-05-18T03:53:52.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least Yasuo players will now definitely realise that infinity edge is vastly superior to triforce on Yasuo...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zoeeee","date":"2016-05-18T03:35:34.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:42}}  {{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}} Basically the corest core item ever for Corki.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2016-05-18T03:33:06.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You DO realize that ADCs werent ever meant to buy sheen items in the first place, right? \nTrinity has always been a fighter item; it used to have 50%ASP  or so and AP/AD.
