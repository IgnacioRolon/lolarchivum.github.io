I made it a point not to stoop to his level but after the game Im the one with a suspension and I got no feedback report making it seem the player said all of these hurtful things with no consequences. Confused about how i became the one in trouble i submit a ticket for clarification and get the work around from the employee who even said \"Iâ€™m really sorry you had to deal with that kind of behavior\" and yet no consequence on said top laner. And then when I wanted to get the community involved and post my chat logs to see if im in the wrong he said that wasnt possible although Ive seen riot employees do this ALL THE TIME. Can I please get some insight or anything? Or if another riot employee sees this can I get some help please??","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-29T03:26:58.721+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"A chat-related punishment will produce logs in your reform card which should be shown to you when you log into the client.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2020-02-29T03:28:21.394+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is possible for playerA to get punished and playerB not to, even though playerB was waaayyyyy more toxic . \n\nLet's say playerA started the game with the toxicity meter at 95% and playerB's at 35%. Ingame, playerB said some pretty nasty shit and playerA responds with some minor shit. After the game, playerA gains 10% toxicity and playerB gains 50%. Now playerA is at 105% toxicity and gets punished, whereas playerB is at 85%, and not punished in that specific game, even though playerB was found to be 5x more toxic than playerA in that game.\n\nThe next question is how did playerA get their toxicity meter to 95%. For that, we look at your behavioral history's consistency x severity. \n\nFinally, if you aren't able to get chatlogs from the client or Riot support, chances are you used your chat in a toxic manner in either pregame champ select (which got dodged) or out of game PMs.","replies":[{"poster":"Hes Paint","date":"2020-02-29T03:30:00.814+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get your analogy and appreciate the feedback but the dude was literally using slurs and hate speech?","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2020-02-29T12:19:12.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There have been a few people saying that it takes 2-3 uses of zero tolerance phrases before it gets punished. \n\nFrom the things you sited, only f%% is counted within the ZT phrases.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-02-29T03:53:51.551+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have no way of telling if they got punished or not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2020-02-29T03:54:30.740+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well they did a horrible job with the feedback thing giving the impression that it is sent everytime a punishment is made. The lack of one, in reality, actually means nothing. They are only sent occassionally to comfort players in knowing that their reports are actually being reviewed and acted on. They will never directly tell you what action was taken on someone else's account. So theres a good chance that person actually did get punished, considering how strict they are about chat violations. Theyre working on the feedback system this season so its not so confusing. \n\nThe only time I've seen a Rioter post chat logs was back in the day when tantram or lyte would come into a thread where OP is lying, and they expose them and OP says go ahead and post em (since they need permission first) and they post em like ya heres what actually happened... otherwise, its usually just players posting their chat logs, not Rioters. You should be able to get them when you log in. Post em here if you want, up to you of course. But keep in mind, theres nothing in the rules that states you are allowed to break them. There is no condition that will suddenly make you exempt from the rules, so dont expect anyone to be like oh you didnt break any rules because that guy called you a %%%.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pombagira","date":"2020-02-29T09:05:15.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you feel as if they haven't been punished (or the bot didn't detect it), please submit a ticket to Riot's support team and have them take a look for you.
