I dont control when they play and the only way to not be bombarded with the 5 minute monologues cuz I clicked on the minimap is to not play that skin. \n\nIm not saying the *ENTIRE* Voiceover is too long; it's only 9 minutes. Tahm Kench's full voiceover is 24+ for the record, and multiple skins/champions after him comment on how much he talks as a result because prior to that, 5 minute voiceovers were on the longer side. I AM saying Ashe has a ton of dialogue - on her base skin even, meaning I kind of would have to play PROJECT to not hear them - that go on and on and on for 20 seconds or so. \n\nand lastly; Have you ever PLAYED Xayah? Or Rakan? At all? Like even for 1 game\nThey literally DO NOT shut up ever. Yes, I could mute voice lines but the thing is, voice lines are a huge part of the game as they are in almost every non-turnbased game (and arguably, even some TBS games like Fire Emblem); There's a reason Xayah, for instance, shouts FEATHERS FLY every single time she presses R with no exception; why evelynn's W casts *override her current voice line and plays a new one*, etc. \nTheyre highly impactful and key to knowing what your/the enemy champion is doing. Long Move voiceovers do NOT contribute to this, theyre just a reason to not hover my champion (and thus, have less information immediately relevant to me) to not have to listen to it.\nIt is actively worsening my experience of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2019-09-25T18:41:09.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">and lastly; Have you ever PLAYED Xayah?

I never been bothered by champ's VO in general. I've played Taliyah &amp; her \" Throw another rock\". I've played Super Galaxy Rumble &amp; his \"SUPER INFERNO WAVE!!\". I've play Rammus &amp; his long &amp; deep discussions on the meaning of life.\nI never had a problem with the long move quotes because it allows me to learn a bit more about the champ's personality &amp; views on the world &amp; events.\n\nThat the thing about this subject, it's a personal problem, it's subjective. I never had a problem with the VOs because I either think it's neat, heard it a bunch of times before so I'm use to it or listening to something entirely.\nBut for you, it's clearly a different story.

I like Xayah and Rakan's banter as they walk back to lane, and I think they are one of the better examples of detailed VOs that deliver character done right. \n\nAlso, you can literally mute your Champion. Riot is NOT forcing you to listen, not to mention you can adjust the VO volume higher or lower to suit your preferences. I like listening to VOs but I have it low enough to where I can tune it out easily when I am focusing on something else. There is also a reason they started doing \"long move\" lines. You're probably walking to lane when you hear these lines, unlikely to be doing much other than watching the map. If that is somehow worsening your experience of the game, then idk what to tell you. Its not like they are spouting these lines in the middle of battle. Its a LONG MOVE quote. \n\nLastly, I don't think turning off voices turns off gameplay important voicelines does it?

Maybe Xayah's ult and that's it. Even Lee's ult kick is really obvious visually and sfx-wise.

Hearing it directly from the champion is much more powerful than reading about the whole town they are in for that story. For instance, a short story that is about Vel'koz and Lissandra, [https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_us/story/the-eye-in-the-abyss)], really expand on what it means to be an ice born. It shows what's under the ARAM map. The protagonists of the story aren't in game champions. So this story gives you perspective of how Vel'koz and Lissandra interacts in the world of Runeterra, but hearing them talk about their motives, philosophies, and moments in their lives is much more impactful.\n\nPyke, for instance, talks about an underwater city, which you would never get from the \"actual\" lore; He is just some spooky spectral from reaper of the harbor in the lore. Pyke shares intimate details of how \"the last thing he ever drank was priceless\". That is HUGE on an emotional level. We understand that something so simple as a drink is monumental to him. \"Work hard and then die.... The other way is worse\". Comical, yet it shows where he is in life (death?). He is constantly pushing towards an end goal that we think is crossing off the names on his list of those who betrayed him, but from another voice line he says how \"his bosses to need gold\" or something along that. Now we know he is an employee of someone, but we don't actually know who.... \n\nIt gives the player a very personal look into the champion they are playing. It gives the player a chance to relate or be intrigued by a champion, which could lead to more exciting gameplay or more \"maiming\" that champion. In the end, if it really upsets you, then it's easy to tune out or you could turn off VO in the audio setting, but it is a great tool to explore a champions story while still playing the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShyImagoghnar","date":"2019-09-27T03:46:35.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've played with voices muted ever since zoe's release xd","replies":[]}]}
