She should see this bonus damage on units, but I was under the impression it shouldn't occur to structures.\r\n\r\nHow to replicate: Start a game with Rek'sai. Put at least one point in Q. Buy Ravenous Hydra. Activate Q. Hit a structure. First hit deals base AD + normal bonus AD as applied by the skill.","replies":[]}
