Not sure if it was due to my hardware or internet connection, so I quickly shut down the client to restart it. As soon as I was able to reconnect my team had surrendered. After I was given a leave buster penalty. \r\n\r\nIt was annoying, but hey it was only a 5 min or so penalty so I put up with it.\r\n\r\nHowever every few games I play this seems to happen, and each time it does the penalty gets worse. If I restart my client everyone quits before I get back into the game, and if I don't restart it then the game seems to crash and close itself out. Either way I am unable to make it before the game starts for some reason. \r\n\r\nLong story short I now have 20 min penalties to join games; punishment for something that I feel I have little to no control over. Don't get me wrong I understand why this penalty is implemented in the game, but in this scenario I can't help but feel slightly frustrated. \r\n\r\nI'm playing on a mac (if that makes a difference).\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated, I just want to figure out what is wrong with my client/system so that I can avoid this kind of stuff in the future; for myself and everyone else in the match I join.","replies":[{"poster":"OhRustybb","date":"2017-08-29T22:55:31.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happens to me. It never happened before. I have great internet and have never had an issue with league. A few patches ago, though, it started telling me it couldnt connect during loading.

This could be due to some corrupted files or possibly your network losing its connection for a split second. If you haven't tried it yet, let's try running a quick repair through the client options as well as checking the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).","replies":[{"poster":"Mitulus","date":"2017-08-29T20:45:53.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply.
