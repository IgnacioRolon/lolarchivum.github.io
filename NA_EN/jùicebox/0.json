My game will completely freeze up whether I am on the loading screen or in the game won't allow anything to be seen until at least 45 seconds after the freeze started. Not only that but to enable that countdown to start I have to click back on the frozen screen of League or else the game will completely crash. I tried repairing the client to see if that was the problem and it is not I also completely Re-Installed League directly from the site and it still has not fixed the issue. My computer is relatively new I just built it within the last 6 months and this has never happened to me before. All of the other games I play work just fine on this PC as well and they are much more demanding, so I don't think its a problem with my PC. Any help would be very much Appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-15T22:39:52.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your pc is having a hard time minimizing League and then reopening it anytime you alt+tab. Since the game will crash if you don't click back soon enough, it most likely means that League is trying to catch up with it's processes, isn't able to catch up after so long and then crashes. \n\nA clean boot might be able to help since no other programs will be running in the background, but go through the other steps in this [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) just in case. Make sure to test those changes in a custom game, and let me know if that doesn't help.","replies":[]}]}
