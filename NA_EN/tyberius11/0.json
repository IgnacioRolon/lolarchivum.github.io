As a free to play player the only way you get skins is through hextech crafting key fragments and obtaining chests. You suddenly get that chest from a champion you just got with blue essence after disenchanting a lot of champions from champion capsules. You open the chest, your eyes get excited, you get 3 champion shards that are not even worth that much blue essence. \r\n\r\nRiot—I thought Champion capsules are only for champion shards now. To be a free to play player and rely on chests for skins and getting champion shards is way too cheap. I know it’s RNG and all just take champion shards, ward skins, player icons and all that aren’t skins out of the RNG for hextech chests and make seperate chests for those.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-19T02:15:45.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The capsules you get through level-ups do primarily contain champion shards since they are the main source of getting BE. Regular hextech chests mainly give out skin shards and other cosmetics.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyberius11","date":"2017-12-19T08:16:47.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I know this but I got from a hextech chest 3 champion shards and am highly disappointed! I was expecting a skin. Being a free to play player it’s bard enough getting skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-19T21:23:17.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ahhhhh so you were thinking chests should give you permanent skins and not skin shards? You're able to disenchant any skin shards you don't want for orange essence. That orange essence will then let you upgrade the shard to a permanent skin in your collection.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyberius11","date":"2017-12-19T23:15:50.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You still don't understand. I am very disappointed I opened a hextech chest and got 3 champion shards. I was hoping for skins! I have the worst luck for skins I like and especially since I'm a free to play player the my shop skins are teasing me and I really want them but they cost RP. Why can't Riot give them for free as a Christmas gift? Other MOBAs are waaay more generous.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyberius11","date":"2017-12-20T22:12:24.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Broporo I’d like a response please. I have the worst luck with skin RNG, having got 4 panth skins and 2 being duplicates.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
