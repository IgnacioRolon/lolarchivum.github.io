I feel Xerath passive have the same problem , when you can just solve it to reduce mana cost from abilities and had him something fun. Like idk , he&#039;s a champion who have only skillshots abilities so why not reward people to touch everything ? His new passive can be :\r\nXerath add a debuff on his target , when he hit a champion with his abilities , the next will do 3% more dmg for 5 secs. Stacks up to 5 times , to a maximum of 15%. Basic attack refresh the debuff\r\n\r\nSome suggestions guys ?","replies":[{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2018-03-12T00:38:31.379+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xerath does not need any more damage. Plus, his current passive is really good. Not only does it help him in lane so much, it provides an interactive choice between both laners. Does Xerath try and risk an auto on the enemy laner for the huge mana boost, or does he play it safe and just take what he can get off a minion. On the flip side, when Xerath's passive is up, do you risk going in to harass/CS and allow him to get a huge chunk of mana back, or do you play back and wait for him to use it, giving up 15-30g in the process for potential lane advantage? It's not like Annie holding passive either, because Xerath will lose CS by not autoing so if he has his passive up, there is a small window that both champions must decide how they will play around this passive, and honestly it can be very fun to see what happens. \n\nMuch better than Xerath's older passive that just converted 50% of his bonus armor into AP. \n\nWukong I agree. I think that as a whole, Wukong needs an update. He has a single interesting part of his kit, that being his decoy, everything else is just basic, dated abilities. Even his passive is just kinda eh. Riot is cutting down on stat checks though. I wouldn't be surprised if Wu got a rework sometime in the mid-distant future where his armor/MR or another tanky mechanic like you mentioned is somehow activated or conditional past \"Be near X number of champions\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-12T00:10:44.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly i would greatly prefer the current xerath passive (interactive, strengths and weaknesses) to just giving him an invisible, free damage buff.\n\nDont fix what is not broken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2018-03-15T09:53:16.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Wukong passive feels way too much like a nerf. Currently his passive gives him resistance through an entire fight so long as the enemies are near by and just reducing the damage from a single attack from each enemy instead is not helpful for his teamfight or his laning phase and honestly would mostly just encourage an enemy to poke him every 12 seconds in the laning phase.\nIf he were to get a passive change, it would need to be something that doesn't rely on a teamfight to get its full use. Something that he can use in lane to help him defend against pokes and harass, but still offer some protection when he goes to dive in on an enemy champ during a teamfight.\n\nhonestly, I think changing it to something as simple as \"Wukong gains X Armor/Mr for X Seconds every time Wukong deals physical damage up to a maximum of XX Armor and MR\" would be the best bet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Melloώ ","date":"2018-03-12T12:16:37.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree all about you said guys.\n\n But my bad , I forgot to talk about a really little nerf on his spells ( around 2-3% less dmg on each spell except of E ) ,it's true that a insane buff here. I was thunking about that ; after , idk something like , 2 stacks of his passive he deals the exact damage he does actually. \n\nBut i'm not a expert on him , i just feel like , why he have a mana sustain via auto when you can just give him a lower mana cost on spells and a interactive and fun passive.\n\n Anyways do you think about others champs with this type of old passive ?","replies":[]}]}
