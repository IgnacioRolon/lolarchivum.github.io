Then you go screw it do the opposite just so they shut up. oh you want us to retreat even though we already are? oh you're gonna ping 10x? cool ur not stopping let's see what happens when I go in. Oh now you're talking and saying wtf didnt u see my ping? no i'm a blind deaf person playing video games on top of it all I just randomly stop retreating with my team for no apparent reason. oh you want to target the adc even though I already am and you have just stopped using your skills just to ping like an idiot? Ah you must mean let's target the tank that seems like what you want to do. then they start cursing at you and end up afking and you just type in chat  cool as long as the pings have stopped i'm fine with this.","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2016-10-12T00:26:22.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol, that's just someone using the pings wrong, totally different situation.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Troll Armada","date":"2016-04-06T21:56:25.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course the opposite of this is the feeder accounts which, must have some sort of programming which, if team tries to actually take an objective, start ping spam.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
