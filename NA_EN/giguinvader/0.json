The passive gives mana for a basic attack every 12 seconds, so it severely lowers the need to return to fountain. Drawbacks of this champion: you have no viable damage outside of your abilities, you have absolutely no health, and you have no way to stop people from dodging all of your attacks. This is a champion you need a lot of practice with to make predictions and get used to the feeling of being the guy that is targeted off the field before anyone else. Never let your guard down as you are a literal glass cannon, there needs to be a glass cannon skin for him honestly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2017-07-03T18:14:16.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:103}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:143}}","replies":[{"poster":"giguinvader","date":"2017-07-03T18:20:57.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about azir","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2017-07-03T18:22:48.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=giguinvader,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=m7ERxgE5,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-07-03T18:20:57.426+0000)\n>\n> What about azir\n\nI mean...
