I would run at 30-35ms for about 5-10 minutes and then it will spike to 300-500ms. When this happens my character slides to where i last clicked and the game kind of freezes and then resumes causing everything to happen at once. I have died or taken a ton of damage unintentionally when this spike happens.\r\n\r\nSo I took to the internet to see if I can find any fixes, unfortunately I haven't been able to find anything that works, but I do have a question that would be awesome if answered.\r\n\r\nI read that played on a wired connection (I am currently wireless) will greatly reduce packet loss and ping spikes (awesome!), the only issue is that there is already currently 1 person in my household who is wired. I was wondering if having 2 people connected with a wired connection would lag the both of us when we play. Another thing that seemed odd was that I recently got an upgraded router and modem from the one I had before but now i'm experiencing these odd spikes out of nowhere that I never used to deal with. \r\n\r\nSo here I am posting in the boards hoping for a fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-11T02:38:48.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, being wired won't affect your network any differently that it does now when you're on WiFi. I recommend swapping over to that wired connection and if that doesn't change anything, try swapping out your modem/router to the old one you had before (if it's still around). Sometimes even new modems/routers can ship with problems, so this would be an easy test. If you're still having issues at this point, I strongly recommend going through the rest of the steps outlined in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\nHit me up if you still encounter issues after all that.","replies":[]}]}
