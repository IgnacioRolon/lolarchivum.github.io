Like yes he looks straight like hes out of an anime just like 80 % of the other characters in this game. Yes he has long emo hair like 80 % of the posters on this board does. The number 1 complaint i've read though is that he's an \"Edgelord\" Uhm does anyone on this board know what that even means? An Edgelord is literally someone on the internet who is super angsty and shit like that and usually thinks hes some tough shit. But in the game he IS tough shit, like it really just feels like people just want to bitch about anime looking characters for some reason. In game he doesn't even angst LOL.

However as jhin words his BS in such a way it sounds philosophical people would love to get on their knees for him. He does have an overloaded kit tho.\n\nAnd i mean his appearance srsly pushes me away from him, the whole discount sasuke animu edgelord thing kinda wore off on me.

Ironic really, seeing as at least one of the people flaming me has flat out told me that he&#x27;s being so aggressive because he got picked on in school for likeing anime and manga and &quot;feels the need to  defend himself&quot;... as if me not liking the champ is a personal attack against him or something.\n> \n> But whatever.  I&#x27;m done.  I don&#x27;t care anymore.  I&#x27;m tired of ranting at stubborn kids who will just keep making up ever more absurd shit to try and paint me as a cackling bully, a racist and a villain.... just because I don&#x27;t enjoy something out of a freaking cartoon.  And when I stop fighting they&#x27;ll all cheer and smile and claim that they won... because they were able to harass me into submission... and they&#x27;ll feel good and tell themselves they&#x27;ve won something and done something good, because they verbally abused someone into the fucking ground over a petty disagreement.  And none of them will see the irony of it at all, or stop for even a second to think that maybe I&#x27;m a person or something.  No.  I&#x27;m a god damned super villain that is attacking the things that they love, and because they&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;m evil and it&#x27;s totally ok that they have harassed me for three days straight.  Villains aren&#x27;t people after all, and they don&#x27;t deserve ANY respect.  They &quot;beat&quot; a &quot;bully&quot; by bullying the shit out of him... and they&#x27;ll call it a win and not for a minute think that maybe they&#x27;re acting out the part of those jerks they&#x27;re mad at in the first place.\n\nAight dude, it's clear you've been through the wringer with these folks. I'll take my leave and just say I'm sorry for any additional stress I've caused you. For the future, please remember that you can avoid a lot of bullcrap from people by simply not stooping to their level and flaming back.","replies":[{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2017-06-29T19:23:01.823+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh.
