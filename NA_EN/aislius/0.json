When i launch League client i get an immediate bug splat. What this indicates for me is that with the new 9.23 patch notes, that there is a program (third party or just launches with app like kernel) that crashes immediately. It's like a background program that was put into place to remove the issues with some sort of colliding with the alcove that causes your CPU to use a ridiculous amount of usage. As i went to task manager it indicated that i had 90-95% usage, when i usually don't go over 50% when i have 140 frames. I guess i have to wait for a hot-fix, or a new patch. \nSystem Specs: i7 8750h 6 core Processor gtx 1070, 16 gb ram. Running from an SSD\nTLDR: New patch with background program needs looked at, low fps, unplayable.\n\nEDIT: Installed the new windows update, and my computer stopped using 95% CPU and dropped to 40% on highest settings.

That makes.. basically zero sense?\n\nIt sounds like you have not actually checked what processes are using the CPU. That is the place to start; check usage under load for the top processes and identify if it is client, game, or something else entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2019-11-22T21:52:42.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=KanRHYeZ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-11-22T21:30:21.812+0000)\n>\n> What.
