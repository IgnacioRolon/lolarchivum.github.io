This is becoming fairly frustrating, and has been going on for a week or two now. I'm hoping this is a temporary issue, and there's a fix that either Riot is working on or one that I can do myself. Any help and/or suggestions are greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-19T04:23:58.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooof, it sucks that there are still some club issues out there.
