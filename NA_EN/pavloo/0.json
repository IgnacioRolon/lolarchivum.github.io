Yeah, not a great start to the post, huh? I regret getting pissed off enough to be permanently banned to this day. But to the point:\r\nI got permbanned in April last year, but not before making a PBE account linked to this account. From then, I was worried that my PBE account will get its access revoked. It didn't. For over a year and a half.\r\n\r\nAround 2 weeks ago, I thought it'd be a good idea if I sent a support ticket asking if my PBE will ever be banned. For some time, it was civil discussion about the system and stuff, and then the rioter asked for my banned LIVE account's data. I sent it, and guess what? My PBE account got its access revoked due to that. The truth is, that these rioters (won't call out by name for obvious reasons), wanted to hide the fact that their system had fucked up and didn't ban my PBE instantly. By the way, one of them just straight up locked the ticket after that.\r\n\r\nIn that time of having PBE, I collected over 800 skins, and way more things.\r\nI feel like Riot just took away my hard work from me for simply asking them if it will ever get banned.\r\n\r\nSo, now you might ask: Where's the \"proof\" that was mentioned in the title? Welp, here it is: (I censored the name of the rioter(s)) *Also note that my replies won't be there because for some reason they aren't visible anymore.)\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/CevvMuR","replies":[{"poster":"Pyrosan","date":"2019-10-10T21:20:33.818+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"so you got permabanned for flaming\nstill had access to the pbe which is an honor exclusivity thing\nthe system didn't ban you\nyou manually told riot \"im permabanned but still have access\"\n\nand its their fault you got access revoked","replies":[]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-10-10T21:33:34.213+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get how this makes Riot \"assholes\". You got banned, you asked Riot why your PBE account didn't get banned and whether or not it would, pretty much telling them all but explicitly \"my PBE account should be banned because the account it's attached to is banned\", and they told you several times across your correspondence with them that, **If your account is permanently banned, the PBE account attached to it should and will be banned too**...\n\nAnd yet, they're assholes for doing exactly what they told you would happen?\n\nLike, let me look at the quotes you showed again, just to see;\n\n> _To be honest, since your account was banned you will also lose access to the PBE account since Honor Level 3 is a requirement and getting your account banned will reset your Honor._\n>\n> _I can clarify with you though that once your account gets banned, the PBE account linked to it will also be inaccessible._\n>\n> _Regarding the PBE account in question, well if your live account that was used to create it is permanently suspended then you won't have access to the PBE that way. Sometimes it takes time to go through these accounts but in the end they are disabled if they no longer qualify for eligibility._\n>\n> _Well as mentioned before if by chance you were not eligible anymore then those accounts do get disabled as we do have a team that looks into those cases. So yes, I can see that the PBE account was indeed disabled now since the live account had been permanently suspended._\n>\n> _As my colleague mentioned, sometimes it takes time to go through these accounts, but eventually they get disabled._\n\nThat's five separate times you were informed that your live account being permanently suspended also means that you will lose access to the PBE account tied to it. Just because you don't like the results doesn't mean that they're assholes. They're just doing their job.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-10-10T21:29:15.276+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, you **knowingly** brought to their attention that their system had missed disabling your PBE account when your linked main account was banned..... and you're surprised they fixed the issue?\n\nAnd then you're surprised that your honor level 0 account (because it was permanently banned) is no longer allowed to access a PBE account?\n\nPBE is a privilege - not a right. You have no right to it, and they aren't assholes for doing what they said they'd do if your main wasn't of an honor level that is permitted to access PBE.
