And any valid reports prevents you from going down, even if they don't warrant a punishment.\n\nEither you last had a 14-day ban, which means any valid report would get you perma banned, or you had a 25 game chat restriction and used hate speech, which bumped you to a perma.(Atleast that's my understanding for using hate speech after having a chat restrict, might need to be corrected.)","replies":[{"poster":"ferrera1","date":"2018-01-25T02:38:25.226+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yeah, I understand but if I were to have a perma mute, that would be nicer.","replies":[{"poster":"Icy Hot Shoto","date":"2018-01-25T02:43:48.792+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really.

For multiple reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that if that player wen't back on their word and retaliated against other players with in-game actions, Riot would then be responsible for allowing that player to continue playing when they were capable of doing that.\n\nThe second is that if Riot gave one player an exception, they would be buried under a literal mountain of requests by other players who also wanted the same treatment.\n\nThe third reason is that it would be impossible for Riot to make a distinction between players who were like you, being genuine about their request, and the other sorts of players who just want to keep playing and have every intention of trolling if someone pisses them off.\n\nIt comes down to the fact that Riot can't even begin to take this type of direction with things because it is impossible to draw the line around what is acceptable or not, and around Riot's own responsibility.\n\nMaybe you would have been perfectly responsible with a perma-mute. But unfortunately other players would not, and so Riot cannot help you in this way. This is why we can't have nice things, because scumbags like those other players take advantage of the systems you would have used responsibly. The best ideas can still be ruined by just a few selfish low-lifes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2018-01-25T02:38:46.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see what is stopping you from creating a new account and just continuing to play without being toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"ferrera1","date":"2018-01-25T02:40:16.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What is stopping me is the trouble of getting to that point, you know what I mean?","replies":[{"poster":"Tokogawaruf","date":"2018-01-25T04:49:42.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Understandable, you fear what happened might happen again.\n\nI heard unbinding your Enter Key helped a few People\nOthers tend to Mute all as soon as the game begins.\n\nMaybe you can find other Threads about \"How to not be Toxic\" here, I can remember there being one lately, but i cant remember the title.\n\nHope this helps","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-01-25T04:43:12.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, they have tried infinitely scaling chat restricions in the past. lets just say it didn't work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ferrera1","date":"2018-01-25T02:42:33.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I do admit it, I should not have been this toxic and hurtful to my teammates, it was a qualified game, I got stressed and eventually it happened, the least I can hope for is a refund, if not then that's fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2018-01-25T10:08:26.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no refund you got what you payed for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tokogawaruf","date":"2018-01-25T04:47:00.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could try to remember this account as a warning when you make a new one.
