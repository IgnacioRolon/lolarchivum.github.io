Same as for someone with a clean account\n\nYes, in that if you slip enough for a new punishment, your previous ones will dictate which level the next one will be at.\n\nHowever, if you consistantly show reformed behavior, your account can be brought back into a clean state.  But it'll take time and consistant play.  Last I heard, roughly 3 months to move back 1 tier.
