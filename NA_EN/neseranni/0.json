What I suggest is an upper-hand chance for mana depending champions. It&#039;s like when there is a manaless enemy champion in 750 aoe, our champion should gain %75 mana regen. Numbers can be changed, but I hope you understand what I mean. Doesn't it be good?","replies":[{"poster":"Spizzle9000","date":"2015-06-03T14:36:36.854+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The whole purpose of mana-less champions is to be able to stay in lane longer because you don't have mana costs on abilities to hold you down. \n\nFirst off, for champions that take energy, they cannot spam their spells as much as mana-users.

I know that most of the champions that do that can easily regain that health, but abilities such as Vladimir's E cannot be spammed forever because of the stacking health cost, at least in early game. Also, a lot of them have longer cooldowns. Take Aatrox, for instance.
