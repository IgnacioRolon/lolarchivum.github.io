Raises attack damage and ability power for a couple seconds. (Works in Conjunction with Kog'maw's Passive)\n\n-Q- Spiked Head Bunt\n(About Shen's Dash range)\nOmen lowers his front spikes and lunges forward dealing a small AOE damage at the end of the Lunge.\n\n-W- Bone Armor\n(A combination of Rammus and Mordikiaser's but not as powerful since its targetable to any ally champion)\nTarget ally gains MR/AR and granted a small Thornmail like effect which grants 15% basic attack damage reflected back to enemies.\n\n-E- Bone Cage\n(Similar to Ryze target root Skill)\nTarget enemy becomes rooted by a cage of bones and is rooted.\n-No Damage Just for Utility\nhttp://www.levork.org/pictures/gibbet.jpg\n\n-R- Bone Impale (Ultimate)\nOmen fires spikes from his back in all directions at enemy champions (Maximum 5 targets) as a Aoe. Any enemy Champions caught in the AOE are Knocked Back. If They hit A Wall They are stunned for 1.5 seconds. \n(Like a Multi-Hit Condemn from Vayne)\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLore:\nThis Mournful hound was lost and abandoned. Feared by his looks, and Hunted for his ferocity, Omen is actually a very faithful companion when trained.\n\nThis one in particular belonged to Kog'Maw. A Voids hunters best friend. He worked as a blood hound finding new foods for Kog'Maw to taste. Kog'Maw would toss the bones and corpses away as O'Men would fetch them playfully.\n\nWhen Mahlzahar ripped Kog from the Void this faithful pup started looking for his master. Lost and feeling abandoned he searched and searched. When at last O'Men came across Kha'Zix and fallowed him across a portal into Rune Terra. He dashed threw just as the small portal was about to close upon him. Kha Surprised at the small pups bravery turned and faced the dog like beast menacingly ready to eat the small creature. Frightened but determined to find his master he cast a cage of bone over Kha'Zix and fled for his life. Ever since has been fallowing Kog's scent to be re-united with his friend. Which has brought him to the league of legends.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nStats from Levels 1 and 18:\n\nHealth: 420 (+86 per level) \nMana: 255 (+33 per level) \nAttack Damage: 50 (+3.5 per level) \nAttack Speed: 0.625 (+2.215% per level) \nMovement Speed: 335 \nHealth Regen: 7 (+0.53 per level) \nMana Regen: 7 (+0.57 per level) \nArmor: 30 (+2.8 per level) \nMagic Resist: 30 (+1.25 per level) \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nQuotes - Picking him on Champion Selection: \nHowls\n\nIngame - Emotes:\n1. Sniffs Air\n2. Starts to dig at the ground\n3. Sits on rear and looks around\n\nIngame - Battle Death:\nHis skin vanishes leaving only a bone skeleton\n\nIngame - Quotes:\nGrowling\nBarking\n\nIn Game - Joke -\nChases Tail\n\nIn Game - Dance - \nStands on Hind Legs and Doggie Dances.\n\nIn Game - Taunt -\nFires a Bone and Fetches it.\n\nIn Game - Laugh -\nPulls bone Spike of back and Buries it.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJust a idea, Void still needs a true support champ to make a 5 man team.\n\nHe has All The CC Kog doesn't and works in conjunction with all his abilities\n-KnockBack\n-Stun\n-Root\nCombine with Kog's slow high damage and Zero escape there a perfect match.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTips and Strategies Examples:\n\nExample #1 - Initiation\nArmor Up\nLeap Into A Group\nImpale Team And Divide Them\nBone Prison The Priority target\nLet Kog'Maw go to town\n\n-This strategy would make a way for the team to wade threw the tanks and get to the important priority targets.\n\nExample #2 - Having low damage, he can pin enemies to help feed the carries\nIf O'Men would catch some one out of position he can cage them. Then pounce to reposition and impale and stun the enemy till friends show up.\n\n-Great for chasing down those delight foods Kog wants to eat \n\nExample #3 - Play Maker!\nSecuring objectives like dragon/baron can be achieved by jumping over the wall and impaling (R) all enemies against the Round wall or out of the pit all together. If one tries to re-enter the pit bone cage them in place. Leaving your team a couple seconds of freedom for a main objective steal.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOVERALL\nOriginal skill combination\nUnique kit setup\nUnlike any other Support\nGreat addition to the Void team\n\nI mean come on who doesn't like a spikey death puppy!!! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Press ƒ to Flash","date":"2014-08-11T05:19:08.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You guys know that picture isn't \"Omen\", last I checked that is the old model for Kha'Zix.
