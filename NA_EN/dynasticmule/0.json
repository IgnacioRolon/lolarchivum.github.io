He tried to reset his password, but never got the email. After looking up his account, fatm0ng3r, it appears someone was playing on the account for a couple months, between February and May of this year. He hasn't played since early 2016 if i remember correctly. The account is currently Gold 3, sporting a 67% winrate. \r\n\r\nWould a Rioter please look into this matter? He's had this account probably since season 1 and I'd hate to see him lose his account. He's also submitted a ticket, but hasn't heard anything about it. I created this post just to help him out.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this, hopefully Riot can help with this.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-25T01:50:47.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have your friend continue talking with our account agents in his ticket.
