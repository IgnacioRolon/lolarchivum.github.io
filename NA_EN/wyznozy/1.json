The problem with this is the fist icon is pretty small and on the old forums it was very clear which member worked for riot when they posted due to the rioters name and their profession under their name. Can you guys please do something to make it more clear to which posts are from riot :I pls.","replies":[{"poster":"Yuish","date":"2013-09-18T01:44:49.552+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, as a player who isn't colourblind I still have trouble differentiating posts and can totally see where you are coming from.\n\nA suggestion to Riot might be to add a shaded background (of a colour other than red) to their posts which I have seen many other forums on gaming sites use, this makes their post clear and hard to miss. It would technically make the differentiation easier for everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Montag","date":"2013-09-18T06:26:50.350+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're considering a few different treatment for red posts.
