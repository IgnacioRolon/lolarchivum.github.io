IE, singed was visually updated but not gameplay or lore. What about champions whose lore is Broken like Lee Sin, or more egregiously, Fiddlesticks and Nocturne. How far back are you going with your lore updates following updated champions. Master Yi was pretty heavily iterated on. What about Ekko? \n\nWhat I am more asking for is guidelines on whose getting what. I do have faith that you'll get to everyone eventually (I've got this cool idea that Noxus is gonna run into a civil war hearalded by the Du Couteau family and Riven Versus the Seedy and Corrupt Black rose, power through merit v power through deception, with Darius as a split(heh) vote.) I am also excited with the love Zaun has been getting lately and I think everyone's favorite goo ball, besides twitch, could use a bit of lore love.\n\n  But, what are Riots current Lore goals? You've got your new long form entries, which are awesome, but how far back into the updates do they go? What level of update gets a lore pass? How far back into the \"New Champions\" list do these lore updates go? How prioritized are finishing the current story threads left by Shurima and more egregiously Fjrelord?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-07-26T18:49:22.891+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"I mean all Champions. We aim to produce written character introductions that are of the same format as seen with GP, TF, and Graves for every single Champ. Our priorities are based on Champions who are going to be involved in updates of any kind, new Champs, Champions with contradictory backgrounds and those being used in Events such as Bilgewater and other projects.\n\nFor example, Fiora received her update, so we put together her new introduction. Bilgewater was in production, so we did new intros for TF, Graves, GP and MF. Singed is one of our Champions with an outdated history, so we're working on him.\n\nAlso, these introductions are not necessarily the best place to further stories alone. For example, when Miss Fortune's intro comes out, it will cover the events of Burning Tides: The Reckoning, but the best way to understand those events is to read the story itself. \n\nWe want to create stories for our Champions that have different \"zoom\" levels. You want a quick idea of who they are and what they do? In-client character introduction is the place. Want more of an overview of how they became who they are? Go to the website and read their background. Want to get a feel for their personality in the story world? Read the flavor text on the website that accompanies the background.\n\nWant to see them alive and interacting with the world, to get a really good idea of their thoughts and personality in the moments that they are developing?

Not every story needs global implications. This isn't a war between nations or a global catastrophe, it's a very personal affair; a score to be settled between two men that crossed another, highly influential one with a certain woman lingering in the background, perhaps having orchestrated it all. \n\nThe impact isn't global, its local and its individual. It's about Gangplank, Miss Fortune, Twisted Fate and Graves; those four and those tied to them in whatever way be it those who fight with them or who die by their hands. The world won't change much, but the lives of these four will be affected. If you don't care about them and their goals and whatever, then you don't have to and shouldn't force yourself care.","replies":[{"poster":"Legacy of Xion","date":"2015-07-27T09:47:03.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I care about Miss Fortune, but if the world narrative is going to be 10 independant stories that have no correlation or overarching plot, then it's not a narrative.\n\nIt's a fucking newspaper about current events.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2015-07-26T08:02:26.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaredan,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=nfkXKAwr,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-26T05:52:04.314+0000)\n>\n> The new format for champion introductions will be done for every new Champion and every updated Champ moving forward.There's more to come for Fiora.
