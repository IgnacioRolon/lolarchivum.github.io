Are you able to get into champion selects and the loading screen never shows, or can you not even get the client open? Hit me up with some details so I know how to approach this!","replies":[{"poster":"RancidRabbit","date":"2017-10-18T21:53:14.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, I re downloaded the thing as I said. I downloaded it for my Mac and it had to do the new launch thing. So I waited 15-20 minutes and after it was ready for me to launch and play the game, league of legends was going into the real login screen of the game. I waited 30 minutes - nothing. I'm really worried and I want to get this fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-18T22:26:34.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh yea that sounds like a different problem than what I was thinking initially.
