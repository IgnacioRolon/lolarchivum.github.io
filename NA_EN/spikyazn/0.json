The defining thing about true damage is that, if it does damage in the first place, it will always do the specified amount of damage, never getting reduced by defensive stats or effects, or boosted by unrelated damage amps. \n\nThere is a separate damage type that does go straight through shields, invulnerability etc. That's generally referred to as pure damage or raw damage and is only used by the fountain lazers.","replies":[{"poster":"Subject 5","date":"2015-07-18T11:51:42.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=L7u5bQXn,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-07-18T08:23:25.005+0000)\n>\n> Yup, that's the intended behavior with true damage.
