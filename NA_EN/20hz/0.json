I start to freak out mainly in fear of losing all the money I have put into this account. I submit a ticket and expect an e-mail to follow. A few days pass and I come back here to check my match history to see if there is anything out of the ordinary, then I think to check that my e-mail is correct so that I may actually get a response, and sure enough it is not my e-mail. I then go to manage my support tickets only to find that since as early as July, people have submitted tickets apparently using this account saying they were banned and someone hijacked their account. So now I am throwing my ticket on top of what seems like other people having the same issue (most of them also seem to have different names as only once was I addressed as the name on my account). \r\n\r\nI am assuming there are security questions that will prevent anyone else from taking over? I saw that people left alternate e-mails and that most tickets were marked Solved. Mine is currently open along with another that is trying to do the same thing I am. WHAT IS GOING ON?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help while I await a response from Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-18T00:45:07.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries! It does look like your account had a good deal of rather suspicious activity, kind of like all the random tickets you're seeing from people other than yourself. We've got the account protected for now until we can verify the original owner and return it to them! There are indeed recovery questions to go through before the account is unlocked too.","replies":[{"poster":"20Hz","date":"2017-10-18T01:00:15.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh thank the lord. I just unloaded a number of e-mail accounts to contact me as I did create another account with the one I had suggested to use earlier. Should I remove the account that is tied to the e-mail I want to be using?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-18T01:17:23.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ehhhh not sure I completely understand that question tbh xD! When those agents ask for a new email for the account recovery process, give them a secure email that isn't associated with other League accounts to be the safest.","replies":[{"poster":"20Hz","date":"2017-10-20T00:26:00.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did just that and everything seems sorted! Really not sure what happened there but it only took a week to resolve, so thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
