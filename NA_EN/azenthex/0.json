This includes names. \"some black guy\" \n\nTyping too many sentences + swearing even w/o directing it at anyone is more likely to get you punished.\n\nLastly, we questioned support in multiple tickets ------- the resounding \"standard\" that seems to be held is this quote from support when asked about banter\n\"I wouldn't type anything outside of telling your teammates gj or calling an objective because anything you say may be misconstrued :/\"\nSo if someone reports you for chat and you were using chat there is a percentage chance you will get punished. IE save your typing for just the game.\n\nYou can go test it yourself.
