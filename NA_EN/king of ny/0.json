It is impossible to play like this. Ive been stuck at the fountain tons of times because of this problem coming out of the loading screen. \r\n\r\nPlease fix this problem","replies":[{"poster":"booey961","date":"2016-11-24T02:06:02.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem need help was working on my old MacBook Pro now with new pro just freezes","replies":[]}]}
