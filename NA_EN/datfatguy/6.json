You can abuse Mord, Garen, Tryndamere, Teemo, Mundo, Jax.  All of those can be played either top or jungle (maybe not mord).  Teemo shrooms are strong, Garen requires a little patience but scales very well, Tryndamere, Mundo and Mord are pretty braindead. Jax takes a little practice, but isn't too hard.  Basically, you want to bait the enemy into trying to kill you (not get blown up), then kill them.  Or if massively ahead just take everything on the map and if they contest, kill them.\n\nIf you must play squishys, I suggest rushing zhonya's for the bait and outplay.
