Why did I have to get matched with a support (I know this was in normals but who cares) that didn&#039;t buy a sightstone and put the LEAST amount of wards in the team. Like WTF. I know it&#039;s normals and they don&#039;t really matter, but seriously, this support put down 8 wards and just built full AP? It was a Lux support aswell.\r\n\r\nSo to the people that play support as someone like Lux or Annie: there is NO excuse for you to not buy a sightstone in a game. If you don&#039;t do this, then just don&#039;t play support. This doesn&#039;t mean that you shouldn&#039;t build any AP, it means that you should ALWAYS buy a sightstone. And you see this item {{item:2301}}? This item right here gives you AP AND wards!\r\n\r\nSo instead of just building full AP and acting like the mid laner, if you&#039;re playing a mage support, Eye of the Watchers should be like the first item you get. There should not be an excuse for you to not buy a sighstone as a support.","replies":[{"poster":"SchmidttyGames","date":"2017-01-03T01:22:27.738+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone who legit calls themselves a \"Support Main\" (I do) understands the power of Vision Control.
