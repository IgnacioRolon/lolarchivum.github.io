If they didnt gank mid or top by 4 min likely they did a full clear then went to their bot side to do wolves->gromp and might gank bot around 4-5 min. \n\nShaco or hec or some other %%%% might start top side and same thing... bot or mid should have jg pressure around 2:30-3:45.\n\nIf you die to a jg gank or burn sums just count on getting fucked up some more.\n\nIf you get bullied in lane and ur sitting under your tower with 40% hp and jayce is zoning u off of cs that ur tower is hitting you should either call your jungler or back because here the kind of situation you will get dove by a competent jungler.\n\nThink about who junglers like to gank and why? {{champion:157}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:37}} \nSquishy immobile lane bullies with no reliable cc(coincidentally, champs people fucking hate playing against)\n\nThink most junglers think this shit is worth their time without some significant cc and burst from you and your ally? {{champion:42}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:7}} \n\nSo think about that, and where you should put your wards at what time, whether you're safe to fight the enemy laner at a certain moment, and whether it's safe to push the wave into the enemy tower. You should do all these things based on how strong you are vs the enemy laner and jungler and the probability he will be near your lane at a certain time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-24T00:34:20.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love it when I get camped. That takes pressure off of other lanes since the enemy jungler is usually less of a threat to me than my teammates. Just make sure to ward properly and not overextend.\n\nMost importantly, don't tell or expect your jungler to help you. If having an extra person monitor a lane was a good thing junglers wouldn't exist in the first place, we would just have another duo lane. Instead your jungler can be taking objectives, ganking other lanes, and counter jungling.","replies":[]}]}
