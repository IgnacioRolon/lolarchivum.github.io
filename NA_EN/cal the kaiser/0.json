Resetting your modem is a good start, but those other steps would resolve game file issues and not really your network.  Instead, run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for these matches to get an analysis of your specific case.

Ever since last patch I have been laggin constantly, sits at around 200 then spikes as high as 2050ms and it is unplayable. I am not the only one, everygame there is a few laggers and I havent seen any posts from riot explaining what this might be. I know this game has suffered lag but this is ridiculous, a game based on quick precise casting and Im limping through games with auto attackers and just praying. Cmon rito, help us","replies":[]}]}
