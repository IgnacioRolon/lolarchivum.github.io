This is why dynamic que is so bad one tier apart is enough for a player to be useless and have 0 impact on the game. As a diamond i legit couldnt do anything but just watch them feed while our mid misses everything and doesnt move all game until its too late because he has no idea whats going on since hes silver and then every lane of theirs roamed and got fed while my team had 0 idea what was going on missed everything and then died. LOL. not looking forward to league of hope i have the better baddy in season 6","replies":[{"poster":"35denKcYNj","date":"2015-11-08T11:47:56.276+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen players in Bronze that were better than players in Gold and even low plat.\n\nYou as a diamond player should have been bodybagging everyone, or at least keeping it close. And if you say you couldn't because they were feeding then that is a totally different issue. It was a normal, they were probably trying new champions out that they were not familiar with.
