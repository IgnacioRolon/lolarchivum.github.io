Say something or dodge you are only wasting your own time. You should never be 1-7 on your champ in a game or you clearly cant play it and need to play something easier. Seriously have had too many games wasted by jackasses that should be playing normals. Doesnt make me toxic that im mad that im the only one actually playing a champion that I know how to and am trying its you that doens't play at your best that makes the game shit. \n\nAll these players were also a tier lower last season and have 3-5 players that they play with. Go figure. Dynamic que is def not a problem Kappa. Like what goes through your minds? \"well better pick a champ Ive never played prob feed and make my entire team lose/pissed at me, sounds like a good time!\"","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-05T02:38:43.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The feeling is mutual, judging by your attitude.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-05T02:20:57.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i guess bad games arent allowed to happen? i guess you arent allowed to be out played by someone else from time to time ?","replies":[]}]}
