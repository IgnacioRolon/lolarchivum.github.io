No, you will not be able to use the chroma until you have the corresponding skin for it.\n2) b. Yes, if you unlock the chroma now, you'll have the chroma unlocked on the account, but will only be able to use it once you own the respective skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Gunnerkreig","date":"2018-12-28T19:38:09.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah - I made the mistake of redeeming a chroma for a skin I didn't have in one of the prior events, thinking that I would be able to use it without yet owning the skin itself. It's not a big deal, but I do think it would be nice if some sort of pop-up or message warned players who were going to make the same mistake as me in the future, or if the shop did something to indicate which items you wouldn't actually be able to use (maybe just shade out the chromas for skins you don't have).","replies":[]}]}]}
