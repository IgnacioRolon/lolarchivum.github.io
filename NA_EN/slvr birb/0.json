I have nothing to lose. You're the judge who says it's not your job to care who is morally right or wrong. You just hate people who aren't like you. Goody 2-shoes.\n\nYou cant try to put yourself on a pedestal. You have been banned multiple times, likely for chat related offenses. You are, in no uncertain terms, someone no one wants to play with, and someone riot themselves has stated they do not want you to play their game. They cant stop you from coming back, its free to make an account, and any measure that could be implemented to stop it would either be easily beaten or cause more harm than benefit, but you can ask any rioter. They will tell you to go elsewhere, that is riots OFFICIAL stance. They dont want you here, and they dont care about your money. That is what a permanent ban means.","replies":[{"poster":"plz ff","date":"2020-02-23T22:44:35.708+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"This Pika guy is really something lmao.","replies":[{"poster":"slvr birb","date":"2020-02-23T22:47:22.322+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=plz ff,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=XtYeedsq,comment-id=000a0001000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2020-02-23T22:44:35.708+0000)\n>\n> This Pika guy is really something lmao.\n\nIkr???

There is literally nothing you can do to stop someone from playing. T1 had an \"ID ban\" that meant when riot knows for sure they are T1, the account gets banned. Which only really amounted to any account he streamed on. Unless you are ID Banned and actively stream, theres nothing they can reasonably do that wouldnt be easily circumvented or do more harm than good.\n\nAnd even an ID Ban takes a lot of resources to effectively enforce.","replies":[{"poster":"plz ff","date":"2020-02-23T23:01:31.916+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pika Fox,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=XtYeedsq,comment-id=000a000100000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2020-02-23T22:55:03.575+0000)\n>\n> Maybe because theres no real point to blacklist an email, given you can literally circumvent that in less than one minute?

It takes 4 offenses to reach a permanent ban, none of which are single games. And its not like its going to be one game flagged every 100 either, youre likely negatively impacting >50% of youre games to some degree AND a decent portion of them are likely more than one minor instance. This is just for ONE permanent ban.\n\nYou *might* be able to successfully argue getting permad once was a bit of an over reaction.... Youre not a positive player by any means, but *maybe* you started to get better. But when you have a half dozen accounts permad? You cant argue you were wrongfully banned at that point. You cant even argue you have reformed.","replies":[{"poster":"plz ff","date":"2020-02-23T23:20:35.905+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"Why are you so aggressive about this? \nThat's very negative of you imo.

Basically Riot is so greedy and so rich that they dont want to spend the extra money to open centers where people read through reports all day and hand out punishments. Instead they swear up and down this system is foul proof and then when someone comes on here being banned for saying GG EZ. In comes a Rioter to try and make sure everyone still believes the system is good. I remember when the tribunal was around. Sometimes you would get many many chat restrictions before they actually banned you. At some point my buddy got a 100 game chat restriction before they banned him.\n\nThis all comes down to money and how much they can save just supposedly having and AI instant penalization system that makes 0 errors. I wonder what Elon Musk would think if he seen what was going on with this game.\n\nJust my 2 cents.\n\nEdit: Also it's very easy to get tilted in the system they have set up for match making and they have even been quoted as saying \"making it harder\" to climb because of so many smurfs.\n\nBut how did we get smurfs?

Some days range 20 posts while others get 40-45. Let's balance this out. Let's say 15 posts a day about a perma banned account. Well multiple that by a year in days, 365, x 3. that would make almost 17k players in the past 3 years.

Most of the complaints on the board regarding punishments are for chat restriction to 14-day bans.\n\nSome complaints are rage threads from people whom are already banned, have posted about it, and still stick around to continue voicing their opinion.\n\nFinally, some people are those that contribute more than just one perma-ban. They continue to get perma-banned multiple times and come to the board multiple times about their perma. Since those that behaved poorly enough to be perma-banned one time will continue to get perma-banned if they come back to the game and refuse to change their behavior.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
