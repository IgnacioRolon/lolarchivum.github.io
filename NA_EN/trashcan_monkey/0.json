Whenever I press the launch button, my game immediately disappears from my screen. I don't think it crashes because when I open task manager,  LolClient (32 bit) and Lol Patcher (32 bit) are still shown in task manager, however, they show up in background processes instead of the current Apps section. Any help would b e appreciated, but I have been searching for hours for a fix, and I have already tried everything I have seen in other threads. I have re-installed LoL about 5 times, restarted my computer many more times, deleted all the files people said to in the projects folder of LoL, tried running the client from the deploy folder, etc. Nothing I have seen in previous threads work. At this point I am willing to try anything. Thanks in advance for help...","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-30T22:47:16.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This specific situation typically happens if your client is unable to reach out login servers.
