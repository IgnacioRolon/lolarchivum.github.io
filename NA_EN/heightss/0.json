Is there another server I could join that would allow me to play??

I attempted to switch to Japanese servers, which I did successfully but since my location is in Korea they have restrictions that don't allow people not actually in Japan to play on their servers. I just need to know which servers I am actually eligible to play on from Korea and what the ping may be like before I pay to switch again. I'd rather not put my account into limbo again between two servers.
