Doesn't matter how long I wait it's just black. I can't tab out, can't go to task manager, can't click anywhere, nothing. The only thing I can do is force reboot my computer. One day I tried to go into a game and it worked for awhile, but then a few days ago I tried to go into a flex ranked game with some friends and it went back to giving me a black screen every time.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has this problem and/or has found a fix please let me know. I've lost so much lp over this stupid thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Artêmïs","date":"2018-01-13T20:17:07.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the screen turns black, keep pressing space bar+enter+delete.

It seems like your network might be having some troubles making a solid connection there, so it can't find any of the data to display which is why that loading screen stays black.\n\nLet's go through our [**Connection Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) so that we can narrow down what's causing this little hiccup.

Unfortunately the problem did not stay fixed. I followed the connection guide, used the hextech repair and it worked, but only for so long.
