It can&#039;t be jg because someone like Nidalee or Lee and etc would lvl 2 invade him. I mean maybe he can top and he would have great synergy with Rengar because he can spawn a bush.

He can root the enemy with a free gap closer for jungler & ADC. He's ranged for 3 sec after touching brush (so always in the bot lane). He can shield his teammates or make them untargetable. He can smite without a jungle item so he's going to have a vision advantage on skuttle & wolves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2016-09-26T20:17:56.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungle and maybe support.
