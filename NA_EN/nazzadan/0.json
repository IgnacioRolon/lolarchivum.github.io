I've seen people say it's got something to do with Steam, which I now make sure isn't running in the background.  I ran a repair last night just in case, and it happened the next game after.  \r\n\r\nI don't know what else I can do to be completely sure this stops happening, it's getting pretty annoying having to level an ability in the fountain at the very start of the game to make sure my hotkeys work and having to alt f4 over and over to get it working.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-15T02:19:03.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible that the settings files saved server-side are corrupt or misconfigured in some way. To ensure this isn't the case, I'd recommend completing a reset of the file with the following steps. First, you'll want to **log into the Client** then minimize it and navigate to your config folder, which should be in this directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nDelete these files:\n**- input.ini\n- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nAfter deleting these two files, I'd like you to hop into a custom match so you can test if your key bindings will function properly now. Let me know if this worked!","replies":[{"poster":"Nazzadan","date":"2017-02-15T03:28:14.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright did that and everything seems fine for now, but like I said its an intermittent issue so I'll bump the thread if it happens again.  Thanks for the help.","replies":[]}]}]}
