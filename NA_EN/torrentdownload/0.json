Is there any way to prolong the time selection or at least decrease the penalty time? :/ I've lowered the in game graphics to the lowest, I'm just having problems with this new client that I have never had a problem with before .-. And what is with this 30 minute penalty to begin with though? It's too much even though it was just something simple. I understand leaving halfway through champ selection and dodging, but I wasn't even trying to do that. x__x \r\nI had to randomly choose a champion because I can't see who I'm banning and then next thing I know my time's up. x.x \r\nIt's really frustrating because I can't even play as much as I want to anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-29T22:29:27.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've certainly seen some performance issues with the Beta Client on lower-spec machines.
