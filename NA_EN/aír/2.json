Let me just give a recent scenario to you guys. I was playing another ranked game and our mid and top were doing quite poorly. The mid fizz was 14-1 by 20 min into the game and top Hec was 10-2. Post game, rather than staying quiet, or acknowledging they just had a bad game (cause legit guys, we all do, even I do sometimes while also having my awesome games too), our mid laner said the most infuriating and tilting words ever:\r\n\r\n&quot;It is just a game.&quot; \r\n\r\nSo that makes it okay to feed? And to rage at teammates? So rather than saying to yourself &quot;I did badly, let me see what I did wrong so I can fix it in the future&quot; you say &quot;Idgaf and I will keep doing my mistakes because this is only a game and it doesn&#039;t matter anyway.&quot;\r\n\r\nCause here is the thing, this is not just a game. This is a community, a new world. A livelihood for some (LCS pros) and an incredibly important hobby to others (like myself). We can make long lasting friends here. Or we can play on our own to feel that thrill we don&#039;t always experience in our normal day to day life. Whether we are Bronze or challenjour, we play this game because we enjoy it and it is not just a select few, but over 70 million of us. \r\n\r\nAnd yeah, yeah... &quot;You are not an LCS pro lmfao.&quot; I know.... don&#039;t remind me.... but even LCS pros had to start somewhere. They didn&#039;t all of a sudden get placed into Diamond 1 and they don&#039;t all play perfectly all the time either. And to them, a win or a loss still has a lot of meaning to them, just like it does to many of us. \r\n\r\nSo please, don&#039;t let &quot;this is just a game&quot; be an excuse to keep playing poorly in a ranked match and an excuse to not learn from it. If you don&#039;t want to learn or get better, then stay out of ranked. If you plan to go into ranked not caring if you win or lose, then stay out of ranked. That is what is normals is for. \r\n\r\nCourtesy of an avid League of Legends Player,\r\n\r\n\r\nAirman CompSci","replies":[{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2016-06-04T07:25:02.236+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"And that is completely correct.
