Any RP would be greatly appreciated. \n\nI sincerely dedicate this Injured Poro picture to any verbally and emotionally abused Rioter who may read this. \nThis is the meaning behind the picture: \nAn injured poro who drew a peace sign around his eyes, is surrounded by a bunch of angry people at Boards. \nThe poro represents people (actual living human beings who have feelings) that works for Riot. The angry people represents **some** of the players who are negative and toxic towards the Rioters. There has always been toxicity towards Riot, but lately, I've seen a lot of it. The comments said by the people in the picture are directly from the comments I read in Boards or hear people say. The poro received a cut on his eye but made that cut be the long stroke in  the peace sign he drew around the cut. That simply symbolizes how politely Rioters respond to incredibly negative comments- even to a point where it doesn't make sense socially. In general, the picture depicts how careless words can deeply wound someone and cut at their heart. \n\n_Imagine a possible scenario with me_. You worked really hard on this project for days- weeks, and sleep had been a second thought. I mean this was something that was suppose to reward the players and you were so driven to make that reward feel like an actual reward. You feel so excited and happy to have finally finished it. You as a designer feel connected with your project, it has become a part of you- something you are proud of. You and your team had finished making Victorious Graves. You are grinning and laying back on your chair to catch some rest while the rest of the team is eagerly waiting for the response from the online player base. First post= \"victorious graves in-game model is trash\". Second post= \"wow vic. graves is garbage\". Third post= \"damn, the designing team really didn't try on this one\". Fourth post= \"Are you fucking serious, what a waste of a skin\"... The team tells you the response and some of them are mad, others are quiet and sad. As for you, you are torn between feeling wasted + disappointed in yourself and wanting to somehow explain to the assumptive comments that you actually tried really hard on making the skin. \n\nYes, a lot of the people are angry and sometimes rightfully so. Even some of the comments in the picture speak truth to the existing problems. And yes, I'm a goddamn hypocrite. I was super against the Lore Change for Varus and even posted this: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/W7wkwAsL-a-conversation-riot-hq-after-changing-varus\nI even up voted very negative comments as well. (and downvoted Rioter comments only because it was downvoted by others/or after reading the first line). However, I don't think it's too late for me to change and be positive and constructive in my criticism/comments. \n\n_\"Sticks and Stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me\"\n           -a liar _\n\nEverything was done by Paint 3D. I'm not an artist so this took hours. Partially cuz it crashed half way. Always remember to save  along the way :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-04T03:06:51.411+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y'know, this meant so much to me personally that I actually had to put the post off to the side to make sure I devoted enough time to write the answer it deserved. \n\nIt's understandable that people are heated, and unfortunately, a lot of that heat was displaced on the Support Agents here in H&S (who sadly can't make game design or balance changes like the players wanted). We do our best in trying to make sure people know the best places to leave important feedback, but sometimes it can look like we're deflecting. That's definitely not the case. We hear you, some of us even agree with your sentiments sometimes, but we have to be sure to deliver that feedback to the right people. They don't let us mere poro's mess with code  and such!\n\nAt the end of the day, we still do our best to either directly solve problems or get players over to the right people who can dive deeper into the issue and get in fixed. Sometimes, the fix just needs more time to be finished (in the case of account transfers) but you can be sure we'll do what we can to make sure players know what's going on when we can.\n\nAnd you aren't a hypocrite either! Players are allowed to dislike new content, especially if they preferred the old version (IE Varus). It's perfectly alright and encouraged to discuss those kinds of things, but the line does need to be drawn somewhere. We can't let groups of people of specific individuals get attacked for something in a video game!\n\nOnto the matter at hand. Someone needed some RP I believe? Be sure to check your account, you should have gotten enough for at least another chest/key ^_^.","replies":[{"poster":"Chaeyeoní","date":"2017-12-04T05:33:07.897+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad the picture meant a lot to you :) And you shed light on how some problems require more time to be fixed and that's definitely true. It's hard for us as the player base to fully understand what's going on in the inside, but there is a difference when we refuse to even try to understand and demand immediate fixes. \n\nThanks for the RP!!\n{{sticker:galio-happy}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Real Sexy Yoona","date":"2017-12-03T12:18:48.493+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn son.
