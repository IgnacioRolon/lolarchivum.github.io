He may queue up with some fans, but that has no bearing on the enemy team.  You can't choose your enemy unless it's a custom.  Teambuilder, Draft, and Blind normals are all matchmaking modes.\n\nIn some of his videos, he even flat out states that he has had to try multiple times *because his off-meta pick didn't work*.","replies":[{"poster":"True Lizard","date":"2015-03-16T11:18:38.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"they are rigged the only one who can prove they aren't is him and he will obviously say its not because it will make him look like what he is.

Anyone who looks at his match history on a third party site can clearly see when he's playing a custom or a matchmade game.\n\nCase in point: [Break the Meta Ep145 - BEST LANE EVER Lulu & Vladimir Bottom!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT9008EzDI)\n\nThis game was also on his Twitch livestream, where viewers could see that it was a matchmade normal.

Leaverbuster is only concerned with what happens after a game starts, but there absolutely is a set of punishments for dodging games that escalate. It starts with 5 minutes and, if I remember correctly, can get up to like 1-2 hours of a 'time out', but it's only a one time delay, not a long-term like leaverbuster's lpq.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Ruin Sage","date":"2015-03-16T09:23:48.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"someone is salty cuz solwolf would whip ur ass with a jungle bard even if you had ur best champ.
