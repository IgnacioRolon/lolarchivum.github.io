Whether it is people talking about porn sites or (mostly) how horny they are, I can&#039;t get away from it. I tell them that that they are being nasty and inappropriate but there isn&#039;t really a report category for that particular behavior. Please consider adding this category in the reporting section.\r\n\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"x R e n g a R x","date":"2016-05-21T14:18:29.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as they're not trolling or being toxic, I don't see why saying 'im horny' is a bad thing.\n\nKids nowadays know about sex before they even turn 10. \n\nIf you don't like what people are talking about or it's distracting you from playing...you can mute them.","replies":[{"poster":"Firu","date":"2016-05-21T14:26:21.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the point is, the OP views explicit talk like that as inappropriate.

It's similar enough.  If we added this category than it would make confusion between Unsportsmanlike Conduct and/or Verbal Abuse.
