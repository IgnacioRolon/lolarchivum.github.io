And he straight up needs a new E. Like he pulls his soldiers to him or something. The mobility and shield gives him waaay too much, and it's super uninspired. At the very least give an incentive for blocking him. Like instead of damaging who he touches, he increases the damage of the soldier he E's to.\n> \n> I understand the Shurima Shuffle thing is cool and all, but when his entire lane pattern post-6 is to all-in the enemy laner every time they show their face you know something's not right.\n\ndont forget the knockup ^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sinneli","date":"2015-07-21T09:19:18.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir is, much like other DPS mages, reliant on positioning. He does not thrive in the middle of the teamfight, but rather,on the backlines. He can engage and create a wall which prevents movement to prevent assassins from coming in, but allow me to tell you about this. \n\nAzir is vulnerable after a dash. He has no method of escaping afterwards except his ultimate. \nIn a teamfight situation, an assassin coming from the side towards Azir will leave him completely undefended if he used his soldiers Q. Forget summoning a soldier again. He can only focus on one zone to attack for soldiers present. Either the front-line or the back.  If he recalls his soldier to get rid of an assassin who might burst him down, the front-line will suddenly lack the high DPS on a certain zone where the soldiers had been. \n\nTo counter Azir properly, being in two lines instead of one fight in the middle would be a better strategy. Tank in the middle, mages and ADC walking around the edge. Soldiers can only attack in a synchronized format. \n\nIt will reduce his DPS output immensely on an entire team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Myrddin","date":"2015-07-20T21:17:10.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a useless one in a couple days","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sea Cappy","date":"2015-07-20T19:33:23.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's the kind of mage that wins, that's what he is {{champion:268}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"stealthfox94","date":"2015-07-20T18:37:12.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir is a classic case of Riots designers getting over their heads.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-07-20T17:08:23.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on how you focus your build.
