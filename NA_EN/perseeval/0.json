It starts at a speed of 12 thousand KBps, and drops quickly to 2 thousand, slowly reducing afterward until it is lower than 200 KBps. The estimated time for installing goes from 20 minutes at first to over 200 minutes, and rising. I'd really like to start playing the game, but this problem is preventing me from doing so. I have added the launcher to be an exception from my Firewall as other fixes online pointed toward doing that, but it hasn't improved. My download speed is 150mbps which translates to about 18 MBps, and this is the speed I get on other apps like steam or if I download anything through a web browser, so the problem isnt with my internet.\r\n\r\nAny help with this issue would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-08T01:33:27.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's likely just the download speed normalizing itself. It starts off really high sometimes if it hasn't actually calculated the dl rates, so then it eventually levels out at the actual speed. It's not entirely uncommon to get varied download speeds depending on what server the dl is coming from, but I would still make sure to try a few adjustments with your network to see if you can get some faster speeds.\n\nMy first suggestion would be to [**adjust the DNS server settings for your connection**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq5). Follow the steps outlined in that guide, and check out the other options as well if DNS settings aren't helping.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jendrok","date":"2018-01-07T03:36:12.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I am having the same issue. Although I have slower internet speeds at 25Mb/s but I get those speeds in steam and not in LoL.","replies":[]}]}
