It is a ranked team that I have been working on for a while, players have come and go due to them not fitting what the team is about, and not having the right attitude.\r\n\r\nThe team requirements are:\r\n-Friendly\r\n-Knows what they are doing in lane(you're not expected to be a godly top laner that can do everything, but you still gotta know what you're doing, and be willing to take advice and still be able to improve)\r\n-Have the ability to maintain a positive attitude\r\n-Skype\r\n\r\nThe team requires these because we expect to have as much  synergy as we can, and be able to mesh with the other teammates currently. We are a joking kind of bunch right now, and will keep an attitude of having fun and positivity, while doing our best no matter what.\r\n\r\nNow for some background on the team. It has had players come and go, some that are still friends, some aren't, as they did not have a bond with the team, or me. Some that were in the team were plat, diamond, gold, silver, and some bronze. I was even in the team when I was bronze, and a couple members right now are bronze, but they meet the requirements, and have managed to show me that they belong.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to join, tell me your summoner name, your division, and your top five champions for either top or mid. You will have to go through some trial games, as we want to make sure you work well with the team.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this, just add me on League if interested.\r\nSummoner name: RoyStealth\r\nServer: North American","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Narwhale","date":"2014-11-23T21:32:00.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN Duke Narhwale\nRank: Silver 5\nMid: Zed, Ahri, Xerath, Veigar, Syndra","replies":[]},{"poster":"Legi","date":"2014-11-23T21:12:37.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"summoner name: Legi\n\nRank: gold 5\n\nTop: Riven Jax Nasus Irelia","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poppy Molly","date":"2014-11-23T21:12:28.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ign - Poppy Molly\nRank : G5 - decayed to S2\nTop : Renekton - poppy - darius - jax - irelia - very flexible and capable of playing most top.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SKT T1 Mid","date":"2014-11-23T21:09:40.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ign: selfz\nd4\nmid: zed yas ori yas, mostly situtational picks","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Madlife","date":"2014-11-23T21:06:14.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summoner name: PlzKillMyADC\nRank: Plat 5\nTop Champs For Mid: Orianna, Yasuo, Xearth, etc. I work with whatever our team chooses.","replies":[]}]}
