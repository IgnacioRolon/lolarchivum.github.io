That only added fuel to the fire. &quot;nice guys finish last&quot; - &quot;youre garbage&quot; - &quot;its cuz your nice youre bad&quot;, etc. He starts going after my religion - &quot;lol this guy is only nice because of his Christian upbringing.&quot; Uh... I&#039;m not religious, but okay. &quot;how can you even do badly on ryze in urf&quot;? Well, I made stupid decisions early on, the opposing laners are better than me, I&#039;m still not good at Ryze, and they have better synergy than I did with Riven? This is a bad game for me. &quot;lol no I bet it isn&#039;t&quot; I mean, unless I intentionally fed every game, I would have some games where I did well, because even if I was one of the worst players in the world, I&#039;d be matched up against other terrible players and probably have some decent games against them because they&#039;re on my level.\nOf course, logic doesn&#039;t work. At the end of the game, he keeps flaming me. &quot;report this ryze for being literal s&&&&quot; Asking for reports is reportable, you know. &quot;go report me then&quot; - &quot;uninstall&quot; - &quot;go kill yourself&quot; - &quot;go kill yourself&quot; - &quot;go&quot; - &quot;kill&quot; -  &quot;yourself&quot; &quot;GO&quot; &quot;KILL&quot; &quot;YOURSELF&quot;. I already heard you, man. \n&quot;go kill yourself and be with your god&quot; {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n\nWhat a guy.\nFunny thing was, even after having a terrible game and a guy flaming me for the whole match, I wasn&#039;t even angry. First of all, it got to be kind of amusing how he kept flaming me when I acknowledged how badly I was doing. Secondly, I&#039;m playing URF! Why the hell should I let my fun get ruined by this atrocious member of the community? I get to do what I want in my games, so if that means having fun, then I&#039;m going to have fun, especially in URF mode. Furthermore, I won&#039;t ever give up because of one of these people. Even if I&#039;m doing terribly and they tell me to afk, I&#039;ll keep trying to turn the game around regardless. Being 0/8 doesn&#039;t mean that I give up on pushing waves, warding, and helping in teamfights, even if I have a good chance of being killed without chance of retaliation by AP Blitzcrank.\n\nDon&#039;t let toxic players tilt you, and don&#039;t let a bad score tilt you either. Realize that you&#039;re so much better than them because you&#039;re not the flaming one; you&#039;re not the person trying to intentionally put people down and break their wills. Realize that it&#039;s just one game (even if it&#039;s ranked) - it&#039;s just one game! You can do better next time, and in the long run, no one will care about that game. You most likely won&#039;t care about it either in the far future, so stop caring about it so much now. (What I am saying is not to not acknowledge your mistakes. Acknowledging mistakes is good, but beating yourself up over them is not.)\nThe way I manage to do this is by being friendly in game. As long as you keep up a positive attitude, it is really difficult to get tilted. You realize that you&#039;re just playing a game, that everyone including you is playing to have fun, and that a good person would try to make the game more enjoyable for others since you&#039;d like other people to do that for you. Players that flame you for being friendly are just being stupid, because friendly people are the ones that will improve the state of the community.","replies":[{"poster":"AgeOfTheMage","date":"2017-03-05T16:34:25.486+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"mmhm, keeping a positive attitude is the key to victory!","replies":[{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2017-03-05T21:00:43.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AgeOfTheMage,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=8WEyy2f9,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-03-05T16:34:25.486+0000)\n>\n> mmhm, keeping a positive attitude is the key to victory!\n\nThanks!

In many professional sports if someone is constantly being a jerk to other people then it doesn't matter how skilled they are at the game, they'll still be punished for behaving poorly. From [Ulanopo's Knowledge Base](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4086541&page=6#post43663877): \n\n>**\"If you kids report and punish things like this, you're going to be in trouble when you get out in the real world.\"**\n\n>This is a subset of the oversensitivity argument, but I feel it warrants separate treatment.\n\n>You're making the highly unwarranted assumption that the people who punish for \"noob\" lack real-world experiences. If you were to ask the TBI regulars, you would find that almost all of us are at least in their late 20's, if not significantly older. Most of us have at least undergraduate degrees. So, this idea that we're all naive little children is more than a little silly.\n\n>Also, we know that professional players dislike people who spend their time typing because math. Not only are the report rates for the highest tiers not significantly lower than anywhere else (this from Lyte), but the pros know how that kind of behavior affects play. Someone who is on tilt is throwing the game just as much as the person who is playing poorly.\n\n>The truth of the matter is that the loose cannons end up having their misbehavior overshadow their skill. Look at Dennis Rodman. There has never been a better rebounder. Ever. But his legacy is not that he was basically a human vacuum. No, it's that he was out of control, both on and off the court.\n\n>In short, this is a stupid argument if you know anything about the people who are reporting and punishing you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-03-06T23:18:11.901+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um...\n\nYou can be nice AND be good at the game you know.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-05T10:41:38.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, Ryze is pretty bad in URF.
