This is the 2nd time this has happened, and so far it has always been a day before a patch around midnight or so. When the game ended everythinf was back to normal, but i got into a 2nd game, and again i got an error for the first 5 mins. It finally let me connect and after that i had no more problems.  I wasnt the only one experiencing this as i saw other as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WrongFatal","date":"2016-09-21T06:02:24.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem.....","replies":[{"poster":"Akwa","date":"2016-09-21T06:05:13.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WrongFatal,realm=EUNE,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=Fqjt5Q9V,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-21T06:02:24.465+0000)\n>\n> same problem.....\n\nSadly i got a leave, so i hope i dont get penalized","replies":[{"poster":"WrongFatal","date":"2016-09-21T06:13:46.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i sadly penalized , when the champ screen come and  it loading to  enter it disconnect...","replies":[]}]}]}]}
