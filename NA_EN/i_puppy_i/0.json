Then it will be fine for a minute or two and all of a sudden you cant cast your spells, you can't flash, and oh is that a Kat coming your way? Made me lose a game in my promos so i'm definitely not fuming about that.. They reported me for afk even though for half the game I was winning my lane just fine. Anyway.. My internet and ping are fine, so it shouldn't be something with my internet (I think). Several seconds or maybe not at all after I've tried to type a message or use an ability it will do it, or it will get some of the letters i typed in a message, so ive sent a garbled cry for help to my teammates. I guess it's probably something wrong with my computer, but I have no idea what. I'd really appreciate some help if anyone sees this has even the faintest notion of what may be wrong. I tried googling it to see if anyone else had this problem but it's kinda hard because im looking for \"I CAN walk\" but most results are for \"I CANT walk\"","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-14T03:27:30.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds suspiciously like really bad bursts of [packet loss.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss) Most of the time, this is caused by either issues along your network routing to the servers or local network settings that conflict with League.
