This what I'm going to explain doesn't happen only in League of Legends but in every game, anyways I chose this forum to try to help me!\r\n\r\nLet's get into the simple but annoying problem I'm having. Basically, my spacebar just doesn't want to work sometimes for like 10 seconds, then it starts working and sometimes \"presses\" the spacebar unreasonably many times without me pressing them (even if I don't press the spacebar once while it's not working it still makes many spaces after it starts working).\r\nIt's not a hardware issue, because my spacebar is working just chill when not IN-GAME. So all I'm trying to ask is that if anybody knows any possible solutions for this. Believe me, this gets pretty annoying when trying to type something in the chat very fast but you have to wait 10 secs for your space to start working, in some cases it actually killed us but that's not important it was just my fault.\r\n\r\nThanks for help! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-26T20:27:07.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could have a bad config file that's not reading your input properly, though it's fortunate it's only the spacebar in this case.  :P  A config reset could fix this up!\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.\n\nLet me know if it does the trick!","replies":[{"poster":"Tuwinn","date":"2017-05-20T20:25:52.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this exact same issue, but your suggestion did not fix the problem for me. My \"spacebar\" continues to stick. It's been like this for 2-3 months. I have uninstalled/re-installed the game. I have even REFORMATTED my PC and it STILL sticks for no apparent reason. \n\nMost of my sentences in-game end up like this: \"botmia\", \"whydidyoustay?Theirwholeteamwasseigingbot\", \"quick,Baron,thendrag\"\n\nIt's incredibly annoying when trying to type to your team. For the first time in 2-3 months, I ran into someone in-game who had the same issue. For the longest time, I just thought it was my hardware in someway, even though the \"spacebar\" never sticks outside of League of Legends. \n\nDo you mind looking into this issue further?","replies":[]}]}]}
