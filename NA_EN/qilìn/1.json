I've reached out to our Network Technicians to investigate. If you have a chance, I'd like you to run some traceroutes so I have more data to provide them. Grab the networking tool [WinMTR](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/a5e0UdGB-unknown-log-in-issues), then run a trace to the IP Address 104.160.131.1 for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes has passed, export the results as text, then paste them to [this thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/a5e0UdGB-unknown-log-in-issues), where we're tracking this issue for now.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
