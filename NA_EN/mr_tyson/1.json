For everyone who hates how Hashinshin plays, I do too. Thats' not the point. Hashinshin is consistent in how he plays the game - bad. Hashinshin use to be a master tier player. He is now D3. He will probably continue to demote based on his playstyle over time. But I think we can agree that Hashinshin isn't some boosted Gold player. He earned his D3 ranking by playing over 1350 games, rarely duo'd, had a 25 game win streak in which he hit masters for a day.\r\n\r\nHashinshin, a Diamond 3 player, ran into a smurf account of Adrian Riven. Adrian is challenger. Hash, perhaps because he watched worlds and thought \"Viktor top seems like a kool pick, maybe I'll try him out top\", locked in a champ he has no experience playing. Against one of the top 200 players in our region. It's pretty predictable what happened.\r\n\r\nI'm sure people will talk about how Hashinshin did X incorrectly. At what point did being bad turn into a 14 day suspension?\r\n\r\nThe season will be ending shortly, and the ranked ladder will be reseting. Is Riot going to be issuing bans to me because I have the misfortune of laning against Bjergsen, or Doublelift, or Sneaky, or any pro going through placement matches? I watched one of Fakers placement matches this year, and he went 18/0 at 13 minutes on Vladimir. This is now bannable?\r\n\r\nThe thing that makes shit situation so bullshit is that Hashinshin has always played like this. He didn't decide 'You know what, I'm losing so I'm going to run it down'. I've seen Hashinshin down 0/3/0 on Jax, jump in and get good trades off/kills. He does it all the time. It's his thing. It's why when a jungler know Hashinshin is on the enemy team, they camp top because he overextends. EVERY. SINGLE. GAME. 1350 diamond games to be exact. And today, he had the misfortune of running into a Challenger player smurfing in D3, and Riot banned him for it.(Not to mention, he was banned for selecting a champion he saw played on the world stage and isn't very good at, ARE YOU KIDDING WITH ME!!!!!!!!!)\r\n\r\nI better see smurfing banned in the future if this precedent continues. Otherwise I'm not entering lane if I think my opponent might be better than me.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-10-23T05:14:27.352+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"It doesn't really seem like it's intentional feeding; regardless, he should write into support about his suspension.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-10-23T03:18:50.836+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":6,"body":"I don't know what is funnier, defending hashinshin or the fact you have a post about feeders: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/ZgdjYxkj-riot-needs-to-fix-surrender","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Tyson","date":"2018-10-23T03:42:44.873+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":24,"body":"To be honest, I think my issue has always been leaverbuster.

Cheating the system is easy, if you are that vile. I would argue, Hashinshin got into the lane where he got outmatched, got tilted and started autopiloting against a challenger player, which results in getting stomped. This is not how \"soft inting\" works.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MegaLobunny","date":"2018-10-23T16:24:09.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Genuine question but what is soft inting?

Hashinshin jumped into a competitive scene with players attempting to win a match and decided to lock in the champion he has absolutely zero experience on meaning that he would most likely lose his match up and put his team at a disadvantage. Which makes it very frustrating for the players who are trying to win the hardest they can. Now look at the alternative, if you really wanted to learn how to play Victor top, there is literally a game mode called normals where the repercussions of losing doesn't matter and it gives you the opportunity to learn new things without jeopardizing other players. And he decided to do this in a competitive match where he knowingly jeopardized other people's games. Keep him banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-10-23T13:56:45.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"As much as i hate hash, thats not banable.

Hashinshin has a track record of giving up games on a daily basis if he's not winning lane. He is diamond only because of the amount of games he plays, it is impossible in League to play over 3000 games in a season and not hit Diamond, unless you go into any game looking to lose. Hashinshin has the mechanics, yes, he's not a complete ape, but he has no understanding of how to win the game, and has the weakest mental of any player I've ever seen alongside probably Tyler1.\nThe reason anyone even likes him is, since his game play is that of a bronze/silver, but with acceptable mechanics, since silver is the most represented division in ranked by player amount, people can relate to him, however, League should not revolve around people that can't or don't want to play the game properly. Hashinshin has been a nuisance for the League community for ages, and based on hundreds of his actions, should've gotten IP banned a long time ago.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Don Pasquale","date":"2018-10-23T15:39:15.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If smurfing was banned, and all smurf accounts were deleted, Riot would lose over 50% of their accounts/playerbase xD","replies":[]}]}
