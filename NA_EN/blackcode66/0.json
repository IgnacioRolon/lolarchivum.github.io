Even though my support was literally trolling me (taking cs, feeding, leaving me in alone in lane) and her duo harassing me over and over again, I get punished. Its nice to know how broken and completely STUPID your system is. I swear in chat and tell people to go F themselves because I'm being trolled and then blamed for it and I get punished.....makes sense. Legit you guys have to be some of the stupidest people ever to punish a player who was being targeted. Seriously great job... and since you guys clearly aren't to bright, I'm being sarcastic. Before you go and ban or punish someone go and check the actually game and not just pick out someone swearing out of frustration of being trolled, especially someone in the final game of their promos.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-05-28T20:52:23.053+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"The rules don't say \"you can't do this unless...\" they say \"you can't do this\".\n\nYour inability to control yourself does not make you not responsible for following the rules.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-29T00:20:35.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/rant","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-05-28T20:57:35.461+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Blackcode66,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=1EkRE4vT,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-05-28T20:44:42.575+0000)\n>\n>  my support was literally trolling me (taking cs, feeding, leaving me in alone in lane)\n\nAll three things you mentioned is not trolling.\n\n---\n\nThat on the side, the system punishes based on consistency x severity.  Meaning people can get punished for 1 game of extreme toxicity or many games of mild toxicity. \n\nBased on what you described as trolling, you probably have many games where you accuse others of trolling. All those games add up and eventually get you punished.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2019-05-29T00:18:08.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hang on.
