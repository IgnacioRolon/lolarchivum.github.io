That argument in itself is subjective and opinionated. One persons opinion on a \"moment\" will differ from another's. This is a matter of you saying that NA sucks internationally, and you are solely basing that argument upon Worlds performances. Let me remind you who won IEM Katowice :TSM. You can't just base a regions performance internationally by just looking at Worlds performance. This is especially true this season where two of the three NA teams at Worlds had major team problems going in; TSM & CLG and yet we still went 7-12 at Worlds as a region. If you even are going to try and bring up IEM San Jose as another international competition to defend your argument I'm going to shoot that down as well. \n\nTSM: 5 days of practice with the roster they brought to IEMs. (2 out of the 5 players are new to NA, 4 out of the 5 players are new to TSM) They still sweep LGD (CH)\n\nCLG: In the process of cleaning up their team and securing their roster, there were dissatisfactions within the team about the organization; Aphro, Darshan. They bring the rookie Stixxay in as well.

And if you look at all worlds ever, NA has placed top 3 once, TSM in season 1, and that was a long time ago. Every other region has reached at least second place. And in 2 worlds, 2013 and 2015, no NA advanced beyond where they were placed.\n\nAnd I am not saying that NA is miles behind or anything, NA can compete with other regions, even KR on occasion. Shown mainly by TSM and C9 at 2014 worlds and at this most recent IEM San Jose, as you mentioned.\n\nAlso you mentioned IEM tournaments, at IEM World Championships, the LoL winners have been NA once, TSM at the most recent IEM Katowice. IN the other IEM World Championships 2 were Korean, and 2 were EU.\n\nSo while it is obvious NA is competitive, and also steadily improving, they are still historically, and currently, one of the weaker of the 5 regions. And my main point in my original post was that I don't like it when Europeans and Koreans join the NA scene, because it makes NA look like they are getting carried, and not improving, as I think they are. \n\nHave a nice day.","replies":[{"poster":"64851012DEL1","date":"2015-12-08T00:36:22.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So now you refuted your original statement which was \"Like I know NA sucks internationally\" by saying \"I am not saying that NA is miles behind or anything\" you make it very hard to reason with when you seem to change your viewpoints every 3 posts. Also NA in Season 6 will be top 3 regions with ease. With the focus now being upon bringing together a better coaching staff and adopting the KR style of coaching, as well as teams now going to EU (they speak English - Common language is very important) instead of KR and CH for players we will see NA certainly shoot up as top 3 region this year. NA will easily be one of the more completive regions this year as well. With teams like the new TSM, the newly focused CLG, the promoted RNG, the completely KR/CH NRG (with exception of Moon + Altec) the new C9, and the possibility of whatever team is going to form or replace out of Gravity's spot, let's not forget Team Liquid as well, even without Quas their line up is still very strong. Even Dignitas can make a showing this year, however unlikely it seems. The point is that this will be the first time that NA will have multiple world class teams competing for the 3 worlds spots. Season 6 will be the first time that NA will actually have more than 2 or 3 world class teams lol. It's no longer TSM vs CLG vs C9. Now let's look at the other regions like EU. EU is especially going to weaker this year. Remember that they only had 2 world class teams in OG and FNC. With 3 of the 5 players on FNC leaving this will either be a great year for FNC if they get lucky with their rookies or their contracts, but more likely it will be a rebuilding year. OG however is unquestionably the number 1 team in EU right now, and should continue to stay strong. After that it's really just a battle for 3rd and 4th place regionally.
