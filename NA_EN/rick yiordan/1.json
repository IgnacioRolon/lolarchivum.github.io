I've waited for about five minutes until I just gave up and closed it.

I would suggest reinstalling the game over night or something, unless your internet is less than 500kb/s it wouldn't ever take that long or longer to reinstall. Plus, not doing anything and simply waiting for it to fix itself will most likely take longer. The client crashing like that is either an issue with settings which could potentially be fixed, but unlikely considering it's just the launcher, and who knows what that setting could be. I'd just reinstall if I were you. It wouldn't take long, and it'll most likely solve this issue unless it's a problem with your computer itself. Which is a possibility, but not a likely one.","replies":[{"poster":"Rick Yiordan","date":"2016-11-29T00:41:49.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"alright, thanks\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1lps3z/if_client_is_not_starting_heres_the_fix_enjoy/\n\nive been using this reddit post to help me fix my problems (even if its outdated) but ive had no luck, im reinstalling it right now but it won't even open, popping up to the title but crashing a minute after.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
