I then went positive every game after that, and got a few honors here and there. It has been around 2 weeks since my ban was gone, and 2 weeks of this positivity, but my honor level doesn't seem to level up. Does anyone know if you can actually progress to honor level 3, or get back to a honor level after you have been demoted? Or does it start fresh in Season 8?","replies":[{"poster":"Hush Of Night","date":"2017-07-28T09:57:49.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With RIOT, the things are really simple. You can be 7 seasons maximum positive with honor level 5 and full honors and in a bad day of flaming you will get a permanent ban. SO SIMPLE. \nYou can demote to honor level 1 in just one bad day and trying for whole months of positivity to get back to honor level 2. Good Luck man.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-27T22:15:21.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can still rank back up in Honor even after getting a punishment like a chat penalty. It may take a bit, but I do see that you've been getting honor and gaining that honor experience.","replies":[]}]}
