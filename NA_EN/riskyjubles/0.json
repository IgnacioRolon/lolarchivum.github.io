Well, the support bot gave me back my account and I once again have sole access (thank god.)\n\nUnfortunately, I had about 4-5k RP on the account before it was compromised. That's all gone now and my summoner name is also completely different. They must have spent the RP to change it, among other purchases.\n\nI put a ticket out about a week ago hoping support could revert the changes the hacker made, but I've heard nothing back yet. After having my account stolen, I'm also being ignored by riot....feelsbadman.\n\nIs this wait time normal to resolve such a serious issue? \n\nIf anyone can offer help or insight into what I should do next, I would be eternally grateful. Thanks so much!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T20:24:57.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As *DTN* mentioned, we're definitely not looking to ignore you. We've been pretty swamped with tickets lately, so response times are higher than normal. With your patience, an account specialist will grab your ticket and we can start working together to set things straight.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-09-26T00:01:03.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It may take some time for them to fully investigate the situation and recover any unauthorized changes made. They aren't ignoring it, they will get back with you as soon as they can. If you bump the ticket it'll take longer for a response because that puts it in the back of the queue. Please try to be patient, they will do everything they can, when they can.\n\nIf you don't get an answer in a few more days, make a new post and one of the Rioters on this board should see, or hit me up  and I'll see if I can poke Player Support to take a peek at your ticket and see what the holdup is.","replies":[{"poster":"RiskyJubles","date":"2016-09-26T03:57:40.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, I just wasn't sure what to expect from my ticket to be honest. It's just been painful after getting a near instant reply from the bot, and waiting while seeing all the damage that hacker did.\n\nWould you happen to know if reverting my account is in their power and goes along with policy? I know it sounds silly, but I now feel like my account is somewhat tainted, and I'd like to see everything they did with it removed.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-09-26T04:10:00.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Account security is the responsibility of the user, so they won't always reverse all the damage caused from an account compromise (usually behavioral punishments) but I have definitely seen many times where RP/IP purchases are reversed. What you want is possible, but I can't guarantee what decision they'll come to.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
