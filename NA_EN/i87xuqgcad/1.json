Gold 1+\n(will consider your rank from last season if provisional were harsh on you, we've all been there.)\n\nAbout the captain\nI'm 21, I've been playing league of legends since beta, and have played in various ranked teams throughout the seasons. I'm currently platinum 5. I'm extremely relax, and probably the easiest person to get along with. It's been a very long time since I've played in a serious ranked team, and entered some 5v5 tournaments and I long for that again. I'm a Computer Science Major, with a not so busy schedule. :)\n\nWhat I expect from my team\n1. Overall this is a game, so I expect everyone to have fun,\n2. I have 0 tolerance for raging! You make a mistake we analyze it, we learn from it, we move on.\n3. That everyone on said team is on at scheduled practice time, I understand life comes first but give your team a heads up so we can find a temp/sub to hold out. You're responsible for our time at that point, please don't waste it Q_Q.\n4. Bad manners, I've played in enough teams to see that one guy just bm the opposing team (spamming taunt or flaming in all chat at them), congrats you placed them on tilt, and made them feel worse that they are having an off game. (karma is around the corner), Also actions like that are removable from tournaments that behavior will not be tolerated.\n5. Team improvement off and on the field. You all are going to be friends! noxian's in arms!! I'd like to see my teammates playing together whether it's duo's, normals, 1v1 practicing champions, aram...etc. (shoot I might even drag you all into a game of hide and seek) :P\n\nWhat I have to offer\n1. Coaching I have several friends, ranging from challenger to gold willing to duo and provide coaching lessons on their off time.\n2. After game analyst, I'll have recordings and statistics of each of our games and will be able to provide 1 on 1 feedback.\n3. Almost 24/7 online time so if you need a duo partner, help with something, or complaint about a teammate.\n4. I'm a gifting addict, and since I win a lot of tournaments I have RP up the wazoo so expect myst gifts often lol (this is not a reason to join the team!!!)\n5. I have plenty of experience playing in teams, and knows what it takes to be a team captain, and shot caller if I must.\n\nRoster: \nMarksman: DaPika\nSupport: Available\nMid: Available\nTop: Rizhao\nJungle: Available\nSub1: Rasdori\nSub2: Lugh\nSub3: Available\n\nPractice Schedule\nWe will practice 3-4 times a week entering tournaments at least twice a month.\n\nTuesday 9pm central\nThursday 9pm Central\nFriday Undecided: Tournament times vary\nSaturday Undecided: Tournament times vary\nSunday Undecided: Tournament times vary\n\nApplication\n\nName:\nIGN:\nAge:\nMicrophone?:\nList of voice chats you have ready?\nRole:\nChampion spreadsheet or top 5:\n(Copy, this blank spreadsheet ->>Champion spreadsheet, fill it out or place your top 5 champions in that role (use example as guideline)) **\nHave you played competitively before?:\nSeason 4 rank?:\nSeason 5 rank?:\nCan you make practices consistently?:\nIf not what times are best for you?:\nAre you able to handle constructive criticism?:\nTell me about yourself?:\nWhat do you think you have to offer the team?:\nHow Noxian are you?:\n\nExample Application\n\nName: John\nIGN:Inimical Noxian\nAge: 21\nMicrophone?: Yes\nList of voice chats you have ready?: Teamspeak, curse, mumble, vent, skype, hangouts.\nRole: Mid main,\nChampion spreadsheet: Inimical Noxian Spreadsheet\nTop 5 champions:     {{champion:55}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:76}} \nHave you played competitively before?: Yes\nSeason 4 rank?: Gold I\nSeason 5 rank?: Plat V\nCan you make practices consistently?: Yes\nIf not what times are best for you?: _\nAre you able to handle constructive criticism?: Yes, without it how would I improve ..\nTell me about yourself?: (Already did)\nWhat do you think you have to offer the team?: A sparkling personality, experience, and a level headed player.\nHow Noxian are you?(joke question): I'm so noxian that I'm legally changing my last name to noxus!","replies":[{"poster":"TheRealBubba","date":"2015-03-21T03:55:36.448+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name: Chris\nIGN: TheRealBubba\nAge: 21\nMicrophone?: all day\nList of voice chats you have ready? cv, adobe, ts, skype, rc\nRole: adc(main) can play any position though since I have good understanding of the game overall\nChampion spreadsheet or top 5: adcs: {{champion:104}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:222}}  \nIf needed for a different position i can practice whatever champions the team needs.\nHave you played competitively before?: yes, in league and in CoD\nSeason 4 rank?: gold 2\nSeason 5 rank?: plat 5\nCan you make practices consistently?: whenever needed, just depends on school schedule, but communication can help\nIf not what times are best for you?: im a college student nights are best.\nAre you able to handle constructive criticism?: its what i live for.
