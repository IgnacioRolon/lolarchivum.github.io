You should see some of the stupid comps me and my friends have done that work.  5 supports, 5 tanks with zzrot and banners, 5 mid etc.  So much stupid shit works because people aren't prepared for it.\n\nI will reiterate that having and adc is meta because it is the most optimal way to play the game (barring individual champions and skill levels) to get the highest win rate.  That doesn't mean its the only way to win but again, you should always have an adc on your team in ranked.","replies":[]}]}
