All of the champion listed above have specific niches at least, and can at least function on their own.\n\nElise is really weak, but she's still able to actually do her job.\n\nOlaf is anything but weak thanks to that bullshit buff on his ultimate.  He's still a clunk to play with a doubled up kit, but he's not anywhere close to the weakest.\n\nGangplank is pretty bad in his \"meta\" role.  But take him as a tank jungler or a bot lane support, and he's actually a very good off meta pick.\n\nVeigar is actually in a good spot balance-wise right now, it's just the bullshit LeZed meta counters his playstyle.  Once those two are eventually whack a moled, he'll come back.\n\nZilean is really bad.  Like Skarner bad after his rework.  He's extremely clunky to play, and nowhere near as satisfying.\n\nRyze has been turned into a cookie cutter mage, but you can faceroll and get pentakills, it's just he's building Iceborn Guantlet instead of Frozen Heart thanks to Riot's CDR on his ultimate.\n\nEvelynn is trash.  She's old Sion bad in terms of kit synergy, and can't sustain in jungle or in lane.  If Bard didn't exist, Evelynn would be the worst champ in the game right now.\n\nKassadin is ok.  He's weak, but his ultimate is so ridiculous it makes up for his weak numbers and bad laning.\n\nBard has only one damaging ability, is squishy, and doesn't scale particularly well.  No amount of number tweaks is going to balance him.

Oh GP. I love playing you mid, but you just can't be buffed because I know how annoying it is to lane against you.

Damage, speed boost, they all feel worse and very hard to really make use of, not to mention Chronoshift no longer being rewindable, and still costing more than 100 mana.\n\nAbout Ryze I still don't know much, I'm afraid, but I know his winrate dropped with a rework that gave him counterplay (See: Veigar and Zilean)\n\nEve actually doesn't seem to be that bad compared to those others.
