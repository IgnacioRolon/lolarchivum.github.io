He can remove all slows, gain -30% incoming damage, -30% incoming CC, and also gains 20% more MR and AR as a secondary passive. He has a free Ghost every 8 seconds that also chunks peoples health with 140% AD scaling with a 2.5 second SILENCE. This isn't even reminding you that his ult can do more than 60% of a Carry's health.\n\nGaren is absolutely ridiculous, he has very little counterplay. You can't \"kite\" him because he has a Ghost that late game, is only on a 3.5 second cooldown if you include it's duration, and he just silences you making any mobility very difficult unless it's just movement speed. Even then his base movement speed is 345.\n\nDiana has mana, and fair cooldowns, she has very easy to dodge skillshots and if you dodge her Q she can't do a whole lot to you without being close to her. Diana has much, much more counterplay than Garen and to be honest I'm very shocked he isn't played competitively. Who knows though, Ryze and Urgot were all considered trash-tier, but you saw how quickly that changed. I think almost totally due to the LCS, Ryze was gutted when people were actually demanding buffs for him a day before and calling him still \"unplayable\"","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-06-30T06:09:19.444+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Oh my jesus is someone trying to argue fucking {{champion:86}} as being overpowered all the sudden?

She is a burst assassin that goes in and gets her primary targert, tell me what mana regen item you get? I can tell you all need is {{item:3001}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3285}}  not only does she not need mana regen, but the cdr is not need because her cooldowns are fine as they are. If you look at most if not all no one gets a mana item sorry, and thats why she is gated by mana early-mid game until she gets a blue. And yes Diana does lose to Akali early, its a skill matchup she may win may not, but if akali gets ahead she can easily snowball a lane against diana. And sorry to tell you this, but those match up i listed are match ups she wins and loses in, If you look at higher elo play and or at gold-challenger you can see the skill difference in each champ and how diana sizes up to it.","replies":[{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2015-06-30T18:17:46.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only get {{item:3165}} if I have been spamming spells but I rarely do that.

No where I mean no where would i swap one of my items for morello.
