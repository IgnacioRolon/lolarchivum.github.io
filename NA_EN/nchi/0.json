Its still annoying though, so maybe, just maybe we can test this early for him?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-13T00:36:50.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is he using any third party programs?  Apps like play.tv and replays have been known to crash the client during champion select.  If that doesn't help, have him send us a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
