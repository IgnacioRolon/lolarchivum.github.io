If you can offer me some more context like error messages you're receiving I can get a better idea, but based on this it sounds like your settings are blocking installation.  Firstly, you should redownload[ visual c++](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3387) because it's a necessary windows product and needed to install.\n\nOnce you've got that back, run through the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to add League as an exception.  That should do it!","replies":[]}]}
