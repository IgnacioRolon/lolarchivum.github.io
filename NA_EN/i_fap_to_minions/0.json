I was given the silver border/icon when they were given out in November, but after a week or so both the border and icon disappeared from my account, and as of writing this I have the default border and no rank icon. My rank is still Silver 3, and I did not go unranked from inactivity when the end of season rewards were given out. Why would this have happened? My account was on a two week ban during the end of the season, but not chat/ranked restricted, would that be the reason? I've never been chat/ranked restricted","replies":[{"poster":"Hollymonster","date":"2014-12-26T19:16:41.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you write in a ticket here (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) our support specialists will be able to assist you.","replies":[{"poster":"        HinoT0M0","date":"2015-03-08T22:01:05.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holly I am starting this discussion and I hope you can participate and help me out.
