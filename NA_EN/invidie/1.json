Both have good and bad elements, and they simply opted for this one.","replies":[{"poster":"Invidie","date":"2018-03-23T21:19:55.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i was simply hovering miss fortune, but some one on my team intentionally banned it, that means he/she ruined my game, and according to riot, \"his/her deliberate choice to ruin league for others reflects a gross breach of community-defined standards\".\nso shouldn't he/she get punished for ruining my game?","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-03-23T21:23:48.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that action is not punishable.

The act of banning your champion is not. Players are allowed to ban whatever champion they want.

IF he/she feels a champ that will be detriment to the team, he is free to ban it for whatever reason.  If someone is stupid enough to blatant typed he used it to troll, then suck to be him.  Personally, if he feels that MF will be a detriment to the team when played by you, that's his choice.  If he did it because he feels it will help the team win, that is or at least should not be punishable.  If he did it purely to troll, that is punishable.  You cannot determine his intention from what you said he said.\n\nJust like you have your own choice of ban and no one is allowed to questioned you on it.\n\nI get my \"off-meta\" most played champ banned all the time which I suspect has something to do with someone looking up my profile.
