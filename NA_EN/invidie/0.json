Those things _can lead to a ban_, but there's a certain amount of flexibility built into the system. Riot's statistics show that the majority of toxicity comes from people who are normally not toxic, but are having a bad day (something like 60%, at last mention).\n\nYou have to understand that the IFS is based on what is almost certainly the largest gaming behavior data set in existence. Having access to that data allows them to predict pretty well who needs a wake up call and who doesn't.\n\nThat's why there isn't anywhere near a 100% ban rate.","replies":[{"poster":"Miyamoto Astolfo","date":"2018-06-05T01:32:49.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"by \"ban\" im referring to a 14 day ban. not many people expect to be completely shut down when it comes to free speech in this game by just typing a couple of words that dont really deserve a ban such as \"fa ggot\". i also never said anything about everyone getting banned or reported, i said that 4 people in every single match i have played deserve to get banned according to this post and the rules","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2018-06-05T04:35:31.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">not many people expect to be completely shut down when it comes to free speech in this game by just typing a couple of words that dont really deserve a ban such as \"fa ggot\".\n\nThe fact that you have to add the space to circumvent the filter kind of says otherwise to \"not many people\".
