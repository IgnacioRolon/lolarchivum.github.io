Not that I care entirely too much, as stated previously I have not played in quite some time preferring other games.\r\n\r\nSo mainly it&#039;s a curiosity thing and the fact that that this account is associated with me I need to know if it was accessed by a someone else.\r\n\r\nI have searched the forums and it seems at times there has been waves of accidental bans, is this perhaps the case? I&#039;ve never incurred an infraction nor smaller ban ever, I can&#039;t imagine what a permanent ban would require.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your reply\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: What I have gathered is that support is lacking; for instance, I just posted this in support and it was deleted and suggested I post here as opposed to just moving the post... I posted in support originally because it is a support issue, a problem with an error... why would I post in player behavior and modification when I insist I did not misbehave.  The tone here is all wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"WookieeCookie","date":"2016-09-24T03:09:42.532+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sickmind,\n\nYour account was locked temporarily because we saw suspicious activity on it after a long period of inactivity.

The point is that the bot accounts often make it allot more difficult for the newer/inexperienced players to win since the bot(s) that they're feeding will be able to out-damage anything the team of newer human players can dish out.","replies":[{"poster":"Cpt Jack Bird","date":"2016-09-27T13:20:46.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"We've seen Co-Op Vs.

Many sleepless nights and about a bajillion sketches later I am actually pretty decent. I specialized in 3D but you are exposed all aspects from figure drawing, 2D animation, rigging, production, you touch on just about everything. The instructors are top notch professionals culled from the industry, I had teachers from Disney, Dreamworks, Pixar etc. As far as the job market goes it can be very competitive, since graduation I have been earning a living doing editing and motion graphics for the Ad and Film Industry, both things I picked up in school and I still use the principals of animation all the time. In hindsight because of how much advertising and film uses Motion Graphics I would have changed my major to that as opposed to just Animation personally, there is tons of money to be made in ads.\n\nEDIT: I thoght the MOME (Motion Media) kids were way cooler to hang with then the Animation nerds lol. I'm a huge nerd... but woah it gets scary haha.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-09-23T17:39:55.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> there has been waves of accidental bans\n\nPeople can't keep their own login information safe and get banned for other people doing things on their account, or they are cheating and lying about far more often than the ban was an accident.
