But I'm sure that what 99% of the issues we're experiencing is the website just being down. I'm not sure if Riot HQ is aware but the account creation after being accepted has been down for around 2 weeks. Or maybe its just me. Because after I was accepted I haven't able to comment on posts it seems like. The account that this has happened to is TheWindWarden on NA. But I hope the website gets fixed soon cause I'm really looking forward to testing out the sandbox mode on PBE  {{item:3073}} https://pbesignup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/pbe-signup","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
