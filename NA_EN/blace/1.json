This could either something on my side not updated yet or the server possibly not sending the match update to our servers yet.  Hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can take a closer look and figure out what's going on.  We'll get back to you as soon as we can!","replies":[]}]}
