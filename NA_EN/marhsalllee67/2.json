I was Jinx with Annie support, the enemy had vayne and soraka. My support and I both quickly became frustrated at the fact that, no matter how much damage we did to vayne and/or soraka in trades, soraka would have both of them healed up to practically full within what felt like no time at all. We had multiple large skirmishes bot lane- the earliest of which were lost because, although we could get vayne and whoever else showed up fairly low, soraka&#039;s heals were enough to prevent us from getting the kills. And focusing soraka so that she can&#039;t help her team was not much of an option in a 4v4 in bot lane when there&#039;s a Jarvan ulting on top of you. We gained the upper hand in some fights, but overall, Soraka&#039;s ability to negate virtually all the damage we did helped the enemy lurch ahead in kills and carry the game for their victory.\r\n\r\nI didn&#039;t feel like I was getting outplayed. I didn&#039;t feel like I was getting out-farmed. \r\n\r\nI felt like we were losing simply because Soraka had mana and knew how to press R and click on vayne every time she took damage.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do against Soraka? How do you make one with more than half a brain actually lose trades in lane?","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2015-07-04T09:16:58.483+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Attack Soraka, she can't heal herself.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-07-04T09:19:31.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She can, its weak.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2015-07-04T09:24:19.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I barely count that have to land a skillshot to stay alive as a means of healing.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-07-04T09:28:49.564+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not to stay alive its to heal","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-07-04T20:37:47.973+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hard engage, support taking ignite instead of exhaust, etc.\n\nYou want to beat Soraka in lane before level 6, but despite that it has a long-ass cooldown. First, you want to focus Soraka. Pre-6, she can't heal herself if you don't get hit by her relatively easy to dodge Q. If you want to make this easier, keep your distance so the missile speed is slowed. Make sure to poke the adc a bit to ensure Soraka will heal them (costing her own health) and continue to focus her. Don't bunch together with your support, otherwise Equinox can hit you both. \n\nIf you can do this, you'll win lane. Soraka will not rush warmogs pre-6, she needs her sightstone for safety and her main support item and/or boots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NorthernDruid","date":"2015-07-04T10:44:38.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dodge them Qs.\n\nFocus Soraka enough to scare her away.\n\nBring Grievous wounds (doesn't help with her ult, but it helps with all her other healing as long as it's applied).\n\nAccept the fact that if the team peels well for their squishy healer so she can do her job you got outplayed by the team.\n\nOr try and get picks instead of huge teamfights. Soraka works really well in teamfigths because there's more people to land Qs on, people are to busy wth being trapped in J4 ult to dodge her Qs and with good positioning she can avoid getting hit most of the time.\n\nSpeaking of good positioning, Soraka needs it. Punish her whenever she's out of position.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-07-04T10:32:16.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would recommend that your support takes {{summoner:14}}, someone in the team should buy {{item:3165}} too. Also, there are some counterpicks to  Raka, {{champion:21}} is a nice option due to her W active AS steriod which also aplies Grievous wounds, reducing her healing to a 50%, same with ignite. A mobil adc like {{champion:67}}  and {{champion:236}} can avoid Soraka's Q, making her lose mana at trying to heal herself and do poke damage, giving you a nice advantage to wither Soraka down.

If you poke her down to at least half health, she'll have to think twice about healing people since it chunks her health even more.
