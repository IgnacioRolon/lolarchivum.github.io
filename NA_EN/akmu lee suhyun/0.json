You'll just do slightly worse than you did before, but you'll still take it over the other choices because it does something fundamentally different.\n\nI was under the impression that Nasus was switching over to Stormraider's Surge, though, and this might be the final push to make all the Nasus players switch.  But I don't see most of top lane switching to Strength of the Ages or Bond of Stone because of the nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2016-06-15T18:44:51.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea warlords or stormraiders was better anyway\n\ngrasp is nice and all but the extra lifesteal heals much more once you get some stacks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Flaherty","date":"2016-06-15T17:47:37.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still good for tanky top laners, just not as good for everyone else.","replies":[]}]}
