All of my sound options are up, but my music is muted. \n\nIt&#039;s only the abilities themselves that play the sound without her voice.\n\nAlso I keep hearing the same movement quotes that I feel that her other quotes are not playing as well.\n\n\nCould you guys look into this? \n\nEdit: I tested it in custom with all of my sounds up and it is definitely not working for classic LeBlanc\n\nEdit: I tested it again, but with Ravenborn LeBlanc and it is still not playing.","replies":[{"poster":"fancyassgrits","date":"2016-06-27T00:29:56.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely is to me, too.

Forgot to report it tho.\nGlad Riot does something about it now.\n\nAs far as IÂ´m aware, many champs and skins suffer from the same issue.\n@RIOT KATEYKHAOS pls tell the team to cut the Blackfrost Anivia taunt sounds. You have to wait 3 Seconds after a taunt to start a new one. I assume long silence at the end of each line.\nExample: Piltover Costums Blitzcrank. His special Horn sound which should play when activating his \"W\" barely plays at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-07-20T19:35:59.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report!
