In the video, you can clearly hear it. Also the mark is missing a visual specifically those lights that are going outward around the mark.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s just a bit irritating because I have mained her for years, and I still do, and I always hear her sound effects and I would notice right away when something is off.\r\n\r\nPlease re add those and thank you :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-04-19T16:14:51.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi SylvanasWrunner! \nThanks for the report! It looks like LeBlanc's revert may have broken this. ;-; I've got a ticket logged just now and have passed it on to the folks who worked on the kit revert. They should be able to get this fixed up. \n\n{{sticker:sg-kiko}}","replies":[{"poster":"SylvanasWrunner","date":"2018-04-20T10:15:11.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for taking this into consideration! Also one more thing about LeBlanc. Apparently with her passive Mirror Image, it used to produce sounds for both instances (When she goes into invisibility) and (When she comes out of stealth and deploys the clone)\n\nRight now it's only playing for the invisibility. Could you please perhaps once again forward it to the sound team and possibly restore the second one?

Just to be super transparent, these may not be prioritized in the next patch as they don't affect gameplay, but the goal is within the next few!\n\n**EDIT:** Logged everything and have 'em assigned out.","replies":[{"poster":"SylvanasWrunner","date":"2018-07-02T20:19:59.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I just want to know if there is any update on these missing sounds. They've been persisting for awhile now. I know it's not a big of an issue, but it is still a good part of what makes this skin unique.

The team's had other issues that have taken higher priority, but they're still wanted to fix these. No update to share in regards to an ETA at the moment.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
