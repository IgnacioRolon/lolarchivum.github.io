We do have other QA friends who cruise the boards for issues pertaining to their teams, though!","replies":[{"poster":"SylvanasWrunner","date":"2016-10-20T19:41:30.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't thank you enough now that all of her missing audios have been restored back to normal.
