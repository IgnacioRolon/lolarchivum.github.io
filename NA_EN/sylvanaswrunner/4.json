For some reason, when both of them got the total or exceeded 20 kills/assists, the event never triggered. \r\n\r\nI believe Lissandra first exceeded, then the enemy Ashe kinda died in a teamfight and got some assists from the fight which got her to 20 or more.\r\n\r\nI was hoping that in her resurrection, the event would finally trigger, but it didn&#039;t happen at all.\r\n\r\nIs the event bugged or something? or it&#039;s because of that situation?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-01T22:54:06.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nYou're right that they needed 20+ kills and assists! Was Lissandra or Ashe at least level 16?

That might've been the reason why it didn't trigger. But then after that we had more teamfights, and it still didn't trigger (I don't exactly remember)\n\nMaybe the game ended before the event could even trigger.\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2252817357/47213537?tab=overview\n\nThis was the game.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-02T21:19:07.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm. It's hard to tell from the match history itself what may have happened in this case. Both champions were 18 by the game's end, and had 20+ kills and assists. I was able to trigger it when testing internally. Did the quest bar pop up, or did nothing happen at all?
