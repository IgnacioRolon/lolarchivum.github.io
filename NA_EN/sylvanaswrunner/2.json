Obviously the other splashes are out on G.images but still the other splashes should be valued as well, and Ultimates used to make animations as well when browsed through the champion page and now they are stable for some reason\n\nEdit: So my login menu animation was off that is why it was not viewing other DJ Sona splashes. Thank you for the info Katey! :) \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Bergk","date":"2015-11-18T03:36:03.073+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, it wouldn't be hard at all for riot to do; they already made the art even. Just let us select the starting skin (the one you first load into the rift with) the same way we select chroma-pack skins, and that would also change the splash art (we can still toggle in game of course)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-18T19:42:17.672+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Bergk,\n\nThis is actually a bit more difficult than chroma pack tech - they're built a bit differently. It's something we could consider doing for another ultimate skin if it's something that includes toggling states.","replies":[{"poster":"Bergk","date":"2015-11-18T20:12:12.861+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I realise that as of right now Chroma skins don't change the splash art. Well then couldn't it be easily listed as three separate skins just in champion selection? That shouldn't break your splash art tech :)\n\n* DJ Sona-Kinetic\n* DJ Sona-Concussive\n* DJ Sona-Ethereal\n\nThat really should just be a simple copy-paste in the coding and then change the associated splash art image.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-18T21:10:55.473+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Based on DJ Sona's toggle tech, it's unfortunately not that simple. It's built into one package, not three different skins, if that makes sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Bergk","date":"2015-11-19T00:35:41.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for taking the time to respond to these posts. I truly do appreciate your time and feedback. \nBut it'd be perfectly acceptable to just outright say \"we just don't feel like it would be worth our programmers' time.\"\nBecause it certainly is doable. Honestly, I'm not trying to be a dick about it because I loved the skin enough to play it regardless. Sona is my second most played champion just because of that epic skin, I seriously never really played her before it. Keep up the great work at Riot! \nPS I'm super excited for Dragon Trainer Tristana! Have you heard any rumors of more \"Dragon Trainer\" skins? You don't have to give us any spoilers on which champs, just are there even considerations for more skins in the \"Dragon Trainer\" line? :D","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-19T19:56:58.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries - I know I may not give the answers everyone is hoping for, but I feel like honesty is the best policy. \n\nThere's a good chunk of work involved in this, and you're right, we don't think it's something we should tackle - not because of the time investment - but because we don't add content to skins after release. Of course, Champion Updates are are an exception here in terms of new particles, textures, etc, as well as bug fixes. \n\nYou're not being a jerk about this, it's a legitimate piece of feedback. I think it's something we should absolutely consider for content we're putting out in the future (or even something we could look at for the new champion select - actually - lemme poke that team about this!)\n\nGlad to see you're excited for Dragon Trainer Tristana! I haven't heard rumors, but we're open to adding to skin themes. We haven't planned anything just yet, but it's not out of the question for the future!","replies":[{"poster":"SOrude NAndstorm","date":"2015-11-19T19:57:37.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hi, can you answer to my topic, i would be grateful\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/EQeXEYn7-eune-problems-are-probably-ignored-by-european-rioters","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RedCyclone","date":"2015-11-18T23:55:51.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cough, just make the icon you select the splash you load into...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Moonboy65","date":"2015-11-18T04:06:48.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that is a really neat idea, i like it\n\nupvoted","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-18T19:40:39.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey SylvanasWrunner,\n\nWhere are you referring to it not being available?\n\nIn the Champion Details Page the login screen animations rotate through all three - Concussive, Kinetic and Ethereal. \n\nIf you're referring to champion select - swapping genre splashes isn't something we plan to add to DJ Sona at this time.
