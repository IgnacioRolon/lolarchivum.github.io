So, I recently decided that I was gonna try and get back into League because I saw a video on Youtube of someone playing it. Of course, I went to the website and downloaded everything over again. When I opened the client (Old One) I came across a problem. Whenever it'd start to download it's go to about 1%-5% then would pop up an ''Unspecified Error - Check Logs for Details'' When you click off of the error, the update restarts again with the same error. I noticed that when you leave the error the update will continue, but only go to 99% and won't fully update. I've asked around and tried anything anyone has to me, like deleting all the files and retrying. I have also tried using the repair tool, didn't work. One friend suggested to come here and see if anyone here knew what to do. Has anyone come across this problem and have a way to fix it? I just wanna play League. Thank You {{champion:238}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-16T16:23:14.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the detailed info here!

That may be in regards to the game server, not the patching services to get you up to date.

I used the link you sent and clicked \"For NA users\" I then scolled down and it said my connection should be \"Great\". Also, could you run by me (Step-By-Step if you could) how exactly to get the logs from the Hextech repair tool?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-19T15:22:07.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, even though it's great ISPs can still have hiccups sometimes as well as your own local settings.  The HRT should upload a zipped folder of logs to your Desktop as an icon.  You should be able to attach that to your ticket!  If you run into an issue, reach out to us anyway and our tech folks can work with you individually.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"3NZYME","date":"2017-09-16T16:08:40.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look at my post, without the error message appearing but happens quite similar to me \n\n(my thread link: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/0IcAuERi-cant-install-league)","replies":[{"poster":"Sorceinist","date":"2017-09-16T22:21:36.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you find a way to fix yours?
