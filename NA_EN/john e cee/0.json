I wouldn't get it on Nasus normally, but I could see it working in certain situations.","replies":[{"poster":"ChrisB5","date":"2015-01-17T02:49:04.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Such as?  I honestly thought you were joking.\n\nI definitely agree with your first sentence though.  I was essentially forced into a pure tank role as Cho, which made me useless when we made it to the towers!  My solution?  ZZ let me build tankier, while still being able to help take down inhib and towers!  It was nice to be able to do this, and they made for a great distraction when I needed to make my escape.  But for Nasus, I just can't see any situation where this could be useful.","replies":[{"poster":"HyP Dolphin","date":"2015-01-17T03:30:22.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well it can tank turrets so that's always a plus(and i think it counts as a minions so backdooring is much easier without the extra armor the turrets have).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-01-16T19:31:47.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The lifespan is super short and it pushes the lane.
