Make sure you know which file is the replay you want to view. Then download a replay from one of the games in your current match history. Identify which file is the one that was just created. Copy the full filename of the recent replay you just downloaded. Then delete the file of the recent replay. And then rename the old replay you want to watch to the name of the new replay you just deleted. Then go to your client and try to play the replay that you just downloaded. This should get you the game you actually wanted instead of the one that you would normally be getting.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Daddy Trynd","date":"2017-09-22T21:09:43.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're a hero.
