I tried to complete a ticket at Riot support, and they sent me an e-mail saying that it would take longer than usual to address my problem. However, when I clicked the link they provided for my ticket, it said the page didn't exist, and when i went under my tickets on Riot support, I couldn't find my ticket. Is there a way to find my ticket? I am rather frustrated because I know what happened to my account (its a scam that I hear is affecting many summoners) and all I need is an addressed ticket to recover my account.  I love LOL but Riot badly needs live support.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-16T17:15:13.996+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do see that you currently have a ticket open, and it has been escalated to our account recovery team.  Are you able to see the ticket now?  You should be able to view your tickets as long as you're signed in to the account that sent it.  If you can't login, you can also send an email to support@riotgames.com.  In either case, you should also receive an email notification with the response to your ticket.  A specialist will reach out to you as soon as possible, hang tight!","replies":[{"poster":"emptybagswag","date":"2016-09-16T18:19:58.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the response. A ticket confirmation was sent to my e-mail, but the link still says the page doesn't exist. Also, because the hacker changed my email address, will the ticket response go to my e-mail, or the one the hacker changed it to? I'm travelling over the weekend, so I can wait for my ticket to be addressed.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-16T18:33:16.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the email has been changed, I recommend instead email support@riotgames.com as well just to be safe to make sure the response gets into your hands.","replies":[{"poster":"emptybagswag","date":"2016-09-16T18:56:46.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
