So very often I&#039;ve run into the issue of rushing to dragon and calling the team as it&#039;s up soon to only have the enemy team respond with no reaction from my team until the enemy team already have pressure on it.\r\n\r\nSo my question is, what&#039;s a good way to get people to group, or to otherwise just help encourage focus and prioritization on objectives? How do I encourage such behavior without outright commands that are often ignored anyways and can lead to toxicity, or ask for assistance and ensure team awareness of such things?\r\n\r\nAny input is extremely helpful and is always accepted. Thanks for any advice you may feel like sharing!","replies":[]}
