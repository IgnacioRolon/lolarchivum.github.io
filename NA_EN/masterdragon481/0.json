Again, I haven't used it many times, but when I did, I would find that where I placed the portal, the creatures were dying before they arrived at the tower.  \r\n\r\nNow, since they still did detonate and deal damage to the minions, they weren't dealing damage to the tower, which would be the main reason I bought the item in the first place.  Therefore, I think mousing over the item in your inventory should display the max range which the creatures will travel; it would make using this item much easier.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2015-02-25T01:14:45.522+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does (or close to it).\nOn the minimap.","replies":[{"poster":"GhostOfShrimpmas","date":"2015-02-25T02:34:07.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Reinboom,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6Y3FVlm8,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-25T01:14:45.522+0000)\n>\n> It does (or close to it).\n> On the minimap.\n\nDamnit, Rito, just because this was already done when the item was introduced doesn't mean you can just brush off constructive criticism.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ice Weasel X","date":"2015-02-25T01:10:41.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be a lot more complicated than you realize.  It's not a simple radial value using the portal placement as its center.\n\n* If a portal is not placed directly in lane, the voidspawn will be unable to take a straight-line path.  Max range will thus be different depending on the direction traveled.\n\n* Voidspawn movement speed increases when within 775 range of enemy structures.  This changes the possible max distance again.  It's possible for a voidspawn to gain movement speed from proximity, run *out of range* to circumnavigate terrain and lose the movement speed, and *re-enter range* to once again gain the speed increase.\n\n* Enemy minions will distract voidspawn, making effective range much lower than max range.  This would lead to a lot of confusion/complaints if a \"max range\" radius were displayed, yet voidspawn never got anywhere near structures within that coverage area.","replies":[]}]}
