The police would stare, though they knew they&#039;d gain nothing from arresting the shell of a man I&#039;d become. \n\nIt wasnt long ago when I was crowned &quot;Jesus of the Boards&quot;\n\nNearly 5 minutes ago. \n\nOh how time has passed, Oh, How  {{champion:26}}  can be so cruel. \n\nRiot cactopus faded into the fogged corners of my mind. His child-like fear palpable in the air. I knew he could no longer haunt my thoughts... but who was that enshadowed figure that hovered over me. His mere presence bringing pressure like no other to rest upon my shoulders. \n\n_&quot;Meddler&quot;_\n\nI&#039;d hear them whisper. The shadows alive with the ghastly imprint of my previous failures. \n\nThey called me crazy. Every one of them. They looked on me with those judging eyes and passed whispers of &quot;the man who speaks to shadows.&quot; {{champion:56}} \n\nI&#039;m not crazy, they call for me, I know they do. They speak the name of the creature that has a stranglehold on all I hold dear. \n\nIf Cactopus took my wife, kids, and the game I love, then the beast they speak of has taken the remains of what made me human. I no longer wish to be the shell of a man, the shed skin of a sickly serpent waiting for my inevitable passing. \n\n_&quot;Meddler&quot;_\n\nI can only ignore their calling for so long. They are growing tired of waiting for the opportune time.\n\nI will see you soon Meddler. \n\n{{sticker:sg-syndra}}","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-02-09T22:23:09.503+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":26,"body":"Good luck have fun, but if you're open to advice, don't BM next time.
