My computer runs everything Ultra HD so Its not a lack in hardware, and I've reinstalled the client twice. \r\n\r\nEvery game I lag really bad from 0;00-1:00 this mostly consists of my character skipping backwards and forwards a few steps. I've noticed this happen on Tobias Fates stream occassionally as well. This happens on all maps, though much more common on Summoners Rift (every game) vs ARAM (occassionally).\r\n\r\nAs my name suggests I am a jungle main, so the usual time I see this glitch is when I spawn, buy items, and click on my red or blue buff location. My character starts to autopath, though every few steps gets set back one or two steps. On top of this my ping NEVER changes through this glitch. \r\n\r\nPorocles I summon thee by name.\r\n\r\nPorocles, Porocles, Porocles!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-10T18:19:03.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too soon Better Jungler, I have not had my poro snax! \n{{sticker:sg-shisa}} \n\nThis might not be due to your PC or game files, but packet loss with a degrading connection.
