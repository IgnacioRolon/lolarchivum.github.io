Thats alot of effort and I appreciate it:P After reviewing these logs it made me notice something about refund tokens. \r\n\r\nSay that a new player joins the game, and buys one of the cheapest 450 IP champions in the game, then blows a refund token on it because he wants to try another really cheap champion (450 IP)... He uses that champ a bit, and realizes he's just short of a new champion, so he refunds again, and gets a slightly more expensive (but still overall cheap 1350 IP champion.) Is there any way to get a pity token or something? Since the noob player blew his refund tokens on &lt;1350 IP champs?  I don't think a new player in his first few weeks of playing would expect to never get another refund token:P \r\n\r\nThat player had no idea what he was doing, and just used the tokens to explore all the cool looking champs. \r\n\r\nis this worth putting a ticket in for? Or is it pretty much 3 and done, no exceptions? I've seen a ton of requests over the years for one refund token refreshing each season, but never any red text on their standpoint of this idea. (or ideas like this one)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-20T21:30:29.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So no, you can't really get more refund tokens, but if something deserves a refund and we can tell it was a mistake etc, go ahead and hit up our billing team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Always better to reach out and ask than assume we won't refund it and miss out ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"Better Jungler","date":"2017-11-20T23:40:28.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright I'll give it a shot.
