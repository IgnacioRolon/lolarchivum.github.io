Just yesterday I can name 6 examples of when me or a friend of mine didn&#039;t get our roles because blind pick. For example I called adc first and then just as I am about to lock someone instalocks and yells &quot;PREMADE BOT&quot; and steal it. This happened four times.","replies":[{"poster":"Tahngarthor","date":"2016-11-15T08:39:25.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normal Draft hasn't been removed. Not on NA at least.\n\nFrankly I don't mind blind pick only because I can play the champion I want even if someone on the other team is picking it. Blind pick is meant to be the casual, don't give a crap mode where you just play what you want to play. There shouldn't be any expectation of pro moves and deep strategy. As long as you go into it with that mentality, there's nothing wrong with it.\n\nI don't usually play normals anymore except for streamers' viewer games though.","replies":[{"poster":"Plastic Mem0ries","date":"2016-11-15T08:39:57.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This person's from EUNE.

Plus, don't most countries in the EU make you learn English, or at least the basics of it? So yeah, I'd agree that EU should be connected.\n\nThe only problem that MIGHT be - EU is so huge. A lot of players play in EU, so the servers MIGHT not be able to handle the capacity of players. Idk though, just speculating as I'm sure they would've done it a long time ago.\n\nOr at least, I think :c.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xerceas","date":"2016-12-30T04:44:15.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both EU regions have a language problem with EUNEs one being much worse, with Polish, Czech and Romanian people more often than not refusing to speak in anything other than their own native language, sometimes not even knowing basic English in the first place.
