When this system was initially rolled out, the team handling the new reform system reviewed the few several thousand cases the system reviewed to ensure it was working properly (not false banning, etc.). \n\n>  I just got out of a game and was DC'd only to find out that Riot had banned my account from today until the 20th! \n\nIf you're curious about your ban, please feel free to submit a ticket to [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They'd be able to look into your account a bit more and provide more information. \n\nYou should have also received a reform card, sent to your email, which shares your chat logs, as well as the resulting punishment. \n\n>  I said nothing that wasn't true to my players and the game was a decent one AND I had several games before the one riot deemed unsportsmanlike without any incident.\n\nWhile what you're saying may have been true - someone doing poorly, not grouping etc., were you saying it in a manner that was constructive? While I can understand frustration in game - I think we've all been there - there's a right and a wrong way to call a teammate out when they're doing poorly. Phrases like, \"WTF are you doing Teemo, group up\" isn't optimal, whereas something like, \"Hey Teemo, we really need to fight as five, can you stop pushing top and group mid?\" is something that is much more constructive.\n\n> if you don't care about us players\n\nWe do care! Unfortunately, there are a lot more of you than there are of us, which makes one on one communication a bit harder than it used to be. \n\nIf you'd like more information on the new player reform system, you can check out Lyte's post [here](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/new-player-reform-system-heads-testing). There's also [an article](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/player-behavior-design-values-punishment) on our values when it comes to punishments, if you're curious about that, too. \n\nHope this helps a bit!","replies":[{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-07-07T16:50:06.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"I still want to believe that False reports dont aid in punishment, but when punishment is gated by volume of reports, you only need a small handful of valid reports along with some false ones to get punishment.

We could both get reported in 100 games, but if you've only played 300 total, and I've played 1000 total, there's a **huge** difference in the rate of those reports.\n\nI don't know what the threshold for that is (though it used to be somewhere between 12-25%), but it's still a factor. And that's not accounting for report weight, which is still totally a thing - demonstrably false reports cause a player's future reports to actually be worth less in determining whether a case is built.\n\nAnd, finally, there's the review step. Simply because there's no *person* handling reviews doesn't mean that chat logs and game-states aren't being reviewed at all. The chat-detection algorithm that handles these reviews is actually pretty impressively accurate.\n\nAll of which means this: a full run of false reports should never hurt you (I've never heard of anyone receiving a sanction who had ONLY false reports against them). However, false reports **may** push you over the edge into a review, which may lead to a sanction based on the behaviors indicated by the *valid* reports.\n\nBut you can't do anything about false reports.

Since the inception of the chat restriction system, it's performed a new review at the end of a set of restrictions, as a sort of \"checkup\" to see what the player's standing is.\n\nThis new review doesn't require any further reports - though reports probably don't help any.","replies":[{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-07-10T06:26:53.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In order for punishments to come out more quickly, you need the threshold for triggering review to be lowered.
