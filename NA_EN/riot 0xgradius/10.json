Here's a few I want...","subforum":"Boards Feedback","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who likes to stay on topic of the sub-forum they're on, I feel like I'm missing out since we don't have a \"General Discussion\" or an \"Off Topic\" section.  I admit, I haven't talked with anyone internally about this, so I don't know if there's reasoning behind it, but I'd like to see how other people feel about it as well.  I enjoy posting in those sections in our current forum, and those are where I find most of the discussions that I participate in.\r\n\r\nFor example, this morning I posted a thread discussing my morning LoL streams, but I didn't really feel like it could fit in any of the current sub-communities.  I was somewhat hesitant to post at all since I couldn't find a section that it fit in.\r\n\r\nWhat say you?","replies":[{"poster":"Verandure","date":"2013-12-11T21:43:00.861+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find that any topic that is about League of Legends has at least one sub community it can fit in. By creating a \"General\" sub community here, it would choke out the other sub communities just as General Discussion chokes out every single other existing sub forum right now. \n\nAn off topic would be nice, though.

Plus you avoid the \"miscellaneous\" trap, where all conversation happens in the \"misc\" place by default, which doesn't allow for any kind of editorial control.\n\nUsing the front page as the primary place you source content you want to read or post on also allows us to do things in the future like \"subscriptions,\", where you can change what you care about and how much you care about it to affect the ranking of content you see on your own front page. Long-term, we'd like to have even more sub-communities, as niche as is reasonable for a critical mass of discussion, so you can opt in and out of the kinds of discussions you want more easily.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2013-12-11T22:56:20.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Plus you avoid the \"miscellaneous\" trap, where all conversation happens in the \"misc\" place.\n\nIn theory a miscellaneous trap wouldn't exist with perfect moderation if the layout is correct.  Boiled down to its base Off-Topic is merely that; off topic.  'If something doesn't fit in any of the currently laid out topics it can go here' is kind of the intended mentality as opposed to GD where it's basically 'If it's a discussion it can fit here' which is like...everything.\n\nI definitely get what you mean as far as subscriptions go and opting in/out is concerned, it'd make a lot more sense to have really specialized sub-communities than ones that're still specific but more general (e.g. Off-Topic).  \n\nI just wonder, would it be possible/healthy to boil the concept of Off-Topic down into something else?  Being able to have discussions about things that have absolutely nothing to do with the game or are completely random is kind of refreshing occasionally, and I'm not sure if it can be split in a way that wouldn't segment the portion of the playerbase that'd be interested in that kind of thing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ozbirta","date":"2013-12-11T21:30:36.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd rather see an \"other\" or \"Off Topic\" than another monstrosity like GD, personally.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot 0xGradius","date":"2013-12-11T21:44:20.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think both you and Verandure have changed my opinion of having a \"General Discussion\" section.

General Discussion doesn't really fill that niche of 'if there's nowhere to put this, stick it here'; it actually overshadows nearly everything.  \n\nIf it were up to me I'd change the Memes & Games sub-community into Off Topic, as those things are by definition not discussion-based material and it could segment that portion of the population in a strange way and/or make moderators' jobs harder.  It's really hard to draw lines if two sub-communities are so closely related.\n\nI'd also like to see a sub-community dedicated to viewed content such as streams and YouTube videos.  eSports is probably the closest the current platform comes to that, and it's not really accurate.  To me the most sensible approach would be to have two sub-communities related to viewed content, one for professional Riot-hosted eSports and the other for the entirety of the near-professional, amateur, and entertainment scenes.\n\nThere also needs to be a couple of the really core sub-communities such as Bug Reports, and personally I'd also very much like to see a sub-community for each community initiative that's been done (Honor, the Tribunal, the League system, etc.).\n\nKeep in mind the platform is nowhere near complete!  As I understand it, the developers are working to ensure the platform has all necessary central functions (sorting and algorithms, visible moderation, possible terminology changes, etc.) correct and fully operational before bringing in new Sub-Communities.  \n\nThe goal (from my perspective) is to make sure that there are enough categories to keep things organized and engaging while not dramatically segmenting the playerbase or stifling certain areas (e.g. the concept of General Discussion).","replies":[]},{"poster":"jwf999","date":"2013-12-11T22:17:41.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree I think these forums need a uh recycling bin section if you get what I mean.
