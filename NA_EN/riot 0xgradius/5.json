I usually stream in the mornings from 8AM PST - 10AM PST.\n\nLike the title says, I main support, but I'm also working on learning different roles so that I have a better overall understanding of LoL.  At times I also play ARAMs with the viewers, in-houses are a ton of fun!  \n\nSo if you have free time in the morning, and you wanna watch me fail and yell at me for it, join me!\n\nwww.twitch.tv/riotgradius\n\nPS: I wasn't sure if this was the right section for this sort of thing.... anyone have any suggestions?\n\nCurrently playing: No One :(\n\nEDIT: Thanks all for joining me, was fun! I try + do this every day, and I'm thinking about making one day a week just a ton of community ARAMS.
