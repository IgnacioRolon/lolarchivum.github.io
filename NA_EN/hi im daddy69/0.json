Then when I go into champion select, when I pick either of them, the rune page selector immediately jumps to the first rune page on my list. It started around patch 7.6.\r\nSomething about the 2 runes pages being \"tied together\"\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any help that you can offer.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-14T18:08:57.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've been tracking this issue and would like to help!
