So follow my simple instructions, and you&#039;ll forever be free of the Orwellian thought-policing that Rito thinks makes this game good. Trust me, I&#039;ve tested this on all of my accounts.\n\n**Baddies: **\nWhen dealing with shit noobs, there&#039;s a temptation to call them &quot;trash&quot; or &quot;cancer&quot;. *Don&#039;t do it*. Rito&#039;s bitch IFS system picks up on that shit and punishes it, because the noobs feelings get triggered and Rito can&#039;t have that. *Don&#039;t worry about it*. That kind of talk is played out and weak anyway. Wanna know how to really deal with baddies? *Fucking encourage them*. Say &quot;don&#039;t worry, you&#039;ll get them next time&quot;, or &quot;nice try&quot;, or even fucking *silence*. This causes bad players to confront their own errors, which causes them infinitely more pain than straightforward insults could ever inflict. Hell, sometimes they&#039;ll even respond to your input by playing better, which gets you more of that sweet LP that you deserve. Plus, the biased honor system mistakes this for honorable conduct, which means you can even convince Rito to *reward* you for raking idiots over the coals.\n\n**Trolls:**\nFellow warriors, we&#039;ve all been here. Some clown steals your CS, builds shitty for fun, or just follows you around spamming emotes and leaching XP. *Fuck those guys*. I get the temptation to tell them how detrimental their existence is to the very concept of polite society, but once again, funkiller Rito swoops in and shuts our righteous anger down. But check it: the truth is, trolls fucking *want* you to talk like that to them. It&#039;s why they troll. Wanna really fuck with them? *Stay silent the entire game*. Shit drives them *nuts*. You can seriously put a troll into an existential spiral by simply not engaging with them, and it completely ruins their day. Mute them or don&#039;t, that&#039;s up to you, but the key is to remain *silent*. The best part about this is that dumbass Rito once again mistakes this for honorable conduct, so even though you caused some basement-dwelling cretin to completely rethink his life choices in a way that calling him an asshole never could, you *still* get honor rewards. \n\nTrust me guys, I&#039;m already Honor 3 in the new season and will continue to handle trolls and bad players in the most cutting way possible *right under Rito&#039;s nose*, WHILE GETTING REWARDED TO DO IT, and **you can too!**\n\ninb4 delete","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2018-02-12T23:01:43.240+0000","up_votes":180,"down_votes":5,"body":"I'll make sure we get this patched up right away.","replies":[{"poster":"Omì","date":"2018-02-12T23:32:04.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":63,"body":"your joking right?","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-02-12T23:35:16.662+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":1,"body":"The post was joking, I'm pretty sure Tantram is too.\n\nI know that text doesn't convey it well but I'm fairly certain all of this was satirical.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2018-02-13T00:13:09.972+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you must get this a lot, but I find names written in red to be intensely erotic.","replies":[{"poster":"Bottom Laner","date":"2018-02-13T02:48:43.811+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.worldofbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/8-weird-superstitions-weve-all-heard-growing-up-as-malaysians-world-of-buzz.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ada Wong","date":"2018-02-15T10:50:33.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=vxy3I4Xi,comment-id=0019,timestamp=2018-02-12T23:01:43.240+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;ll make sure we get this patched up right away.\n\nHey buddy sadly there isn't anything you all can do to fix this type of behavior???\n\nPerhaps I am wrong but what he generally means is not to be toxic in chat \"Say nice comments to your mates who are doing bad\" with the Intention to make them rage and say like I fucking suck, or talk bad about him/her self.\n\nThe other thing about trolling is having \"Junglers\" or other players on your team run into your lane and Intentionally grief you by putting the enemy team ahead this is very common last time I played and to be honest you have to be flat out stupid to do what these guys were doing trolling, however lets assume that I go Mid as a support, take XP, put the enemy ahead intentionally and do it to intentionally make your mid laner rage for example then report them.\n\nThere are many passive ways to make your team angry, make them rage in chat then just report them thus abusing the system without getting banned yourself.\n\nThere is really no fix for this type of behavior unless you start counting less offenses and based off number of reports but this could lead to abuse like back in the day and how you get banned from Smite for not feeding for being 0/1/0 in smite but your mate goes mid 1/4/0 and you get banned for doing better.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2018-02-15T20:59:48.741+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Perhaps I am wrong but what he generally means is not to be toxic in chat \"Say nice comments to your mates who are doing bad\" with the Intention to make them rage and say like I fucking suck, or talk bad about him/her self.\n\nI feel you may have missed that the intent of the post was satire ...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Scuttle","date":"2018-02-12T17:45:11.450+0000","up_votes":64,"down_votes":0,"body":"What the fuck dude this is gonna get patched in a day.
