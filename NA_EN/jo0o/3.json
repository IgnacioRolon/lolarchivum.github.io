He gets flamed, and _just ignores it._ He's very much aware that people are talking shit, but he handles it in healthier ways than flaming back, such as by turning the flames he receives into clickbait titles/thumbnails for his youtube channel. I have never once seen him actually lose his cool in game, and I think his rank and success are a testament to that.\n\nTo those of you who have been restricted or banned for retaliating against other flamers, please check this guy out and consider copying his behavior. It's simply not worth it to get angry because some guy on the other side of your computer screen is needling you.\n\nA few other sample videos while I'm here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/anN6PK28xDE\n\nhttps://youtu.be/f37U0GyBU5A","replies":[{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-02-23T20:33:02.825+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"\n\nPlus 12 !

Im also like that in my games, i rarely mute flamers unless their spamming","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bruenir","date":"2019-02-25T00:03:32.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but he is not playing with the pressure of trying to climb because he is smurfing.
