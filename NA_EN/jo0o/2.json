It prevents incremental adjustments being made by the perpetrators that would allow them evade identification very easily.  They obviously have to be secret about their methods or again it would make it too easy to avoid being caught.  It is unfortunate that some innocent people get caught in the crossfire but those _**truly **_innocent have bans reversed.  It is also an _**extremely small**_ % of false positives.  It would be a much different situation if this affected a large portion of the player base, but that obviously is not the case.  \n\nLets also be honest with ourselves here.  Every single ban wave (as with normal bans) people come here and lie about being falsely banned only to have it later revealed it was just.
