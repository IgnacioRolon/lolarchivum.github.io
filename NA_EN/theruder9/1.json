For one the animation barely plays when I intend it too. All of his other emotes work fine, he&#039;ll stop mid run to do it, or I can spam the animation like normal etc. But for this, hitting a hotkey not only doesn&#039;t stop him, but it also forces me to wait standing still for about 3-5 whole seconds before the animation will play.\r\nIf while moving I type in /joke then it works fine, but I still can&#039;t repeatedly type quickly to have him use the animation repeatedly. I don&#039;t THINK this is intentional, because every other emote in the game allows you to do this.\r\nAlso Ryze&#039;s ale flashes in and out of existence for no reason at random. Also when you face upwards, (I&#039;ve noticed it&#039;s much worse when looking up and right) his bottle becomes completely transparent.\r\nAll of these issues occur everytime, in multiple games.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-07-18T18:23:28.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo!

Usually I get scared when they do vgus because often the skin's quality drops. Feels like a waste of RP at that point when a cool skin gets rekt. Pirate ryze transitioned well though","replies":[]}]}]}
