Fwiw I appreciate the love (obviously I'm biased lol). A fresh meta is both scary and nerve racking, but also brings some fun and interesting shifts to the meta. I like how things have moved and hope to see more. Change will always cause fall out, but not change (IMO) is even worse.","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2018-06-27T00:30:26.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> but not change (IMO) is even worse.\n\nTo an extent.
