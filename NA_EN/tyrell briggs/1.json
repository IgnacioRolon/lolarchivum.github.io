Now, after 7.16, I have insanely high ping, even after disconnecting and reconnecting. My internet will be fine when farming, but as soon as the time comes to make a play, the ping jumps to 5000+. The screen stops moving for a second, my character moves forwards, slides backwards, pauses, then sprints forward to where I clicked without the walking animation. I keep getting flamed for feeding hard, but there's nothing I can do. Could something be wrong with my WI-Fi config, or is it just my client? I have no issues in any other program that needs internet.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-29T04:39:30.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eeeeee this sounds an awful lot like packet loss actually. Essentially, this means that part of the data your connection is sending is getting corrupted, so our servers don't quite understand how to read it.\n\nLet's test for that before I jump to any conclusions though, which we can do by using this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). Let that tool scan the network logs from that game with 5000 ping, and post a screenshot of what it says here.","replies":[]}]}
