Sometimes during this time I get \"attempt to reconnect\" but eventually it settles back down. It doesn't happen to everyone in the match but it's not just me either. What's the deal?","replies":[{"poster":"IAvada KedavraI","date":"2016-08-25T19:38:27.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am in the exact same situation as you are. I tried the hextech repair but didn't do anything. Other people in the game are also having this problem. It's totally ruining my games. Having this happen in bad timings has cost me a lot of games the last few days. Let me know if you find a solution.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Megagig","date":"2016-08-25T16:04:15.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I did this and the logs show the spikes. The thing is, all the solutions are for my end. I've checked during the spikes and there's nothing wrong with my network. Ping on the network is fine, speed is fine, nothing else using my network expect league. It's almost every game now and it lasts for about a minute. I just downloaded the hextech repair tool and ran it so I guess we'll see the next few games.
