Has anyone experienced this problem?**\r\n\r\nPS. I'm not interested to swapping to Ethernet even though i know this probably would resolve the problem, and as I said earler, I never had any problems with this before.","replies":[{"poster":"Im Axiom","date":"2017-07-07T11:38:44.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are wrong about League being the lowest in terms of bandwidth. I have had the awful experience of being forced to play on a mobile internet connection (and therefore pay close attention to bandwidth usage), and based on my experience league uses at least twice the bandwidth of any fps. League might be simple in aspect, but the information being sent/recieved from server is much greater than direction, location, firing status ect. of a typcial fps. Perhaps it is inefficiency by league's part, but it is very likely a network problem on your end, and at times league is exceeding the stability of your network and the ports league uses are handling more packets than your router can handle. There is a plethora of small things to do to improve the health of your network, but for starters, get off WIFI at all costs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-06T23:08:28.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could still have issues reaching specific services, like the game server.  If your high packet loss was more constant I'd consider a routing issue to the game server, but the spikes could suggest a more local issue.  Try out the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help rule out possibilities.  I know you might hate to hear this, but swapping ethernet wouldn't hurt just to confirm the origin.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
