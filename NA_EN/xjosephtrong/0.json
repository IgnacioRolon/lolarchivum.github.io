Not just that the shen who play with me also disconnect since this yi trolling so hard and act like a bot in game. Yet Riot does not improve this report system by looking at all the play. The only thing they look at is the chat and is so frustrating when trolls does not get ban by Riot. Riot clearly trying to improve only in their art in game(maps, skins, chromas,...) while the game itself have so much flaws and they does not want to improve something like this.","replies":[{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2019-10-23T23:39:43.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"post chat logs to see if thats all you really said","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-10-23T22:50:53.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The game mode does not matter, nor does it matter what other players are doing or have done.

I take extreme to mean severe in this context, so maybe you just didnt mean it that way. But you did say \"repeated\" extreme rulebreaking. You can reach permaban off repeated light rulebreaking, as well.

Ive seen people permabanned from games where they were merely arguing with someone over a play and then called them bad. Thats not \"extreme\" imo, but yeah youre right, it depends what you consider extreme. If you consider that extreme, thats just odd to me, but youre entitled to your opinion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xJosephTrong","date":"2019-10-23T22:59:03.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"The same thing go with you.
