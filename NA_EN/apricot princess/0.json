Only a few things in the game are actually an issue for me and most can be avoided, like banning Lucian or Lux, so I can have a safe game.\n\n_However_, the new kill/death animations for the house missions–those big strobey house logos that pop up over a champion you kill– are a huge issue for photosensitive epilepsy and cannot be turned off nor the effects turned down. \n\nI understand that epileptics are in the minority for those who play the game, but League has brought me a lot of joy these past few years and it's heartbreaking that Riot doesn't take epilepsy seriously when developing and designing new game mechanics. \n\nRiot, please, **create a toggle off function for house animation finishers** so epileptics can stay safe. \n\nThanks for your time\n\n——————————————————————\n\n**EDIT**: Hey everyone, before I get started. Wow. This post kind of blew up during my day of medical appointments. Thanks for everyone who responded, Rioters included. \n\nI just want to say that I understand Riot's reasoning for launching this new animation w/o a toggle vs not launching it at all. I studied multimedia design and basic game design in college before I got sick and understand the basics. Timelines get crunched and some things fall off importance wise. I'm not asking for the animation to be removed. It's a cool effect and honestly, if it didn't cause photosensitive issues, I'd be super stoked for them. \n\nIt is a shame that the game has an option for colorblind mode but not photosensitivity. But that likely comes not from malice, but from not knowing what exactly triggers epilepsy or how to go about creating that feature vs colorblind really being open and shut as to its effects. \n\nI only became epileptic a year after I started playing this game, and that's when I realized only roughly 10 things in this game messed with me. My doctor is aware I play and he's also aware of how much joy this game brings me, especially as my health has gotten worse (outside of epilepsy), and has just told me to be as safe as possible. Ultimately, anyone with photosensitive epilepsy plays video games at their own risk.\n\nI have submitted support tickets about how to go about addressing the specific graphic parts of the game that could be adjusted in order to be safer for photosensitive people (like for a photosensitive mode or toggle). Ultimately, I was told that it has been brought up to devs before and that they unfortunately don't care or see it as a priority. Hopefully they forwarded my ticket to the right people, but it's super easy for something like this to just be forgotten about or swept under the rug in lieu of more content that promotes the game, skins, events, etc. \n\nI would love to see photosensitivity thought of more in the future for people like me who love and support this game and I'm willing to help if there are any questions regarding how Riot could possibly do that. If needed, I can share my support ticket where I go in depth about opacity of spell effects and color variations or quick adjustments. Thanks for everyone's time.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Xenogenic","date":"2019-05-13T17:52:05.687+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":53,"body":"**UPDATE: ** Disregard the original message below.

The game is already a risk for Players like this, even 1 skin with new animations can be an issue. \n\nBut, As some one who genuinely enjoys games, league being one of my favorites. I do want to see QOL for folks who might otherwise be unable to enjoy the game.  Creating a Visual Filter is going to be work, its going to cost $.  I think its worthwhile. Yea... you expect players like the OP to be a minority as a dev.\n\nI might be projecting but \"lot of joy these past few years\"  It feels like the OP is some one who truly enjoys games as well. That's relatable to me.  Its a hassle and likely unviable to consider every animation and every skin. Its a lot of work.. but building a ground up Filter to reduce animation effects to a safer level sounds like a really good thing. Once you have groundwork in place it reduces the work load massively.\n\nSo like I said. Why don't we all take it as a moment we can as a community come together to support a QOL change. We got red attention on the topic. What if instead of meangless tilt and outrage and flame we sit down address the topic.\n\nFirst up, Better understanding of the issue would be a good place to start. It looks like a lot of folks don't have the best understanding of Epilepsy. I certainly don't. Can a few folks step up to explain the issue better then Wikipedia?  Is it fair to treat it as an \"allergy\" to flashing lights?\n\nSecond up. What would be needed to make a Photosensitive mode. Muted animation effects or colors? What would actually reduce the trigger risks.\n\nThis is information I personally don't have adequate knowledge on. Id like to see the conversation shift to making a better experience.

However, the three biggest recorded risk factors for triggering a seizure (and what would need to be addressed in order to make a Photosensitive mode) are:\n\n- \"Strobing\" effects (flashing between colors at a high rate of speed) [The \"lost episode\" of Pokémon was taken off air from this]\n- Sudden changes from darker or cooler colors to brighter and hotter colors (not to be confused with strobing, which can take place with almost any color combination, these changes are simply from say black to white or vice versa, and don't necessarily have to be done several times at once, but just done very suddenly with no gradient)\n- High amounts of motion (not necessarily Strobing, but just too much motion at one time over a large enough area)\n\nBasically, Epilepsy is most commonly triggered by an \"overload\" of sensory (usually visual) input. It's not necessarily comparable to an allergy, and more comparable to what happens when someone or something surmounts a critical level of stress. But since it's a more specialized form of stress on a notably vulnerable area, it's far more acute than simple stress factors.\n\nIn order to make a Photosensitive mode, you've actually got a decent start - muting the colors and toning back some of the more hyperactive animation effects is a decent start.","replies":[{"poster":"Apricot Princess","date":"2019-05-14T04:26:03.769+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"The points ChaosReyn made are all correct speaking from my experience with photosensitive epilepsy.

Not a big deal from a gameplay side but some folks get attached. This does make a system with 100% reliability thou, its worst triggers would represent its highest risk. Reliability as It removes all the animation and coloration variables from skins and chromas or game mode.\n\nIs that safer thou? I don't know how bad the variance is for folks who have to deal with this. Is this even a remotely realistic solution? What are the issues that really need to be solved to make things safer for ya?\n\nGive that there are minors who play, what kind of verification is needed to enable this?\n\nI got a large gap in my knowledge on the topic here.

Epilepsy differs from person to person, but overall the main triggers involve opaque, bright, quick flashing spell effects (usually with a contrast difference between flashing– whether against the map color or against it's own color base). \n\nI do not think a mode or setting that removes a huge part of the game (all skins?) is viable. Not for the player or for Riot. Also, there is unfortunately no 100% reliability with epilepsy but there are things that help and things that absolutely do not help– or worse– trigger. Chromas usually do not affect spell effect colors. \n\nThe best bet for a photosensitive mode would be a toggle function/setting much like colorblind mode that swaps out the spell effects mentioned above (opaque, bright, etc...) for more muted, transparent effects/effects with more overall opacity (so the contrast between the dark map color and the white/bright light blue/etc isn't as dramatic). This does mean that riot would need to look at each champion's spell effects to see if they meet that criteria, but once they're known they wouldn't need to revisit them again unless a rework or a complete VU that modifies those effects was made. \n\nI have an entire support ticket written out in detail with more information about the possibilities of making these modifications.

The people with photosensitive epilepsy playing league are roughly (per statistics) 30,000 out of 100,000,000. It did not make fiscal sense to not launch the product this time, because no matter what this will be the framework for future events, and needs to get tested. Upon release of the next version the toggle will most likely be added. The amount of work that went into this had to cost a lot of money, and to straight up not release it would be a big financial hit as well. \nJust realize RIOT does not OWE anyone anything. This is a free to play game and these effects are a part of it. There are people in the world who cant walk, run, swim, or breath on their own. Get over it, get some fresh air, get some of the salt out of your system and get ready to hit the fields of justice in a couple weeks when the event is over.\n\nRiot if you are reading you should let people freeze their accounts if anyone is in decay range in Ranked until the event is over, per support ticket, for the people that are really unable to play due to a medical reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Leon Etoile","date":"2019-05-13T22:25:38.275+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">did not make fiscal sense to not launch the product this time\n\nUmm.. the house thing has nothing to do with MSI and could have easily been pushed back.","replies":[]}]}]}
