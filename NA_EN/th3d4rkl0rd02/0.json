Since this is an update overthrowing the entire client, I'd assume the effects would be worse.

Item Sets won't be deleted. No problem with that. And it's not linked to the Pre-Season update but to whether you use the old Client or the new Client, currently in Alpha (and soon in Beta).\n2. All the Item Sets you already used (and even some you didn't -- more details below) will be available when you play from the new Client.\n3. You will **NOT** be able to create additional Item Sets from the new Client.\n4. As long as the old Client will still be usable, you can pop back into the old one and still create additional Item Sets from there. **But they won't be available in games launched from the new Client immediately!!**\n\n\n**To get your Item Sets from the new Client, you need to \"activate\" them _for a given Champion_, by launching a game where you play this Champion from the new client.** A Custom game is enough, and no need to play the game, just loading it is enough, this will \"activate\" all your existing Item Sets for this Champion. But you need to do it for every single Champ you want to use a new/updated Set with. (Alternatively, you can look for the right files to create and copy in your League folder, but if you start to manually create/modify files, be careful.)\n\nEDIT @ Targons: if you want to re-use/copy this information, feel free.","replies":[{"poster":"Th3D4rkL0rd02","date":"2016-11-04T03:43:47.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a ton, I was worried.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-04T02:03:15.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to Cactopus's post from [this thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/aWRfq6Ze-petition-to-keep-item-sets?comment=00050007), we don't plan on deleting anyone's item sets.
