While the patch affects in-game content, it doesn't have any affect on your connection path to our servers.  While there seems to be strong correlation between the patch and your lag, this does not seem to be the root cause at all.  Additionally, we do constantly monitor patches to see if there is any drastic increases in ping for players across the whole server, and we have not found any such issue.  If the patch itself was at fault, then every single player would be experiencing the same issue since everyone is on the same patch.  Since this is not the case, we need to look elsewhere for a root cause.\n\nThe Specialist in your ticket should have been able to look over logs regarding your internet connection.  However, you can check the health of your connection to our game servers yourself by using our [Connection Analyzer Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743).  It should let you know some steps you can take to improve it as well.\n\nI hope this helps!","replies":[]}]}
