There are reasons to go down either of the other trees, and some of the masteries you have to pick between. Riot also changes the masteries EVERY SEASON. So quit bitching and realize that it was going to happen no matter what.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-14T14:35:20.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because the old masteries weren't cookie cutter..? This is like when WoW changed to not have talent trees. Everyone used the exact same cookie cutter trees for entire roles while there were a select few champions that did well outside of the cookie cutter trees like 30/0/0 Akali. At least now it's less of a role and more of a playstyle sorta pick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-11-14T14:33:54.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you're pissed that the numbers 18/12/0 piss you off more than 21/9?
