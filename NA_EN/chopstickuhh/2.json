But in exchange, he can't use brush very effectively.\nGood tradeoff I think.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2016-03-12T21:46:02.112+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually, in the preview of aurelion, his E marked the position he was going with a blue icon","replies":[{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2016-03-12T21:55:37.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh, I think that may be team only though?
