Examples given.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"So it&#039;s rather well known that the tribunal has always had flaws, but it&#039;s at the point where it makes me want to not play the game anymore, period. I have a log from a lobby chat in ranked. I joined 3 lobbies with the same player. \n\n_________ : If I die in lane I&#039;m going to quit\n_________ : If you don&#039;t like it you can f off this is Silver get used to it idiots\n_________  : thats awesome\n_________  : You again\n_________ : yep dodge or lose\n_________ : your choice\n_________ : Why can&#039;t I report you right now?\n_________ : Come on Rito\n_________  : League :D\n_________  : In game I am innocent\n_________ : Cant do shit about it pregame (****)ers \n_________ : guess ima play nidalee and i suck at her\n_________ : cool\n_________ : I&#039;m leaving mid game anyway\n_________ : nice\n_________ : yep\n\n(I starred the cursing so I can post this, and I got rid of irrelevant names for privacy)\n\nThis guy had those first two lines copy pasted in all of the three lobbies I was in with him. He didn&#039;t respond to reason, and because of the tribunal system, he will probably never be banned. I wanted to play it out too, just so we could lose and I could paste this log into a report box. This is ridiculous. People do things like this all the time, and the tribunal doesn&#039;t punish them for it. Riot needs a simple system where you can report someone by clicking on there name or something similar to that. How challenging would that be? Have you paste logs in the report, and it&#039;s all done. That way when people are passively toxic in game, or just intentionally ruining the game before it&#039;s started like this, there&#039;s a way to catch and ban these players. RIot&#039;s report system is so over complicated, and ineffective that these types of players are practically immune as long as they don&#039;t do anything in game, or say anything to warrant a ban. I want to know what people think of this, because in almost every other game, you can report someone at any given time, and riot has chosen to force you to play out an inevitable loss in ranked just so you can report someone, so they can get a warning. That makes no sense at all. I know you guys are working on a new client, and i&#039;d like to know if something like this will be implemented, because it&#039;s about 5 seasons overdue. \n\nThis was not the only player I found doing this either, I still continue to run into players with &quot;positive&quot; attitudes, and just feed lanes throughout the game intentionally. And there&#039;s nothing you can do about it. I&#039;m sure riot is aware, but it&#039;s such a simple fix they still haven&#039;t implied, and I&#039;d like to understand their thought process. \n\nI apologize if this sounds like a rant, but these types of players need to be punished, and there&#039;s absolutely nothing other players can do about it right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-26T07:44:57.960+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have evidence of toxic behavior that you cannot report via the usual methods you can submit a support ticket.\n\nInclude their username in the ticket, as well as any screenshots or video you may have.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazyBear1987","date":"2016-10-26T07:29:48.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tribunal isn't even active at this time.

They have already stated they want to improve the Tribunal since the old system was faulty and caused for IP farming and false bans. \n\nWhat we have now is not the Tribunal, but the Instant Feedback system. Mostly handled by an automated system as well as Riot Support staff members. It is still referred to as the Tribunal, but it is not the Tribunal so to speak. \n\nPregame is something Riot is interested in, since there is no report button at the beginning or during a match. But obviously, this wont come until the LCU is live since trying to change the client now could cause a whole bunch of issues. \n\nRemember, this is mostly a client issue, not a game issue. So making changes isn't as easy as game balancing or inserting a new champ/skin. But I understand what you're saying. Pregame flaming is an issue, and currently there are only two means of reporting it: playing the game and reporting at the end, or taking a screen shot and submitting it via Riot Support. Not entirely effective, but Riot has mentioned they want to look into better ways of improving the Tribunal and improving reports. \n\nPregame is still recorded, but as I said you can't really report it unless you play the entire game to report or just screen shot and submit it manually. At least for now. Who knows what the updated Tribunal for the LCU will give us.\n\nHope that helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MUSHROOM MIDGET","date":"2016-10-26T08:10:35.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"a lot of people have asked for a report button in the pre-game so they can dodge and still report.  unfortunately trolls are not stupid.  \n\nif you add a report to the pregame they will just wait until the game starts to troll.  wouldnt you rather know before the game starts so you can dodge?","replies":[{"poster":"Just One Word","date":"2016-10-26T14:07:20.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"MUSHROOM MIDGET","date":"2016-10-26T19:48:41.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you would choose a temporary fix and make things worse in the long run\n\nkeep in mind most of these people would only get a chat restriction.  then they would think \"oh i cant do that in pregame anymore\".  and now you dont know you have a troll until the game starts","replies":[]},{"poster":"Techno Athena","date":"2016-10-26T15:48:51.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wouldn't you love to recreate 1984 and let Big Brother dictate our every move?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-10-26T10:25:14.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there are much more sophisticated ways to game the system.\n\npre/post game chat is not one of them.
