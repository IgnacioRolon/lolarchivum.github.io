It was not triggered by problems with hardware, the keys still functioned in other tabs and applications\r\n\r\nHopefully this will help to prevent some frustrations in the future ^^","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-04T04:46:40.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure what you mean.
