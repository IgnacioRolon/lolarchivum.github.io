Ranked Draft is live now on PBE, however for some reason I couldn&#039;t ban any champion, the ban pick window didn&#039;t appear.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HK6690C.png\r\n\r\nAs you can see on the image, I couldn&#039;t do anything, resulting in a dodge. I have no idea what caused that, nor what could have caused that, I just opened the Alpha Client (PBE) and tried to play a ranked.\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Raifur","date":"2017-04-30T15:40:15.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me, however i was able to choose the champion i wanted to ban... the ban button was locked. we should be able to do like a hover ban, similar to the how we can pick while hovering when the time runs out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Credo","date":"2016-08-31T02:42:05.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We know about this and have a fix, you should see it tomorrow!
