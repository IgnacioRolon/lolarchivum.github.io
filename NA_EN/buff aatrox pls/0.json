Like cmon this sucks if a new player just found this game and decided to level up and gets rewarded by going against the top 2% when he reaches level 25+. I get Diamonds also play normals, but why is a fresh accounts i guess public MMR if that is a thing so high? I get on my other account and play REGULAR people and come here on a fresh level 30 to play tryhards?  Seems alittle unfair.\n\n\nEDIT: I've leveled up 2 other accounts and I've never had this much pain. Every game feels like you get ran over by a dumptruck because it's stacked with high plats and diamonds while your team is also leveling up. Totally unnerving and alittle lopsided. Checked my match history and I'm getting put against masters? Are you serious riot? I'm a hardstuck silver player who just wants to have fun on a new account and I have to get matched with diamonds and masters? I understand the only way to get better is to face better players, but they're 3-4 divisions above me and since the majority of league players are silver-gold im not quite sure what the point of playing normals is now; unless I feel like getting my ass kicked by mr johnny who has played this game since beta. \n\nI don't think I should continue playing on this account until I get a response on this issue because it really blind sided me. Had fun leveling my other accounts before with friends and such, now I go into a game just to get cyberbullied by masters.

If you were in unranked, the matchmaking is a little less strict since it's not ranked play. On the other hand, there's a pretty good chance that your team and the enemy teams stats evened out when tallied together as a team.","replies":[{"poster":"Buff Aatrox Pls","date":"2017-09-04T09:48:46.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just got done leveling the account to 30 so Im still in normals trying to scrounge enough Ip to afford champs to enter Ranked. I understand alittle less strict, but this is still unforgiving. I still rally around the point that if a fresh person decided to stick to leveling and got this far and started going on 10+ loss streaks because he's going against timmy the choo choo dragon who hit masters the last 2 seasons and are turned off to the game due to the difference in skill when in reality he's going against some of the best players in the game. I'm not quite sure what changed in the algorithm, but my last 2 accounts were nothing close to this. Most games need all 5 players going on maximum overdrive, chugging 3 monsters and have the reaction time of a squirrel to actually make the game close, I feel bad for all players involved in these games since the new player most likely has a lack of game knowledge putting his team behind mechanically and mentally while the other players get to 5v4. I know this because I just faced a fresh level 30 account on my main account who didnt even know how to buy items and didnt buy anything until 20 minutes when he got his entire warmogs. We crushed that game because this player DIDNT know what to do. I felt bad for him because i checked his match history, and he had endured EXACTLY what I was enduring on this fresh account.  This is no plea for me since i have other accounts and can just come back to feel shitty for myself by getting crushed over and over again, but at least address this issue for more freshly leveled people so they can properly be placed into their (((Public MMR????)))","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2017-09-03T17:17:49.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's hard to believe that you are against high-ranked players every game in normals. In normals, there are times where high-ranked players are put into a game with lower-ranked players. Try ranking on those accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"Buff Aatrox Pls","date":"2017-09-03T18:59:11.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"go to op.gg and look up my account and look through my games.
