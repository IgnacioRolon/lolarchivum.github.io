The only thing to do with him is splitpush and hope they come at you one or two at a time. AP nunu blows up and dies if he can't eat a minion, so he is only strong in the lanes where enemy minions are...if he gets alone in the jungle or in lane without minions he's basically dead to any competent team. If they group and force teamfights without you or even with you, unless their teamfight is way worse than yours, they will win, because full ap nunu isn't great in teamfights (only the ult, and even then you can't really stay close because you will die). There is a reason he is usually build almost full tank, and that is because he slows and is annoying, forcing them to focus him, and yet he survives if he is tanky. If he's ap, he gets blown up (once again unless he can eat a minion, which he can't do if he gets stunned while ulting).\n\nI've done it before, and yes it is super fun and \"op\" but only if the enemy comes at you one at a time like i said.\n\n\n And you have never played with it either ;) looking at your match history you don't have any games as nunu...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2016-04-12T00:32:36.343+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think anyone will actually take this
