Since he isn't attack speed based (only attack speed he'll prob buy would be {{item:3078}}) and he has strong burst that is mostly magic damage. Plus he is kind of like an assassin when he has his package lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"legionnaire99","date":"2016-11-22T18:31:36.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"God I must be a nightmare for you {{champion:122}} {{champion:420}} ?","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Memes","date":"2016-11-22T18:40:04.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, people can have their preferences.
