Been going for 2+ years since the new client - I'm not the only one. Just google for \"stuck at zero\" or \"champ select frozen\" on the internet and there are dozens of posts. There's even YT videos showing this, reddit posts with 100+ comments, etc.\n\nAt the very least can you make the client pick the highlighted champion so we don't fail to select a champ and lose LP???\n\nEdit: Don't ask for a trace or give me the generic networking troubleshooting guide. It doesn't work. There is something wrong with your client constantly d'cing when I NEVER d/c in game and internet is working during the champ select.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-08T03:59:54.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this isn't exactly what you wanted to hear, but the first step to troubleshooting these network issues is to first check your network settings to make sure you're able to get a clean connection to *our* servers (it's not uncommon to be able to connect to certain servers and not others, that's just how the internet works). \n\nDo me a favor and update your port forwarding and DNS settings really quickly following those steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).
