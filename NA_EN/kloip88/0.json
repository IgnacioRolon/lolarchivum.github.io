This is the first champion concept I've ever made so yeah. Feedback requested.\n\n(I'm currently working on a better lore)\n\nAbraxas is a fighter/assassin who specializes in low risk all ins, but is especially susceptible to heavy cc and ganks when he's too pushed. His ult allows him to temporarily become the glassiest glass cannon possible but not without some very good mobility to escape back to safety.\n\nAppearance-wise, Abraxas appears to be a fairly large metal suit of armor, bound in chains, with an eerie light blue mist emitting from within. In his wraith state, he appears as a blue skeletal ghost with a large broadsword. \n\nHis armored form will look something like this:\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1426455967655%2FHauntedArmor.png&key=f0abbd34f14549f3a15cd94dd9970851&width=150&height=150&errorUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.leagueoflegends.com%2Fapollo%2Fassets%2Fdiscussion-thumbnail-ward.png\n\nHis wraith form will look something like this: \nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1426211635077%2FSpirit-Warrior.jpg&key=f0abbd34f14549f3a15cd94dd9970851&width=150&height=150&errorUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.leagueoflegends.com%2Fapollo%2Fassets%2Fdiscussion-thumbnail-ward.png\n\nLore: Something about him being a Demacian general who in a search for power, made a deal with a mysterious dark sorcerer *Cough* {{champion:30}}  *Cough*, was executed for it, and ended up having his soul trapped in his armor.\n\n\n**Abilities** (all numbers are placeholders for balance reasons)\n\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1426486775417%2Ficons_13835_btn.jpg&key=f0abbd34f14549f3a15cd94dd9970851&width=150&height=150&errorUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.leagueoflegends.com%2Fapollo%2Fassets%2Fdiscussion-thumbnail-ward.png **Passive: Scars of Agony**\nAbraxas' resource is Agony. He passively gains 1 Agony a second. Upon hitting an enemy champion or jungle monster, he gains 2 Agony, and upon killing an enemy minion or jungle monster he gains 6 Agony. Upon killing an enemy champion, he gains 15 Agony. Max 150.\nWhile in Wraith form, Abraxas loses 2 Agony a second if he hasn't been in combat for 6 seconds. Abraxas doesn't gain Agony from dealing damage in wraith form, but gains 25 Agony whenever he kills an enemy champion in this form.\n\n**Q: Tighten the Grip / Spectral Rush**\n\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1426489033610%2Ficons_14017_btn.jpg&key=f0abbd34f14549f3a15cd94dd9970851&width=150&height=150&errorUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.leagueoflegends.com%2Fapollo%2Fassets%2Fdiscussion-thumbnail-ward.png **Tighten the Grip** (soon to be changed)\nArmored Form\nCool-down: 14 seconds\n*Abraxas pulls his armor closer and tightens his chains, protecting himself and granting him increased health regeneration. *\n\nAbraxas shields himself for 70/110/140/170/210 (+70% of armor) for 6 seconds, and while it persists he gains 70/85/100/115/130% base health regen per 5 seconds and causes his auto attacks to cleave in front of him, hitting everything in a quarter circle in front of him.\n\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1426486833214%2Ficons_15723_btn.jpg&key=f0abbd34f14549f3a15cd94dd9970851&width=150&height=150&errorUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.leagueoflegends.com%2Fapollo%2Fassets%2Fdiscussion-thumbnail-ward.png **Spectral Rush**\nWraith Form \nCool-down: 10 seconds\nCost: 35/30/25/20/15 Agony\nRange:650\n*Abraxas blasts forwards, destroying the life force from anything in his path.*\n\nAbraxas blasts forward, dealing 45/75/105/135/165 (+45% ability power) magic damage every .5 seconds to anyone in his path over 2 seconds.

He cannot attack during this time. For 5 seconds after the duration ends, he takes 20% bonus damage from all sources.\n\n**R) Unbound**\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1426486827563%2Ficons_17540_btn.jpg&key=f0abbd34f14549f3a15cd94dd9970851&width=150&height=150&errorUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.leagueoflegends.com%2Fapollo%2Fassets%2Fdiscussion-thumbnail-ward.png \nNo cost\nCool-down: 6 seconds (60 seconds if either form died)\n*Abraxas frees his soul from his bodily prison for a time, allowing him to move unburdened but also unprotected by his armor, while it lays at the spot he left it until he inevitably returns.*\n\nAbraxas releases himself from his armor and leaves it behind, entering his wraith form. While in this form, Abraxas gains +15/20/25/30% attack damage, +10% movement speed, and ignores unit collision, but loses 35/30/25/20% of his armor and magic resist. His max health while in this form is equal to his base health plus 0/100/200/300 (+20/30/40/50% bonus health). His wraith form health is unaffected by items. He spawns with the same percent of health he had in armor form. His armor remains in the spot where he activated this ability with 650 + all bonus health. If the armor is destroyed or he dies in spectral form, he is returned to armored form with only 15% health and -55% movement speeds back at the spot of where his armor was. The armor provides vision, and can be the target of spells.\nAbraxas can travel around in a range of 2300 meters away from his armor. If he leaves this range, he has 3 seconds to return or he will die in spectral form. Abraxas can recast this ability at any time in a range of 975 from his armor after he has been out of combat for 3 seconds to return to armored form at the spot of his armor. If he does, his health is equal the percent of his wraith form's health + 15% of his total health. He can also go up to it and select it to return to it regardless of if he's in combat.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-16T04:04:41.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, the Corki Valkyrie definitely clarifies a lot.

This is an awesome concept and it's even more impressive that this is your first one.  I really like the thoroughness and attention to detail, and there are some really cool elements of this kit.

I looked into Verrix and yeah they are pretty similar, with my guy being more Fight Safe Fight Safe and him being more IM GOING IN. A pretty funny comparison.\n\n> The thing that confuses me is how you chose to label Abraxas- a tank/assassin.

I think having a gap closer that then naturally feeds into a knockback is an odd pairing and doesn't solidify Abraxas' role in either case.\n\nI labeled him a tank/assassin solely because league doesn't really have one, but looking back at it now he seems to fit the fighter/assassin role better due to how you'd build him with more damage focus. I wanted him to feel like {{champion:56}} was inside of {{champion:111}} but I think more fighter oriented in armor form is better.\n\nAhh yes the Q. First off note that its 2 separate cooldowns, they just share levels. The reason I thought he could use a knockback was because I was worried he'd feel defenseless if someone got him into that state with the 55% slow, so it's kind of a \"get off of me\" move. If you have a better suggestion though id love to hear it.\n \n> I also see, if I'm not mistaken, that Abraxas has two forms of passive AoE damage, similar to Renekton/Nasus ultimates.

I added this to give his initiation a bit more Umph.\n\n> The absolute coolest part about this kit is the Ultimate.
