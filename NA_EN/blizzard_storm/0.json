Please don't give me Riot Kayle/Kayle. I don't mind the free skin, but I don't want another champion. I have OCD and I like having exactly 60 champions on my account. If you randomly give me Kayle and make my roster 61 champions, I legitimately might quit League of Legends. You don't have to give me anything, I don't want anything. Please just don't give me a champion on this account.
