Even though it's an AoE spell, it has a special rule tacked to it where it does double damage to single target if it only hits 1 target. And also applies spell effects like deathfire as single target. (Not 100% confirmed on this, but like 95.2% sure that's how it works.)\n\nI think there may be a few others like this but can't think of them atm. Old {{champion:82}} Q used to be, but they changed that.\n\nBut for the most part, yeah, just cause an AoE spell only hit 1 target doesn't mean it's not an AoE spell, cause it still had the potential to hit multiple targets. Just think of it like a skillshot that could have hit multiple targets, but missed all targets but one.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-06T22:16:21.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jhin is also a bit unique.
