I have since achieved at least one S- or S ranks with each, but have not received any mastery tokens. My most recent game was an ARAM where I got an S rank with Rammus, who has definitely been mastery 5 for some time now. It told me I'd received an S in the end of game screen, but no token. I checked Hextech, but to no avail, I did not receive my hard-earned mastery tokens. At least one of these champs, if not both, should be at 6 by now.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-13T16:15:57.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking into this for you, I do see that these games were played in ARAM.  Per our [champion mastery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide) guide, tokens are currently only available in Summoner's Rift.  It will be necessary to play in those modes.  Hopefully that helps clear things up, and best of luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Librain","date":"2016-09-13T17:48:37.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would explain it.
