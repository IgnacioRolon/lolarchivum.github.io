I'm not sure what your technical background is so feel free to ask for clarification on anything. \n\nThe 3D map itself is built using [threejs](https://threejs.org/) (an awesome library for running 3D scenes in the web). The map is made up of a bunch of tiles (flat images of each area that can be stitched together to make the whole map). To make them 3D we use a [depth map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_map), a black-and-white image that tells the terrain how high it should render. The closer a pixel is to white, the taller it will be. \n\nEverything else, like the sidebar, navigation, and image viewing experience are built in [React](https://reactjs.org/). They still have to talk to the map though so to bridge that gap we used Redux (which basically makes a global object for all of the data). Both the UI and 3D map can read data from [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) so they know what to render. \n\nThat's the high level tech behind the map. I'm happy to answer any questions you might have!","replies":[{"poster":"The Lunari","date":"2018-08-15T08:43:52.030+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, \n\nThanks for such tech. juicy answer - you got all my tech. question sir!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nebuluna","date":"2018-08-15T02:11:57.266+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there! \n\nTo answer your question, the Design Systems Team built the map experience using paper prototyping, user journeys and flows, high-fidelity mockups and digital prototypes that we used to test with internal Rioters. For initial concepts, this map was created through software such as Adobe XD, Photoshop, and Invision for prototyping. From there, our technical artists transformed it into code! I'll go ahead and summon Riot Biomarker so he can explain that part of the process!\n\n\nWe also did a big content audit for internal illustrations and conceptual artwork that existed within Riot Games but players had never seen before. Our goal being that we wanted to establish the world of Runeterra as a living, breathing place for players. \n\nFor the map terrain, artists hand painted layers in Photoshop referencing Bioluminescence's cartography work along with 3D models of iconic landmarks placed to make the world feel more real. \n\nWe are super happy that you love the map!\n{{sticker:sg-kiko}}","replies":[{"poster":"The Lunari","date":"2018-08-15T08:44:14.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the quick and big reply - as a fellow Product designer I tip my hat to you sir for such great answers and user contact!\n {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nMay I ask if you could share a little bit more info about the User research behind the Map? (If it's not a top secret) It would be cool and amazing to see more of the UX in Rito.\n\nJust curious question - why are you using adobe XD over Sketch? (Especially when you cant export your .xd file high-end wireframes/mockups to .psd for an artist, but with sketch plugin, you can)\n\nAnd my last one - Can you share your progress ideas on map expansions? What would be the ideal goal (of the map) or if is there any strategy on how to implement the map more to the client to get a better user experience? \n\nOne more time big thanks for answer all my question in my original post, even if this will not be answered (I will understand why :D ) - you did a great job! Keep rocking!\n\n[And as a reward take this meme for you.](http://blog.uxeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/user-experience-memes-24.jpg)","replies":[{"poster":"Nebuluna","date":"2018-08-17T19:11:01.203+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes! Love the meme & super excited to talk UX! \n{{sticker:sg-lux}} \n\nIn terms of understanding the problem space, we did not have a current and definitive player-facing map of the world of Runeterra. None of our stories, comics, events, regions, champions, etc. have any clear spatial context within the world. As a result, many players’ connections to Runeterra were fractured and inconsistent. Players were creating their own maps to fill in what they wanted to know, but we wanted to make sure they had an accurate source to base their theories from. We understood that by creating a map, it would be a good way to help players understand spatially a theme or champions by placing them in the context of a location. We want to strengthen these connections and present the lore in an interactive format so players can literally explore Runeterra!\n\nOnce we had something to test, such as the usability or general player sentiment towards a new feature, we would go ahead and test with a small pool of internal players (e.g. Rioters) and analyze that data. One of the things we learned through testing was that players wanted or expected to the see more art on the map. This lead us to design a new feature, the Image Galleries and Points of Interest pins on the map! User Research is super valuable and highly insightful! \n\nSince we work in the gaming space, it’s important for us to use tools that are accessible through multiple platforms. While I have a Macbook and a PC, I prefer to play my games and work on my PC and will prioritize using Adobe XD or Illustrator over Mac-only products. Since Sketch is only available on Mac, I decided to use Adobe XD instead. In tandem, our visual designer takes my wireframes and create high-end mocks in .psd using our existing Hextech UI library. Sometimes, I don’t get to do high-fidelity wireframes and instead whiteboard or sketch some concepts and flows on my notebook and present that to him. I haven’t drawn on napkins (yet), but have drawn on post-its and index cards!\n\nFor the future of the map, we definitely have some features that were not able to make it to the release of the map due to project scope and time constraints. We want to add all the stories, comics, videos, and champions, and continue to explore new ways to introduce interactive elements to the experience. \n\nI hope I've answered all your questions :). I'm happy to answer any more you might have!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
