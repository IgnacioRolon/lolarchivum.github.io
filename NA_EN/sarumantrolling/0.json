At this point, vel walked up to them and let them kill him. I went to my blue, guess what.. kayne ghost walks over the wall, smites my blue and kills me. Velkoz follows, lets them kill him. \n\nAt this point hes flaming and saying its pointless to play if the jungler is inting, and he buys a longsword. When I came back to life, I went to get gromp. Kayn is still sitting at my blue waiting, he kills me with the help of mundo who was sitting top tri from blue side. At this point kayn is like 8/0 and finding me everywhere in my jungle killing me, I attempted to gank top, died to mundo. I attempted to gank bot once I got ult, died to kayn counter gank. Now im like 0/8, still trying to farm what I can that kayn is not taking, and velkoz continues building AD and running up to enemies letting them kill him. \n\nHe starts spamming ff vote at 15, still building AD, still intentionally feeding. I managed to get 1 kill in a team fight at the base, while he ran in dying over and over.

You evade the Morg binding, but your \"escape\" path is odd, you know, not towards the closest safe area or not towards a wall to flash over, and you turn around to auto...twice.\n\nThat's really really ugly, but it's possible to make really bad decisions. Maybe not inting.\n-------------------\nAt 1:01, your botlane has just been chased out of your jungle by 4 enemies. You charge the Morg, who binds you. When that times out...you walk forward into the rest of them. Who you knew were there. Who you knew were preparing to take your red. You had no flash. Your only skill, Audacious Charge still on CD. You were just half-healthed by the Morgana, and walking forward into the enemies that you knew were there was your choice.\n\nThat's inting. You did that on purpose. You had ample time to choose anything else.\n-----------------------\n....You chose to go right back to the red...where you knew they were. Your tri-brush was warded, so you knew that their botlane hadn't left your jungle yet. You take the blast-cone over the wall. You see that the red isn't in the camp, and you finally see the enemy botlane going back to lane. You walk into the brush instead of walking away.\n\nInting.\n-------------------\n2:54 after taking your wolves, you see Kayne in the midlane. You go to your blue. 2:58 Kayne is visible leaving mid, going to your blue side jungle. You don't drag the blue into the brush, but instead do a standing trade out in the open. 3:04 Kayne walks through the wall, right in front of you. You run away till 3:09, when suddenly, at half health already, you turn around to auto attack. The Vel-Koz, who is far away, is still level 1, and only has Plasma Fission. Even if they weren't inting, they would be completely unable to assist you. 3:12 you did smite for health. Good work. But you're still taking a standing trade with someone a level above you. You could have maybe walked away, but you Audacious Charged back into him, again. \n\n~~Inting~~ (edit: Explained enough. Not inting)\n-----------------------------\n3:48 you were spotted by the vision plant. That means that Kayne is still in your jungle and that he sees you. You...continue forward. 3:53 you engage the Gromp. 3:54 Mundo, in vision, walks under the turret to your jungle. 3:58 Kayne appears. You die.\n\nInting\n---------------------------------\n6:14 Kayne in vision near your raptors. You finish killing the wolves. 6:20 Kayne in vision near raptors again. You decide to go to your raptors...6:24 Kayne almost kills Rengar, and the Rengar flashes away. 6:26 Fizz 205 health, recalling. Rengar 215 health still running. You walking towards a Kayne two levels above you. You sit there and auto attack till 6:31 where you run away....to not underneath the turrets. Perfectly between both turrets' range, ~~then waste your flash after the burn is sure to kill you.~~ (edit: unfair accusation rescinded)\n\ninting\n--------------------------------\n7:11 you help chase the Kayne out from turret diving the Rengar who had been unable/unwilling to finish their recall (it seems that he was trolling as well). 7:16 you ward, and Fizz is coming up behind you to help. Enemy Yasuo is seen leaving mid to back up their Kayne. 7:16 Fizz turns back to mid to tend to the minions since Kayne has been chased out of the dive. You keep going. 7:18 you finally catch up to Kayne. 7:21 you die. Yasuo was there too. You knew it. And Kayne would have killed you solo anyway.\n\n~~inting~~ (edit: Understandable set of decisions: Not inting)\n--------------------------------\n8:31-9:00 you're fighting Ez under your turret. You keep getting poked down, really low, really easily, but Ez takes some turret shots. Seeing an opening, you charge him, but die.\n\nIt looked pretty nasty taking all that damage, you could have died at almost any time, and recalling from there would have been a decent decision, but that xp probably looked really good, and the last charge at Ez could have gotten him.\n\nNot inting\n------------------------------------\n11:00ish Taking minions, killed by the Kayne.\n\nNot inting this time, but very easy for the Kayne because of the prior inting, by you, Rengar, and Vel'Koz.\n--------------------------------------\n12:30 They've chased out the Fizz from your inhib turret, but their minion wave all died, so the tower is safe for now. You go to flank them. You and Quinn jump in, 2v3 and take one down.\n\nNot inting, but easy for the enemies because of the prior inting.\n---------------------------------\n15:00ish Getting minions again, killed under turret.\n\nnot inting, but easy for the enemies because of the prior inting.\n-----------------------------------\n16:50 died defending inhib\n\nNot inting, but easy for the enemies because of the prior inting.\n--------------------------------\n18:00ish solo contesting an already destroyed inhibitor. Running away...not towards safety. Flashing in. But, you were already dead at that point.\n\nEh, it's hard to call this one. Your retreat path, as well as the decision to try to defend an already lost objective. But, either way, the prior inting decided the outcome of this interaction.\n------------------------------\n18:45 died defending Nexus\n\nNot inting, but easy for the enemies because of the prior inting.\n-----------------------------------\n--------------------------------\n--------------------------------\nSo,~~ 6~~ (edit: 4) inting deaths, ~~8~~ (edit: 10) not inting or questionable enough deaths.\n\nInting gets a 14 day ban for the first offense. It only takes one purposeful death to be called inting. You inted.","replies":[{"poster":"SarumanTrolling","date":"2018-07-27T07:42:22.106+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Call it what you will but I know I didnt die on purpose. I did not make any decision with the thought \"im going to go die on purpose.\" Call it soft inting or not caring what happens but whatever. I am not a jungler, as you can see from my match history I play only support unless I get auto filled. I don't know the thought process of a \"good\" jungler or where im even supposed to go. You call it inting, I call it sucking at jungling. I don't think i've had one game where I did well in the jungle, and this was an extreme version of what I already expected getting auto filled. \n\nI made choices to try to save myself from being behind all game as I already knew I would be with losing most of my jungle the first few minutes of the game and already getting flamed. Judging from what you say, all the enemies being visable before my deaths, I now know that I don't look at my map enough. Whatever, ill take this 2 weeks to learn how to jungle better from videos and streams and.. whatever.\n\n-edit-\n\nLet me explain a few of those deaths you've deemed inting:\n\n1. When I go into the brush at red, I think at that point that its possible for me to steal it with smite to save it and put him behind. Didn't work. Not inting. \n\n2. When you claim I \"saw\" kayne mid, I did not. I imagined that after he stole my entire bot jungle he would go to his own jungle and leave me behind with no red or chickens. At this point I have leveled my Q, so when I try to escape, I turn to auto for the knockup, as he has my red so im slowed, and he is a level ahead so he has his E to slow ME from far away. I did not expect velkoz to help as I already knew he was inting after the first stunt he pulled. I was only trying to survive with my Q knockup and the mastery that gives me attack speed when I first auto an enemy. Not inting. \n\n3. Why would I run anywhere but the furthest away from my enemy? I walk between the towers because walking directly to the t2 tower leaves me much closer to him than running directly in the opposite direction. Not inting, trying to escape and getting outplayed. \n\n4. I don't recall the moment I chased kayne, but yes that was a bad decision. He must have been low and I thought I could get some XP and shutdown gold in some desperate attempt to catch up. My actions were not because I WANTED to die. not inting. \n\nso, 2 very questionable deaths. Probably very bad decisions out of frustration, not only from this game starting poorly but from the previous 2 losses as well. ","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2018-07-27T10:08:52.145+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I probably judged too harshly.\n\n1: Going for the smite on the red in that situation is.....How to explain my thoughts: In the 1/3rd of a second prior to entering the brush, the decision to enter the brush has the highest potential reward, and having already lost all that time means that not contesting would be a big loss. So entering the brush wasn't exactly the part of that decision that I consider inting. The inting occurred when you chose to _enter_ your red side jungle after already dying there twice before any jungle camps spawned.\n\nPathing to that side of your jungle at that point in time looks like an intentional desire to feed the enemy kills. \n\n2: That explanation is full and complete. A set of poor decisions is not inting. The Audacious Charge at the end, instead of taking those last steps to get under turret still looks bad, but I can see that at that point you felt dead already and were just returning damage with a skill that came off CD. Not inting.\n\n3: Engaging with the Kayne at that time really looks like you're intending to give him an advantage. Both of your nearby teammates were completely unable to assist without great risk of dying. He was much more powerful than you were. You had two turrets available to escape to, but chose to run across between them. I will retract my accusation that you burned flash purposefully.\n\nIt doesn't look like you were really trying to escape though. And the part where you chose to give the enemies an advantage was when you chose to engage Kayne in combat. Choosing to give the opponents an advantage is punishable.\n\n4: He was knocked down to half health, and for a half-second you did have Fizz coming to back you up. It would be reasonable to not notice that Fizz changed trajectories, and greeding for a kill is not inting. So, Not inting.\n---------------------------\nThat brings my total to 4:10.","replies":[{"poster":"SarumanTrolling","date":"2018-07-27T10:16:19.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can live with that.\n\n At least you understand that not everyone is part of an elite LCS team and we all don't have excellent map awareness or pro jungle strats. I have played Xin a few times... not enough to know my strength at any level or with any amount of items. As I am a Nami main, I am rarely close to enemies unless they jump on me.. all of my knowledge of the game was gained by playing from afar and assisting with heals or a bubble and retreating. An in-your-face character like xin or irelia is cool to me, I like their themes but they are hard to play. \n\nI stick by what I said about not inting though, I lose enough games as it is without just throwing LP away. I surely wouldn't risk being banned for 14 days or permanently to piss off 1 person... Its cool, though. I play Heroes of the Storm which will hold me over until the 9th.\n\nYou know, though... when I ran between t1 and t2 towers to escape kayne, he could easily have dove me and taken 1-2-3 tower shots and still used his ghost walk ability to escape tower range and heal himself. As I said.. I was just trying to get as far away as I could.

I can't read anything in team chats, only all chat so I can't verify claims of people saying certain things.\n\nHowever, your description of the first encounter isn't what I saw. Vel did try to help you and he fired his Q off to slow as many people as he could and he tried to hang around to see if they'd continue the invade and they did and he was trying to run away. Would it have been better if he warded before leaving? Yes. Is it punishable that he didn't, no. He might have been too focused on escaping alive or he just figured you would start on the other side of the map instead of going back to red when you could see that they were still there. \n\nIf anything it could be feasible that you were inting early game because you kept engaging on higher level enemy champions who had invaded your jungle and were just making a point that your allies don't help you in your jungle when you're behind... but I really don't have any time to review your other jungle games to see if this is normal behavior or if you're inting.\n\nI don't really see inting except two questionable deaths. 1) Rift Herald Solo, 2) mid solo farming and ezreal just comes behind him and eats him.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2018-07-27T09:35:57.255+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:267}} Hey there,\n\nI deleted the picture you had in your thread as it stated the name of the summoner you are talking about in this thread.

I see that my name draws more attention to me than it should but it is just a summoner name not any indication that I am a troll or I will int in games. I have seen horrible names, \"Bot or I AFK\" \"Yas or Feed\" stuff like that how is my name worse than those? lol it boggles the mind.

You continued to laser focus on the velkoz muddied any meaningful discussion in this thread because again, no one else in that game has any impact on your punishment whatsoever.  9 people could had inted or 0 people inted that game have zero influencement on your ban.  It's pointless to tell us what he did that game.  Focus the discussion on yourself only.\n\nDeath (or feeding) is not the sole reason behind the ban.  It is called INTENTIONALLY feeding.  You can have 30 unintended deaths in a game by being grossly outplayed and camped and you would not be banned.  If you have just a few INTENDED deaths to screw over your teammates, that would get you banned.\n\nIntentionally feeding, if detected, is a minumum 14 days ban the detection gives a lot of leeway to avoid false positive and it's pretty hard to trip that thing.  I am unable to pull your match history from where I am right now, but when I am able, I'll try to give a more detailed reply.","replies":[{"poster":"SarumanTrolling","date":"2018-07-27T06:02:04.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I died.. a lot.
