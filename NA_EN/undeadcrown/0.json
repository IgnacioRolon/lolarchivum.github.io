I get in a game with a premade that bans my champ and calls mid for themselves. (big deal, I&#039;ll top) after I pick my secondary champ (Trundle) They say they&#039;re going top. Nope, they are going top. So We don&#039;t have a jg now, since he went top start of game. I&#039;m assuming by them bitching constantly in pre-game that they wanted me to dodge but I didn&#039;t want the timer so I went with it.\r\n\r\nI start the game, go bot and they literally bait me for a death, my own team. Cool. I go bot again and I legit died but it was my own fault for that one. \r\n\r\nAs the game goes on our singed feeds his ass off, and I not being a good trundle to begin with and stuck bot am getting destroyed. \r\nEVEN THE ENEMY TEAM WAS SAYING SORRY TO ME ABOUT THEM TROLLING. \r\nAfter game the pre-made reports me and I get a 14-day suspension. \r\n\r\nCan anyone from RIOT please take a look at the chat that game or even replay the game and see, please? This is annoying that pre-mades can have that kinda power...\r\n\r\nThanks kindly","replies":[{"poster":"Bettnachleger","date":"2018-05-26T11:50:36.965+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're roleplaying Trundle really well.\n13 deaths, didn't spend a single gold, giving first blood under enemy tower + a few more kills.\nSure, you're the victim of a trolling premade ...\nHopefully you get a perma ;^)","replies":[{"poster":"UndeadcrowN","date":"2018-05-28T23:00:20.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First death was next to tower north of it, team went in for the person coming down and they ran away when I started attacking. Two people used flash to get out of it even faster. Then the singed feeds a lot and I just couldn't keep going. So good job basing your opinion off not even 1/3 the facts, kid.\n\nAnd forgetting to buy and item in the beginning cause I was focused on rushing to the gank.\nAfter that I died again AND THEN NOTICED I didn't have any items. By then the chat log as well as singed dying on purpose would give you an indication as to why my mood for that round was shot to even play.","replies":[{"poster":"Bettnachleger","date":"2018-05-29T06:18:22.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, so what you're saying is, that you started attacking someone under the enemy tower... while people were on the way. \nBut you were already under the enemy tower?\nI mean, okay, maybe that's a point for you, because you tock like  44 Seconds for the first death ;D\n\n> And forgetting to buy and item in the beginning cause I was focused on rushing to the gank.\n\nwhoops you made a mistake\n\n> And forgetting to buy and item in the beginning cause I was focused on inting to the gank.\n\nOkay, explain:\nHow do you forget to purchase items for the whole 16m.51s game?\nHuh? \nI mean, I don't care, you got a ban, so i'm happy.\nBut would still love to know your excuse ;D\n\n\n> After that I died again AND THEN NOTICED I didn't have any items. \n\nWait, you knew you had no items, but ... you never fixed it?\n\n","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ı Sona ı","date":"2018-05-26T06:29:56.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is really unfortunate that you had such a poor game experience with teammates  who weren't as teammatey as they could of been! I recently received a 14 day ban after having a tough game and a player unhappy with me reported me!  However after speaking with Riot support they dug into it for me and saw that I was trying to win the game even though my allies said I wasn't, and they overturned the ban. \n\nThe best thing you can do in this scenario may be to contact Riot Support staff through a ticket or a live chat session if you believe you have been wrongly suspended so they may review your case!

Either you were reported and the game is reviewed or you were not and it is not. Being reported multiple times in a single game does not make the system review you any harder.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TragicEcho","date":"2018-05-26T06:30:45.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Send a ticket to riot with chat log","replies":[]}]}
