Favorite ADC of all time, no cap, no second best after her.  She is the most fun to play champ for me and was there for me after Irelia got gutted post shit show and has given me the best plays and time of my life.\n\nAnd she deserved so much better than this.\n\nIf this is some make up for the whole worlds skin debacle which I really didn't care about - I kinda knew from the jump that Rakan would always be the first one to go solo - you didn't in the slightest.  I'm sure many, many, many X/R players would have loved to wait to get something better because a much smaller group of people like star guardian than say, K/DA or even Battle Academy.  This was so not worth putting a legendary price tag on because of how many players of the champions it will alienate, and it feels bad that their special, all out skins, *their legendary,* were wasted on this.  Freaking kill them both and make them projects, I would have died over them and gone broke.  But you gave them frillier, fluffier cosmic skins and expect us to be happy they're getting a almost, repeat skin?  And everyone knows that it'll a cold day in hell before any champ - leona was a special case - gets more than one.\n\nAhri legendary Star Guardian? Perfect. Love it.  Star bitch with a purpose.  If this one had gone to Zoe?  Great.  She's legit bubbles, stars, and glitter and everything SG embodies and would've been perfect when amped upon steroids.  It's something I liked on other champs. Not the way you have done it with these two. Especially when I noticed from the get go what price point they were gonna hold.\n\nI would have been ecstatic if this slot was saved for a legendary set of Immortal Journey where the subliminal message of their every move and action could have been 'Yes, for one world's series we were apart, but our love is Immortal' and decked them out in the silks, gold, and jade accents and all the good things and made them look undeniably beautiful.  No stars.  No glitter. Just them, in their world finally full of magic and...happy.  No bar fights, just music.  No struggle to live, just an endless dance for them and them alone.\n\nNot only would it have pushed well with their background of being Ionian champions, it would have been an amazing opportunity to make Xayah a little flowier while still maintaining her signature edginess, and make Rakan more extravagant and out there and amping up his ever present effervescent personality and polishing all his peacocky elegance.  Yin and Yang at it's highest aspect.  Her night to his day.\n\nInstead we get...this.  An alienating, wrong feeling, thematic that only one fits well into while the other is shoe horned in to fit in one specific aspect.  Xayah is made to seem like an even bigger bitch than she is, while Rakan graciously and unnecessarily gives his last light away to her.  Leaving her alone.  Forever.\n\nI really hope her castle built of the worlds ashes is grand and great for the travesty committed that is this skin set.  As beautiful as the art is, and kudos to the splash artists and art team despite a few issues, I will not be purchasing these because these are not what they should have been for the price.\n\nPlease, please reconsider these skins.  I truly hope in the future even, if my plea goes unheeded, it will at least make you check twice when considering future skin line ups as well as who and what should get to be called a legendary.","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-08-28T07:00:01.273+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cho'Gath has 2 legendary skins.\nCorki has 2 legendary skins.\nDarius has 2 legendary skins.\nEzreal has a legendary skin _and_ an ultimate skin.\nHeim has 2 legendary skins.\nLeona has 2 legendary skins(even though they're technically the same skin but whatever).\nTristana has 2 legendary skins.\n\nGranted some of those skins may not be considered legendary by today's standards, but the point still stands.

Also, Cho'gaths was a skin for a really sweet and talented cancer patient, so I think it is now considered a mythic and locked behind gem stones. Ezreal's I think was more a consequence of being super old and having an ulti to hide, that then getting a rework and not having a legendary previous (at least to my knowledge).\n\nWith that said, I don't see anyone outside of older champs getting more than one any time soon because visually it makes them look cleaner than their dated base models can while newer champs can and will get away with just really good looking epics.  That's what I meant in reference to their legendary slot because outside of that, it's a slim an dsmall chance, plus if they do decide to make another one (here's to hope!) it will be years in the future once other under loved champs get their much needed skins outside of the ones they had for debut.\n\nBut seriously, thank you for pointing this out. I honestly had no idea.","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-08-28T07:28:27.878+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dark Star Cho'Gath is the cancer patient skin, and I don't think its legendary.\nThe legendary skins I saw for him are Battlecast and Gentleman.\nBut if Dark Star is legendary, that means he has 3.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pink","date":"2019-08-28T07:30:17.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=4 Step Cadence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=6ZZNNlwu,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2019-08-28T07:28:27.878+0000)\n>\n> Dark Star Cho'Gath is the cancer patient skin, and I don't think its legendary.\n> The legendary skins I saw for him are Battlecast and Gentleman.\n> But if Dark Star is legendary, that means he has 3.\n\nWait\n\nGentleman's legend status?

Sorry for the confusion. \n\nI meant DS Cho is definitely classified as a Mythic because it is gemstone locked and marked by the purple gem for skin tiers; checked after you told me about this actually.  I'm also pretty sure it does not check off all the Legend boxes, so it is not both a Legend and a Mythic. I have to check again.\n\nAnd yea the other skins def do qualify as Legends I was just surprised cuz of how old look and are compared to newer ones lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"G0blinSlay3r","date":"2019-08-28T02:02:38.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Now you know how i feel about project jinx.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pink","date":"2019-08-28T02:06:12.711+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Heretics,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=6ZZNNlwu,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-08-28T02:02:38.379+0000)\n>\n> Now you know how i feel about project jinx.\n\nBruh I threw a bitch fit about that skin too it was so shit xD\n\nThis is coming from someone who hates the champ with a passion lol I felt so bad for Jinx fans","replies":[{"poster":"G0blinSlay3r","date":"2019-08-28T02:11:59.556+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Imperial Pink,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=6ZZNNlwu,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-08-28T02:06:12.711+0000)\n>\n> Bruh I threw a bitch fit about that skin too it was so shit xD\n> \n> This is coming from someone who hates the champ with a passion lol I felt so bad for Jinx fans\n\nSeriously idk why were being downvoted for speaking our minds. \nSeems very back handed.\n\nSo much potential for riot to do great inspiring work.\nAnd we get the bottom of the bucket.","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-08-28T07:02:19.217+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You didn't get downvoted for speaking your mind.\n\nYou got downvoted because you admitted that you were going to break the TOS by installing 3rd party software to change PROJECT: Jinx and stream yourself afking every time you see the skin in-game.\n\nDon't act like a fucking victim, cause you're not.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pink","date":"2019-08-28T07:26:17.293+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=4 Step Cadence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=6ZZNNlwu,comment-id=0000000000000001,timestamp=2019-08-28T07:02:19.217+0000)\n>\n> You didn't get downvoted for speaking your mind.\n> \n> You got downvoted because you admitted that you were going to break the TOS by installing 3rd party software to change PROJECT: Jinx and stream yourself afking every time you see the skin in-game.\n> \n> Don't act like a fucking victim, cause you're not.\n\nThey did that?

However you are right in that many people that do like it because of old MG animes and will buy because of it.  You also have to consider time.  Battle Academy is a super new anime skin line in comparison so people may not be a fan of it because none of their mains or in it or they don't like the champs that were in the pool.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-08-28T15:38:11.119+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair points, but there is another point to consider in my opinion.\n\nBattle Academia definitely had (or better put, still has) the potential to become equally popular as Star Guardian.

I'm speaking on popularity from reactions I got outside the forums on each one after people swallowed 'another freaking lux skin +1'.  People really liked the MHA concept and how it was done.  I even saw fanart for champs in the line pretty fast, like Camille, Irelia, and Zoe.  Marketing does play a huge part in how a skin line will be received and they did jack shit for BA outside the 'choose your house' and 'what your house stands for' videos.  Something like SG has nostalgia to immediately garner attention, whereas BA is so new, and inspired by something so new, it really has to be both good on its own and well marketed.\n\nI feel like Riot kinda tried to gimp the skins by playing the house event as the skins event itself cuz they push each house with a specific skin once you chose. Council=Jayce, Faceless=Ezreal, ect.  And then that was it.\n\nBA will definitely expand but I feel it'll be more like Project in a sense.   It will start off with a few skins and the hextech crafting it did start off with, but then get something like PROJECT: Hunters, which is actually the first, what I would consider, full major event for PROJECT with the game mode and all crafting included.  Cuz hunters brought back and added a lot of things. The minions for old and the game mode and of course the color story of 'Neon Mice' for new.  I feel like BA didn't even really get that much, as I think the minions were just normal minions and towers were still basic towers.  Only thing map wise that changed was the Championship accents plus house icons on the floor.\n\nCompeting wise, yes currently the only thing that could theoretically knock down SG, is PROJECT or K/DA.  PROJECT has the establishment and K/DA, despite how green it is, already has a universe page and a *massive* cult following.  Everyone knew wtf a K/DA was even if they didn't know what K/DA was.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PrettyGirlsFeet","date":"2019-08-28T10:25:05.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Imperial Pink,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=6ZZNNlwu,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-08-28T01:58:59.228+0000)\n>\n> I am imploring you from the depths of my soul.

The VO does nothing to show that part at all, it's what i loved so much about her base VO, even tho yea she's an edgy e-girl she has a reason - to not freaking die due to people limiting the magic they need to survive.

I even clearly stated that in the end and the title of my comments.\n\nI am speaking as a *Xayah main*.  I've heard damn near every single voice line and interaction between my love birds and hearing them speak in these skins feels like ice in my veins because it does not sound like them to me.  I am salty that this will be their legendary skin legacy when it didn't need to be. However, like I said before, if this was another epic set i would have been completely and totally fine.\n\nIf u think they are, and that they are great as X/R's legendaries, good for you.
