I'm gonna list some times to show what I'm seeing on my end. They're going to look heckin' weird, and possibly impossible times, but it's just because they're standardized to one time zone and adjusted.\n\nI'm currently showing that you changed the icon at 2017-10-02 23:26:48 PDT and the most recent game was played at \t2017-10-02 16:36:13 PDT. With that data, it looks like you changed the icon back to Worlds and still haven't played any games with it equipped. With that being said, the match with no ranged champions may be taking awhile to properly record. If that's the case, we'll just have to wait for that match to be uploaded for the mission to update. \n\n\nJust to be sure of everything, what game was it that you were playing that you think should have finished the mission? Tell me all the champions that were on your team, or shoot me a screenshot of the game itself so I can triple check everything, otherwise, I can only go off the data I have.","replies":[{"poster":"fizzinurbutt","date":"2017-10-03T03:33:10.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://ibb.co/ezP1kb\nhttps://ibb.co/dpB3yw\nThis is the game that we played with the loading screen.
