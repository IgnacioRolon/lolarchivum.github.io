The ones we have now are fun\n\nIf you think all the new runes look boring, did you know that they are adding a souped-up version of TLD and SRS to the new keystones?","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-09-02T14:19:13.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say those 2 got refocused rather than simply souped up.  The TLD adjustment looks like you need 3 separate types of attack to proc it and unless I'm mistaken that means you don't have a Keystone at level one since you only have one spell and a basic attack.  SRS getting it's proc condition changed shakes up the champ pool that uses it quite a bit too.  3 attacks rather than a percentage of damage gives way more options for fighters and tanks to take while limiting it's use on assassins and mages to an extent.","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2017-09-03T13:25:03.162+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're mistaken. Each single attack counts as a trigger.\n\nWhat this \"3 seperate triggers\" means that it will prevent Thunderlord's proccing from multihit AoEs and dots.
