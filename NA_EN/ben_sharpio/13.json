Riot has a big enough playerbase to soak up the slight loss in players when a bunch of jerkoffs leave over the ban and it would show people that Riot takes the game, cheating and player behavior seriously.  As it is, even if they soft ban people for abusing the glitch now, they'll likely still have exploited their way through a bunch of ranked games with it to get unfair wins.

You send out ban waves only AFTER you can either detect the injection tool for the scripts/hacks or have proper preventative system in place to legitimately counter the problem. \n\nAll banning people using the tool would do is tell the script and hack creators \"hey we're on to you\" and they'd immediately start working on a work around and diving Into the code and thier internal forum would know to stop using it and lay low until they can cheat again. \n\nGotta bring down the whole system.
