With that said, I don't think they should do the same with Masteries and Runes. Summoner spells are extremely helpful in-game and they can literally change the tide of the game with Smite on JG'ers. Just last night I played a game with my level 6 friend to help her level up and I, like always, called top. We had a Sona mid, a MF and a Tahm Kench bot, so she was stuck going JG with Pantheon. We ended up winning the game (mostly because of the Sona), but she had an extremely hard time leveling. I believe we won the game with everybody level 18, Kench at 17, and she was at level 12 still. I just feel like that's ridiculous. She can't JG because she doesn't have Smite because what, she hasn't played long enough? Then again, though, I do still feel that, if for nothing else than for marketing purposes, Riot needs to keep some leveling-based perks in the game that still affect the game itself, like Masteries and Runes.\n\nMasteries are important to in-game, sure, but nowhere near as much as Summoner spells, so I feel like that's something they could leave as a leveling-based perk. Runes, then, are even less important to in-game success. Again, they are important and they're extremely helpful, but there are people who win games without them. And when I say in-game success, I think I mean more that, without, say, Smite, there's almost no way to correctly work your position in the game, whereas Masteries and Runes aren't going to hinder your ability to JG. They might hinder your ability to JG WELL, but you can still JG correctly without them. They aren't a necessity for fitting your position on the map. Now I fail at League and know next to nothing about its mechanics and all that jazz. However, I'm pretty sure I'm not wrong on this one. If I am, I apologize. However, I still say Summoner spells are probably the only thing that would hinder someone's ability to simply fit their position on the map.\n\nI would also like to address the fairness you mentioned. You say that the Masteries and Runes give an unfair advantage to some because they've played longer, but that's not the case. Masteries and Runes are a player-chosen thing. Yes, the slots to get them are leveling-based and the quality of the Runes are leveling-based, but the player still chooses which Runes and Masteries to use both in their sets and which set they use in each game. Now this already kind of disproves the unfairness only because just because people have the slots, doesn't mean they're going to use them correctly. Veigar hurts a lot with his AP, so if you build MR, you can defend against him a little better. But, if you're doing blind pick, you don't know you're up against a Veigar, so say you build AP as well. Now you're just making it harder for yourself. The more AP you have, the more damage he does to you with his own AP, so whether or not your item build consists of MR, your Runes and Masteries still give AP and that's going to put you at a slight disadvantage. Basically, just because somebody has the potential and capability to be at an advantage, doesn't mean they know how to or will do so.\n\nNow I addressed that, but I should also say the other part of it for safe measure. I main Gnar, who is typically built either AD or Juggernaut or both. Of the two games I built AD, I lost one and won the other. Of the 15 games I built Juggernaut, I only won 3 and lost 12. Now, of the 18 games I played building AP Gnar, I lost 10 and won 8. Also, since I fail at this game, people who main Gnar and are good at League would probably do a lot better when doing the same build as me. Where I'm going with this is that most people build a certain way against Gnar because he generally goes AD or Juggernaut. People on my team also get mad at me for building AP because something or other about scaling. So people don't expect me to build AP against them. Therefore, when I do, it throws them off and they, for a second, can't adapt fast enough, giving me enough time to get in a kill or at least base them. So whether or not they have more or less Masteries and/or Runes than me, I still built mine different than they were expecting, so they weren't able to fight me as well. Putting this in a more objective setting, if someone were to build something the enemy wouldn't expect or that isn't all that common, even if it only works a little bit, it will still throw the enemy off enough to give you an advantage, so the amount of Masteries and Runes someone has doesn't matter near as much as Summoner spells.","replies":[{"poster":"8Hz98hmIDG","date":"2016-01-20T19:52:10.887+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with all of this.

Another problem with giving Smite to early level people is the difficulty of jungling in the first place. It's relatively easy to be a top, mid, or bottom laner. Being a support is a lot harder conceptually (I'm relatively new, think I joined when Rek'Sai was the latest champion, and I still remember my pre-thirty experience), but it's not something that's necessary to learn when you start the game. Jungling, however, is a step above those four roles. I remember playing with my silver friend, and he normally played Vi or Lee Sin jungle in my games because we didn't have a jungler most of the time. So after I got my first champion, I decided to save up for Vi and get her because I didn't want to be stuck in games without a jungler. After I got her, I tried her out. Died on my first clear. Tried another game. Died on my first clear. Gave up Vi and started playing Lissandra (my other champion) again. I did not like jungling, and I did not know what I was doing wrong. I was following a highly approved guide on MobaFIRE, buying the starting items and putting points into all the right masteries. I didn't have Runes, but my friends were certain that it was possible to jungle with only masteries.\nMy problem?\nI had 14 points into the offense tree, and none into the defense tree. I thought I had to fill up the offense tree before I started working on the 9 points that would go into the defense tree. I was wrong. My silver friend became exasperated with me, asked me what my masteries were, and had me change into 5/9/0. What a change. I was suddenly clearing the jungle without [major] problems.\nSo, in summary, it took me a lot of time to get used to the jungle, even with a strong jungler and a guide from C9 Meteos. I don't think that it would be a healthy decision to overwhelm new players with all five roles at once. Force them to learn the easy roles first, and then they can start taking cracks at supporting and jungling once they get used to the game and **get masteries**. The jungle is going to be inhospitable for new players even if they have smite, because unless you're playing Nunu or another really strong sustain jungler, you're going to die on a first clear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2016-01-20T00:26:05.619+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"But the problem is, you are not introduced to them.

Then, they find it really fun watching the ganks, so they decide to install League and main JG'er role. They get in, and start JG'ing. They started out with it and their friend helped out, so they have a fair idea of what to do. Starting out immediately without Mastery points is going to be a pain, sure, but if you don't have good masteries for JG'ing, get a leash, Heal, and Smite, and you won't die your first camp. If you really want to be safe, ask if they wouldn't mind helping leash just one more to level you up and give you more of an advantage. That shows that Masteries won't be TOO much of a problem if you know how to work around it. Also, please note that I SUCK at JG'ing, so if it seems like I'm speaking out of my rear end, it's probably true.\n\nThat's a very specific situation, sure, but the concept still applies and it carries over. Smite at level 1 helps them adapt to the idea of using it and how, when, and why it would be executed early instead of having to wait until level 10 and THEN start adapting. I posted a reply to another comment on this thread, but I'll restate it and shorten it here. I was playing a game where I called top because, at the time, I was only good at top. Turns out I'm maybe-sort-of-half-decent with support Raka, so now that's my secondary if needed. But back to the match, I went top Gnar, we had a Sona mid (who was pretty much the only reason we won), and a Miss Fortune and Tahm Kench in bot lane. My friend, who was also playing, was then stuck first timing JG at level 6. I had played JG and I had Smite, but I sucked at it and I figured there was a VERY slight chance she could have had a natural talent at JG'ing, so she went with the first sort-of-JG Champion she listed, which was Pantheon.\n\nI leashed her three times and, by the end of the game, she was still only level 12 compared to everyone else's 18 and one 17. Sona also got fed in mid and carried, but y'know, whatever. So when these lower levels get stuck somewhere or, worse, there's a four-man premade and the last person is stuck with the only open position which is JG, they tend to do badly and then the experience of JG'ing could potentially be ruined for them. Giving Smite to all levels just helps people fit their own role on the map well. It's like a nerf for a whole role rather than a specific Champion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xicashina","date":"2016-01-19T21:54:06.565+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":24,"body":"Just ....

New players have terribad experiences cuz a smurf jinx gets fed in 8 minutes and comes out of a bush with a mysterious red ring on her shoes and shes suddenly burning down summoners rift, and everyone is like wtf wtf wtf.  now thats a problem.\n\nI suppose one thing they could do is lock 1-9 lvls away in their own bracket?  that way you wouldnt have 9 and under teaming w/ 10 and up, so there would be no unfair advantage.\n\nI have to say though i think that keeping certain things from players at first is a good idea.  What would keep players playing if they didnt have anything to work towards?  Give you everything off the bat you say?  not have to try and level up for anything extra you say?  well thats BORING, and would make smurfing an even bigger problem.  Also xp boosts make money.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-01-20T02:43:23.011+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't help that one of the most iconic noob-stompers synergizes so well with sated devourer {{champion:11}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"xnxHUNTERxnx","date":"2016-01-20T22:46:28.331+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"bot games are not designed around a jg position so it doesn't make sense to allow lower level to use it until they are ready to play pvp imo","replies":[{"poster":"criizzash","date":"2016-01-21T06:50:37.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would mean level 3, not 10.","replies":[{"poster":"xnxHUNTERxnx","date":"2016-01-21T22:09:42.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i still have to disagree a player unless a smurf account is not ready to be potentially matched with a level 20 or 30 and it does happen","replies":[]}]}]}]}
