Season 6 I played 90% of my games as sona, then soraka, morg, and braum. My problem is that braum&#039;s laning phase generally isn&#039;t strong and I tend to underperform on him. So i&#039;m looking for a tanky support that would fit my play style. I enjoy playing ranged poke supports because I can do my thing from a safe distance, and I actually do damage. With tanks you usually have to go all in, and I&#039;m simply not good at knowing when I can and can not go all in. Especially reading on my adc&#039;s follow up. I&#039;ve tried alistar, leona, braum obviously, thresh, blitz. And I can&#039;t seem to bring myself to enjoy the tank play style. What kind of support would you guys suggest that I could take when my team needs some extra tank? Thanks!","replies":[]}
