I have to manually close and reopen league and Im usually any where from 2-10 minutes late to the game and have suffered through countless Low Priority queues because of this. I am on a Mac. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"xl Kirito lx","date":"2016-05-24T01:35:58.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh hey, I think you have the same problem I've had for the past season.

You have to wait out the crash.  It'll take 5- min.
