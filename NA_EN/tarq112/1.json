The distance to our servers, your ISP's routing, or something else could be a few factors.  Our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide would be handy to test the strength of your connection when you play different connections.
