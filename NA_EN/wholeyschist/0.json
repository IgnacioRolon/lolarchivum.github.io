Time and time again I'm getting games where junglers will not attempt one objective, int to a lane (not obviously, but in way that you can tell they did it on purpose) and then afk split push while the enemy team dominates.  I report it every time, but nothing is ever done. I'm done playing league until they can fix the trolls.  Tired of putting hour after hour into a game and lose because of people trolling (yes, obviously I have bad games too, but this is different).","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-02-27T23:53:16.247+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"What do you mean \"not obviously, but in way that you can tell they did it on purpose\"? If they did it where it is obvious they did it on purpose, it's inting. If it's not clear they did it on purpose, it's not. You don't get to say that you're some magic omniscient being who \"can tell\" - it's either clear to an **unbiased** third party (i.e. a Riot employee/support agent) or it's not. You are not somehow better at this than an unbiased third party - and in fact, by being in the game, you're the **last** person who should be \"trusted\" to determine inting.\n\nSomeone not going for objectives does not make them a troll. Having poor jungle pathing does not make them a troll. If they're dead, on the top side of the map, it isn't warded, etc. and the enemy jungler happens to get it first, **that's not trolling, that's losing in skill as a team**. The jungler is not the only person with responsibility for dragon/rift herald. If you are bot lane, you should be ensuring vision of not the pit but the **paths** to the pit. If the enemy jungler starts to try and solo dragon, **you go make them stop it**. If the enemy *team* starts to fight dragon (i.e. including mid and/or bot lanes), then that's a failure of your lanes to provide pressure. **None of that is the jungler's fault**.\n\nSplit pushing against a team that is heavily dominating **is the right call 99% of the time**. When it becomes clear that 5v5 fights don't end in your favor, why would they keep doing them? You know the saying \"he who repeats his actions expecting a different result is a.....\"? Well it applies here. Your jungler saw that you weren't winning 5v5s and weren't making any progress by grouping all 5 together - so they tried something different. You'd rather them just sit with you and let the enemy keep chipping away at your towers until they win?","replies":[{"poster":"IainG10","date":"2020-02-28T05:55:02.425+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is entirely possible to do thing intentionally but not obviously; now, I'm not saying that's what's been happening in OP's games, but just to clarify the point. \n\nThough it's quite hard to think of something specific to LoL, if I took Blitzcrank, and: \n1. Used all my Relic Charges on Caster Minions \n2. Then took Siege Minions with no Relic Charge ready \n3. Used Q (without then using E or R) to hook the enemy engage on top of my ADC for the entire game \n4. Only warded the Side Bush in Bot Lane (the one near the Inner Tower) \nI would definitely be trolling, but it could be passed off as a bad game, but only to someone who didn't know how to Support. However, I imagine the IFS wouldn't be able to spot it, because I doubt the IFS has a nuanced enough understanding of how to play to understand what I was doing: I'm clearly warding, using my Support Item, engaging with my hook; I'm very definitely not AFK; but in reality I'm wasting my wards and Relic Charges, denying my ADC farm, and then directly attempting to get them caught and killed.\n\nNow, that took me quite a while to think up, I have no intention of testing it, and I doubt it applies to OP's example (especially considering how many Junglers are provided by Autofill); but to say it's _completely impossible_ sets a dangerous mindset.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-02-28T00:35:24.104+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solid logic, would like to have a generalized version in its own thread to link to when more people inevitably wail about people not doing what they want in game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WholeySchist","date":"2020-02-28T18:08:50.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Split pushing when their running 5 down mid with baron buff is not the right choice, especially if you are playing a champ with poor wave clear and bad tower damage, but are good peel for your team in a fight.
