Kassadin doesn't have AD scaling spells or high base damages so he needs higher damage AD items/CDR so he can spam riftwalk and keep his E charged for sticking power.

The mana is the key aspect because it makes riftwalk still chunk while you have good sustained and moderate burst with Trinity procs + gunblade and its active. You're not SUPER durable but kassadin is so slippery that this build makes you beefy enough.

He is mobile. \n\nTank refers to HP/resistances where BRUISER refers to damage/HP. It just so happens the best in slot HP items have resistances. \nBecause kassadin has one of the worst non-support base damages in the game and some of the worst scaling of non supports in the game, he cannot be called an assassin.
