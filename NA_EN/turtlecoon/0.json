But then you need to take a step back and examine the overall situation from a neutral perspective.\n\nYeah, you probably would have won that one game if your team did alright.  But why does that matter?  Your rank is a portrayal of your ability to win over a large number of games, and over a large number of games, your teams are going to even out.  You're going to play with and against a similar number of trolls, with and against a similar number of smurfs, with and against a similar number of disconnects.  If you're going 10/2/15 every game, you're going to be climbing.  The fact that you're stuck reflects your own deficiencies.  You may be justifiably angry at that AP Riven you got last game, but you know what?  He's not going to be on your team in five games, ten games, one hundred games.  But you?  You're going to be in every game you ever play.  So whose mistakes should you really be focusing on?  You're not a stupid guy - you already know the answer.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fractalfantasies","date":"2015-05-10T19:59:09.743+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should I play strong pics ('FoTM') or learn a few champs really well?","replies":[{"poster":"turtlecoon","date":"2015-05-10T20:07:23.993+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=fractalfantasies,realm=EUW,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=HXiImb5O,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2015-05-10T19:59:09.743+0000)\n>\n> Should I play strong pics ('FoTM') or learn a few champs really well?\n\nMaster a few comfort picks.

For example, I've seen Leonas randomly leave bot to invade and kill the low-health enemy jungler. Can you suggest any opportunities that most players don't know how to look for? (I already know most of the \"free dragon\" situations).\n\nKnowledge naturally opens up opportunity.  What isn't readily apparent to you is pretty apparent to the other guy.  \n\nLet's say I'm that Leona.  This is probably how I knew what to do.  The enemy jungler is playing Rengar.  He ganked mid at 3:30.  I clicked him and his red buff was half expired.  Red buff lasts two minutes - that means one minute has passed since he acquired Red buff.  Because Red buff has a five minute respawn timer, I can estimate that his Red buff will come back up again in roughly four minutes.  So I type ~7:30 their red into chat.  \n\n7:00 swings around and Rengar ganks mid.  The gank works, but he drops to 1/3 HP.  He then disappears into his red jungle at 7:20.  You know what?  He's pretty low, and I'm fairly certain his Red buff is about to come up.  So I swing by there, and sure enough he's doing Red, so I pick up the easy kill.  \n\nWhile that foray into his jungle may seem a bit random to you, it was a pretty reasonable looking opportunity to me, because I took a moment to interpret available information earlier in the game.  \n\n***\n\nNow, this is just one example, but the point is that there's actually a fair bit of information on the map that people tend not to notice - whether because they didn't take a few minutes to read how long Red buff lasts on the wiki, or because they didn't take a few seconds to click Rengar while he ganked mid.  When you start to take account of that information, a lot of interesting plays will naturally begin to open up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xayahs bich","date":"2015-05-10T18:01:00.764+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you effectively trade in lane as an ADC.

But somehow she still did more damage to me in that time. \n> \n> I feel like every time I try to poke the enemy I always come up on the losing end. How do j fix that\n\nThere's a big difference between poking and trading.  Poking is \"free\" damage when you abuse a momentary advantage to damage an opponent when no retaliation is possible.  Trading is, as the name suggests, is an exchange of damage.  Recognizing the distinction between the two is very important.\n\nPoke patterns tend to be very short.  A simple long-range Lucian Q through a minion, or a quick autoattack/combo while the opposing ADC is stuck in the freeze frames from last hitting a creep.  The goal of poke is to get some free damage down and immediately back off before the opponent can retaliate. \nThis video covers it briefly under the name of \"guaranteed harass\":  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRHVlFwnbqU&t=53s\n\nTrading, on the other hand, is a longer damage exchange rather than a quick burst of free damage.  As an ADC, this means that, as opposed to a quick Q, you want to put out an auto>Q>auto in order to maximize your damage in the damage exchange.    \nBillyBoss (top 10 Challenger) demonstrates the auto>Q>auto pattern nicely here.  \nAs an ADC you may want to watch the entire coaching video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FYYYMNqrU0&t=13m8s\n\nWhat it sounds like here is you're mixing up poking and trading, so you aren't using the optimal attack pattern for the scenario.  You're going in for some quick poke but ending up with a damage trade, and the combo you use does not provide optimal damage output for a full trade.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-05-10T20:40:19.760+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"A dead turtle is talking!

If you turn a 1v2 into a 2v2...that's still a 2v2. \nWhat makes counter-ganking potent is the fact that, in a gank, people play very aggressively due to their sudden numerical advantage.  If you're there to counter-gank, they don't actually have a numerical advantage, and what constitutes an aggressive play is now an over-aggressive play.  What seems like a good 3v2 tower dive for the enemy team becomes pretty questionable if you pop out of a bush and it's now a 3v3 tower dive.  \n\nThe enemy jungler ganks under the same principles that you do.  Put yourself in the enemy jungler's shoes.  If your bot lane is blatantly overextended with half health, the dude's probably pretty likely to show up down there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Byakuya Kuchiki","date":"2015-05-10T18:14:26.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why am I stuck in elo hell.\n\nlol jk jk but seriously As a hypercarry such as katarina and zed if i fall behind what should i do?","replies":[{"poster":"turtlecoon","date":"2015-05-10T23:54:56.142+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=gamerguy13,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=HXiImb5O,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-05-10T18:14:26.786+0000)\n>\n> Why am I stuck in elo hell.\n> \n> lol jk jk but seriously As a hypercarry such as katarina and zed if i fall behind what should i do?\n\nAs Katarina, roam.

It's kind of hard to reach Challenger if you're losing winnable games because you start raging.

Having two Silvers get into a huge argument because they're blaming each other is a pretty common sight.  But I mean, the higher you go, the better people understand the game.  I may not be happy that the enemy top laner received much greater jungle pressure than I did, but when it comes down to it, I'm well aware that I lost lane largely due to my own improper play, and that my jungler was more focused on controlling the Dragon area because he's Nunu.  I may not be happy that my bot lane is 0-4, but I'm well aware that my ADC is a top main who was forced into bot lane due to a mismatch of roles and now has to play Jinx into Sneaky's Lucian.  I'm not going to start arguments over those things, no matter how frustrated I am.\n\nSo, to answer your question, yes.

I invite you to consider that this isn't defensive play, but bad play.  \"Aggressive\" and \"defensive\" are too often used as conveniently nicer ways of framing play that is simply stupid.  If you aren't going for easy harass or high percentage kills, that isn't defensive.  That's stupid.  And if you're all-inning on low percentage kills or going for heavy trades with no clear advantages, that isn't aggressive.  That's stupid.  If you're looking to improve, you need to actively LOOK for areas where your play is stupid, not seek to justify questionable or lazy decision-making under the lens of convenient terms like \"defensive.\"  It's hard to fix a specific mistake if you don't see it as a mistake.\n\nI'm not trying to call you out or imply anything - I've never seen you play.

I do have to say that this is something people tend to completely over-generalize.  There really isn't one specific answer, because what you should be doing is always dependent on a whole ton of factors.  Whether your bot lane is ahead or behind is just one of those factor.  It's not enough information to make a proper decision off of.  \n\nHow to properly close out a game in solo queue is heavily dependent on your team composition and the enemy team composition.  If your team has strong siege potential, definitely look to do that.  But solo queue teams tend to have pretty crappy siege, so you often have to look to force fights instead.  In the lategame, Baron is the primary objective with which to do so.  Pink/Sweep the surroundings to deny vision and look to force a fight a fight.  If the enemy comes, kill them.  If they don't, take the free Baron and push with the buff.  \n\nIn general, one thing that branches solo queue off from pro play is that people just get caught left and right.  So grouping up in the jungle and going for picks as a gank unit is often a pretty successful tactic, whether you're ahead or behind.  In a 30-40 minute solo queue match, there's almost guaranteed to be a stray opponent farming too far up a lane, or a support trying to ward too deep without any allies nearby.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CloaknDagger222","date":"2015-05-10T18:11:14.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I notice in your match history you use a few different junglers that I enjoy or play regularly (Udyr/Skarner/Hec)\n\nHow do you determine which jungler to pick?

Thanks!\n\nThere are no pro players who play only a single jungler.  Being a serious pro player means you pretty much have to learn all of the meta junglers.  I'm the opposite - as a solo queue player, my champion pool is severely limited and specialized, as I don't really have to play into and against specific compositions.  \n\nPersonally, I pretty much one-trick pony whatever champion I seem to be winning on, but between the three champions you listed:\n\nHecarim I mostly play in the top lane.  He's not a terrible jungler, but he's not a great one either, since junglers usually get less gold than laners.\n\nI only jungle Udyr if I have a very strong earlygame top laner bruiser like Riven or Renekton.  With that combination, you can make the most of Udyr's innate early-game tankiness and damage.  Since you have no ultimate cooldown to wait on, you pretty much just dive the enemy top lane over and over.\n\nSkarner is my go-to jungler at the moment.  Fair clearspeed, fair CC, good synergy with Cinderhulk+Righteous Glory, a low cooldown shield, and fantastic single-target elimination.  Feels sort of like Udyr, except Skarner isn't as useless as Udyr when he falls behind.

You get to Plat 2, then Plat 1, and continue on from there.  \n\nYour goal as a top laner is simply to have as large a positive impact as you can.  That can come from early roams to get your team ahead, it can come from simply shitting on the enemy top laner until he's irrelevant, it can come from AFK farming and becoming a lategame monster.  It depends on what champion you're playing and the win conditions of the given game, based on team compositions and how things are going. \n\nI personally consider Teleport borderline irreplaceable on top laners, but as I've said many times in this thread - do what works for you, period.  That being said, make sure you're not just picking Ignite out of comfort, though.  Give Teleport a reasonable shot, and if you still end up favoring Ignite, then that's perfectly fine.  But if aren't using Teleport simply because you haven't given it a fair chance, then you're only doing yourself a disservice.\n\nI can sympathize with dodging a role you don't play well, and it shouldn't be that big of an issue because Mid is a highly-contested role anyways.  It's probably pretty infrequent that you get forced into it.  It probably wouldn't hurt to put just 10-20 normals into learning an easy mid laner like Cho'gath or Annie, though.  It's not as difficult as you think.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"khmarican","date":"2015-05-11T00:27:56.319+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think that, as a jungle main, I should temporarily switch to maining a role with a greater potential to carry until I reach a higher ranking?

I know for you it's easy to say, but to me I just can't see where I'm faulting SO badly that I can't climb out of this ELO where I'm obviously outperforming over half of the players in the match all the time.\n\nYou're completely over-thinking it.\n\nWhat do you need to do to improve?  Exactly what you're doing now, minus one mistake.  There, you've indisputably improved.  Take away another, and another, and another, and all of a sudden you're in Platinum.  \n\nStop trying to do everything and become everything.  Just focus on making one less mistake at a time.  You're a rather prideful player, and that's okay.  But I know you're not prideful enough to pretend that you aren't making any mistakes.\n\n***\n\nYou're not upgrading your trinkets.  You're not buying ANY wards.  In your two most recent losses, you were 9/10/5 and 2/9/4, suggesting you're not giving enough respect to the fact that you're behind.  \n\nThose are easy places to start working on.  Don't make this complicated for yourself.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-05-11T21:59:38.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does KDA matter as much as people treat it?
