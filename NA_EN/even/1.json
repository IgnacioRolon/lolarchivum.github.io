It seems silly to get excited for new champ/new skins with the new patch but have nothing actually be released with the patch. It's a new patch but nothing is different than balance changes. I don't really understand why Riot delays releases of everything, the release of the patch ruins my hype so the release of the new content is always unexpected and unsatisfying. \n\nJust my opinion.\n\nEDIT: didn't mean to put this in gameplay","replies":[{"poster":"Naalith","date":"2019-05-14T19:06:45.040+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I can understand spreading out skins but champions should never be held back for any reason.

True, the patches have been unsatisfying and I actually wonder, how Riot used to create 1 champion per half a year and we were getting hyped up for it now, they create 2 champions per 3 months and they rework half the unique ones to a generic \"revenge\" theme.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sõna","date":"2019-05-15T13:28:18.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rumors say that they secretly developing mobile games so they put all skilled human resources into new project while leeching this huge IP for a few more years.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nevrankroaton","date":"2019-05-15T05:52:53.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I almost jumped at you like \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN DISAPOINTING, YOU DAMN BOARD WANTED RIVEN NERF, VAYNE NERF AND YOU GOT IT.
