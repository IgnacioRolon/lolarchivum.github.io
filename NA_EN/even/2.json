If you have a bad ADC, you almost always lose the game, unless you can hardcarry like 20/0, which cant happen every game. Because ADCs are 90% of the teams consistent damage in this meta, if yours is constantly getting caught out, or simply not good at their champion lots of the times you just lose the game, almost no matter how strong the rest of your team is. \r\n\r\nMany supports can&#039;t do anything in lane with a bad ADC. If you main a support that primarily is used not for the damage, if your ADC falls behind in farm/items just because they aren&#039;t good, you lose every fight in lane because the opponent just has more damage. Even if supports just roam because their ADC isn&#039;t good and makes plays around the map they will lose if they can&#039;t end the game by 35 minutes (which is hard to get your teams do in some elos) because the enemy ADC will always carry every late game teamfight. Bad supports can often also end up in a lost lane but it&#039;s not as bad for the ADC because if they are good they can just farm up and try to scale.\r\n\r\nFed ADCs can be too hard to deal with. With the new ADC meta the popular ADCs all snowball really hard and can be almost impossible to stop: {{champion:236}} bursting you with as much damage as an assassin, {{champion:81}} chunking 1/3 your hp with one ability, and {{champion:202}} killing you in 3 autos. On top of this, they all don&#039;t fall off as hard as they should for being strong in lane.\r\n\r\nWhen an ADC wins lane, it impacts the rest of the map way too much. After your bot lane tower is destroyed, the enemy bot lane just goes top/mid to take each tower and there is almost no way to stop it. So if one bot tower is lost, it becomes 3 towers gone within the next 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nI just took a look at most of the losses in my match history and noticed a trend, almost every game I win (no matter if I did good or bad) my ADC&#039;s score/kp is extremely good, and almost every game I lose my ADC&#039;s score/kp is really bad. I just wish other lanes like top/mid were able to snowball as hard as bot, or at least able to stop the enemy bot lane from snowballing.

So the discussion is always about those specific champions and their flaws.\n\nThis rant is too much into what's known without thinking outside the box. While you're not wrong and I can easily replace all the instances of \"ADC\" with \"Marksman\" especially in a 2v2 which is seemingly what this matter is about, it's not like it's the end of the world and Marksmen have nowhere to play the game.","replies":[]}]}
