Thank Riot for the promotion forgiveness free win thing, because both of my last promo games had intentional feeders in it. And my first promo game today had one too! He said he was going to feed in champion select, but I figured might as well play y&#039;know? Since dodging counts as a loss anyway. It went as well as you&#039;d expect. I know it&#039;s going to be crazy these last few days of the season, especially since it seems every other player is boosted or trolling. \r\n\r\nAnd I do understand this could be abused. In your promo and you don&#039;t like your teamcomp? Just dodge. But consider this; the good would outweigh the bad. There will be so many more people dodging to avoid a troll than dodging to... abuse this or whatever. And it&#039;s not a perfect Sol {{champion:236}} by any means, but until Riot implements a way to deal with these kinds of things, we sort of need a way to dodge these trolls. The queue time increase (5-20 minutes) is a good deterrent as well. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s just so miserable to climb when trolls have access to your information. &quot;He&#039;s in promos,&quot; they might think to themselves. &quot;I&#039;m already gold so idc. Time to get my feed on!&quot; Thankfully I have trust in Riot&#039;s punishment system (as seen by so many threads here) but it doesn&#039;t fix the damage already done.

You cannot know if the people would abuse a system like this,but it is somewhat obvious of their intentions. This is rank and people will do what ever it takes to get a free win. If dodging was a thing then too much people could abuse it to get that one up, doesn't like the team comp (from either team), ban (didn't ban) a certain champion people would dodge, just to mess with people and leave at the last second. It's crazy how some people would abuse it but it could happen. And that's the reason why they don't want to do it. If you can prove the goods outweighs the bad and give evidence to back up your claim I'm sure a Rioter would listen.
