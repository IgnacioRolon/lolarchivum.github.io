I made a post about how there seems to be something missing cuz the last paragraph suddenly references that Shen fights in two worlds with no buildup other than being called an anomaly in the opening line.  Nothing helps to lead up to the concluding line about the significance of the impact of the two worlds on eachother.    So it feels tacked on like it was forgotten that he was a spirit warrior and added on after the fact.  It’s not incorporated.....     (I’d completely forgotten/wasn’t aware of this removal beforehand so it’s not a case of missing something cuz u knew it  as there).
