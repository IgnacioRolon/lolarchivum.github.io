Excellent (and no doubt tedious to data-entry) work!\n\nI actually put a few of these together myself at work for my own curiosity - something I did was do a trimmed down version that only included relationships that currently have player-facing lore to support them or that were intrinsic in their nature (which removed a lot of mystery relationships and added in a couple that Universe is missing).  It certainly simplified it down a lot and you started to be able to more easily see clustering appear around regions and highly influential champs (like Swain, J4, etc.) which is what you'd expect.\n\nI'd have liked to have been able to increase the draw, strength, or magnetism force on a per-relationship basis, but the software I was using wasn't really designed for that, out of the box.  It would have been good to be able to ensure connections like Xayah <-> Rakan, or Garen <-> Lux, were closer and more important seeming than, say, Miss Fortune <-> Olaf.

If it's on Universe, it's supposed to be in Necrozard's graph.  (I know you're not asking about that side of it, but many people seem to be taking issue with Necrozard specifically, when they are simply the messenger.)  \n\nIf there are issues with the data, then it's on Riot to fix it - not Necrozard :D\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}} \n\nThis is why, when I made my graph, I started hand-editing the data because so much of the official, Universe, data felt superfluous, or old, or missing.  Problem is, that's a mad rabbit-hole of opinion, headcanon, old/new lore, and interpretation.\n\nFor example, in _my graph_, I had a relationship from Quinn --> Sona because it was a Buvelle matriarch (Lestara herself) who was saved from a frenzied beast, and who spoke on behalf of Quinn when she was entering the Demacian military.  That's not listed on Universe, and indeed, it's possible that Quinn and Sona have never met - we have no updated info on Sona yet or her relationship to Lestara Buvelle, or how noteworthy a particularly headstrong scout with her Azurite Eagle might be.  So me including it is headcanon.  Rioters have headcanon too :)\n\nBut also on _my graph_, I do not include the Universe-approved connections of Sona -> Taric, Sona -> Xin Zhao, or Sona -> Ryze, because there's no updated, player-facing, information to support any of those.  Makes Sona a very lonely node, but that's to be expected I suppose without her new biography.\n\nRemember, my graph was just something I put together as a personal thing.  I'm sure everyone else's would be different.  Here's a screenshot (grainy, sorry): https://imgur.com/a/Xs5ck\n\nThat's just one champion (my main) in a network of all champs.  Going through every possible connection and being able to decide whether it is or is not something to be included in a graph is a minefield - and I totally understand why Necrozard wouldn't put him/her-self through that.  There's no winning there.\n\n{{sticker:sona-playing}} \n\nI think this is where people take personal offense to my graph?  Let's do this :)","replies":[{"poster":"SpyroTF","date":"2017-12-27T12:49:03.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, so being a lore/Swain junkie that I am, I just HAVE to ask a few questions about this.  \n1.

Sona would have been there too, were it not for Quinn's new lore obliquely referencing someone who I assume will still be related to her.\n\nI assume he's still an important member of the Black Rose too, but I have no player-facing evidence to support it yet - so I didn't add it.","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2017-12-27T18:30:05.703+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I assume he's still an important member of the Black Rose too, but I have no player-facing evidence to support it yet - so I didn't add it.\n\nSurely Sion's promo where Swain asks for the Black Rose's help and Vlad answers the call to infuse Sion with some blood magic is a clue?\n\nThat and the short lore segment we got which says he's got a cult following among Noxian aristocracy and has been around since the dawn of Noxus (by transitivity adored by aristocracy means connected to Black Rose?).\n\nSpeaking of which, are these short lores rock solid canon? ~~Did I get overhyped for no reason?~~","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-12-27T19:26:36.239+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Blood Magicks,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=8z86b5ZE,comment-id=00130000000000000001,timestamp=2017-12-27T18:30:05.703+0000)\n>\n> Surely Sion&#x27;s promo where Swain asks for the Black Rose&#x27;s help and **Vlad answers the call** to infuse Sion with some blood magic is a clue?\n> \n> That and the short lore segment we got which says he&#x27;s got a cult following among Noxian aristocracy and has been around since the dawn of Noxus (by transitivity adored by aristocracy means connected to Black Rose?).\n> \n> Speaking of which, are these short lores rock solid canon? ~~Did I get overhyped for no reason?~~\n\nSo you assume that either the Thorn, or the Petal, is Vladimir?
