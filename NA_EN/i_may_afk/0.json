The 15% attack speed bonus just adds a generic amount of power to the jungle that was not needed for the vast majority of jungle champions. Underperforming champions could obviously be compensated in a better way after.\n\nIt's kind of like Duskblade in that Duskblade adds a huge layer of generic strength to the assassin class but it means they're balanced exclusively around that 1 item instead of emphasizing their own unique strengths and weaknesses as champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rootlo","date":"2018-02-26T21:29:51.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pokemonred200,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ELVv7O7u,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-02-26T14:58:32.088+0000)\n>\n> {{item:1041}}&#x27;s attack speed was added for champions like {{champion:11}} and {{champion:102}} who had playerbases who used attack speed _and nothing else_ in their runes.
