I get someone on my team who is auto filled support, but cant play the role. He asks for top however, no one will switch with him. So naturally, he picks his top lane as a support (Renekton)\r\n\r\nKNOWING full well that he is planning on intentional feeding. I&#039;d rather take the penalty on myself of Que dodging and waiting 5 to 15 minutes than waste my time playing a game like this. Personally, I would rather have 10 minute Que times than have auto fill on, and i think many of you might agree because you actually lose time having auto fill on in many cases, because you or someone in your Que dodges. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m looking for solutions to this problem, personally, I think if someone is auto filled and you Que dodge you should not be penalized. Do you think this is too much? It could possibly be abused I know, but I&#039;m not sure how we could handle this. \r\n\r\nA response from a Riot employee would be appreciated :D","replies":[{"poster":"Hambone2013","date":"2017-02-20T17:28:46.270+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whining about autofill is ridiculous. It's basically a tuned version of what was in place before new champ select. Just play the game out the guy may have picked renekton because he knows the champ and still meant to give support a go.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2017-02-20T15:57:38.341+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> KNOWING full well that he is planning on intentional feeding.
