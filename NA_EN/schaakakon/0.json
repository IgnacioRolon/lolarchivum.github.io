Which the IoW was created to prevent more rune war catastrophes.\r\n\r\nWho better to do the lore retcon of Brand than someone named Loping Cinder! \"Powerful magics could potentially imprison him\" is oddly very specific, as Brand is an elemental spirit that was imprisoned in a cage of True Ice. Perhaps Malphite and Brands new lores will have them be akin to the Bards and Sorakas. Bard is the sprinkly spirit that inhabits that ball of hair wielding a flute, Brand is a fiery spirit that inhabits the body of Kegan Rodhe. Sorakas original form could have been one of sprinkles as well but her punishment for turning a serial killer chemist into a werewolf (to you know, help with the murdering..?) was to be banished from the celestial club and her mortal form is that of her current unicorn self.\r\n\r\nPerhaps these celestial spirits that Bard and Soraka come from not only possess benevolent spirits but also malevolent (Brand) and neutral (Malphite) spirits as well? \r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Loping Cinder","date":"2015-03-10T00:12:16.738+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"When Brand is revisited, I, along with other writers, will be involved. \n\nFor Transparency: I lead a small team that develops and updates champions.\n\nI love reading these creative posts.

I'm obviously not saying you should post up your drafts for some massive crowdsourced review. However, I do think that the community would appreciate it if you had some meaningful engagement with them about where you want to take Brand or how you want to reinvent his character, with a real back and forth of ideas. I don't think it would just be PR: I imagine you might well gain some insights from that discussion. I don't know how long you've been into League lore, but there are lore community members who have spent **years** immersing themselves in League's lore, and even if they're not professional authors, I think that's a fantastic resource. It would be a shame to neglect it.\n\nMore than that, I think it's important not to view League's lore as a blank slate. I really don't think that's appropriate for a universe with an established history and years of community investment. I get that you guys are making changes. I also see that of late you've been trying to keep things \"backwards compatible\", with fewer \"Trundlings\" whereby a character is deleted and replaced with a new character with the same name, and I encourage you to keep up that trend. Community discussion is a good way to get a sense of what elements the community is most invested in. That doesn't mean you can't still choose at the end of the day to delete those elements, but if you do so, I think it should be with full awareness of that cost. If it's something that nobody in the community cares about, and you think you have an even slightly better idea, sure, why not, rewrite it. But if it's something the community really values, I feel \"I think my idea's kind of better, maybe\" should not be considered sufficient justification for a retcon.\n\nAs for Brand himself, I threw out some ideas in **[this thread](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4888328)**. I'd be delighted if you or other Narrative team members found them to be useful grist for the mill. But, as I wrote above, I'm not really that invested in Brand. There are people in this community who are, however, and I really, really think you should be talking to them. The element of surprise can be very exciting, but discussion with a community as passionate as this one can be quite enriching. Avoiding spoilers is all well and good, but I think you should also give some thought to avoiding the scenario of Brand fans logging in one day and discovering that you've completely retconned their favorite character without a single word of discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"Loping Cinder","date":"2015-03-10T23:56:44.613+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for all the feedback CupcakeTrap.

I think some prior community engagement will not only give you some ideas, and some useful feedback on your own ideas, but also make for a much happier reception of the changes that do come down the line. Releasing major changes without prior discussion is a good way to make what was intended as a \"Mystery Gift\" surprise into more of a \"Fiddlesticks ult in your face\" surprise.\n\nIn addition to Champions, I for one would really value some kind of discussion with Narrative, Art, and other such departments prior to major changes to the settings of Valoran, and in particular its various factions. I do get quite anxious about the possibility that I'll come by one day and find that you've completely torn down and rewritten Bandle City, for instance. The community is positively teeming with ideas for the various factions, and I think it would be a shame to just slap something down without some prior community engagement, early enough in the process that what gets said in that discussion might influence how it turns out.\n\nI do want to stress the importance of timing. While post-release \"Q&A\" style discussions are enjoyable, they aren't really a substitute for meaningful community engagement; by the time you're holding the Q&A, most of the material is already locked in. When it comes to brand new Champions or settings, of course, the surprise reveal makes a ton of sense; those *are* blank slates. However, to the extent that the incoming material is an express or implicit retcon of established lore, I feel that the negatives of the \"shock reveal\" approach grossly outweigh the positives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paper1","date":"2015-03-11T00:03:27.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"PhoenixSlayer13","date":"2015-03-11T00:32:15.901+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You probably got downvoted because this is not the place to talk about your gameplay experience.

But at the same token having an ancestor being blessed by a watcher to have True Ice makes you Ice Born and it seems hereditary because Ashe and Sej use the powers but dont seem to be contractually obligated by the Watchers in any way as Avarosa and Lisandra was. So as long as one person with True Ice powers went around popping out babies, you can have a Frost Guard of Ice Borns.","replies":[{"poster":"Voidac","date":"2015-03-09T04:05:31.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't really know who else had access to True Ice, as it was a popular magic with the Frozen Watchers. Ashe and Sejuani aren't Iceborn, but they posses True Ice weapons and some inherent magical ability due to their ancestry. They are by no means immortal like Lissandra. But here's the thing, we don't know what came first: The Frozen Watchers or the Frostguard. \n\nHonestly, I don't think we'll ever know. We need a timeline, something to tell us WHEN Lissandra corrupted the Frostguard and when Brand was captured. I believe the Frostguard were already pretty powerful even before Lissandra's intervention. They knew a lot of stuff, and were around before Lissandra. \n\nBrand actually tells us when he was captured! Sort of...\n> \"After millennia, I am free!\"\n\nA millennium is a thousand years (more specifically, the anniversary of a thousand years). However, Brand uses the plural of this word, meaning multiples of thousands of years.\nHe was confronted by {{champion:86}} and {{champion:99}} accompanied by a Summoner on 8 April, 21 CLE. We don't know how long he had been running around since he was freed by Rodhe, but it couldn't have been too long.\nWhat doesn't make sense is that Lokfar was home to barbarians... not really people of magic and knowledge. If anyone is going to know what happened to Brand, it's the Frostguard. They are the ones who have all the archaic knowledge of the Freljord. Assuming Lissandra didn't write him out of history, they'd know. \n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Lokfar\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Freljord\nMan, look at all this lore. It's so good.

Modern Runterra is quite the clusterfuck ranging between Mount Targon to Piltover. I'm actually wondering if Riot can somehow create one world where those two can live in together..\n\nHowever, what was there before Shurmia? Imo, its safe to say that the rise of the Shadow Isles (its empire prior to the undead) is roughly two thousand years old to modern Runterra and Shurmia three to four thousand.. All we objectively know is that prehistoric yordles lived when the Watchers first came/invaded.\n\nAs I reread Bards teaser, do you think it is in chronological order? Freljord tribes -> fall of Shurmia -> Shadow Isles become what is it today? That would mean Lissandra lived when Azir was mortal (not that they would even remotely know of each other) but more importantly that the Frost Guard were around just as long?\n\nWas it asked in Bards Q&A what the Bardkin think of the Watchers and viseversa?\n\n(Sorry for my rambling tangents) wait, it says in Lissandras lore \"When the Watchers were defeated by ancient heroes\" and in your Freljord link it says \" but in the end the Watchers were overrun and thrown howling into the abyss\" so I guess we can assume there was only a handful of Watchers? Its hard to imagine a whole race being thrown off one bridge.

Afterwards, a little while later, Lissandra killed Avarosa. I always assumed the Frozen Watchers were a group of powerful immortal sages or something. Incredibly knowledgeable, been around forever (immortal and all), but they got smart and decided to give out power for power (immortality for empires). The Iceborn lived on while the Watchers fell down the abyss. I REALLY WANT TO SEE SOME ART OF THE WATCHERS.\nI wanna know who these people were, how old they are, and how the hell did they lose against Avarosa and her Iceborn horde. I find it hard to believe she bested them in open conflict. I mean, she couldn't kill them, so she threw 'em over a bridge (however badass that may be). And where the hell was Serylda when all of this was happening? Where was Lissandra?\n\nAND WHEN WILL WE SEE ART OF THE 3 SISTERS TOGETHER BEFORE BECOMING ICEBORN? Man, I would love to have a poster of them before all of this went down. Lissandra being all blind, Serylda and Avarosa... man. That'd be so damn awesome.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
