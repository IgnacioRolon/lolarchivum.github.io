The second problem is; After every single game, it takes for the score board around 20-30 sec to pop up.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-05T01:30:31.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That first issue with LoL crashing completely might be a sign that some of the game files have been corrupted somehow. I'd suggest running a repair through the client options to make sure everything is still intact. You should be able to find that repair button by clicking on the gear icon in the upper right of the client.\n\nIt definitely shouldn't take that long for the post game lobby to load either. While you're in the client options, look for a checkbox called **close client during game**. Make sure that is NOT checked, and you should see the post game quicker!","replies":[{"poster":"Demoted  N e n e","date":"2017-06-05T01:45:23.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will try to repair the files, and that option was checked so, now i changed and it's going fine!
