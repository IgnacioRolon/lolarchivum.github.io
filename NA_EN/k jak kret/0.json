To clarify, are you starting and stopping the animation, or starting the animation, moving the camera off of him, and moving it back onto him? I'm able to repro what you're describing in the second scenario, but wanna make sure I'm not missing anything. :)\n\n**EDIT:** I've resolved the issue for moving on and off screen, and that'll be ready for 7.23! I *think* that may also fix what you're describing, but lemme know! ","replies":[]}]}
