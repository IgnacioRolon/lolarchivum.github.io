That being said, LoL is now more or less catered towards a new younger audience, a younger audience who can't maturely deal with their own lack of skill. I remember someone before called it \"childproof\" in the sense that young children who do miss everything still can feel like they made an impact. LoL needs to be way less forgiving so that plays are actually properly rewarding for the effort used. I really miss the days of being blown away by a pro player making the first 'trademarked' play like the insec kick because LoL was way less forgiving so seeing that pulled off had the most impact. Now everyone can do it, and although it's not a bad thing, the stakes are far FAR lower if you fail it now than before.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pubbi","date":"2018-07-01T22:34:09.532+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":5,"body":"Yeah, I don't think Duskblade's damage is the problem,  assassins just aren't healthy for the game in general in their current state.

You might have had a point if it has the Zhonya's passive (multi-use instead of single use like Stopwatch) but no. The small amount of stats that you get from Armguard won't actually save you against *any* assassin all in, and while you rush your Zhonya's, the assassin will snowball off of you even if you don't get a kill because you will have effectively zero waveclear, due to Armguard giving you next to no AP, and no mana regeneration so you can't afford to spam your abilities like a Zed or Talon can.\n\nImagine if Zeal didn't have any attack speed on it, but still cost the same amount of gold.
