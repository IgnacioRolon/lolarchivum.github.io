They can't really stun on demand, can't shield themselves properly (viktor's Q doesn't help much), and they're constantly exposed to both poke and all-in attempts. Sure they can burst hard and can capitalise on the enemy's bad positioning. If your opponent plays half decently, has a tank, or you just can't exploit some bad moves, you pretty much useless.\nTheir damage is very strong, I won't deny that, but with all this movement buffs the other champions have, it's very hard for these guys to deal damage while not dieing in the process.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DunkmasterDennis","date":"2018-05-31T02:17:49.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How is this idiot {{champion:17}} immobile?
