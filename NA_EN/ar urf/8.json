I'll admit that I have posts about balance and I personally hated season 8 with runes reforged, but I like the game overall.\n\nIt's a love hate with me, I love seeing new champions, I love seeing what changes they'll come out with, I love skins(some skins), and I love certain classes like mages and ADC. I just hate burst meta is all.\n\nBut I didn't mean to come off as complaining with this post. This post was addressing both riot and those who like to like to say this is a dying game.","replies":[{"poster":"Stray Kat","date":"2018-11-30T10:28:51.810+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry, it's been a rough day and my tone came off sounding harsher than intended with the choice of words I used.
