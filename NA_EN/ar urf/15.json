I was in but lost my Diamond promos filled with D5s and D4s three times this season, and eventually quit playing because I hate this season. I probably could have continued climbing if I gave a fuck, but since I do not, I have since decayed to Platinum V. \n\nSo speaking as a higher elo player?\n\n**Don't** follow your fucking laner. \n\nIf you don't have vision of their jungler and/or the enemy laner can solo kill you, all you are doing by following them is putting yourself at risk. If the enemy is roaming and they know what they're doing, you'll be missing minions and allowing your turret to take damage, too.\n\nThat's not to say that you can't follow your laner or shouldn't ever do so, but it is heavily dependent upon the match up, what else is happening on the map, and so on and so forth. Most of the time, your best play is going to be to shove a wave, recall to buy items and gain tempo/lane control, pressure their turret, farm the jungle, get vision, or roam to the other side of the map.\n\nIf you're Katarina against a Lux and the Lux goes missing you can probably follow her. She's an easy solo kill. But if Katarina roams and you're Lux? You're asking to feed the enemy assassin by blindly following them into the fog of war. Think about it, even if you do follow them and manage to turn a fight in another lane, the reason that happened is because the enemy overstayed and/or was too far out. You're expecting them to make that mistake. If they back off once they notice you are following your laner, you gain nothing, but the enemy team gains tempo.\n\nIdeally, your allies back off and play safe when they notice your laner has roamed. This wastes your laner's time on a pointless roam, meanwhile, you gain some CS, vision, wave control, etc.\n\nIf your team won't play safe and dies to every roam it isn't your fault, it's theirs, and you shouldn't try and fix their mistakes. You're more than likely to get yourself killed trying to help them if they are that incompetent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2018-11-01T04:20:12.138+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It all boils down to _do something. _\n\nEither follow your laner for a countergank or shove your lane to turret.
