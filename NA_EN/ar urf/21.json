That sounds egotistical and very subjective. Do you know how many toxic people think they're the best person on the team? \n\nAt the end of the day this is a team game. Using a cheesy champion to prey on a disorganized team isn't \"carrying.\"\n\nI've seen so many Yi or Yasuo players ignore team comps, get fed, then be blown apart late game by teamwork because they think they can do it all by themselves. They don't group and they don't focus on objectives.","replies":[]}]}
