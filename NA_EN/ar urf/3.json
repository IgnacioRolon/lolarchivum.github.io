In other word, your Q is hard to land the three of them thats right, but easy to land one, in other word Aatrox is strong enouph to take down any enemy in lane 1v1 at early, in late all what you have to do is to be your team guard, and try to deal damage and catch up with the enemy, because if win your lane you take 1 step close to win, if you shield your ally you give them chance to win the team fight, how to shield them? simply land your Q to knock them up stand in the middle between both enemies and ulti before you get in ofc, and try to W the enemy carry, and you gonna revive your self, and with help of {{item:3026}} you gonna be nearly immortal in team fight so if your team isn't good at all then you lost if your team good at least a little you gonna win the game, also don't ever go with Aatrox tank, go with him full lethlaity and life steal, believe me you will see it by your self.\n\n\nAnd that is my opinion nothing more, have a nice day.","replies":[]}]}
