I know that I would need to add players manualy and i have no problem with that.\r\nSo i`m asking for help, maybe someone know how to, know some tips or something, is this even possible? give me some directions from where I could start. Maybe is not so hard to do it and someone could help me with this? I know that it needs API, but i dont know how to use it all.
