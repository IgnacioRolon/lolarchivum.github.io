And, in fact, RIOT wanted to rework Lee Sin and, guess what? When people complained, they reverted his rework in a \"ok, ok, I won't touch this, please don't kill me\" mood. But they didn't care about Cassio mains (for example) when they complained about her rework.\n\n**AND BEFORE SOMEONE COMES HERE TELLING THAT LEE SIN'S KIT IS OK AND RIOT DOESN'T THINK HE'S A PROBLEM:** [Just look at this.](https://twitter.com/RiotMorello/status/484042166948212736)\n\n*\"I love his kit.

Nidalee and Gnar are better, aren't they? Vi is crazy strong, sure, and takes far less skill than Blitzcrank, but she doesn't have as much raw damage as him. Overall she's probably too good for competitive scene, but I don't see why they can't just nerf both her and Lee Sin. I like the knock back for Lee Sin, why not add functionality to the new Bard portal so you can push people through the portals? That would be fun. Then you can nerf him in other ways because \"hey guys we indirectly buffed him by adding synergy with other champs\" and the people that want nerfs will be happy. I saw a video showing that Bard's teleport won't do things like let Skarnar take an enemy through the portal, which logically leads me to conclude that Lee Sin is also limited in that fashion, not able to force the enemy through, but I think they should change that fact and then Bard would be a better combination champ than he is now. This would make drafting phase more important when the characters are weaker individually than when with certain champs that make them specifically better.\n\nJarvan IV is a champ that combos well with both Gnar and Vayne, so why not help Bard combo well with Skarnar and Lee Sin (Vayne would apply here as well) and Jayce I guess?","replies":[{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2015-03-18T17:03:24.183+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> What's so insane about Elise anyway?

They almost never have more than 200 upvotes, which would be less than even a percentile of the league community. Statistically speaking, VERY few League players actually use the boards. \n\nAlso, it's pretty much true that politicians rarely represent the majority of their constituents interest. In the US, any non-presidential election has a sub-50% voter turnout among the registered voters that said election actually applies to. This is to the point where local state elections usually have a sub-20% turnout. Even presidential elections usually only get to having around a 60% turnout (which is considered pretty good, as far as the US is concerned). So suppose you have a 60% voter turnout. Unless you're simply assuming that the remaining 40% are content with either result (not likely), then you can't really say that the president represents a hard majority of the US peoples interests. This is pretty strongly supported by the fact that presidents can rarely maintain an above 50% approval rating, especially if they have a second term. \n\nSo yeah. Most politicians in office simply represent more of their constituents than the guy they were running against, but rarely do they truthfully actually represent the majority of their constituencies opinion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2015-03-18T23:47:16.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"However people complaining for lee sin nerfs are kind of hypocritical in this case because a lot of complaints center around his damage mobility and tankyness.
