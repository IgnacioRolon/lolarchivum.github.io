I was in champion selection, thinking which champion I want to play. There is like 6-7 seconds left and I&#039;m gonna pick my champion when the message pops &quot;A player you&#039;ve reported has been punished words words la la la pew twang pwe&quot;. It took my by surprise and I had little time to react. I close hastily the pop-up but I have no time to choose a champion and I&#039;m kicked out of the game. I just entered promo with a free win token. I guess now I have a free loss token too.\n\nI like the fact that you get those pop-ups so you feel your reports are useful, but please don&#039;t let them appear in the middle of a champion selection. I have better things to think about in that moment than the fact that someone I don&#039;t and I will never know has been chat restricted. Do it so it can only appear when you are not in a game. Even if it hasn&#039;t cost me the game, those few seconds you get distracted may mean you don&#039;t choose the best champion for your team or you forget to change the runes.","replies":[{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2015-12-07T21:25:03.578+0000","up_votes":114,"down_votes":1,"body":"Meanwhile at Riot HQ\n\nRioter 1: Wait for it...\nRioter 2: 12 seconds left in champ select.\nRioter 1: QUICK!
