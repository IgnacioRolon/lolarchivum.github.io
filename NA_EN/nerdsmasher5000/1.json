The whole point of a rework is to force a champion to play differently, and if you're still trying to play Veigar like a pick mage instead of a teamfight oriented control mage, you're going to have a bad time. Old Veigar was basically an alternative version of Syndra; new Veigar is far more similiar to Anivia. If you try to play Anivia like you're playing Syndra, of course you're going to have a bad time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhantomGG","date":"2015-07-19T05:06:26.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completely agree, gain actual knowledgeable facts, then open your mouth untill then keep it shut.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazedPorcupine","date":"2015-07-19T05:04:27.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, I'm entitled to talk about changes to Karma, Veigar, and Soraka. Sounds good to me.\n\n(PS, I don't think any of them are in a bad spot really. Karma is pretty good right now, and Soraka is nicely niche. Veigar is also pretty decent and is a good niche pick).","replies":[]}]}
