When I canceled my TP to W the enemy Akali, my body went with her but the stun did not go through. She didn't have any type of spell shield on her.\r\n\r\nAnyway, immediately after that, I could not use any of my abilities, nor could I recall. I couldn't activate my abilities with the keyboard, and I couldn't manually click them to activate either. However, I could use flash and items, and I could type just fine with all my keys.\r\n\r\nI closed the client and reconnected, and still had the bug when I reloaded. It went away after my second death following the start of the bug. \r\n\r\nI was able to record the bug(?) with fraps. Has this happened to anyone else?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T00:58:47.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's pretty flippin' weird! I've certainly never heard of this happening before. I'd recommend uploading the recording to a video hosting site and post a bug report to our [online tracker.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report)\n\nThanks!","replies":[]}]}
