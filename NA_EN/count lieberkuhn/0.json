To reference another comment I made the other day, crit and lethality items are the go to carry items, and they're too cheap. Adc has always started to hurt with just 50% crit, but with so much early gold they are building it too fast. If an adc gets the double kill bot with first blood and first tower, they are already miles ahead, and with how damage like crit scales it's just too fast. And lethality needs to be more costly too. An MF with just Duskblade won't just dominate bot lane, she'll curb stomp it. Dusk and Youmuus alone will get her Qs to nearly 700 damage. That's basically an IE crit on a squishy. \n\nItems for carrying are too cheap and tank items are not able to keep up. The way to fix it is to make them more expensive so that marksmen, a class specifically designed to end the game, aren't ending the game at 20 minutes. \n\nMore expensive items also means that you won't get stomped if you come back with just a long sword and they have BF sword.\n\nTLDR: More expensive items means less damage items, less damage items means less damage, less damage means less kills, less kills means less objectives, less objectives means longer games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Emerald Fang","date":"2017-11-27T06:46:02.293+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy hell cant agree more.
