They are after the original main body, if anyone is interested.**\n\nHello.  I&#039;ve been here since closed beta.  The first champion release I saw was Nasus.  I&#039;ve been with this game for 6 years now, and I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen the game in a state that is worse than it currently is.  More importantly, I&#039;ve never seen the player base so upset with the direction the game&#039;s taken than they are now.  Season 5 as it is now is currently the worst time in league&#039;s history.  I don&#039;t believe I have nostalgia goggles.\n\nA few months ago, League was in fantastic shape.  With the introduction of Cinderhulk, a tanky meta emerged.  Although tanks were a bit over the top at the time, it brought and end to the assassin meta and the game was in its most balanced and varied state ever.  Tanks were viable again, which brought assassins in line, while still keeping them useful as ADCs had once again become truly useful as tank killers, requiring the use of burst to deal with.  It was a nice game of paper-scissors-rock which made the game just work.  A few minor tweaks were needed to achieve perfect balance.\n\nThen they went and fucked it up.  I think it began with the introduction of Runeglaive; a replacement for Magus that nobody wanted or asked for (this became a recurring theme).  By removing Magus in the name of &#039;diversity&#039;, Riot succeeded in doing the following: \nMaking Diana and Elise (eventually) viable again\nMaking Karthus and Fiddle jungle no longer a thing\nTemporarily making Ezreal mid OP.\n\nAll this item did is trade traditional mages who could jungle for AP assassins.  Why both enchantments could not be kept was apparently a question that never received a valid red answer, even though having both would increase diversity far more than either single item could.\n\nThen they followed it up with sated devourer.  People remember Feral Flare; it was nightmarish, so Riot decided to bring it back with a vengeance.  Admittedly the old devourer needed an update, but holy balls.  It didn&#039;t need this.  Sated devourer is one of those items that is by existence broken.  It synergizes so well with a selection of champions that it makes them broken (Kayle, Yi, etc).  The item needs a nerf, but considering Riot&#039;s recent response to sated devourer&#039;s dominance was to nerf Cinderhulk.\n\n_\"The other facet of this is that if Cinderhulk has to compete in the end-game against these other two - what it effectively would have to do is create unstoppable characters that cannot be killed - and so even if it does work - it wouldn&#039;t be a state we&#039;d be particularly happy with. \nTherefore, by shifting Cinderhulk&#039;s impact to be more impactful mid game and less impactful late game - the item actually has a window to shine - rather than be overshadowed end-game by a devourer or completely dominant when it is good.\"_ - Xypherous\n\nThis logic is weird.  Xypherous is essentially saying that a tanky equivalent of sated devourer would be OP, so lets nerf tanky junglers in the lategame.  He is right that cinderhulk would have to be OP to compete, because sated devourer is too strong and too binary of an item.  The answer isn&#039;t to nerf cinderhulk to have a VERY small window of increased power, but nerf/rework sated devourer into a more reasonable state.\n\nThe Kalista nerf was also bizarre, and the most counter-intuitive nerf in League&#039;s history.  Nerfing the ad ratio on basic attacks makes 0 sense, and only serves to make the champion more convoluted and add even more text to one of the most tooltip-heavy champions in the game.  Kalista needs a rework, not weird nerfs that only mask the problem rather than solving it.  Just to clarify, the problem lies in her kangaroo hops.  They cause some champions to have zero chance of defeating her with any amount of outplay, and she herself is countered by a specific set of champions: those with point-and-click hard CC.  Which Riot is phasing out in favour of skillshots.  This in itself is not a bad thing, but it only exacerbates the Kalista problem.\n\nAnd now the Juggernauts update comes along and makes everyone even more angry than before.  We have: the Darius update nobody asked for, the Garen update nobody wanted or asked for and adds a gimmick to his ultimate because uniqueness > gameplay in Riot&#039;s eyes.  \nWe also have the Skarner update nobody wanted or asked for and adds a really big crystal scar gimmick, and finally the Mordekaiser update that is just a massive experiment and a big middle finger to all Morde players.  I only play him on occasion and even I&#039;m upset about that one.  Forcing Morde in the lane that makes the least sense, against enemies he is most vulnerable to, and putting most of his power budget into a dragon ghost which will only be useful 5 times per game, IF YOUR TEAM IS DOING WELL.  The dragon ghost just seems like a &#039;win more&#039; mechanic.  In most cases, the team who is ahead claims the dragon if they&#039;re on the ball.  \n\nWith this, we have armour nerfs across the board.  Some champions are apparently having their armour per level increased slightly to compensate, but most tank items still cost more and offer less.  This combined with the BIG cinderhulk nerf is likely to see tanks out of the meta completely again.  As we found out a few months ago, tanks being strong is healthy for the game&#039;s overall balance, and so making them less viable seems highly detrimental to the game as a whole.\n\n=============\n\nI&#039;ve missed out plenty of other missteps that Riot have made and people have gotten deservedly angry about over the last 3 months or so, but it really seems like everything Riot is doing is making people more and more upset and disillusioned by the game.  Rather than admit their mistakes and revert some failed ideas like Sated Devourer, Riot seems to instead try to change all other aspects of the game to try and fix the problem, and in doing so create several more.  I have never felt like 10 bans were needed any more than I do right now, since the game is in such a horrid state of balance and is basically unplayable now.\n\nI would not be surprised if League sees a significant drop off in players if Season 5 continues down this treacherous path.  The Bilgewater event came at a good time for Riot, since the hype overshadows the dire state of the game, but once it goes away, things will go downhill.  I feel like Riot will tread water, throwing changes at a wall to see what sticks and hoping the players will not leave in droves before worlds.\n\n\n_____________________________________________\n\n\n**Edit:**\n\nThere have been a lot of responses both agreeing and disagreeing with my post.  This is good.  It's nice to have both sides of an argument.  However, I would like to address some of the more common rebuttals that people have come up with.\n\n_**The forums and Reddit represent a minority of players**_\n\nThis is correct.  The number of players who actually post on the forums are minimal in the grand scheme of things, but arguably some of the most passionate players (why else would people like me spend lots of time writing posts and responding to things if I didn't care about the game?). \n\nMy original post was based on the fact that when League is in a good spot, the majority of negative posts are regarding one or two champions who are in a toxic state of balance.  Posts are often more positive and constructive when people are satisfied, which is clearly not the case right now.  Most posts are complaints, and call for reverts of mechanics that people are not happy with.  See: Sated Devourer, Juggernaut update, HUD.\n\nFurthermore, just because the forums represent a minority of the playerbase, does not mean that everyone else is happy by default.  I will use my own personal example here.  Of all my real life friends who play League, I am the only one who posts on forums about it.  However, of my friends, their opinions of the game's current state vary from strong dislike to indifference (with a correlation between frequency of play and dissatisfaction).  Of course, my social circle is an insignificant portion of the playerbase, but I highly doubt that I am the only person with this sort of experience.\n\n\n_**Tank meta was well balanced, but change needs to happen to prevent the game becoming stale**_\n\nThis is true, _but only to a certain extent._  The tank meta resulted in all classes in the game being almost equally viable, with tanks obviously being the most viable by a small amount, which was mostly fixed with some tuning.  Change is good, but only if handled with care.\n\nThey key thing here is that Riot decided to shift away from the tank meta heavily, despite the tank meta being regarded as the most balanced state of the game in years.  This was completely the wrong thing to do.  By making tanks less valuable, the same old issues arise.  ADCs also lose value, and the game devolves into having lots of high burst champions (assassins and some mages) dominating the game again.\n\nWhat Riot should have done is keep the meta intact, but change the game in small ways that did not upset the balance of things.  Sated Devourer was an attempt at this, but it was handled so poorly that it just made a certain subset of champions overpowered.  This meant that those champions could not only handle tanks, but they could handle non-tanks even better than ever, invalidating champions who did not have the abilities to abuse the item to achieve the same absurd level of dps.  \n\nA better item would have made dps junglers like Master Yi able to handle the tank meta without making them absurd vs squishy targets.  Perhaps a jungle equivalent of blade of the ruined king would have achieved this.  The warrior enchantment (perhaps with some tweaks) would be the go-to item for being effective against less tanky teams, and the BotrK style enchantment would allow champs like Yi to remain relevant if they came up against a tankier team.\n\nAlso, I completely disagree with the notion that Cinderhulk should be made viable by no longer making it even compete against devourer, but shifting it to a brief midgame window.  Why shouldn't all jungle items be made equal?  Cinderhulk SHOULD be as good as Devourer, or rather Devourer should be brought in line with Cinderhulk as it is before the upcoming nerf.  \n\nThere is absolutely no reason why a tank item and its carry equivalent should not be equally good at doing their respective jobs.  Sated devourer's broken design makes this impossible to do, but by changing it for something balanceable and not simply an item to be abused by certain champions, it would be possible.\n\n**Let's look at it another way.**\n\nThe game is in a lot of ways like paper/scissors/rock.  That game is perfectly balanced because each option is strong against one thing, but weak against another.  \n\nBy weakening rock, scissors becomes OP because although paper will continue to be great at beating rock, there is nothing to stop scissors cutting the paper.  And so the game falls apart.\n\nBut this can be expanded upon.  Let's look at the most popular expansion of the game, 'Paper Scissors Rock Lizard Spock'.  It works like this.\n\nPaper > Rock, Spock\nScissors > Paper, Lizard\nRock > Scissors, Lizard\nLizard > Spock, Paper\nSpock > Scissors, Rock\n\nNow, we have a game which still has the same level of balance.  All options now beat exactly 2 other options, while losing to the other 2.  The balance is still maintained, but depth and complexity is increased.  \n\nAdmittedly depth is better than complexity so this analogy doesn't completely hold up, but hopefully it gets the point across.  By expanding on an existing, _successful_ meta with new items and champions which challenge the game in interesting ways without invalidating the meta itself, Riot would have been onto a winner.  \n\nHell, there's actually some merit to the Morde update in regards to trying to make a viable botlane which isn't ADC-focused (assuming the ADC would instead go top, i.e. Vayne, Quinn or Urgot).  That idea is cool.  What isn't cool is that they had to completely rework a beloved old champion into a role that makes no sense for him.  If Riot had made an all new champion who was designed from the ground up to be a tanky botlane pusher that is support-reliant, then everyone would have loved it, _even if it didn't work._\n\n================\n\ntl;dr Riot should have focused on changing the meta entirely when it was in such a balanced state.  They should have _expanded _on the meta and introduced new champions/items/mechanics that challenge it enough to shake things up and keep things fresh, without taking away from what makes the game work.  \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2015-08-07T05:58:16.451+0000","up_votes":93,"down_votes":41,"body":"Honestly its just you, I've been playing since season 3 and I hear this every season.

It wasn't a good item last season and a lot of players didn't forget that. Feral flare was a bad item to introduce and sated falls under that category. IIRC FF was the most hated item last season. Sated is quickly rising towards that place as well for this one. \n\nThe AP jungle item change and the time between changes (that were needed) was too long.

You could shut both down, but they could easily come back once they got that item. \n\nThen the statement yesterday just drew the last straw with a lot of people. The most requested thing by Pro's/casual players was the 2 things they aren't working on. Sandbox/replay systems. With the Vast amount of replay systems riot could have picked any of them and asked the Devs to come on board and make one that would work in-client. I can't understand how a simple replay system could be so hard for them to make. \n\nSandbox mode is something riot deemed \"toxic\" because it would just add a level of \"toxicity\" that wouldn't be healthy..... What? So saying to someone \"go practice flashing over that wall in Sandbox after.\" is toxic? if someone said that, hell I would be more happy to hear that then \"hey go Fuk yourself, and die of cancer.\" I don't, which is less toxic Riot? You tell me. \n\nMANY pro's are pissed with riot's inept attitude towards giving players the basic tools needed to get better. Thooorin and Montecristo hit the nail home. [Here is a Link to Monte's response. Started at a point I think he starts to pick apart the response from riot better.](https://youtu.be/_tdrx3Fohmc?t=9m52s) Both share the same View on this. Along with all the Pro's tweets about this, I am surprised at riot's response. \n\nIf riot continues this path of not delivering basic fundamentals to it's players I doubt league will be a AAA title in the coming years. It's becoming more of a spectator's game then one people want to play. If riot put 1/4 of the effort into the game as they do making the LCS/Worlds/Other International matches, This game wouldn't be in such a poor state. \n\nIt's sad to see a game I have played for so long, just widdle away because the Developers and Management have become complacent with the game. Maybe riot learns, I don't know. But they are up against the wall now, and I think people are realizing that they aren't going to deliver on things the masses have asked for. \n\nI for one will sit back and watch the game fall if riot continues this ideology of systems that they deem not a necessity, but would vastly improve the games overall competitive nature.\n\nEDIT: [Here is my comment on the Big Riot plz blog](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/riot-official/VcbeEAoy-riot-pls?comment=0230)","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf209142555","date":"2015-08-07T12:55:27.630+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"So where is that Hai comment because he actually said the game is in the best state that it's ever been in.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2015-08-07T05:50:35.428+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":24,"body":"I know I'll probably get downvoted to oblivion...

This method alone produces a lot of backlash regardless of the intent of the changes, since people's understanding of a champion's role and strengths/weaknesses get subverted, especially when only numbers are given without context.  \n\nWhat Riot SHOULD do (and have occasionally made attempts for like 2 years ago) is work more closely with the community through all stages of a champion's development.  Let's look at a couple of possibilities.\n\nMorde: CertainlyT announces that with Morde's difficult to balance nature, he was planning on shifting him to be a dedicated botlane carry who was support reliant.  Chances are, there would be a strong opposition to this, and so CertainlyT would instead work with the community to figure out a compromise that would make him more fair and viable in a solo lane without breaking his core identity.  It is unlikely anything close to Morde's current rework would see the light of day using this method.\n\nSkarner: Riot announces a new idea for a passive on Skarner, but his stun was being moved to his slow to ensure that part of his kit remained intact.  They suggest the idea for a control-point based system for Skarner, and suggest a prototype version (the one we have now).  In this case, it fits Skarner's identity, but the implementation needs work.  Through transparency and good community involvement, the crystals passive could progress from being viewed as a gimmick and/or hindrance to something very exciting.  \n\nFurthermore, by operating in this way, Riot would have a LOT more popularity with their playerbase.  If we all chipped in to get the Skarner rework we all wanted, or at least a nice middle point between the community's wishes and what Riot believes is healthy for the future of the game, then it would be OUR champion.  A Skarner that was worked on by both Riot and Skarner players.\n\nI think this could be applied to all aspects of league.  Ask the community what they want, and find ways to deliver on this.  A few people will always be upset by any change, but it is better to ensure that a good portion community is on board before finalizing any changes.  Transparency goes a long way here - letting us be in the know earlier on in a new development helps us to accept the change and feel like we were eased into it, even if the community had little direct involvement.\n\nFYI Skarner is my favourite jungler :p","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"I Main Swain","date":"2015-08-07T15:13:58.411+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"it's funny because not a week ago everything on the boards was thanking riot for the bilgewatter lore and telling them how fantastic they did.  it took all of 1 day for that to completely flip.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gubigubi","date":"2015-08-07T05:23:49.037+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"I have and still do enjoy the game.
