Sorry for the long post.\n\nI&#039;ve had this long-time concern about the unhealthy gameplay elements that CertainlyT champions bring to the game.  This isn&#039;t a rant against CertainlyT as a designer per se, but I think that for all of the positive elements his designs bring to the game (new mechanics etc), they are outweighed by the overall negative impact of his champions from an overall &#039;fun factor&#039; point of view.\n\nA quick recap on CertainlyT champions:\n\n* Darius\n* Zyra (co-designer)\n* Thresh\n* Zed\n* Yasuo\n* Kalista\n\nAll of these champions have been problematic on release, and with the exception of Darius, all have introduced unique new mechanics to the game.  All have had to be significantly nerfed post-release except Kalista, whom I still believe has her inherent issues due to overly binary play (you either have targetted stuns and beat her, or you have skillshots and lose).\n\nCertainlyT champions are fun to play, because they give you a sense of power.  You have options, you can make those LCS plays, and you are in control of your own fate and success in the game more than almost any other champion.  This makes them fun to play as, but unfun to play against imo, for these reasons:\n\n* They have overloaded kits, with most skills having either a secondary active component, or a passive component.\n* As a result, the champions usually lack clearly-defined weaknesses\n* This means your success when fighting these champions is based more on the _enemy making a mistake_, rather than you playing well.\n\nThat final point is what really causes issues.  Fun gameplay is based around making your own opportunities for success, and then capitalising on them. This makes you feel like you have outwitted and outplayed your opponent.  It should also mean that _you played to your champion&#039;s strengths better than your opponent played to your champion&#039;s weaknesses._\n\nPlaying against a Zed for example is exhausting if they are competent.  When I beat a good Zed player, I don&#039;t feel like a boss, I just feel tired.  Like I&#039;ve had a game of dodgeball where only Zed is allowed to throw balls unless he fumbles, and even then I&#039;ve had to sprint to catch that ball just to have a chance at throwing it back.  Compare that to say the Sion remake, who has a ton of very easily-identified strengths and weaknesses.\n\nAlso, for a game which really made a name for itself back originally because of its emphasis on skillshot mechanics, to suddenly have Yasuo (windwall) and Kalista (constant dashing) invalidate these with their mechanics seems a bit against the game&#039;s design philosophy.  Riot have been progressively moving away from targetted skills (particularly those with hard CC) for a long time now, and for good reason as they result in binary gameplay which lacks counterplay.  If you intend to follow that design philosophy, you can&#039;t have a champion like Kalista who more-or-less requires targetted CC in order to reliably defeat her.\n\nAs I said, this isn&#039;t a hate post.  I believe there are a LOT of issues with CertainlyT&#039;s designs to a point where they outweigh the positives, but the positives are there.  \n* Thresh for example is a very good support who never feels overwhelmingly oppressive to fight against (after a lot of nerfs at least) due to his hook being easier to dodge than Naut or Blitz&#039;s hooks as a result of its slightly longer windup.  \n* Kalista&#039;s soulbond mechanic has some real merit to it, resulting in some interesting decision-making at the start of the game, and opening up some healthy synergies with under-utilised supports like Alistar.\n* Yasuo using movement as a resource is an interesting idea, but I wish it was used differently.  Rather than it just applying a defensive steroid, what if it instead empowered his moves when at maximum flow?  You could then make gameplay have much more meaningful peaks and troughs, where Yasuo could build MS items in order to maximise usage of his powerful skills (a bit like Rage), but at the cost of more consistent damage or survivability.  Right now it feels like a bonus that was chucked on just because they could, and is more of a nice bonus than an intrinsic part of decision making when playing Yasuo.\n\nCertainlyT, you&#039;ve got some great ideas, but you need to show some restraint.  A champion shouldn&#039;t be everyone&#039;s power fantasy, because that only works in a single-player environment.  Giving free stats results in less viable decision-making when choosing items (Yasuo is forced to get IE & shiv, Kalista is forced to get Runaan&#039;s), and most importantly, a champion needs clearly-defined counterplay.  Only Darius really has this (easily kited).\n\n\ntl;dr\n* Being fun to play as doesn&#039;t necessarily mean fun to play against\n* His champions put too much control in the hands of the user, not enough in his opponents&#039; hands\n* Lack of clearly-defined counterplay\n* Good mechanics and ideas are drowned out by overloaded kits\n* Mechanics that make skillshots unviable are bad for the game and its current direction","replies":[{"poster":"GloriousKaiser","date":"2015-04-09T17:07:46.214+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Darius is his most balanced champion right now. Even with the ult buffs, he doesn't feel overbearing BECAUSE he has counterplay (NOT COUNTER PICKS)\n\nCertainlyT's problem is that his champions counterplay isn't accessible unless you pick a specific champion against them. So it further pushes the idea that games are decided at champion select which they shouldn't be if the former is true.","replies":[{"poster":"Count Lieberkuhn","date":"2015-04-09T18:05:26.812+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"To some extent this applies to all champions, but in the case of these champs, a bit more than most.  Kalista is a prime example of this - almost impossible to land a skillshot on if she is good, and as a result you need things like the Taric stun to reliably deal with her.\n\nI think the 'if x player is good' mantra is a big thing with these champions.  They have high skill floors and skill ceilings compared to most champions, which means that these issues are only really significant in the hands of competent players.  However at my level of play (gold) I find that with CertainlyT champions, the amount of skill required to play them effectively is lower than the amount of skill required to play _against _them.  This also applies to most assassins though, to be fair.","replies":[{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2015-04-09T18:27:22.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the same time, Riot loves to nerf the crap out of counterpicks like Kayle and Heimerdinger, which in turn make champion like Zed even more overbearing. They also love to make EVERYTHING a skillshot, so Kalista has an even easier time. Look at Zilean and Veigar.\n\nFor me, CertainlyToxic is among my less liked Reds, together with Scarizard. He has too much freedom and loves to stomp over Riot's precepts and design limits. CertainlyT is not a good designer, he like the fanfic writter that makes overpowered Mary Sue auto-inserts into the story. He has good ideas, but most of them are horribly designed and utterly selfish. As you mentioned, his champions are made to feel good only in the case you are playing them.\n\nThresh, Zed and Kalista have been problems since release, while Yasuo, Darius and Zyra are in an overnerfed state. They are all oppresive and have low counterplay, specially Zed. An assassin that has ridiculous waveclear, low cds, no-limited mobility, energy and ultra safe assasination which leads to completly one-sided and extremely safe tower-dives? Riot really needs someone with a paper fan to bonk CertainlyT over the head every time he starts overloadind his champions.\n\nSometimes I dont know if RIot is simply inept when it comes to leash his own developers, or they are encouraging him to make flashy champion for LCSBIGPLAYS.\n\nAlso, I dont know if he designs his champion on the visual departament, but I find all his champions boring. Like ''3edgy5me'' boring. They are all darkz, edgy and have this 90s anti-hero vibe I hate.","replies":[{"poster":"Count Lieberkuhn","date":"2015-04-09T22:16:08.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You also comment on a significant point I brought up, which is how these champions are in opposition to a skillshot-driven game which Riot has been developing.  Targeted skills are simpler to implement, and are mostly a thing of the past now, in terms of new champion designs.  It is very counter-intuitive to have the game focus more heavily on skillshots, and then introduce mechanics that seem to punish players for picking skillshot champs.\n\nI'm also not a fan of his characters' visual designs and themes, but that's an entirely subjective issue, and I'm not sure how much input designers have in this regard at any rate.  I would imagine the visuals and themes are primarily the realm of the art department, with the champion designers having less input on the visual side of things,","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DaedricTerror13","date":"2015-09-09T10:24:02.579+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"NOT ANYMORE LOL!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-04-10T23:11:52.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius has counterplay.\n\nI want you to say that the next time you are playing{{champion:75}} against him.","replies":[{"poster":"Count Lieberkuhn","date":"2015-04-11T02:30:37.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is true, Darius falls under GloriousKaiser's idea of Counterpicks vs counterplay.

Thresh is still strictly better than most supports due to his enormous utility, but only by a tiny amount, and he doesn't feel oppressive to play against.\n\nKalista is probably the most obnoxious champion design since Fizz, except worse in some ways - Fizz has a window of vulnerability after he uses playful/trickster, whereas Kalista continues to be elusive and almost untouchable after every auto-attack.  Gets my blood boiling when she hops away from you like a fucking bunny rabbit, forever just out of reach.\n\nYasuo is in a manageable spot now entirely because he got nerfed to the ground.  Yasuo was unfortunately another failed attempt at the melee adc archetype, which has historically always been a difficult one to balance.  It's either overbearingly strong, or useless unless fed.  Yasuo's design and mechanics were an attempt to have a viable, balance-able melee adc, but the overloading of free statistics actually made this even more of an issue than it is for say, Master Yi or Aatrox.\n\nZed is still the most low-risk, high-reward champion in existence.  His ultimate should NOT have a get out of jail free card attached to its already enormous kill potential.  It should have 0 base damage, but instead deal a larger percentage of the damage dealt during the duration at the end.  This would stop it being used cheaply as a safe last-hit, and instead require Zed players to commit to their engage for a decent amount of time in order to get some good damage out of the skill.","replies":[{"poster":"StellarPrime","date":"2015-04-10T20:41:55.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I pretty much agree here...especially with {{champion:238}} . It's funny because my main is {{champion:143}}  and I think the fact that playing against \"CertainlyT\" champions  can be very unfun to play against is somewhat true because when I play Zyra in the midlane I pretty much feel safe against every champion except Zed. The fact that both champs have had CertainlyT's hand in their creation further enforces the idea that champions with \"overloaded\" kits can be extremely frustrating to play against. If every champion had something unique about their kit that separates them out from the rest of the champions, that would be great...but too many champions with nothing \"unique\" were made before CertainlyT's champs came along. \n\nAlso I'd like to add that I'm pretty sure the trend has continued since CertainlyT's champs and isn't applicable to his champions alone. Correct me if I'm wrong on this :)","replies":[{"poster":"Count Lieberkuhn","date":"2015-04-11T02:54:28.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zyra is perhaps the least oppressive of his champions I think, since she has the same weakness as a lot of other champions like her - no natural mobility and tankiness, and all of her survivability is reliant on landing her CC if attacked.  She's similar to Brand in this regard.  She's quite safe, but a good player can do a lot of damage when her E is on cooldown.\n\nAs for uniqueness, I think this is something designers have been improving at, but the difference is the level of uniqueness.  I would argue that the unique mechanics on CertainlyT's champs are muddied by the fact that they have too many of them.  \n\nLet's compare two recent(ish) champions with unique mechanics, Azir and Yasuo.  Can you concisely describe each of these in one sentence?  For me, the answer is no.  I can do this for Azir (he's the guy that uses immobile summoned units for damage and mobility), but not so much for Yasuo.  He's the guy who blocks projectiles, and uses mobility as a resource, and gets free crit chance, and relies on knock-ups to use his ultimate, which allows him to shred high-armour tanks, and looks like Mitsurugi.  What is his identity really?  \n\nBTW I'm not saying Azir doesn't have his problems, but he has a clear design based on a single unique concept, and that concept is explored fully.\n\nAlthough I'm not too fond of Braum due to him making botlane interactions quite stagnant, at least he has his identity as the support who can get in the way of ranged attacks to protect his adc.  That's what happens if you take ONE of the mechanics that Yasuo had - a champion who is for the most part liked by the community, with a clear identity.  Doesn't hurt that Braum as a character is WAY more interesting and like-able than Yasuo though, but I'll try and keep this based on gameplay.\n\nAzir, Bard, and Gnar are good examples of champions based on unique mechanics/themes, with a clear identity.  I think if Yasuo was 'the guy who uses mobility as a resource' and Kalista was 'the adc who specialises in support synergy' and those themes were the central focus and explored fully, these champions would be a lot more interesting.  \n\ntl;dr Unique mechanics are fantastic, but one unique idea explored fully > lots of unique but undeveloped ideas","replies":[{"poster":"DaedricTerror13","date":"2015-09-09T10:26:16.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but she WAS op when she came out, she got a mega nerf because she was even worse than all the others he made.\n\nShe was THAT bad they had to insta nerf her, instead of cave to his nepotism.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2015-04-09T17:07:49.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't see why CertainlyT has to be called out to have this discussion.

Yuso for example, he was intended to be the first melee's in a long time to be able to go mid lane so him being op to be able to counter range/wizards.  To balance him they basically nerfed everyone of the skills and stats to justify the 50% crit chance. Where if they had just said \"maybe 50% instane crit chance was a bad idea,\" and pulled it. While to Keep him in the mid lane they would just decrease the cool down on Wind wall and increase the power of his passive shield.
