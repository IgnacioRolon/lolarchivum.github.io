Before the server move, I had a ping that fluctuated between ~90 and ~77 depending on the time frame. Right before the move it was a consistent 77.\r\n\r\nAfter the server moved, I had a glorious ping of ~25. That was august of last year when this happened. I don't remember the exact time frame that I had ~25 ping, but I do know that after some time, my ping eventually became ~55. To put that in perspective, I have a friend who lives in Las Vegas and his ping is roughly 60. So, I live south of Pittsburgh, on the boarder of West Virginia and Ohio, and I'm getting the same ping as someone in Las Vegas!?\r\n\r\n\r\nTo show I'm not crazy, here is a speedtest to the SilverIP Comm server in Chicago:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.speedtest.net/result/5851966052.png\r\n\r\nAnd to show that my LoL Ping is ridiculous given the distance, here is a traceroute to the Riot servers:\r\n\r\nhttps://s15.postimg.org/jxofkop4b/tracert.png\r\n\r\nSo, prior to the move, riot was posting a bunch of pictures about their backbone. More specifically, this one:\r\n\r\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/engineering-hd.jpg?itok=msHWYc21\r\n\r\nI live pretty smack dab in the middle of the Chicago server and of the Ashburn server according to that map. And from what that graph shows us, I should literally be connecting to Ashburn, and jumping straight to Chicago with no interference. Instead, I'm being routed to Chicago, which, given how I'm in the middle, shouldn't actually matter in terms of travel time, it should actually be less than the alternative.\r\n\r\nMy ISP is Atlantic Broadband, a company Riot is not peered with. Funnily enough though, Atlantic Broadband is a subsidiary of a Canadian company known as Cogeco of which Riot is peered with. Atlantic Broadband, despite being east coast, is a pretty big provider, something like 9th to 13th largest.\r\n\r\nI've exhausted my resources. I've sent in tickets, no dice, I've called my ISP, no dice. I just want a more direct, straight answer from someone as to why I'm getting a 55 ping to a server I should quite literally be getting half of that to.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-06T01:01:32.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The determining factor to how your network connection is routed to League is your ISP. They decide whether you connect to one node or another, or if your connection connects to a specific backbone provider or not. There may be a certain node that's causing an issue, or it could just be a *really inefficient* route to the servers, but I'll need more data to know for sure. I strongly recommend running a *full traceroute* using a network app called [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/). Simply boot up the app, paste **104.160.131.1** into the host field, then start the trace. After 5 min has passed by, export the data as *text* and paste the data in a reply to me.\n\nI'd be more than happy to specifically point out where the latency starts climbing and where there may be troubles.","replies":[{"poster":"Retsudrats","date":"2016-12-07T09:16:34.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was originally going to show a WinMTR screenshot, but figured it best to show a command prompt traceroute for a post.\n\nHeres a pastebin to the results: http://pastebin.com/UgsvSLze\n\nCopy and pasting the results dont seem to like the uh, font for the boards, but Ill paste that too.\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n \n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n \n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n \n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n \n|                             192.168.0.1 -    0 |  310 |  310 |    0 |    5 |   89 |    1 |\n \n|                   No response from host -  100 |   63 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n \n|                             172.25.16.5 -    0 |  310 |  310 |    9 |   20 |  140 |   12 |\n \n  |te0-0-0-7.rcr21.pit02.atlas.cogentco.com -    0 |  310 |  310 |   12 |   22 |  152 |   14 |\n \n|   be2821.ccr21.cle04.atlas.cogentco.com -    0 |  310 |  310 |   15 |   26 |  151 |   18 |\n \n|   be2993.ccr21.yyz02.atlas.cogentco.com -    0 |  310 |  310 |   22 |   32 |  152 |   28 |\n \n|                 level3.yyz02.atlas.cogentco.com -    0 |  310 |  310 |   22 |   33 |  152 |   24 |\n \n|                                 No response from host -  100 |   63 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n \n|                             4.35.80.238 -    0 |  310 |  310 |   49 |   60 |  200 |   49 |\n \n|                          104.160.132.35 -    0 |  310 |  310 |   49 |   59 |  150 |   56 |\n \n|          ae31-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  310 |  310 |   49 |   60 |  162 |   53 |\n \n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |  310 |  310 |   48 |   60 |  199 |   51 |\n \n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-07T22:52:41.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for providing your traceroute results.

From the looks of the routing, my traffic doesnt hop onto the riotdirect network until its already in chicago...So why would routing to chicago to riot be different than routing to the SilverIP Comm speedtest server also hosted in chicago?\n\nI understand it might be my ISP, but the last time I spoke to them(it was regarding the 'no reply from host' nodes) they said that the final set of IPs (the riot ips) were pointing towards Los Angeles. Doing IP lookups on those also seems to point out that way. Im sure its nothing.\n\nReally, the question is, could the request location from riot be screwing up? One would think a route from chicago should be going the same route regardless of the service, right?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-08T21:50:40.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At this point we can only speculate, since the IP address you ran the trace with isn't an actual game or platform service IP address, it's simply a test IP we use for these tests. In normal operating conditions, your route should be similar, but these traceroute revealed regardless of what *should* happen, the route is simply problematic at the moment.\n\nI hope that cleared up the confusion.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
