Like 10-15 times a game. My Soraka becomes unresponsive and my messages/pings don't go through. But then, outta nowhere, it all goes through at the exact same time. Both my messages and pings registered in 13:22 in the game simultaneously. My ping never, ever goes above 17 or 18 and my Internet is pretty good. I have no connection problems at all. Everything and everyone else in the game continues like normal (as you can see with my Kassadin ferociously battling Meowkai and Leona), it's just me.

Essentially, packet loss happens when some of the data gets lost between your network and our servers.
