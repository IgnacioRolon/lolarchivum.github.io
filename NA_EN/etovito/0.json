It was just gone, **POOF** not even there. I bought it when all the special little wards were on the shop, penguin skier, riggle ward, etc. Now I don't even have my favorite one. If someone could help me get it back or maybe this is an issue on my end, please help. \r\n\r\nI looked through my purchase history and it only goes back 3 months so I couldn't find when I bought it and I don't know if there is an option to see your full purchase history. Thanks to anyone who can help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-03T20:51:01.852+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's an issue on-going currently where some ward skins are missing despite being unlocked on the account.
