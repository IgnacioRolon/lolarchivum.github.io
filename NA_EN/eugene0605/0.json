I knew the game was then remake because i was queuing with my friend. I have lost at least 14LP but i only realised that after playing another ranked game. I was wondering if i can go back to the game after crash thus i skipped the error reporting window, but the repair wass not yet finished after they remake. I have no idea why my client crashed and i think it is the second time of crashing a game, which is not even the first game of the day. I wonder if riot could help fix this and give back my LP D:","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-16T21:21:31.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't alter LP without damaging the integrity of the ranking system, but I can guide you through some things to try and make sure this doesn't happen again. First, try to make sure you're always launching the client as admin. *Especially* when patches are rolling out. If not, sometimes those files can get corrupted or stop working properly causing these kinds of crashes. \n\nAs for what's going on with your client right now, let's take a couple cautionary troubleshooting steps to make sure this is fixed. Run through our [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) for some general steps, but hit me back up if this doesn't stop happening.","replies":[]}]}
