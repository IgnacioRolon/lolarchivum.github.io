I was able to get it working and I went back into the game at 12 minutes. We ended up winning the game and I went 10/5/18. But after the game I ended up losing 20 lp and getting a 20 minute leaver. How is this fair. Doesn't this stop players from rejoining games, making it even worse for their team.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-05T22:58:46.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might feel like this pushes people towards not rejoining, but this system helps prevent people from essentially 'farming' wins while being AFK. If this system weren't in place, players and botters could hop in a match and immediately leave, but still get LP and other benefits if their team was able to win. As you could imagine, this would almost open the floodgates for afk's.\n\nIf your wifi is crashing like this relatively often, try updating your Port Forwarding and DNS settings by following those steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). Those are usually able to help smooth out a spotty connection, but let me know if it doesn't seem to help at all.","replies":[]}]}
