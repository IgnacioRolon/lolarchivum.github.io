Pyke might not have to fear death, but he probably doesn't want an evil warlord from the distant past to rule over him more than a captain. And Mordekaiser certainly won't ignore a powerful revenant and let him do what he wants.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-06-04T15:30:52.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's assuming Mordekaiser is actually leading the Harrowing though. I have a feeling the Harrowing is an event that happens annually on it's own, like a morbid holiday.

I don't think Mordekaiser would waste his time on an event that's sporadic and fleeting.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-06-04T18:44:45.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mordekaiser is truly leading the Harrowing, there is no doubt about it. If you read the set of Shadow Isles pieces that were released at the same time as Kalista, Mordekaiser is clearly in charge. \n\nMaybe the phenomenon existed before he arrived to the Isles, and he only molded it to his own will, but as of now, he's the chief.\n\nAlso, the Harrowing is NOT annual. That's a misconception Riot has battled with for a long time, because they started things off by releasing content about the Harrowing on \"real life\" Halloween, but the Harrowing can happen seemingly randomly (at least from the Bilgewater point of view). Or at least, in an unpredictable manner.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-06-04T18:55:09.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mordekaiser \"conquered\" the Shadow Isles, but he doesn't lead the Harrowings - Mordekaiser wants to conquer the mainland, not launch periodic raids on Bilgewater. The ONE thing about the Harrowings that would indicate that Mordekaiser is not in charge of them is the fact that they happen, and then recede. They do not linger and occupy. Mordekaiser wouldn't waste his time on an undead spook-a-thon of a pirate town that only lasts a night to a few days. If he's leading undead to the mainland, he will do so and conquer the regions he decimates, as he carves a path towards Noxus. He's not bound to the Islands and the Mists like the lesser undead are, and he's got necromancers in his employ, so if he was leading the Harrowings, they would be composed of undead he can detach from the islands with and lay waste to Runeterra.\n\nAlso, just because Mordekaiser moved in to the Isles and subjected some of the undead there doesn't mean he's got absolute control over everything there. He's just an interloper who's utilizing the tools at hand, but he is by no means the overarching power on the Isles. The corrupted life waters are the true power that governs the Isles and form the Mist, not Mordekaiser. He's the equivalent of a man who built a fortress in a jungle full of gorillas - he may be able to subjugate the gorillas, but the realm he is in has no lord and master.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-06-04T19:33:48.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a valid theory, but nothing you offer as evidence sounds very convincing to me. I suppose we'll just have to wait and see in future lore :)\n\nOne small point, though: Mordekaiser could regularly invade Bilgewater just as an easy way to raiser more troops, amassing them until he got enough. As you said, he doesn't care about occupying this island, but it's still the closest settlement, so the more practical source of new souls to enslave.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-06-02T19:15:19.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FauxSchizzle,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=LpE5y09R,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-06-02T16:23:20.688+0000)\n>\n> We speculated about this a lot during Pyke's development.
