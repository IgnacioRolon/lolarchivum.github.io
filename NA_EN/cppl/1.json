The whole point of mages are to be high damage ability based champions who need skill and (depending on the champion) mobility in order to not get blown up. Giving them damage + defense combination items removes this intended weakness without losing their intended strength.\n\nHowever despite this you still have the best defense + offense item in the game, Zhonyas, which pretty much counters any assassins kit if used properly. Giving you more damage + defensive items would only further cover your weakness without compromising your strength.\n\nAnd if your not worried about compromising your strength there is already a myriad of tanky items out there for you.\n\nAssassins intended strength is to pretty much be able to one combo any squishy target, but leaving themselves very exposed after their cycle has ended. This is why items like Zhonyas and Mercurial exist; They aren't intended to be your go-to item every game, but rather a reactionary purchase to give you options against assassins if you should face one. Even with these items, it is still very much up to your own skill and ability to negate their burst, which if successful, you gain a significant advantage against them.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-05-05T20:25:21.614+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"> Assassins intended strength is to pretty much be able to one combo any squishy target, but leaving themselves very exposed after their cycle has ended.\n\nTurns out that's not a very fair way to design a champion.

But I don't agree that it's not a fair way to design a champion. Not every champion needs to be able to 1v1 or go toe-to-toe with every other champion. There will always (and should be) certain types of champs that struggle against others, and those champs have champs they struggle against as well. \n\nTake rock paper scissors for example:\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Rock-paper-scissors.svg/2000px-Rock-paper-scissors.svg.png\n\nEach one has a clear enemies they struggle against, and clear enemies they are strong against. Thankfully league is not as binary (win/lose) as Rock Paper Scissors, but the concept applies. Because there will definitely be champions you struggle against more than others, it becomes that much more important to A: Choose the right champs (if you can), but more importantly B: Learn how to overcome, or at least survive, those challenges. Even in LCS, there are players who struggle against certain champs and can feed (looking at you faker/azir). \n\nPossibly the single best thing you can do if you struggle against a certain champ is to play said champ. A lot. Every time I do this I learn so much about what each champ is capable of and their windows of weakness. I come out so much stronger and conveniently have added a new champ to my repertoire.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-05-06T01:52:06.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And if Riot didn't treat the laning phase as sacred, I wouldn't really care that I can't 1v1 every other champion in the game.\n\nBut they do, which means I can't play mid without fighting an assassin about half the time.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CppL","date":"2016-05-05T14:41:55.349+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Slythion,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gzsLIyZL,comment-id=00040001000000000000,timestamp=2016-05-05T14:36:24.602+0000)\n>\n> My point is that your main complaint is that an assassin is doing their job to kill squish and generally non-mobile champions.
