Please make it possible to choose Champions in Normal and Draft by typing in the letters and than hitting the Enter key for logging in (or even better for just showing other teammates and a second time Enter to log it in). This would be awesome cause many players have a bunch of Champions and its much easier to select Champs this way)\r\n\r\n2. The Music and the Sound of the Client should be able to be separatly adjustible, cause sometimes in long Queue times we players more like to do smthing else but watch the count-down xD\r\n\r\nThanks guys and aagain: We all love your new client :D\r\n\r\n\r\nOh and please make {{champion:268}} playable again &lt;3 xD","replies":[{"poster":"Credo","date":"2016-09-28T01:52:32.252+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. We thought about the enter key, but decided that it is too easy to make a mistake with it (and accidentally choose a champion you didnt want). We could potentially revisit this later, but thats the current plan.\n2. This is something that will happen relatively soon.
