See, I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding here.\n\nI *can* handle your insensitive \"jokes,\" I can handle your insults, and I can handle your abuse. You won't actually bother me, and frankly I'll probably forget about it entirely in a game or two.\n\nBut am I happy to have bullshit like that around during my leisure time, when I'm just trying to play a game and have a bit of fun? Nope. It's sort of like how if someone shouts a slur at me on the street I brush it off and go about my day, but if someone comes up to me at a movie theater and starts whispering slurs in my ear I want them kicked the hell out.\n\nAssholes exist, and many of us *can* brush them off. But that doesn't mean we'll give players like that a big hug and welcome them to our community with open arms.\n\n----------------\n\nThe mute button isn't an excuse to allow toxic behavior -- it's a defense AGAINST it, so I'm not forced to listen to 30 minutes of harassment I have no interest in reading. Doesn't justify the harassment in the first place, or mean that *League* is allowing it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2017-05-21T16:41:03.335+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not that the community as a whole can't handle a single joke, but rather we just don't enjoy playing with people who'd rather be verbally abusive and harass others than play the actual game itself. Yes there's a mute button but that's not an excuse to be a jerk to other players. There are ways to interact with other players without resorting to insults and the like, and though it's not always easy at times it is definitely possible. Maybe the ones who need to man up are the ones who can't handle being held accountable for their poor behavior rather than the ones who simply don't enjoy and/or tolerate that kind of behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wishbone25","date":"2017-05-21T05:17:22.909+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"all i can say prepair to get penalties one after another with that attitude untill bann window show up GG","replies":[{"poster":"Pokupoku","date":"2017-05-21T05:20:53.050+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=wishbone25,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=xGlraRpk,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-05-21T05:17:22.909+0000)\n>\n> all i can say prepair to get penalties one after another with that attitude untill bann window show up GG\n\nsmh whats wrong with you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mr209e2s","date":"2017-05-22T06:11:22.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok im not a great player but i have played since beta and  i can agree that the community in a wholw has changed but now you have more kids and teens than adults but in reality it is a game and reall shouldnt matter what any one types in gAme usually after hat gam you wom see that person agan for awhile if at all, instead of complaining and comstant crying just play thw game and move on after that in the end itnis just a video game just my .02\n\nSorry about grammar and spelling ","replies":[]}]}
