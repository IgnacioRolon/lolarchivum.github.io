I can't even log into the support site anymore with the pbe account credentials. Yes I understood that accounts prior to 10/25/2013 have been disabled. My account is before that time but why is it getting disabled now are you still disabling accounts 4 years later? I had access to it two months ago. Also singups are closed so can I no longer play on the PBE ever?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-29T00:23:45.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you know your account is older than that point, then that would be the reason why it's currently disabled. Accounts prior to that point were disabled awhile back and sent an email with steps on how to recover it. Reach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with your main account that is associated with the PBE one, and we might be able to get that activated again.","replies":[]}]}
