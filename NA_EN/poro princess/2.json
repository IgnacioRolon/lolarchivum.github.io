I know about the mage rework around the corner, but I haven&#039;t seen Kat mentioned in any of those posts at all. And frankly, I&#039;m a little concerned that with the mage changes she&#039;s going to be heavily affected in one way or another.\r\n\r\nAre you able to comment on if there is anything being done to her? I really like how she is now and if there are changes incoming, I would love it if they didn&#039;t drastically affect her style of play.\r\n\r\nThank you so much!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\na Happy Poro ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-04-14T05:25:25.639+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"No kit changes to Kat planned for 6.9 (the mid-season patch).

Ardent Censer is pretty much a newb trap and isn't that great, since the aspd and on-hit damage don't scale at all with heal/shield amount, Mikael's Crucible feels like a gold sink with a ridiculously long cooldown, Zeke's Harbringer doesn't feel as great anymore with how easy it if for marksmen to access crit now, Aegis and Frozen Heart are often picked up by the jungler or top lane that picking it up yourself just feels like a waste of gold, and Zz'rot Portal has become a nearly mandatory item for most teams. The Sight Stone upgrades aren't even that intuitive, becoming more of a last upgrade than a useful upgrade.\n\nIs it not possible to bring back Globe of Trust, Soul Shroud, or make changes to Mikael's Crucible, Ardent Censer, Zeke's Harbringer to make give supports a better time on the field? It feels like supports took a leap forward in season 5, and then took a few steps back when season 6 started. Inspiration was removed as a mastery, Expose Weakness was thrown into Ferocity, an unappealing tree for most supports/tanks (which should swap with Assassin, imo).\n\nAlso, could Nami's ult be coded so that Windwall/Unbreakable only shaves off a portion of Tidal Wave, instead of it disappearing instantly even if it touches the wall by half an inch.","replies":[{"poster":"CoolKnightST","date":"2016-04-14T18:07:27.984+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports have a lot of problems still.

It's still pretty good so no complains their. But as far options go with {{item:3050}} the line is pretty much dead. We still have {{item:3143}} but it's just so expensive for the support role.\n* {{item:3800}} pretty much got gutted for the support role. The repeated nerfs in order to ballance it out of the toplane together with the pretty \"nah\" components in the support role. Made it into a luxery item rather than an option your team actualy needs engage. The mage update might give some improvements to it. The buildline will still remain an underwhelming element from it.\n* {{item:3056}} it's really miserable that the only HP/AR/CDR item in the game remains in this position.\n* {{item:3222}} with the mage changes that also will effect {{item:3174}}. It might become an ok line for supports. Still fear that it will get nerfed to dead to ballance it for solo lanes like they did with {{item:3092}}. RIP\n* {{item:3504}} is a bit in a strange position. It's a luxery item that can be decent on a fell champions. It's an snowball item with average impact. The problem with the item is since it doesn't provide defensive stats you are not likely to rush it while in the lategame you pretty much reached the cdr cap to make it any more usefull. Personally I would like to see the componements change to {{item:3028}} + {{item:3113}}.

I'd agree with many of your points -- zeke's being mostly useless due to crit focus this season (still helps ashe and jhin though I think even if they already had 100%), zz'rot, ardent,  mikael's you are correct. I'm sure if you talk to your jungle before game or at start, you could convince them not to build aegis though -- also it can help to have 2 if your tank is going to dive while you hang back peeling for adc. I think your idea with nami ult and windwall makes a ton of sense -- and not just for nami ult; for rumble ult or other spells too. Similarly, yi and fizz shouldn't get free pass out of 2nd proc of morg ult unless they actually leave her ult radius instead of relying on playful/trickster or alpha strike.\nI differ with your claim on champ viability for supports though. I know meta changes as you climb tiers -- i've been everything from bronze to gold in a season before. If you know a champ well enough, you can play them even if they are not meta -- and actually start shift to a new meta. Ex: I was spamming morg support about 6 months before she took off in pro-scene a few seasons back and destroying people. I played {{champion:111}} support about 3 months before it became popular and a meta-pick. If you plan on winning in under 30, have you tried darius or noc support? They actually are not completely troll. You need to build full tank though -- maybe damage for 5th item if you get there. The {{champion:56}} ult and fear/{{champion:122}} pull and passive mean adc's with limited mobility and/or range actually have to respect your damage early -- especially if their support is a janna or soraka. I'm not recommending either of them, but the point i'm trying to make is that other champs can be viable supports in current meta too. Does leona need a buff compared to some supports? Yeah. But in a meta with few gap closers, why not try tahm? If you are vs a disengage or neutral support like janna or raka, you have no fear of throwing lane. Post-laning, you can ult behind enemy team and easily force fight -- bonus if you bring heavy cc top like malph or poppy with you. Or bring back naut support. Have you tried ap {{champion:10}} support -- you don't have to feel bad about going ap because of scaling on your heal/movement speed buff -- plus you remove it as option for enemy top/mid to play. How about {{champion:201}} , {{champion:79}} , {{champion:57}} , {{champion:98}} , full tank {{champion:6}} (again a cheese pick) or {{champion:143}} ? Just saying -- with enough practice and the right picks by enemy team and your's there are non-meta champs that work. All the same, i agree with you that some supports deserve update and support items definitely do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LabMem004","date":"2016-04-14T18:42:12.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\n> Will supports also have updates?

Power Chord Q is amazing in lane up until mid game, then it becomes a weak poke unless you have Sheen/Lich Bane built, I feel.\n\nShe's not a terrible champion, perse, but I strongly feel her update missed the mark. There's so many reasons to choose another support of her. Her stun is tied to her ult, which is a fairly long cooldown. Nami and Soraka have a better time healing, and Nami's passive outshines Sona's E until Sona puts more ranks into E, which is relatively late into the game. Nami also has the same poke output as Sona, if not lesser because Sona doesn't have to take a lot of risks to push Q and get damage out.\n\nBut that's all just my opinion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2016-04-14T09:52:27.129+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Will supports also have updates?

The more important problem is true sight. Apart from the fact that people barely buy pink wards across nearly all elos, the removal of the green ward indirectly buffed stealth assassins such as rengar/shaco. Perhaps look into more options of countering stealth with vision.\n\nOf course rengar has high burst, but so does every other assassin, such as zed or  talon. The problem of stealth assassins is not in their kits but limited vision. Although, quite strangely, I don't see nearly as many complaints about eve/shaco, both which have stealth on a much lower cooldown than rengar.\n\nRengar's only real ability and role is to assassinate high priority targets, and players should be aware of that and play against it. He is a niche champion, in a sense that he punishes splitting players and no vision on the map. He should be kept as a high risk high reward assassin, as I believe champion diversity should be preserved.

Yellow is better for objective control and \"Burst\" warding where you need a lot of vision for an important objective. Blue is better for long term warnings and wide coverage over a long time but you don't store multiple charges and it's vision radius is smaller.\n\nWhy not have the two red trinkets have reasons for using one over the other? The starting red trinket could disable wards, show red outlines of invisible champs, follow the player and last a shorter time (maybe long enough to clear 2 wards by yourself), with a short cooldown. \nHowever the upgraded version will have a slightly larger area (but definitely smaller than it is now), does not disable wards, stays in the same spot it's cast on, revealing all invisible units and making invisible champions targetable, like the old lens did, with a longer cooldown. \n\nThe upgraded lens would be necessary when fighting invisible champs but would not provide the benefit junglers and supports would like out of the basic one: Lower cooldowns and vision denial. If you expect a gank from a Shaco, get ulted by Talon, or anything else, early game they will have the advantage because without a pink you can't see them. Upon hitting nine, though, upgrading to the second red trinket will be a godsend to some being stomped by an Akali or Rengar. Then it'd be a matter of balancing stealth around various vision options everyone has.\n\nAlso, another note on Vision: You'd think with a name like \"Stalker's Blade\" that it'd be more focused on invading the enemy jungle, but it ends up being more about protecting your own. Why not replace the yellow wards it can place with blue wards? And have it on a kinda 2 charge system that SLOWLY (agonizingly) recharges and players can reduce the timer on getting another ward by killing large jungle monsters. That way, it'd have versatility, being both good for defense and invades as well as objective control. Lee Sin wouldn't like it that much, but they usually either keep their yellow trinket or build a sightstone anyways.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"rat king99","date":"2016-04-14T17:52:39.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I thought the reasoning for the immobile mage and ADC rework was because the classes weren't relevant enough and were underwhelming.
