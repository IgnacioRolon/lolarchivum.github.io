Are you guys really so delusional that you seriously believe restricting/banning accounts actually accomplishes ANYTHING? \r\n\r\nLiterally anybody who gets banned can just come right back with a new account and whatever they got banned for becomes pointless because that cycle will continue. And if they stop there will always be another troll/hacker/shit-talker/racist/etc to take their place. \r\n\r\nLeague is the only game that actually cares about banning. You try to go to call of duty or halo or diablo....literally pick any other game, and try to report someone for language. You just get laughed at. Because they KNOW that people would just shrug their shoulders say &quot;oh well&quot; make a new account and go right on with their routine. \r\nMaybe thats why every other game ONLY cares about banning scripters/hackers. But even then, same end result, new account incoming for the same bullshit. \r\n\r\nThis is serious you guys need to consider that no one gives a shit about your punishment system because theres no true way to banish a player. You will never be able to successfully ban someone. Theyll just laugh at you and make another account. \r\nBan the new account? Bam! Another one to take its place. \r\n\r\nSo I say again. Can we get real here and stop pretending the tribunal actually accomplishes anything?  It doesnt. And it never will. As long as league of legends exists so will the negative portion of the community as it does in any PvP game EVER. Not one company has ever been successful in it so why do you persist in this illusion of a better community? \r\n\r\nYour game would become so much better if the tribunal only punished for afks and hacking.\r\n\r\nThats why we have mute options. Guys annoying you? MUTE.  Racial slurs? MUTE. Insert any general hate speech? MUTE. \r\nWhy even have a mute button if you have a report system for it. Since when did anybody give a rats ass about internet strangers words? They&#039;re just words, and if youre hurt by words you definitely shouldnt be playing games where you kill people.\r\nDoubt ill ever hear a response from riot. I know how great they are at responding to their community. But someone needed to say this. \r\nQuit lying to yourselves and scrap the tribunal already.","replies":[{"poster":"deathgod5","date":"2017-06-26T09:43:54.693+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well... if it is really no problem to anybody to make a new account, why do they all come here to complain once their account got banned?","replies":[{"poster":"shadowwreaper","date":"2017-06-26T10:24:56.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"duh. money spent on the account.","replies":[{"poster":"deathgod5","date":"2017-06-26T11:12:08.440+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"then they do get punished right?
