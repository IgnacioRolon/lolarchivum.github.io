But in the same breath I am very disappointed. Yorick has been ignored for so damn long, that he should be at the top of your list. I do not understand why the easy path is being taken by working on champs that are decent (they have some flaws but they are still playable) instead of looking at the ONE SINGLE champ that all of Riot says is toxic and was a terrible mistake(gameplay wise).
