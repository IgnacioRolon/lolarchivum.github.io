That&#039;s more than most mages can get late game without baron/infernal dragon and the elixir. Maybe his free ap on hit isn&#039;t too balanced and he should be viewed just as any other assassin. Not to mention that at late game he had 1000 ap too and my mercs and maw did absolutely nothing because his ult took out 90% of my hp at full hp anyways. you can view me as an angry person who got stomped by a veigar, and sure he was fed but it came to the point where everyone had even items.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2016-06-03T02:15:21.143+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You mean Zed can have counters?
