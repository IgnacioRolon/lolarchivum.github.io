Once I get into the loading screen spot, the screen than proceeds to freeze and than won't allow me to open. I than attempt to alt tab and go back in but it still won't stop. I than proceed to close and attempt to reopen, but each time I do, the game is remade. This is becoming a constant issue where at first I thought it was a simple glitch, but it is now happening each time I want to play a simple game of draft or ranked. Because of this remaking issue where my team would remake simply since I was 'afk' I now have another leaver buster and I simply refuse to wait the time before five games before play a twenty minute game. I guess this is a report and me asking for you to remove the buster because it is undeserved and really annoying that the layout simply doesn't work and I'm being punished for it. Before you ask, I've also tried repairing my download and than reopening it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-05T02:27:57.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, we cannot remove or modify Leaverbuster penalties for any reason. Regardless of intent, your absence from the game negatively impacts everyone in the match. This is a big reason why all disconnections or treated equally and why we're unable to remove these low-priority queues.\n\nThe issue you described sounds like League stops responding after you transition to connecting to the gameserver (load screen). If this is true, then this is likely caused by an unstable connection to the gameservers, and is likely a direct result of issues along your route or with some local network configurations. I strongly recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure all local settings are good.\n\nLet me know if you observe any change from taking those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"sGhostys","date":"2016-12-08T20:40:29.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, but what happens if it doesn't work and it still ends up crashing?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-08T22:29:56.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then you can let me know and we'll troubleshoot this further.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Molniya","date":"2016-12-05T04:35:39.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing I can suggest if you are Win10 is to run in Win8 compatibility mode, right click your Icon and select troubleshoot compatibility then click test. Start up a custom game with yourself and then see if it works. Select next on the troubleshooting Icon to save your settings and you should be good.","replies":[]}]}
