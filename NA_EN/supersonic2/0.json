Realistically, it's just a lot easier to start with troubleshooting one individual connection so that we can either solve the problem or, if it does end up being a larger issue, get more information to help troubleshoot the network.","replies":[{"poster":"Gli","date":"2016-05-06T08:35:41.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I'm not sure if making my own unique post would be a better way to get Riot's attention, but I may have found out what some of the lag issue is? I was checking the boards because my ping had randomly increased from 73-74 up to high 90's, and I wasn't having the issue 12 hours ago when I played my last game, I ran speed tests and everything is fine. A couple posts on the boards were about Frontier DSL users experiencing lag issues, and one posted about some new routing? I'm not sure exactly if this is the issue, but http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/KdPWc1HA-ping-issues-after-69 is the main post I got the info from. Hopefully you guys can figure out what's going on and address the issue.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that I myself am a Frontier user, so the other post would be relevant towards my problem with ping as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chappies","date":"2016-05-05T21:59:18.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't experienced any packet loss nor ping spike yet it takes a while for league to respond to commands (right clicks,skills etc)","replies":[]},{"poster":"supersonic2","date":"2016-05-05T21:52:29.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YOU ARE PLATINUM 2!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dillon the Lion","date":"2016-05-06T06:05:44.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am also experiencing A LOT of ping spikes, and I don't believe my end is responsible.
