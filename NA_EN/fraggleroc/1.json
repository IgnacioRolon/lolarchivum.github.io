Playing Co-op vs AI with 4 bots (usually) to farm these boring missions efficiently. \n\nYou can say it is my choice to do these missions. But think about it... Outside of ranked games, this is pretty much the only activity u can do to earn free skins (if u don't wanna pay for stuff). Devs should know that players will always pick the route with least resistance/effort... Apart from the game modes, ARAMs and ARURFs... \n\nIt's sad that bots are still not eradicated... there's still nothing much to do outside of ranked games... AFTER 8 LONG YEARS. \n\nThanks for the fish, Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2019-02-15T05:04:52.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am just playing for fun now.
