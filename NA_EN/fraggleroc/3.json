Seeing as though {{item:3303}} exists, I'd say riot had support in mind for them. Especially zyra more than brand. The way her passive works just screams support.

Tanks should be safe and strong bc they can't carry.  The ultimate reward - carrying, should carry a lot of risk.  Hence, tanks should have less risk, which means good laning.  Strong laning should be a direct counter to about all assassins, as assassins aren't only designed to carry but are also designed to snowball.  Those rewards equate to extreme high levels or risk.  If they do not, assassins override the building blocks of the game and start to erode the meta.  Why play marksmen if assassin carries harder, earlier, and cheaper?  Why play strong split push if an assassin can regularly get strong fast and take that option away?  Why play a mage and wait to get one-shot ulted before an assassin even finishes an item?
