Heavy Tanks and Tank Supports are not rewarded according to their contribution to the team based on the current system. A Heavy Tank may get a poor rating and KDA even though he may be an integral contributor of the win for their team. This may not be reflected on the rating score. These guys are shoved by the system, not get the rating they deserved.","replies":[{"poster":"Fraggleroc","date":"2016-03-07T15:07:35.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there r many ways to win a game.

If I'm having that much of an impact then im bound to be getting 3-4 assists per team fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valderis Vandala","date":"2016-03-07T08:27:14.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that would suck, if it worked that way, luckily it doesn't so you don't have to worry about it.","replies":[]}]}
