Except there is a game mode from which u can't do bans. That folks want to indulge in mindlessly playing the game sometimes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-04-02T10:39:15.197+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok.

And that it should be addressed? \n\nDo u know what is the average ban rate across the board when u exclude these champions?\n\nIf I was Riot, these are the champions I would nerf into the ground and then access what changes it brought to the game.\n\nYes, I'm a simple man. I'm not a Math man or some Statistics guy. I stare at some Statistics in the face and can only come up with the most simple solution that appeals to my common sense. That is what I am- A simple man with simple solutions.

Pro players who think they are privy to some special wisdom or knowledge that the majority do not possess- Would it be possible that it's simply because they lack the empathy to think in the shoes of the common player?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
