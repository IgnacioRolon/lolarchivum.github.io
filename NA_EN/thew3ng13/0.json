If so, i guess I can accept the punishment and try to reform i guess. But if you don&#039;t think this is ban worthy, as I do, to flame these bastards who purposefully ruin everyone&#039;s game, I might just quit because I think this system is legitimately broken then. \r\n\r\nYou aren&#039;t going to ever get rid of flame in a game like this, and I see people who say much worse things than this on a daily basis in the game who largely won&#039;t face repercussions.\r\n\r\nI just don&#039;t see how people can stand playing this game when shit like this happens without any visible repercussions to the actual troll of the game, and why does Riot care more about what people say than what they actually do? You can mute chat and pings and solve that problem easily, but trolling is actually impossible to avoid, and is a lot more negative for people than someone calling you a %%%%%% on the internet or something.\r\n\r\nBtw the support was in a series, and purposefully wouldn&#039;t surrender or let us open up a lane to push. \r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nTheW3ng13: mmk\r\nTheW3ng13: ill ward his blue\r\nTheW3ng13: just play man\r\nTheW3ng13: play it out\r\nTheW3ng13: no big deal\r\nTheW3ng13: we can still win easy\r\nTheW3ng13: to help them\r\nTheW3ng13: ?????????????\r\nTheW3ng13: third time\r\nTheW3ng13: hes been here\r\nTheW3ng13: trolling in her own series\r\nTheW3ng13: fucking child\r\nTheW3ng13: no you are fucking stupid\r\nTheW3ng13: taking her shit\r\nTheW3ng13: thinking you are helping\r\nTheW3ng13: instead\r\nTheW3ng13: of actually pushign through a shit ad\r\nTheW3ng13: that everyone has to deal with at some poitn\r\nTheW3ng13: fucking child\r\nTheW3ng13: thats you\r\nTheW3ng13: i have zero respect for people like you\r\nTheW3ng13: who just fucking give up\r\nTheW3ng13: the instant something doesnt go right\r\nTheW3ng13: yes\r\nTheW3ng13: you fuckign did\r\nTheW3ng13: dipshit\r\nTheW3ng13: GAVE UP ON BOT?!?!?!?!@\r\nTheW3ng13: fucking dumbass\r\nTheW3ng13: &quot;im not going bot&quot;\r\nTheW3ng13: even though its my role\r\nTheW3ng13: you just gonne take creeps\r\nTheW3ng13: and xp\r\nTheW3ng13: from another lane\r\nTheW3ng13: fuckign that lane over\r\nTheW3ng13: cuz this game is over\r\nTheW3ng13: and xin was able to camp top\r\nTheW3ng13: since bot turret was gone at fucking 5 mins\r\nTheW3ng13: thanks to you\r\nTheW3ng13: dipshit\r\nTheW3ng13: 9x zyra please\r\nTheW3ng13: wont mean anything\r\nTheW3ng13: at all\r\nTheW3ng13: since everyone here sees the fucking obvious\r\nTheW3ng13: that you legit trolling\r\nTheW3ng13: ff at 15 pls\r\nTheW3ng13: no\r\nTheW3ng13: then zyra wont get banned\r\nTheW3ng13: we have to 9x\r\nTheW3ng13: cuz you fucking ruined the whole game\r\nTheW3ng13: retard\r\nTheW3ng13: god ur such a fucking idio\r\nTheW3ng13: why no ff\r\nTheW3ng13: ffs\r\nTheW3ng13: can we open\r\nTheW3ng13: zyra\r\nTheW3ng13: i willing to bet so much money\r\nTheW3ng13: open mid\r\nTheW3ng13: if you can kill zyra\r\nTheW3ng13: dont contest\r\nTheW3ng13: end this shit\r\nTheW3ng13: please report zyra\r\nTheW3ng13: 99% sure she is not letting us surrender now\r\nTheW3ng13: zyra is responsible for losing ahri the lane\r\nTheW3ng13: and bot tower at 5 minutes\r\nTheW3ng13: im not stopping you\r\nTheW3ng13: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\nTheW3ng13: actual trashbag\r\nTheW3ng13: end pls\r\nTheW3ng13: say yes she cant stop us now\r\nTheW3ng13: bg\r\nPost-Game\r\nTheW3ng13: game was over the instant zyra went mid\r\nTheW3ng13: please\r\nTheW3ng13: 9x\r\nTheW3ng13: this fucknig bastard\r\nTheW3ng13: what a child\r\nTheW3ng13: lmfao\r\nTheW3ng13: the game\r\nTheW3ng13: didnt matter\r\nTheW3ng13: like why are you saying stats\r\nTheW3ng13: that were boosted\r\nTheW3ng13: from us fucking around\r\nTheW3ng13: and trying to let them end\r\nTheW3ng13: dipshit\r\nTheW3ng13: god you are legit retarded\r\nTheW3ng13: actually\r\nTheW3ng13: a fucking child","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2018-05-23T04:18:34.783+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":">I got banned 14 days flaming a support--\n\nNo need to continue after that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-05-23T04:06:05.408+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, you deserve it.

This is the internet, you aren't going to solve the issue of flaming with a flat ban for anyone who does this, that way players just abuse the system by reporting someone who they don't agree with.\n\nI don't have a recent history of flaming people, either, this kind of came from nowhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-05-23T04:16:56.347+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're not them nor are they you.\nDoesn't matter what they say or do, what you do is your own responsibility.

Any frustration exhibited by the players most affected by the situation is going to be the only thing exhibited to the system, which seemingly only looks at the chat logs to determine who is the guilty party.\n\nThis system treats the symptoms, not the underlying issue of having a team-based game with no actual accountability.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-05-23T05:16:23.774+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot bans toxic players because they don't want them here.

You won't get a notification for chat punishments that are result from your reports, and you have no way of knowing if they can still chat or not after you aren't in a match with them. (And even chat punished people still have some chat use allowed). Thus there is no way for you to know if they got chat punishment or not. Only they and Riot knows that.\n\nJust like the Zombie Gerbil tells you, you are punished for your deeds. They are punished for theirs. Everyone is responsible for his own behavior only and is punished for that only. So, do not retaliate.
