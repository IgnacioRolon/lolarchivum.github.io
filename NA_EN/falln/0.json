Popular champions get tons of skins while other&#039;s are left out to dry. For example, Orianna. Orianna has gotten two skins significantly recent: Heartseeker Orianna and Darkstar Orianna. Xerath got his last skin 2-3 years ago. Xerath doesn&#039;t even have any chromas. I understand not giving skins to almost useless champion&#039;s( old ww, old yorick, urgot), but why Xerath. He is a mechanically advanced champ, but riot seems to be ignoring him. I saw a concept yesterday for a Darkstar Xerath, which would be awsome, but we know riot won&#039;t do that. I just want to see more skins for a variety of champ&#039;s (or at least chromas) instead of focusing on popularity. I know someone will end up saying it&#039;s a business move, and yes I know they need to make money. Can we give unpopular champions some skins also Riot? I&#039;m sorry but two Orianna skins in such a short time pissed me off. Like almost none of my main champions have gotten skins as recent as Orianna has gotten both of hers.","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-06-06T17:47:00.400+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait the sand skin was 2-3 years ago how I thought it was last year the fuck is with my memory","replies":[{"poster":"Danjeng","date":"2017-06-07T06:14:29.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summoner's Rift is a deadly portal which sucks in your sense of time if you invest too heavily in it.\n\nI still think Ekko was just released last year but it's been two ~~someone please help me i have been trapped for years my life is slipping away i said i would quit in season 5 but im still here and spend my nights browsing boards~~","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-06-06T18:43:07.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guardians of the Sand was released around when Azir, the Shurima Event, and the Lore Retcon all happened.

While absorbing as much light around him (An example to make this possible with particle effects would be to add some sort of light drain visual on his passive empowered basic attacks) he feeds off a portion of what he absorbs and he stores the rest of the light. This pure light energy that is stored is then discharged through xeraths abilities.\n\nTo me the coolest part about this skin idea is the very clear distinction between darkness and light. You will be able to work with 2 very distinct colour schemes in 1 champ, opening up the possibility of making the particle effects not only look epic but also make them pop hard. Even if this might be too difficult or too much work on a medium popularity champ like xerath the idea of having a dark skin on xerath would be epic. Something black, purple or even grey maybe, its something he doesnt have yet and very easy to explain the colour scheme from the point of view of xeraths previous skins. (I mean Infernal=Red, Nature=Green, Tech=Pink/reddish, Nomad/sand=Gold, so all the skins have an elemental feature thus darkness/void makes sense for xerath).\n\nI hope that you could do something with this, or that you just enjoy picturing the idea (If someone like this feel free to use the idea to make something from it, just make sure you let me see it :))\n\nCheers,\n\nMagey McMageFace","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2017-06-06T17:47:10.879+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have Battlecast and GotS Xerath and I do love both of those skins\n\nBut I will say this: Xerath has potential for much higher quality skins and I want to see those.
