April 14th 2016, I submitted a ticket to riot for serious FPS drops (10-15 FPS), and extremely distorted in game sound. There were no solutions until the next patch. Unfortunately I think Mac users will see the same thing this year. Patch 7.7 was released and pretty much ruins the game for anyone on Mac. In game, the client will freeze the frame if the mouse is not actively moving. This makes recalling, spectating, running to lane, and just playing in general quite difficult. Various posts have been made on the forums, and Riot's solutions simply do not work. They recommend disabling the trackpad and mouse shake, and also disabling the hot corners feature. These settings were all already disabled for me in patch 7.6, and the game ran flawlessly. After I patched my client for 7.7, the flaws began to show and my game experience was essentially destroyed. I sure hope Riot cares enough to update the game and fix this issue before the next patch.\r\n\r\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Venom1576","date":"2017-04-10T04:42:37.708+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've run into the same exact issue today.

Are you running any gaming mouse software at all like Razr Synapse? If so there could be some setting in there that isn't interacting with league very smoothly causing those freeze frames. \n\nIf that's not the case, hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can take a closer look at what might be happening!","replies":[{"poster":"Bunksy","date":"2017-04-11T03:17:45.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am using gaming mouse software, and it worked fine in previous patch. The mouse does not effect the freezing. I have also already submitted a ticket, and your solution is to play in windowed, which would mean I have to play the game at a very low resolution to fit my screen. So I can either botch my game quality or play a freezing version. Sucks","replies":[{"poster":"Venom1576","date":"2017-04-14T20:35:15.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was given the same suggestion/solution to play Windowed or bordered. It makes the screen and resolution so much worse and is just less comfortable to play in. I really hope they fix this for Mac users because it's ridiculous that we can't play in full screen due to a software incompatibility/bug. It makes playing the game not fun anymore.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Armalice","date":"2017-04-13T19:17:00.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same situation here. if someone finds a solution please post it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"fredformc","date":"2017-04-09T08:10:14.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same","replies":[]}]}
