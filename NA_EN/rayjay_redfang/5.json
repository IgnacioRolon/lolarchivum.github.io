A screen said that I had unlocked a capsule. I'm not sure if I leveled up or not. I checked the loot and there was no capsule, and I restarted and there was no capsule still.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-03T21:54:10.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm looking over your missions and match history/XP gains for the past 4 days or so, and it looks like the last time you leveled up was on Nov 30th and that capsule you were able to open and got some Sion and Anivia champ shards. So far it seems like you did get those and were able to open them, so I wonder if that popup might have been delayed from an earlier capsule/chest?\n\nLemme know if you think of something I might have missed that could have given you a chest and I can check that out too, but right now it seems like it lines up!","replies":[{"poster":"Rayjay Redfang","date":"2017-12-03T23:01:21.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, I got those two shards a long while ago. I just got a notification after a game that I got a capsule, and my loot tab kept having a glowing dot by it. I could have sworn that I got notifications for both prior capsules though. I'm pretty sure it wasn't from leveling up.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-03T23:55:44.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did go ahead and double check to see if maybe you could have seen a notification about a mastery chest, but it doesn't look like that was activated by your own S or a teammates either in the past few days. Unless I'm missing something specific you can point out for me, it looks like you've gotten/opened everything you should have at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"Rayjay Redfang","date":"2017-12-05T03:34:01.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely wasn't a chest. I think I received a notification of a capsule after a custom game as well, but I don't remember it I got one or not. I just didn't know if it was a bug, false notification, or what happened.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
