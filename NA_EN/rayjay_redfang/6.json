However, I've been experiencing 200-300 ping continuously every game. I considered the fact that it was my internet connection. \n\nWhen switching over to the legacy client, I experienced a ping of less than 100 continuously. \n\nSo, I played a game on the newer client and had an average of 300 ping. For another game immediately after, I switched to the old client and experienced the ping of less than 100. The mode I was playing is ARAM, if that matters.\n\nMy question is, is the larger ping a bug, or something fixable, and if it is, how is it fixable.\nThanks.\n\n*Edit: Also, should I move this to the Client Discussion?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-07T00:36:33.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Beta Client doesn't change anything after you've entered game, so I'm not sure these two are directly related. If you're still experiencing this, I'd say that there are instabilities in your connection to the servers, which causes latency (ping) fluctuations. I recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure all your local network settings are compatible with League.\n\nLet me know if you experience latency issues after taking those steps.","replies":[]}]}
