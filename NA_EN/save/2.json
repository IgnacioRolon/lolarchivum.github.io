Her damage is crazy I will agree on but she lacks any sort of mobility so it's just a trade off of damage for mobility. Extremely easy to gank and if put behind she really just falls in an abyss until (if) she can make it to late with full build. I just don't see the hate she is getting from Riot when there are many other champions that are played more that needs nerfs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KcbmsQxbPL","date":"2016-09-14T18:15:16.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, check out my boards post [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/jtUIq7Oj-anivia-feedback-from-a-seasoned-anivia-main) \n\nIn short offer a compromise, I think the Q changes are completely fair and would offer more of a reward for hitting her skill shot, but the R changes are completely bogus. My proposal is that instead of having the E do full dmg when R is at full size (increasing her burst window by 3 seconds) it should do full dmg when R is at half size or after 1.5 seconds, fairly increasing her burst window by a maximum of 1.5 seconds, also making it impossible to E->R someone by adding a 1.5 second delay between R->E. My full post/article [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/jtUIq7Oj-anivia-feedback-from-a-seasoned-anivia-main) will go over everything in depth.\n\nAnivia is already a high skill cap champion with a pretty low play/ban rate. That deserves some acknowledgement as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Radnar the bold","date":"2016-09-09T19:46:30.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito hates team valor","replies":[]},{"poster":"jaymc1130","date":"2016-09-09T19:32:03.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No. Fuck articuno.
