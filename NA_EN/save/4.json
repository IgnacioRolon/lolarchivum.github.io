It was such a disappointment! If you watch Sven's ultis carefully, you'll see that he missed a lot of his shots, ones that really didn't look like he should have missed. Almost looked like he threw the game. They were some horrible ultis. Don't know for sure if he'd have swayed the team fights in their favor if he'd been better, but it really looked like he wasn't terribly comfortable on that champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Save","date":"2016-10-04T23:12:08.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, unfortunately I did watch that game. G2's performance in that game was poor and it has been in the whole tournament. Losing game 1 to the #2 NA team must've hit their confidence hard and getting that win off ROX would've been a great rebound win for them. ROX hasn't looked sharp at all either and for G2 to throw that game and let ROX eventually get back into it and win is just extremely awful to watch honestly. I'm not a fan of G2 in any way but I would've liked to see at least SOME form of competitive play and dominance they showed in EU this season but nah they are just flat out trash in this tournament. 0-3 and pretty much eliminated from making it to knockouts unless a miracle occurs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yxgl222HaX","date":"2016-10-03T02:30:39.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clg isnt a wildcard, what they are is a team who is MABYE 4th best in NA and even thats kinda shaky but they got in on points. I would have personally much rather had IMT go instead, although i do believe imt would not have done much worse due to how predictable and sort of stale adrian is on support. Better teams like the koreans would pick appart their playstyle pretty easily. That said its not just G2. I like watching eu lcs almost as much as na mostly due to unicorns, but i have to admit they look like crap this year. None of their teams are doing anything that looks remotely good and even when they do win, it still looks bad","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2016-10-03T02:12:48.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"G2 in 2016 lul","replies":[]},{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2016-10-03T02:12:10.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's like beating a dead horse with a stick","replies":[]}]}
