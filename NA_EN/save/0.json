Aside from that, I had leftover Riot Points and used them on a Hextech Key. I then used that key to unlock one of my chests and pulled an Aurelion Sol champion shard, that was added to my already 2 other champion shards and I decided to re-roll them into a champion permanently. I got Aatrox from this......\n\nAATROX.\n\nI always hear about how you can submit a ticket to get a champion removed off of your account but I was never sure if it was confirmed. With that I'm asking either where I can submit this or if any Rioter reads this they can do it for me.\n\n**I am not asking for any refund I just don't want him on my account lol me and my friends have joked about him for years as a funny and bad champion (our own opinion, which is also a popular one) and I know I just don't have to use him whenever I return to playing but seeing the Darkin Blade on my champion list just is eh... i'll pass lol\n\nhttp://imgur.com/eM8KoDN","replies":[{"poster":"Save","date":"2016-07-26T03:03:02.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".............\nI'm gonna be pissed if i end up getting a mystery gift from a friend and it results in an Aatrox skin","replies":[]},{"poster":"Save","date":"2016-07-16T04:58:53.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump\n\nhello??????????","replies":[]},{"poster":"Save","date":"2016-07-08T20:08:02.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]}]}
