Was she just not viable in any meta or was she just not “fun”? Is she just an easy champion for new players to learn the game? I want these questions answered.\n\nThe current state of Sona just isn’t viable anywhere in high tier anymore. She feels like half a champion and impacts less of a game. Her mechanics are degraded and can’t even match with any of the current support champions. I sometimes feel bad for my adc that has to lane with me or even for my entire team. It just feels like a complete place holder.\n\nBesides the time of Sona X Ezreal bot lane Season 3, Sona has been shunned and nerfed in many cases. Her Q range, her Base stats, Q damage, Powercord damage, Crescendo damage, AP ratios, and we can go on and on, but it was quite tolerable and understanding. She was sometimes a lot stronger than the opponent adc if played smart, I don't deny it.\n\nI have played about 500 games of the “new-sona” and it is about time I go to my pharmacy school so I won’t be playing anymore. But during the 500 games, I was quite depressed and felt pointless as Sona. I have tested so many different runes and masteries and most of them have failed to match the current supports. And quite frankly a lot of players (including me) are just not satisfied compared to the old Sona.\n\nSona used to be a complete glass-cannon poke and was rewarding for risking her life. The poke on her Q was satisfactory and was able to control lane with decent pokes. If she was out of position Thresh, Leona or even Braum would punish her. But the reworked Sona does not provide any poke damage. I have tried several different builds (runes/masteries/items) on Sona to actually deal damage in lane. But it was an utter failure. She deals less damage and is even more squisher because of her stat nerf. She isn’t rewarding for what she is made for.\n\nHow often do people utilize Sona’s Q passive? Hardly ever. It seems the extra ON-HIT MAGIC DAMAGE: 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 (+ 25% AP) (+10 / 20 / 40) isn’t utilized much at all. Do high tier adc utlize them? No. Mostly because they are busy csing. It needs 100% syncro for the adc to be poking with Sona’s passive which is near impossible. The on-hit magic damage doesn’t even do enough damage anyways. It is so minimal that people rarely recognize it.\n\nAnother issue I want to address is what was the point of giving a passive on her ult?\n“Passive: Each rank of Crescendo grants Sona increased power in her auras. Song of Celerity also gains increased power in Sona's self buff.+10/20/40 Magic Damage for Hymn of Valor+10/20/40 shield power for Aria of Perseverance +2/4/6% Movement Speed for Song of Celerity”\n\nI don’t understand why a support would need a passive on her ult. A sustained support in lane would take about 7~9min to reach level 6 and even much longer for level 11. It takes way too long for her to utilize the passives. It makes no sense for a support to have increased passives for QWE on her ult. And also the buffs are so minimal it is near impossible to see the difference by the time she does reach level 6. A buff like this would suit a solo laner. Look at syndra’s passive for example. It's not exactly the same but it comes close to it.\n\nTranscendent\nSpells gain extra effects at max rank.\nDark Sphere: Deals 15% bonus damage to champions.\nForce of Will: Increases the slowing duration by 33%.\nScatter the Weak: Spell width increased by 50%.\nUnleashed Power: Range increased by 75.\n\nThese buffs are clearly for solo laners that can level up fast and utilize it.\n\nBasically all I feel about this rework is a complete nerf, she hasn’t been played in ANY professional game. She isn't even considered to be played in competitive scene. I want to do more number crunching and talk more about missing mechanics but I just want to get this out there first.\n(Crescendo Ult width nerfed, E does not buff minions, Auto-attack Q Powercord sometimes does not proc damage with the Q passive and so many more)\n\nI have said it in previous post that Sona does not need a rework because she doesn't get played anyways with such low numbers on her stats. But now I won't be playing Sona anymore because I am a complete nuisance to the team if I play Solo Q.\n\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4636828\n\nI just miss the days of the old Sona that used to give the team a small-baron buff. The Sona that actually influenced the team for what she was made for. Losing all that just made her useless. I think her play rate has gone more down after the rework than before.(not like she was viable than other supports anyways. Thresh, Leona, Braum, Nami)\n\nI just want to accomplish one thing out of this post if anything. I want Fearless to answer my questions.","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2014-09-14T22:18:58.184+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":18,"body":"Sona was reworked in large part because A) Her sustain in lane was annoying to deal with early and B) her power in the mid and late game was largely invisible other than her ultimate. \n\nRiot screwed up her Q. Fearless may have been in charge of communicating the rework to us but that doesn't mean that he was the deciding factor on every single change made to her, they probably have at least two or three designers working on each rework, and the lead designer (Meddler) most likely has to sign off on final changes before they go live. Her Q is undoubtedly worse, but the problem with a champion like Sona is that her power has to be balanced around the absolute best case scenario, which is all five champions benefitting from her aura at the same time. The problem with that is that it gives Sona a uniquely horrible disadvantage when one of her allies disconnects from a game, a large portion of her potential power goes out the window, while her general power is already weakened to compensate for her enormous potential power.\n\nThat said, the real issue isn't with her rework, it's with the players. Players focus so hard on the laning phase that they fail to appreciate the power that Sona actually has. Sona is a late-game support, a champion who is designed to have a terrible early game but an amazing team fight power. This seems counter productive, after all supports were originally so popular BECAUSE of their strong early game, and they were given no gold because their scalings were terrible and therefore they needed no late game. \n\nSo, how do players react when Riot emphasizes this aspect of her? They decry that she has worse poking power (not relevant, she's a heal/utility support, not a bully), that her shield duration is too short (a team shield shouldn't be up for more than a second anyway, but at least this rework gave Riot an excuse to nerf Thresh's team shield), that her auras require her to be too close to the team (a champion with no skill shots and auto targeting has difficulty positioning? Damn, I wish I could just close my eyes and slam my face against the keyboard like I used to!) and etc. \n\nHere's the thing: Your adcs are going to be jerks to you. That's just a shift in our meta. Everyone is so thirsty these days because Riot has made snowballing harder. ADCs feel like they don't have enough power in the mid game just by farming up a storm anymore, so they have to \"win\" lane instead of just \"not lose\" lane now. IGNORE THEM. As a support, your job is to help THE TEAM. Marksmen will always find a reason to whine at you, just take the abuse or mute until level 10 when the team fights start, and then coordinate with your top laner and jungler to use your Ardent Censer buff and your team shield to CRUSH your enemies. \n\nDon't worry about lane phase. Stay back, level W first and keep your wards up and just focus on surviving. Don't poke, don't go all-in, don't try and get your marksman kills because the risk is way too high for the reward. Instead, make it clear to your carry that you are going to play passive and if you're smart and you ward properly you won't feed. Then you get into mid game and you just outscale the enemy support too hard.","replies":[{"poster":"MAZZ1M0","date":"2014-09-18T01:49:52.206+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Sona was reworked in large part because A) Her sustain in lane was annoying to deal with early and B) her power in the mid and late game was largely invisible other than her ultimate. \n>etc.\n\nThe problem with that is that the laning phase is foundation for the rest of the game. It's when snowballing begins, it's when leads are had, it's when people win lanes and get turret advantages, etc. The laning phase is crucial, especially for an adc who *needs* the support. If Sona can't perform as well or better than other supports, bot lane is a liability. Also, the W CD is horrendous as is her mana. She can't sustain for crap. If you have two Lucian's -one paired with Lulu, one paired with Sona, the Lulu side will win. Sona's all-in is crap compared to other supports. CC is non-existent till 6 -by that time their adc will have a lead on yours. The speed steroid is *still* outclassed by the likes of Karma and Lulu. And the sustain, the thing that made Sona Sona, pre-rework is garbage now. Don't even get me started on what happens if you put a Zyra, Blitzcrank, Thresh, Morgana, or Braum in there. Sona is easily the worst support out there right now because of that.\n\nAnd yes, a support is a team support, not an adc support. But Sona basically removes reason for an adc to exist as she only does well further into the game. The adc won't be carrying from the usual snowball they're supposed to get (and arguably need) early-on to stay relevant. Adc's are temperamental and item-dependent by nature. There is also the weight you place on the jungler and possibly other lanes that need him.\n\nIf you play against the turret, there will come a point when they start getting aggressive. At that point, your jungler has to watch bot specifically because there a Sona there, period. To get to the golden mid-lategame where Sona becomes useful, you need to keep the enemy adc and sup from outfarming or diving with their jungler. That puts too much pressure on half your team when it isn't necessarily the case with other supports unless your opponents are just bad players. Bad players, okay, but post-rework Sona isn't made for laning phase anyway. So it's a constant unless the enemy team is worse. Skill level affects her success in laning phase more than anything and again like everything about her rework she can benefit from, it's a factor that's outside of her control.\n\nYes, you are the team's support. Your methodology may work well for you, but the rework is fundamentally flawed.\n\nThe real question the op should be asking Riot is \"What do *you* want the game to look like?\" Because apparently, the game we like, isn't the game they want us to have. They've been making a lot of big changes lately and the game is incredibly different from what it even was back when the season started. They clearly don't like the state of the game, but that means all of the things we like, and all of the things we believe make LoL LoL, are flawed in their eyes and they seem unwilling to compromise on some big things -Sona being one of them. There's over a dozen threads (half of them big ones) on the topic of the Sona rework, most of them being negative. Obviously there are people who like it, but based on the sheer numbers of views, posts, and threadstarts, It's hard to imagine her being a success. Her winrate has dropped. Her pickrate had steadily declined. And Riot has gone dark on all Sona discussion since the last major Sona thread two weeks ago. Now threads are popping up about Soraka everywhere. *That* is a rework. I don't even use her and holy crap, that is an *overhaul*.\n\nTLDR: Reworks don't take our opinions into consideration. Riot is like Janus in terms of hearing us out. Sona works for some, but the rework is undoubtedly a failure. Please refer to lolking if you'd like trends.","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2014-09-18T14:19:00.549+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":13,"body":"Yeah, and here we get to the issue. The problem that I'm trying to address and that no one seems to be willing to listen:\n\nRiot ISN'T going to change her. They acknowledge her win rate is dropping. They acknowledge her pick rate isn't leveling out. They respond by increasing the range on her Q, a \"usability\" buff, but no numbers changes and no attempt to make her laning phase easier. \n\nThis happened with Olaf's rework. It happened with Karma's rework. It's happening right now with Cassieopeia. Riot reworks a champion and lets them sit. They assume that players will adjust to the rework after a while and ignore all the initial cries of anger because they ALWAYS happen.\n\nThe only time our shouting has ever changed a big rework was the Lee Sin rework. That's it. So here you guys are, making thread after thread like you said and Fearless is ignoring almost all of them. So I'm coming in trying to explain how the rework works and in what ways it is a positive experience for the Sona player and everyone attacks me because Sona is undoubtedly worse. Of course she is. But you have to learn to play what she is now or just stop playing, because all of your cries are going to fall on deaf ears. Sona is not more special or more popular than Olaf, and neither are Sona's players.","replies":[{"poster":"Fearless","date":"2014-09-19T20:46:20.332+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":17,"body":"Hopping in here because I feel like I'm being spoken for, and what's being said here isn't accurate. \n\nThe Q change is a bug fix.

The range change was never intended, and a range change is one of the last things we'd do to change Sona, as range changes are very disruptive.\n\nThere's something very ironic about this, given auras man.\n\nBut to be serious, the primary offender of \"THINGS FEEL AWFUL\" when it comes to that is Sona's E aura.  350 range is UNACCEPTABLE for a team MS buff unless it's on par with someone like Zilean's. At least with old Sona, though you would rarely get a speed buff greater than 20% lategame (which is equal to the latter half of Sivir's ult), the massive range on it meant you could make a lot of plays with your front line.\n\nNew E is...terrible for playmaking outside of reaction dodging skillshots.  Lulu's W not only has superior base values and range, it scales harder and at max rank speeds up for a far longer duration.\n\nI would MUCH prefer E having better base values and scaling, and cooldown reduced to 10 seconds (at max rank at minimum) IN EXCHANGE for making the ability cost more mana.  You talk about meaningful decisions.  Sona's current E just...feels really outclassed, and later in the game after you build Crucible and possibly Censer, your mana costs are just trivialized anyway.  Athenes had to be nerfed because we needed SOME windows where Ziggs had to actually wait and stop spamming QWE off cooldown.  An increased mana cost on E in exchange for just flat out buffing its other values would easily promote more meaningful decisions on Sona.\n\nIn general I sometimes wonder if people forget that mana costs are a legitimate balance tool.

Players focus so hard on the laning phase that they fail to appreciate the power that Sona actually has. Sona is a late-game support, a champion who is designed to have a terrible early game but an amazing team fight power. This seems counter productive, after all supports were originally so popular BECAUSE of their strong early game, and they were given no gold because their scalings were terrible and therefore they needed no late game. \"\n\nI don't believe the Old-Sona was ever in a position where her early game was weak. With the right mechanics and actual poking time, Sona would be able to control lane competitively with any of the current supports. Which means, dodging thresh hook while poking, trading damage output with nami's ebb and flow, focusing on the right target if leona does an all in, ext. Shouldn't players be punished if they shoot out spells randomly and miss their target? \n\nShe does truely shine very well in late game but her early game was never the issue. We actually have to worry about lane phase in this meta. The adc would be down by cs which leads to snowball. Having to actually be passive vs several of these aggressive supports makes Sona and your adc in a pinch. The lane phase control gets completely out of hand and the snowball lane phase starts. The old sona was able to punish bad supports and transition lane phase into team phase.","replies":[{"poster":"MakersF","date":"2014-09-15T13:16:15.269+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"Sona is a late game support, and needs to be played like janna. Max W in lane, then E or Q depending on the matchup. Saying Sona is useless is like saying Siver is without a ulti: the mobility she offers to the team is incredible, the ability to engage/disegage is really good, can block/heal the pocke and support a full pocke comp.\nThe Q feels a bit unrewarding, I give you that, but the rest of the kit is ok for me. I usually pick her with ummobile champs (she's really good with kog imho).\n\nIs she better than thresh/morgana/braum? Obviously not! The point is: are they too OP, or should all support be as them? Thresh can move an ally (that means negating kills and obj controll), braum can stop any dmg, morgana can send you afk for 3 seconds. This is not even with the ulties. And don't get me started on the hook, the shield and the passive of those 3.\nThe point is that there are a few outliers that offers so much in comparison that no one can stand with them, but taken out those 3, I think Sona is completely comparable to the rest of the supports. If you know how to play her (and the OP keeps talking about poking in lane, and that's definitely NOT how I think she should be played)\n\nMy idea is that the worst culprit is that if you want to make an utility build with some AP you don't have items as a support.\nI build medallion, crucible, sightstone, boots, then I'd like some AP and armor/MR, but there is no item to do that. Should I build a zhonya? Doesn't make sense? I can not build penetration because utility doesn't scale with penetration. I can not build Morello because I overcap CDR. Twin shadows is not bad but is not good eighter. The ryals passive is not triggered by my Q on-hit dmg, so again it would waste a passive. Deathcap as only AP item is not cost efficient, to DFG i should be premade with my team in order to know who and when use the active. The itemization for AP utility support is the problem here IMHO.","replies":[{"poster":"Sonaring","date":"2014-09-15T19:54:29.708+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the contrary, Janna is not a late game champion.

You have a kit that is basically Q for poke, W for heal and E for movement speed buff. Powercord gives you extra damage, debuff, slow. So are you not suppose to poke in lane?

Zyra and Karma go ham, poking no stop. But that's what they should do. Sona, like Janna, is a more passive champ. Max W in lane to heal the poke (and I'm sure you understand that if you poke, but the dmg is healed, it's like you didn't poke). I'm not saing that Sona should never poke, but that's not her role. It's like picking vayne for poking. Are you picking vayne for poking? No, you pick Caitlyn.\nThe poke of Sona comes from the empowered AA of you adc in a small skirmish, and the power comes from the repositioning potential and the healing in lane. And the Q dmg is so low that I believe it's pretty dumb to max it and try to do dmg. If you want to ham poke, pick something else.\n\nAnd again, you shouldn't pick her randomly. Like Janna, she is good with a hard scaling ADC, so that you make up for the passive lane. I guess you don't like a Leona that keeps all-ining when you are vayne level 2. There are ADC that in lane are really happy if they only get to farm, as they outscale the opponent. Sona is there for them. Janna too. Sona + Lucian doesn't make sense: he is already mobile, is really agressive. Sona with kog is a much more better combo.\n\nJanna is DEFINITELY a mid-late game champ, since her ult is way more usefull in team fights that in lane, as it scales perfectly with the more people you have around, the shield can cover all the strategic targets, the slow allows for escape/engage from/on isolated targets. And I agree with you, Janna in soloQ can be really hard to pull off because you need to be syncronized with the ADC, but if you are, she's a great peeler.\n\nIf you are master you probably know this game a lot better than me, but all the Sona I saw played extremely aggressive early, obviously losing trades because her kit is not for being agressive early, and then having to play behind all game. If you play her a bit safer, aim to cover the poke and let the ADC farm, by mid-late game you are a great asset. If by chance you get ahead, she can really become a more active champ, but still you need 5-6-7 levels at least.\n\nBut just to reiterate: SHE COULD DEFINITELY USE A Q BUFF.

I think they wanted to open Sona up for more counterplay, which they have successfully done. But I think there has always been an easy way to deal with sona - land any amount of hard cc on her and she can be instantly deleted. \n\nI don't understand how a late game scaling support is an ideal mechanic for the role. As a support, I want to be useful to my team with utility, poke, or sustain at all times. I feel like my team is handicapped until I can put 3 points into crescendo and get max CDR. \n\nIf you played a lot of Sona before the rework,and after, then you can definitely feel a big difference in power level in regard to her early game. To be honest, playing Sona does not feel good  during the laning phase. One reason for this is that Q's damage is not significant enough to justify putting yourself in a vulnerable position. Considering that heal is weaker (unless you've maxed it first, in which case poke is redundant anyways), has a longer CD, and higher mana cost - you cannot afford to make any mistakes . The reward just isn't high enough to compensate for how risky it is. \n\nThe worst experience is trying to play Sona when your team is behind. If you are down in levels, you feel absolutely useless to your team. Your poke is nonexistant, your heal is negligible, and your speed boost is just a waste of mana. All you can do is hope to land a god-like ult on high priority targets and give your team a chance to  burst them down.\n\nI'm fine with giving Sona counterplay. Her longer cooldowns and higher mana costs, and the removal of her invisible stats effectively curb a lot of Sona's power throughout the game. After all those nerfs, I don't see how she still needed significant reductions to her other numbers as well. \n\nWith that said, I have still managed to have success with Sona in certain situations and she's still my favorite champion in the League, but I'm sad to say I find myself playing Nami, Morgana, and Thresh a lot more now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShadowGlaive213","date":"2014-09-15T12:58:44.496+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"iirc Riot claimed she was reworked because she's not \"satisfying to play.\" But what is satisfying to a player depends on their individual values and what they actually know about the champ really =X I think the fact that her pick/win rate appears to have remained pretty much unchanged, if not lower than before, indicates that the rework has not really changed Sona's state in relation to the overall player base.
