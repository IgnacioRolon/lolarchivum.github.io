They report players for off-meta or a different playstyle/build than expected.  It introduces a lot of false flags into the system that Riot has to filter out to avoid banning innocent players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2019-01-08T04:19:03.887+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DespicableCee,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=f7iLOT8a,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-08T00:16:17.895+0000)\n>\n> I understand where your perspective is , but thats him being political and dodging the question.

Unfortunately riot doesn't actually care about context, as the support agents are only there to confirm whether or not the toxicity bot properly flagged something toxic. Riot then suggest you take the context to the community, (as in, this forum) where the community and moderators will then /disregard/ literally all of the context, look at the chat logs, and say, \"Yep, that chat log was toxic.\"\n\nWhich is stupid. \n\nPicture this, you're playing a game of league with all chat disabled in a 1v1 match. You say in team chat, \"Kys.\"\n\nYour chatlog for that game (as it would be shown from your reform card) would simply be,\n<Player> : Kys\n\nEven though that chat log is from a game where you were literally talking to yourself and no-one else could see it, that's all that would be on the chat log.\n\nNow naturally you'd never get reported for that as the other player didn't see anything to report, but had they arbitrarily reported you in that situation,  BlitzcrankBot would've spotted that \"kys\" post game in the chat log, and you'd receive a harsh penalty (because inciting self harm is a huge no-no to riot)\n\nSo, why was that strange example important? Perspective. \n\nImagine now you're in a ranked game at literally any level of ranked play, and after receiving 20 minutes of uncontested flame from your team, you simply say, \"Kys\"\n\nOnce again, your post game chat log as seen from your player reform card would look like the following:\n<Player>: Kys\n\nInterestingly enough, BOTH of these cases would be treated with equally harsh punishment, because simply put: Riot doesn't care about context, and neither does the community.
