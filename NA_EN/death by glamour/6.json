Any form of CC will interrupt it and you can simply walk out of it. If she is that close to you to actually hit you with an E and you have no escapes nor CC and have little to no armor? then it's your own fault.\n\nAhri is so dependent on hitting you with a charm to do anything that if you dodge her charm she will think twice before going all in. Could she be toned down slightly? yes, is she as \"OP/broken\" as you make her sound? no!\n\nRyze has that one moment of strength, do not engage him if he has his passive up, get away from him until he loses his passive, that's when it's time to all in him and ruin his day.

Neither of these stats mean anything alone or together.\n\n> Ahri does have an overloaded kit or do you deny this?\n\nNext to who? Annie? Ryze? She has a very mobile kit, but that's her playstyle: the kiting, playful, in-and-out mage. If she bursts you down without her charm, it's because she's fed, not because she's overloaded. Her one(1) single-target CC cements her as an assassin, and has a decent cooldown on it. Her sustain....eh, I don't really care either way about it. It's not especially strong until she does tons of damage, and then you have other problems.\n\n> Mf does have do much damage on her ult does she no?\n\nWell, yeah. That's also her thing: The big wombo AoE showstopper. It's absurd right now because crit is in every item she could possibly want, and is also broken. If that got changed, she'd probably be fine, not that I can test that out.","replies":[{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2016-01-20T04:37:38.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ahri isnt an assasin... shes an aoe caster nowadays\n\nShe is mobile\nAoe damage\nWave clear\nSustain\nCC\n\nBasically everything you want as a midlaner with little to no drawbacks.","replies":[{"poster":"Sachabot","date":"2016-01-20T04:46:24.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Xerath is an AoE caster.

That's pretty poor area-of-effect casting.\n\nOh, and she's an easy repeat gank, because most of her mobility is tied up in her ultimate. Despite her waveclear and sustain, if she doesn't get kills or force you out the best she can do is stay even in CS, which probably works better for you.
