Rengar and khazix do the same thing they always did, except now they get punished less and are given way more tools. meanwhile zed and talon are just terrible while being the same feast or famine champs. Riot took away zeds dmg in favor of a gimic, and they took talons burst, range, reliabillity and speed in exchange for &quot;parkour&quot;, out of combat slow moving mobility with a long animation and telegraphed. now u actually need a competent team to carry even if ur 15/2. meanwhile katarina can spam her long range instant blink with daggers the same hitbox as a damn fizz ult in lane. the tier list is basically as follows\r\ngod(for assassins theyre pretty bad rn) katarina,lb rengar,khazix\r\ngarbage gutted and left to die-akali,talon,zed,fizz,shaco\r\nnow im not one to cry with no reasoning so let me explain why each champ is where they are\r\n\r\ngood-\r\nkhazix- hes not too differant but has more options and a stronger isolated q, thats the problem his burst window wasnt affected while the others were\r\nlb- just overtuned, drop her numbers\r\nrengar-they redisributed power, but in the end hes still gonna oneshot u if hes even or fed\r\nkatarina- is just broken, not even that hard to play they need to make it so her bad plays can be punished , wich is hard with her blinking everywhere\r\n\r\nbad-akali- ult has no dmg and a cd, all she can do is comnbo ur half hp bar and die with no sticking power\r\ntalon- gutted too much of him in favor of gimmicky mobility, expecting a champion like him to hit a 125 range aa on a carry in a teamfight AFTER UV used ue abilities is absurd, he doesnt have his blink, or fasw w and r, he can be bursted by the time his ult blades come back with no burst himself\r\nzed- zed was already pretty bad after the hail of s6 nerfs, but useable. now after lethality, plus ult and w changes hes in the shitter\r\nfizz just falls off early , is ult relaint, and has the talon problem where his burst window extended, plus requiring an aa after using ur small range gap closers to do any burst is sad\r\nah shaco. they removed his only build that let him do his job, even if u go full ad ur q plus backstab will only do so much dmg(akali problem) then he has to land 2 more backstabs to be able to kill u, and they dont scale with crit so ur always gonna do no dmg, now hes some wierd nich korean on hit bruiser, hes no assassin\r\n\r\ndid i mention lee sin can assassinate somemone more reliably than talon early and doesnt fall off as early\r\n\r\nchanges id propose\r\n- make duskblade aa have extended range, make a new item with fixed range bonus range aa passive so adcs would nerf themselves by trying to abuse it,(lethalty and ad stats ofc)\r\n-revert the talon rework or  just fix all his bugs, give him 2 quality of life buffs and one minor buff\r\n-akali- give her ult more dmg and give her sticking power anywhere so she lives long enough to get another ult on the adc\r\n-zed-im no zedplayer ,i know he gradually got worse as time continued from season 3 so gl fixing him if u care enough to\r\nfizz- redisribute some of his ult power to his q or w\r\n- katarina- exchange base dmg on daggers for scaling or something and maybe add a indicator to where she es so people who react fast enough can actially land a skillshot on her\r\nshaco- make him scale like caitlyn, make his e stronger( turn into a skillshot if thats what it takes for better dmg and or cc)\r\nlb- nerf her passives base dmg\r\nrengat- idk but im pretty sure the free crit is the problem, maybe u can take that off and give his q crit chance(that might sound retarded i dont play rengar so i wouldnt know)\r\nkhazix- give him some counterplay 1v1 and make him actually be able to do something without isolation","replies":[{"poster":"Poske","date":"2017-01-02T13:27:34.991+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"And what makes you an expert?\n\nKha zix- Nothing really fking changed none evolves R.
