while other champs burst faster. here are a few examples annie ult oneshots faster than talon or zed ever will. ive gotten killed in 2 saas by vayne qcrits fast than the time it takes for talons w to even reach the intial range before the return delay and SHES A DAMN ADC u know what else kills people faster than asassins? viegar pressing r and killing u with one ability at 65 percent hp doing 17k dmg much effort and delays. now assassins burst is as fast as mages like ori and brand, but without the utility. might as well play a fighter fiver like vi or fiora who can still kill the adc but has cc utility and much more","replies":[{"poster":"XPtoken","date":"2017-08-13T09:09:06.193+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":4,"body":"Thing is people and Riot need to get through their head that the whole purpose for an assassin is to assassinate(clue's in the name assholes) so when you nerf the fuck out of every assassin because adc mains refuse to ward, stay with their team, and play safe then what's the point of having an assassin role in the game anyway??\n\nLike we get outdamaged by nearly everyone that isn't a support(and even those are hard to kill with the amount of shield items and buffs Riot showers them with).\n\nTanks can just slap us around til we're dead, a mage can cc us then burst us from range faster than we ever could do to him, and an adc can auto us twice for a free kill, so what's the point of us existing in the game when Riot takes away our purpose to exist?\n\nPeople complained about how there was no counterplay to assassins when wards, positioning, and shit like GA existed but tell me what the fuck is the counterplay to an adc bursting you down with 2 autos?
