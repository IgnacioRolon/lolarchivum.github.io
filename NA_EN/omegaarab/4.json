My first main was akali and i instantly loved her , ai i always seek asassin characters in games. i found i can do insane burst dmg, and learned the game and the role more and more playing with all my free time everyday.than i found talon around lvl 25, and hes always been my favorite champion. but now after a year of hiatus ive found myself unable to break free of bronze. i cn always get out of b5 but thts about it. i have basic understanding of items  and such, but i still build and play ..well..bronze  and i want to get better really bad. ik it took a while but here are my questions\r\n1.i despise cc with a passion, and understand why its in the game but dont at the same time. i feel like cc just detroys play making potential and lacks counterplay, and have no idea what to do when im the strongest in the team but always gets cced oneshot before i can do anything\r\n2.y is there untargetability? i feel like it unfair that such a powerful mechanic can be so champion specific, copletely negates every other champion.something like it i feel more balnced is yasuos wall\r\n3.im an assassin main, and i love every role but bot,  and is eager to play any lane or jg but bot,y? because u hate begin susceptible alon, when theres a hundred and one ways to get oneshot. i hate being unabkle to 1v1 a sngle player in the game, muchless all of them. i feel helpless when a yi ,fizz ,zed,tlon, even fucking xin and trundle jumps on me, like theres nothing i can do but  rely on my team\r\n4.anywasy for the most importnat question- how do i climb as a shaco main?ii usually start a big buufff, go immeidateky to the opposing buff, get first blood, do a small camp gank farm up some more, rush tiamat and usally pick up the jg item last.i feel like the longer the game goes on the more my chance of victor plummets","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2016-07-26T06:41:52.396+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're a S5 skill level player in bronze, it's going to be a slow frustrating grind, but on average you will have a >50% win rate and get there.\n\nJust focus on yourself and play what you're best at. Some games it'll be enough, some it won't, but that's league.\n\nI'm somewhat confused why you grumble about untargetability and then mention being a shaco main, given he has that mechanic with his ult.","replies":[{"poster":"omegaarab","date":"2016-07-26T07:43:06.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if itll give u an idea of my skill lvl this is a game play froom amonth ago that gt me demoted, id di fine as jg but every singlel lane fed i cry","replies":[{"poster":"omegaarab","date":"2016-07-26T07:45:52.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnFUyYnKWrM","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"omegaarab","date":"2016-07-26T07:37:10.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idc if its on an ultimate, its an ultimate i dont mind ekko but fizz and yi with his cd that can go to like 3 secs","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Warmanreaper","date":"2016-07-26T06:47:27.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For CC , if you hate it so much buy a Merc. schimitar , it's QSS removes most forms of CC and it gives u magic resist + life steal, 2. there's no answer for , just outplay / kite , 3. Shaco is a really aggresive champion , gank alot and get fed to the point where u can 2-3 shot people and then help push the lanes.\n\nAs for the bot problem , Every adc has a different play style , I main ADC and I main Draven which is the most aggresive hyper carry in the game , You just play people you feel are right and for the one shot , you kite them , try not to get hit or if you're hit , make sure you out trade them and do not die.","replies":[{"poster":"omegaarab","date":"2016-07-26T07:38:25.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i cnt attack move ick, and im not ktitng a an akali, or reacting before a stealth assassin kills me. alos my reaxtion tme and mechaical skill isnt enough to press qss when i gettcced meaningfully,i always forget i have it","replies":[]}]}]}
