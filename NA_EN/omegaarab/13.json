GGWP. \n\njust saying i never played janna before last partch but i just picked her up in ranked eushed ardent and slapped some shields on yas and twitch, and maybe a ult and redmeption fi ti got a little TOO dangerous and barely lost. heck i can shamelessly say thats the only reason im in promos to gold for the first time right now, all tho i got 2 afkers and inters in the first 2 games so i have to win 3 in a row if i want to taste victory(bad luck and now not they had a bad game legit top goes 0/10 and mid just ragequits) but i think it says alot that duskblade has to have enough dmg to make anyone a burst champ, just so assassins themselves can function and kill people(in the perect situation that is) not to mention adcs spike at ie and zeal item, and reach late game as soon as said zeal item is completed and maybe they have a vamp scepter or last whisper","replies":[]}
