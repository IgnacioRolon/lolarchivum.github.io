Because i can only take the melee creeps and barely since theres a lux or ori just wating to throw thier endless barage of spells and aas across the lane, poking me out before lvl 5. i take orrupting potion, but i lose all in potential and it only helps me surivie till i can ask for a pre 6 gank to get me rolling. (to be noted once i get a single kill or 2 its dually gg, or after i get lvl 6 i can usually start a snowball with no problem, but lvl 1-4 are my weak spot","replies":[{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2016-11-02T03:32:39.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm usually okay with missing a few CS to keep my HP up. Once I hit level 3-4, I start farming more, and if they ever throw an ability at me, I can dodge it by Eing on to them for a quick trade. After I win the trade (because they were down an important ability), they start to respect me more. Of course, this doesn't work for every matchup.\n\nI like longsword start, just so I can afford to be a bit more aggressive.","replies":[{"poster":"omegaarab","date":"2016-11-02T03:54:31.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats a smart move, i think ill try it, tho i usually do so anyways with corrupting and it doesnt work as well","replies":[]}]}]}
