But i should have known my echanics and game knowledge was still bronze when id fail miserably while playing other lanes and champs. Today i was facing a gold vayne in ranked since it was preseason, and i was playing akali wich i was still newly fammiliarinzg with since talon was banned. while i won lane, vayne snowballed insanley and i couldnt touch her. she had a malzhar and skarner constantly protecting her, and everytime id try to burst her id get hit with malzh ult and die instantly. eventually she got so fed even i couldnt 1v1 and shes oneshot my team mates one by one. i truly felt powerless in this situation it ws one of the first games i ever played where there was actually a back and front line. i want to relearn most of the game now and be a better player. im one of thise players that dont know the health and dmg numbers i be like maybe this is enough to kill this champ and go for it; while im usually accurate or close i reallzie when watching streamers its an unefficient way.  now i want to learn 2 champs i can play for top id and jg, where one for each is an assassiny champ i can go around roaming and bursting adcs, while the other may be cc or control. i currently have 6000ip so im fresh to buy a new champ. any advice or coaching that can be offered would be appreciated","replies":[]}
