There would be a point in the game where my game would freeze up and the only way to solve the problem is to force close League Of Legends. This is most likely not a problem with FPS or Ping as I'm always at a stable 60fps and also a stable 20ms.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-09T21:40:44.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's run a quick repair first to make sure that the game files are all working properly. If that doesn't help we can dig a little further into why that happens, but is it happening at any specific time of the game or is it completely random?","replies":[{"poster":"Spicii","date":"2017-10-11T02:02:53.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently I've tried a quick repair, the Hextech repair tool, and clean installing the game. This would seem to only work for a few games and then the freezing would come back inevitably. This happens randomly through-out a game but it's usually only once in a game.\n\n(This problem started occurring around 2-3 patches ago)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-11T02:51:58.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm definitely sounds like the game is working properly if you clean reinstall and everything works fine. This is most likely more related to your pc drivers and such. Make sure you update your graphics drivers if this started 2-3 patches ago, as your pc may not be able to properly work with the game files without those updated drivers.
