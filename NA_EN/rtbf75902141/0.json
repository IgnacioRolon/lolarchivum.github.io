Mordekaiser hasn&#039;t received a re-work in a while from what I can see and his ult is still very &quot;point-and-click.&quot; It makes him a lot less fun to play as a champ generally and can also make him very difficult to outplay if he gets ahead. \r\n\r\nMy request/feedback is: make Mord&#039;s ult a skill shot.","replies":[{"poster":"A treespook nest","date":"2018-04-27T22:42:04.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Morde's ult needs to be changed.

Ok.  Sure. Never mind the fact at rank 1 the entirety of its damage is negated by second wind or a health pot.  \n\nYou want it to be a skill shot. I want it to ground the target for the duration. Seems like a fair trade off.  \n__","replies":[]}]}
