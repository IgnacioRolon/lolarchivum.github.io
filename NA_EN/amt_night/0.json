For VFX, it seems that the cougar's \"q\" is plain. I barely notice whether I've hit an enemy or whether it's still activated in a fight. I was wondering if it'd be possible to maybe make her cougar's q vfx stand out. Maybe something like making the transform particles swirl around her body or paws as she activates her \"q.\" (This is specific feedback for Warring Kingdoms Nidalee)","replies":[]}]}]}
