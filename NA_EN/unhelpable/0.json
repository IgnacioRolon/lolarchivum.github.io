However, only recently did this demotion shielding icon appear. I did go on on a losing streak previous to the appearance of this icon (a few games at 0 lp), but I thought demotion shielding occurred immediately after entering a new tier/division. I was wondering how demotion shielding really worked, or what the conditions for it are. Also, at what point does this icon disappear? Currently at 59 lp does it really make sense to be shielded?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-13T17:29:23.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, you've played a ton of games in Ranked Solo to be shielded by it.  Per the [ranked play](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ) guide, moving up a division shields you for 3 games, and 10 for a tier before Master.  This looks like it's a visual display issue from what I can tell, so I recommend posting this over at the [bug report boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) so our QA can take a look.  Thanks for the heads up!","replies":[]}]}
