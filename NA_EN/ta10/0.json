I can play for a brief period by uninstalling the entire client and all league files and then reinstalling it but as soon as I close it after that, it returns back to the same error message whenever I try to re open it. \r\n\r\nAppreciate any help on a permanent fix. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-10T21:43:20.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's pretty weird that it happens every time you open the client. It sounds like your network has a hard time making that initial connection each time the client is launched, so let's make a few adjustments to those network settings to give it an easier time. Check out the steps on Port Forwarding and DNS listed in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and let me know if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"TA10","date":"2017-10-11T00:05:41.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply. I've changed the DNS as listed in the connection guide and it seems to have improved. I'll check out the port forwarding now and hopefully that will be the end of it. Thanks for your help and I'll let you know if it continues not to work after I've followed the guide.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-11T00:28:38.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sweetness!
