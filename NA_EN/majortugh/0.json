Garen is a tank, mowing down everything insight,and essentially is Demacia&#039;s Captain America. Hes pretty unwavering, steadfast, and disciplined in both body and mind. Being apartvof the duantless guard is no easy feat and if his taunts to Darius mean anything, he may have faced off against Noxus&#039;s resident War monger himself and lived.  Also is able to go toe to toe with the Noxian assassin and de facto successor Katarina (if Swain doesnt take power). Meanwhile, Yasuo is a measure badass Ronnin wishing to regain his honor for crimes he didnt commit. Hes mastered the ancient wind technique of his ionian sword school and is practically unmatched in Ionian swordmanship. He soends his days on the run reluctantly killing those who try to hamper his quest for justice and regrettably has become a cynical drunkard. Regardless his feats of killing his brother Yone (possibly as skilled as Yasuo himself as I doubt the Ionian council would send a lesser swordsman after him) and embodies cold aloof indifference and apathy to everything around him. Rumor is Rivens his rival and the possible killer but this has yet to be confirmed. \n\nLocation: Fight takes places in a forested area similar to summoners rift. Think of Dark Root Basin from the Dark Souls series. Plenty of room to swing a Great Sword, but losts of obstacles and hazards that can be used for evasions and strategic maneuvers.\n\nRules:Both fighters are in peak condition. None of the combatants have any previous knowledge or prep time for the other.\n\nRound 1: Fight to incapacitation\n\nRound 2: Fight too the death\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nEdit: Based on the information, I'm leaning toward Garen. Intially i fel he had the edge but it seems like hes very well equipped. If anyone has any more analysis it would be greatly appreciated.

A new-growth forest would be significantly more problematic, but Yasuo's sword is still primarily suited to a cutting action, so it really isn't much of an advantage over Garen's.\n\nSummoner's Rift has dense tree cover though, indicating that it's likely in an old-growth forest, so Garen should be fine.\n\n------------------\n\nFrankly, this sort of fight isn't much about the weapons -- someone good with a sword can make it work in most environments, and both blades are primarily cutting edges of comparable length. Which means the advantage is likely Garen's, as, assuming they're both paragons of swordsmanship (which seems reasonable) the armor is a distinct advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-10-27T01:39:16.180+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well let’s first verify what sword Garen actually uses.

He’s using a war sword designed to attack anything, but not to be carried around town with. Assuming Yasuo isn’t demanind an unarmored honor duel. And he didn’t jump Garen while Garen was walking around with his civilian weapons (probably a longsword or rapier), Garen should always have the advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-10-27T12:56:42.458+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow you must be fun at parties. :P\n\nJk, I enjoyed that little analysis you did.

Yasuo is also using a sword that's longer than he is tall though. [Take a look.](https://i.imgur.com/xy5zZSn.jpg).
