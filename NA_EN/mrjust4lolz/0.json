I am sure many of you got screwed over by some person on their \"troll account\" or an account they may have obtained from someone and just chose some odd champion for a role to merely have their own fun at the expense of other player's fun and hard earned LP. I believe this is not fair and often enough players get away with their actions. Even when they are reported they merely r given a slap on the wrist if at all and cruise under radar till their next offense. Not to mention players here get apprehended or punished more for verbal actions and \"toxicity\" a.k. honesty as opposed to their actions in game from troll players and the like. Hence their should be a compensation system in place. After submitting a ticket that is valid and reviewed perhaps players can be given back after having something taken away from them. What do you think?","replies":[]}
