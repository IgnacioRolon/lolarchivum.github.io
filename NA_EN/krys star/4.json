Noticed summoners made noises when you selected them, played with them a bit in awe, then selected Flash + Heal. A dodge occurs, and I still have Flash + Heal selected below my Champions/Skins page, but on the left side it shows I have Smite + Heal. This confused me, as did my team mates, and I switched to Flash + Heal again just to double check. The left side remained Smite + Heal, but I figured maybe it was just a visual bug.\r\n\r\nMatch starts, and I still have Smite + Heal selected after all. This, in turn, causes two of my team mates to flame me and accuse me of being a troll, as well as the enemy team questioning if I was trolling. I wasn&#039;t, of course, match proceeds and I prove I&#039;m not trolling it was just an awful mistake and bug. I don&#039;t know if the dodge had anything to do with this, but switching summoners did not give me Heal + Flash as I had intended.\r\n\r\nRiot pls? :( Kateykhaos?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-20T01:15:53.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo Frozen Beauty,\n\nSorry for the delay on this - are you still having issues with this?","replies":[{"poster":"Krys Star","date":"2016-01-20T05:52:11.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it only happened once but it ruined that match for me.

This may explain a good percentage of the increase in game dodging over the past couple of days. many people who have this problem also are reporting no lag in the actual game (like myself, my ping only jumps between 69-78). It seems also that when banning or locking in if you do so in within the last 10 seconds, chances are you are gonna fail the lock in and forced to dodge. This is a problem because many players use the time to discuss strategy or champion bans. Is Riot aware of this issue? the notification i receive looks like this. http://imgur.com/ufVt5yv Also if i could get back the 9lp i lost to this bug that would be great. Lost time is lost time so I know I wont get that back, but if this issue gets fixed then I can actually play the game again so that would be enough for me.","replies":[]}]}
