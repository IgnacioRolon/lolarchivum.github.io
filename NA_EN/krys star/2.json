Oracle Lens, the Altered Sweeper, can be activated, which ends your passive prematurely without shooting a thorn out at all.\n\nRepro:\n1.) Die as Zyra\n2.) Activate Oracle Lens\n3.) Rise of the Thorns ends prematurely, without shooting a thorn out\n\nRiot KateyKhaos pls =(","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-02T18:32:00.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Frozen Sovereign, (I almost didn't recognize you with the name change :P)\n\nThanks for the report! (Yay for repro steps!)\n\nI caught up with champion team, and they're aware of the issue and are looking into it. For a bit more context, we don't consider this a major issue, as the combination of playing Zyra, activating passive and then using a sweeper isn't a super common case.","replies":[{"poster":"Krys Star","date":"2016-02-02T21:36:14.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thanks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Juggernaut628","date":"2016-02-02T02:37:45.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shouldn't be asking for KateyKhaos specifically as she works on skins I believe. But yes reporting bugs is good. And if she is the one who reads this she will forward it to the correct team as I'm sure any other Rioter would. Just know that KateyKhaos isn't on the gameplay team.","replies":[{"poster":"Krys Star","date":"2016-02-02T21:35:42.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I realize and am aware.
