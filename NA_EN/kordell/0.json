I was wondering if someone could test this for me so I know if it is just me or if this new update changed something and i'd appreciate if someone tested this for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-14T02:04:23.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're still working on ironing out some of the issues with those extra mouse buttons, and some players have been able to get it fixed by downgrading off of the Windows Creator update. If you're running the Creator update let's first try reverting to the stable windows build to see if that works. \n\nIf that's not making any difference, there might be an issue with your config files not saving properly. We can also try refreshing those to see if that does the trick as well.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
