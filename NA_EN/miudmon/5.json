I mean, why wouldn't you? It's a new champ that just got released. But hey, people are banning him every other game in dynamicQ draft. Oh, he's not banned? Nevermind you're not in the top 2 picks, someone else will pick it before you, be it your teammate or the enemy team. This happened WAY too often when Jhin was released and I'm sure it will happen again with Aurelion Sol. \nWhy do people even ban a new champion upon release?

Every surprise he could throw at you, every trick he could pull... the only way I see to learn about them is to face real live people playing him.

You are missing the point. In Team Builder you pick role, champ, and allies. It's superior, and had differences that applied to everyone. Your points don't apply to my original point, and never will. You claimed there were little differences, and I proved you wrong. You are now trying to make it about something else entirely that doesn't matter to begin with as people have different preferences, and reasons to play the role they want that ranges from how they feel, a new champ they bought, or maybe they want to play WITH a friend IN the same lane. There is no \"poison\" to pick for me personally I play all roles equally. Just because I am content with any role doesn't mean that others should be nor would that mean anything. That has nothing to do with this whatsoever. If you want a specific role for a specific reason, and a specific champ you get it. It's as simple as that. So people who play all roles can still prefer team builder especially if you want to duo bot lane with a friend as I pointed out already. You can't 100% guarantee you'll get placed with your duo bot in the current dynamic que. That point alone proves Team Builder was superior for champion select, and has many differences.\n\n3+4. Again. I said people can leave if they don't like team comp, and you can boot people who show signs of toxicity before the game even starts, and it had nothing to do with in-game toxicity unless you want to relate the signs of a toxic player in champ select which my point still holds true to it, and is correct. Champion select toxicity is rare? Perhaps based on your experiences that might hold true. Either way I have run into plenty of toxicity in champ select alone just because of the champs picked, and champions banned/not banned (Especially with new champs. 50/50 chance. You ban it someone complains. You don't ban it someone complains). So let's imagine that you don't want to play with a toxic player in dynamic que who is showing signs of toxicity before the game starts? Dodging the dynamic que gives a time penalty. If you also didn't like the champs you were with in Team Builder you could leave the team without breaking the que for everyone else with 0 penalties. This directly correlates to the toxic players who get toxic about the teammates champion picks. It's superior, and as my comment originally proved these were yet more differences. \n\n.5. End of season rewards, and baron santa icon are limited time rewards, and always have been. Those are an every year thing. Besides I already stated the icons were a difference, and you took it to \"We got them didn't we?\". So even if you somehow want to claim it's ad hoc fallacy even though it's not the point of that was that it was a difference between the modes. You want to claim the icons are ad hoc fallacy even though it doesn't apply to what I said at all. Sure. You can win that because that was just a spin-off topic because of something you said that had no reason to have been said to begin with. It literally doesn't matter either way but you should check to make sure you are applying it correctly because that's not ad hoc fallacy. Anyways the original point was that the icons are a difference. That was the point of number 5 from the start.\n\nHasty. I can see that. Nit-picky. In a way. Sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2016-03-31T09:36:16.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Slaven152,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RyO0ThtU,comment-id=0001000000030000000000000000,timestamp=2016-03-31T05:32:35.250+0000)\n>\n> 1+2. Again. You are missing the point. In Team Builder you pick role, champ, and allies. \n\nAnd that didn't matter.

Team Builder dodging didn't break the que, and re-enter the timed wait. It make's no sense, and works against your arguments. Dynamic que takes a long time to que up (There's plenty of posts BY RIOT about the long que times, and what they are doing to fix this). Once inside the que the banning, and champion picks all take a long time, and people dodge at the last second resetting this all. Team Builder did not have long setups, and if someone left you replaced that ONE player without having to reform the entire team. End of story there.\n> \n> I guess, like I said I've seen people roleswap and nobody minds.

One being a Game mode that was later made to be temporary that shouldn't have been, and the others being YEARLY events that are revisted. I'd be more than happy to play the mental gymnastics game but you need to actually use those terms correctly otherwise it doesn't apply to the argument. Not to mention this point literally doesn't matter as I stated. You wanted differences between the modes. I gave them to you. I'm done. You don't like Team Builder, and can't admit it had differences? You don't like that people want the mode back because it is superior? That's your problem. I've wasted enough time here.

I can live with that.  As for bans, there are over 100 champs to play.  If one or two bans ruins everything for you, I don't know what else to say.  \n\nTeam Builder was a concept test for designing a new queue that would solve lane choice toxicity.  The queue times for it, however,  were way too long.  Adding a secondary role fixed that (mostly) and thus we ended up with the new queue system.  While I can appreciate that you liked TB, I imagine that you're in a fairly small minority and that Riot didn't feel it was worth the resources maintaining. \n\nDon't take that personally either.  It's not that they didn't give a crap about you, it's just that they felt they could provide a better experience to more people devoting resources elsewhere.

Either way, the fact that people didn't use it tells you everything you need to know.  However long you want to say the queues were, they were too long.  The disparity in role popularity was the problem and giving an option for 2 roles was the solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Wordse","date":"2016-03-23T21:47:03.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess my point of contention is by being forced to play two roles when I don't get one I am comfortable in I tend to do bad and then my entire team has a bad experience.

Your best/favorite role perhaps is the best/favorite role of a lot of other people, thus you can't always get exactly what you want.

The idea that you can only play one role or you feed is a pretty immature.  Your lack of success is self-imposed.  Nothing's stopping you from getting better at  or enjoying different roles but you.  I doubt very much that Riot's particularly interested in devoting resources to the stubborn, anti-social \"Mid or feed\" mentality you're demonstrating.   It IS a team game, after all, and I think Riot's more interested in focusing on a the team experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Wordse","date":"2016-04-05T04:10:30.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you are misinterpreting what I mean I am not saying if I don't get my role I will purposefully feed.

Whats stopping me from getting better is a system in place that promotes generalization be good at everything.

I don;t think of my self as antisocial I like playing with people I don;t like being unable to help my team. I think that having a place where people can go and have the atmosphere just be less competitive is a good thing.\n\nLike its crazy to say Riot is going to lose a huge chunk of its fans over team builder or Dynamic Queue. But it would be nice if they put some thought to those of us looking for a different experience. Hell I played bots fro level 1-30 and it was great but even I who am terrible at the game want some difficulty which I think is the human element. But in a game where I can't really assist the team outside of not leaving tower range  is not a good spot for me to be in TB alleviated that a bit cause top I just had to keep that other player busy or push and run as soon as they saw that I was pushing. But other lanes have a little more going on and I cannot simply rely on my team (usually my friends) to win  but I do impact the game be being a body. Others roles require a step up in intricacy and awareness that ends up badly not matter how hard I try.\n\nI guess my thing is you cannot expect everyone to be good at the game? (THIS NEXT BIT IS A TANGETN) I mostly think this because of Ranked and how skewed that is. Like I get rewarding winning but I think its pretty balls to people who can't get better. Also in that vein won't the game reach a point where like the best people at least up gold get shit but you got the bottom feeders like me that will never get there. So why not offer the option to buy the exclusive stuff (at least the skins) at a ludicrous price point? That way it is available, It still gives you the incentive to climb the ladder, and Riot can make some money off of offering a cool thing.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2016-03-24T17:18:52.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.
