It's about how much control someone has over their fate. If a character is 100% in control of how a lane goes if played well, then that implies it doesn't even matter what their opponent does to defeat them, and it sucks to be that opponent and know that I can play as well as I want and it doesn't even matter all that much.\n\nIt's just a barrier based on how well the person can play their champion. These champions are commonly ones that people claim are overloaded.

No one plays skarner, so no one knows how strong he is at what point in the game nor how to play against him.  Ive gotten many MANY kills because some poor uninformed fool thought he could pick a fight with me and win.  Now im not saying he isn't a little strong, but these nerfs are waaayyy too hard and in the wrong place.  Skarner is a juggernaut now, that means late game fukr of shits.  If you try to fight skarner in his relic late game, you deserve to get mauled by 160% attack speed. You guys should Love Tap and I do mean love TAP, his early game a bit so he cant bully out every jungler while still scaling into a monster.\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA1/43063556?champion=72&map=1","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-11-26T22:58:42.514+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"Win rate, especially just average win rate, is not the sole reason, but it is a data point that we can have conversations around pretty well.\n\nKeep in mind, we're likely to just hit his ult AD ratio at this point, so we do see this as a love tap mostly.

I just thought the spire nerf was misguided and counter-productive to the new philosophy you guys are pushing of highlighting strengths and identity.  If you want to make the spires being a power point his schtick, don't over smack them with nerfs.  You will just leave a champion with a crappy identity without any power to it.\n\nHowever from what you are saying is that, the spire changes aren't likely going through.  This raises the question of why they are on the PBE, I get the testing ground and such but one day on the PBE with how unpopular skarner is doesnt seem like nearly enough time to gauge impact. Despite that you have already made decided the nerfs werent going through.  I've realized you only occasionally, if at all, look at the PBE for balance so why are the changes there?  Before you say that you guys listen to the balance concerns of the PBE, the fact that reworked Skarner and Graves made it to live without being touched is clear evidence that you don't at least not with major changes that matter.  Skarner and Graves were ripping people apart on the PBE and everyone knew they were horribly broken.  Not proud to admit it, but the first thing I did when I saw you hadnt nerfed skarner with the juggernaut update was abuse him b4 people realized he was dumb which was only 2 games.  You don't really listen to the PBE, so what data are these changes gathering?\n\nAlso: Did you guys do some ninja nonsense to Illaoi before her deployment?  I remember playing as and against her on the PBE, her E was a pass through skillshot and her ult+tentacles didnt do nearly the absolute nonsense damage im seeing on live.  Hell in the champion spotlight scarizard says it stops at the first champion hit, you guys did something.\n\nThanks for the response btw","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-11-27T21:59:02.869+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi, thanks for the post.\n\n> You don't really listen to the PBE, so what data are these changes gathering?\n\nI get that it may feel this way, but it's not really true. Skarner and Graves are examples of where we didn't tune back given PBE feedback, and they came back too strong. However, there are also cases like Kog'Maw (where PBE people said he would be broken, we nerfed him a little bit, and he came out too weak), so it can be hit or miss.\n\nThere's also quite a bit to be gathered just from players' reaction to changes on sites like Surrender@20 or Reddit. At the end of the day we will sometimes (and maybe more often than not) have some unpopular decisions to make, but it's hardly because we don't care about people's opinions. It's a matter of balancing that perspective against what we think is right for the game state.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-11-28T01:25:03.844+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I get that it may feel this way, but it's not really true.

Its just that the environment of having shorter games is not conducive to the success of a late game hyper carry. Once the snowballing and short game issues are addressed hes going to come back into his own even if you had left him alone.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-11-28T20:24:14.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that's taking it too far. Yeah, he's hurt a good deal by the shorter games, but his performance dropped way more than that of any other hypercarry in the game, and he wasn't even winning half of the games that actually did go really late. At some point, we have to conclude that he really is just weak and needs some help irrespective of the game environment.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
