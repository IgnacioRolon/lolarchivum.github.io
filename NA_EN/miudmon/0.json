As much as I understand that it is popular to build him tanky and that his Q, E, and R give him great ability to escape and catch opponents I often find when playing Gragas mid and top 330 base movespeed is just too slow for a melee 'tank/fighter' who usually have about 335-350. Maybe his W should give him a quick burst of movespeed on cast like Viktor's Q (though not as powerful)?

I wanted a tanky but high damage jungler when hitting his E. He just got nerf after nerf and isn't worth it anymore. Even a Cinderhulk Elise (or Runic Echoes into tanky) does his job better. He also just lacks damage in general and I think nerfing the W, a melee skill, isn't the way to go.
