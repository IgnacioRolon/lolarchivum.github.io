So I would like the to add a stacking passive to defiled.\nPassive each kill give you a stack, max 5, each stack gives 1,2,3,4,5 per cent spell vamp\nActive when toggle on defiled he gets bonus % of ability power to all abilities you toggle off defile. You then loose all stacks and you loose all stacks at the end of death defied.\n\nI think this would be a nice revamp to an old champ and would allow him to return to the pro seen. I would help to prevent early game magic resist shut down and help give karthus back some damage. I would increase his skill cap suitability and would not make him over powered. with max stacks and having defiled on you can have 55%/75% Q 55% E and 75% R This could be redused to only 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 Q. I know the ult seems op but late game if it doesn't kill someone life steel usually negate the damage.\n\nI would also like to see 2,4,6,8,5 spellvamp per-stack and 1,2,3,4,5% bonus ap to all ablities. Since you only gain stackes when defile is toggled off and loos all stacks when toggled from on to off, this max for a fun mechanic.\n\nMax stack 200ap change lv 1-5\nWall 5%=10 10%=20 15%=30 25%=50\nDefile 25%=50 30%=60 35%=70 40%=80 45%=90\nLay waist 35%=70 40%=80 45%=90 50%=10 55%=110\nLay Waist single target and ult 65%=130 70%=140 75%=150 80%=160 85%=170\n\nMax stack 1070ap change from lv 1-5\nWall 5%=535 10%=107 15%=160 25%=267\nDefile 25%=267 30%=321 35%=375 40%=428 45%=482\nLay waist 35%=375 40%=428 45%=482 50%=535 55%=588\nLay waist single target and ult 65%=695 70%=749 75%=803 80%=856 85%=909\n%ap could be change to .5,1,2,3,4\n\nOr they could add DFG's effect to his wall of pain and give it an area of affect that if an enemy champion would dash, flash, or tp in the area of the wall excluding ult they would instantly get teleported in to the wall and stunned for 1.5 sec.\n\nSimilar to how has a wall that stops the dash this one redirects you in to the wall giving Karthus more depth. I could even be renamed Torn Vale of Eternity\n\nYou know he is warping the space between life and death thus DFG's effect on wall would make seance as would the warping effects on dashes and tp's.\nthey could even change his Q's so they deal double damage large jungle mobs and champs as aoe damage and triple damage to single target large jungle mobs and champions.\nNOW\nLay Waste\nCost: 20/26/32/38/44 Mana\nRange: 875\nKarthus unleashes a delayed blast at a location, dealing damage to nearby enemies.\nCreates a delayed blast at Karthus' cursor position. After 0.5 seconds, deals 40/60/80/100/120 (+30% Ability Power) magic damage to each nearby enemy, this deals double damage if it hits only a single unit.\n\nPatched\n\n40/60/80/100/120 (+30% Ability Power) aoe minions\n\n80/120/160/200/240 (+60% Ability Power) single minion and aoe to champs / large jungle mobs\n\n120/180/240/300/360 (+90% Ability Power) single target champion and large jungle mobs.\n\nJust in case you wanted a suggested buff.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=blackcat1300,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HxMseV6N,comment-id=0032,timestamp=2016-03-27T17:30:38.324+0000)\n>\n> Another idea is make it so that wall of pain is renamed torn vale of eternity. \n> \n> and give it am area around it that make it so that if you would dash flash tp ect, in the area you get stuck in the wall and stunned for .75-1 second.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2016-03-21T23:24:28.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"revert the wall nerf and let the Q explode a bit more faster.","replies":[]}]}
