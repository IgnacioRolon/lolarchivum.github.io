They pose a lose-lose scenario for the opponent, to either be zoned away from their actions, or to take damage that becomes hard to escape from while also being hard to detect. People notice giant fireballs headed their way, and the chunk it takes out of your health. It's much much harder to detect and respond to the pool of poison by your feet.  One of the best example I've seen is DoTA 2's Venomancer. He has two AOE DoT abilities, one with a slow, and his ultimate that is one of the most damaging in the game. However, the damage of the slowing one is extremely weak, to where regeneration can almost mitigate it at early levels.

That's not how that works. You can still beat aggressive players since no matter what you build to make Poison Cass hurt, you still were able to spam E since after her rework, her E's cost was INCREASED and the damage is the exact same as it was before. Literally, Cass's rework made her passive useful and reduced the damage her poisons did. That's... That's it. And it was more of a ratio change than bases. W was reduced since in a prolonged team fight, having anyone stand in it at all meant certain death and her Q had an 80% ratio and 280ish base on top of a .5s CD .55 ratio E. \n\nOld Cass had one downside at it was a downside that made her near pointless to play and that was reliability. Champions who have 0 reliability are never played. Katarina is a good example. When she's at her prime, she's destroying teams, but put in a CC or two that's easy to land and Kat loses reliability and is now worthless. Same goes for Yasuo in a certain way. No knock ups and his reliability is subpar and he can't keep up, but you give him the reliable knock up and his power is through the roof. Cass got her reliability in the form of a new passive and her Q getting a more static delay rate, allowing her to be able to hit the targets often and go in for the kill. They removed her kill potential on her Fishing Tool so to speak. She's a snake. A Snake Mage. Snakes wait for the right time then go in for the kill, they don't spit poison, walk away, spit some more, walk away, spit more, walk away... No. The spitting Cobra spits and then goes for the kill and Cass is a prime example of such a snake. \n\nCass works on aggressive players just like she always has since if they jump at her, she pops Archangel's and R and rips people apart. Before, she'd R, toss her Q and W and walk away without even thinking about it. No thoughts at all. There was no real counterplay since QSS didn't have a 2s Cd like her Q did. Her new kit has weaknesses and takes time to ramp up to her real power rather than throwing a Q at any point in the game and watching the enemy's health go from 100 to 0 without putting forth any kind of effort let alone using any mana.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-10-15T19:03:35.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zair Umbras,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=17r4m2H3,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-10-15T13:51:23.822+0000)\n>\n> False.

Come back when you have a more educated opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-10-15T19:40:00.129+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I want to know which part I said was wrong. Old Morde was nothing but a stats check with almost no meaningful interaction since he's manaless, has no skillshots to play around, gains defense for building offense, had no CC or gap closer to use, and simply pushes and pushes all day until a jungler came to stop him. If you weren't one of the champions that could overpower Morde in a 1v1 scenario, you were resigned to farming under your tower the entire game and simply walked away if he ever tried to fight you. Old Morde was one of the worst designed champions Riot ever created and had to  be intentionally kept undertuned because of how bad his design was. \n\nAnd please, your metal man? You haven't played 1 ranked game of him the past 2 seasons. That's pretty suspicious for a Morde enthusiast. Face it, Old Morde was a toxic champion purely by design and the only reason his toxicity hasn't been blatantly obvious the past couple of years was because Riot intentionally kept him weak. Old Morde is gone and good riddance; Let him stay in the trash where he belongs with old Sion, Old Gangplank, and (soon to be) Old Poppy.","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2015-10-16T00:59:49.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Old Morde was one of the worst designed champions Riot ever created and had to be intentionally kept undertuned because of how bad his design was.\n\nSounds like Yasuo with his awful crit passive.\n\n>And please, your metal man?

Morde will be infinitely more healthy as a bot laner than he could ever be as a solo laner if Riot insists on keeping his no CC, no gap closer kit. Solo lane Morde was nothing more than a stat check. Morde either won or lost the 1v1 with no room to outplay mechanically from either side because his kit is so underloaded and braindead. Going botlane gives his teammates opportunities to make plays for him and adds another lane opponent against him that he's forced to interact with. Clearly new Morde is overtuned atm and some of his design concepts may need to change but the idea of Morde as a bot lane carry and not a solo laner is infinitely better and gives infinitely more room to balance that his solo laning days ever did. Solo lane Morde was either broken or terrible. Bot lane Morde at least has a chance of striking balance.","replies":[{"poster":"JediSenpaiNP","date":"2015-10-15T21:55:09.266+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Solo lane Morde was nothing more than a stat check.\"\n\nAight, so here's the thing. Solo lane morde liked numbers, but even without buffed up stats, he could be valued as a pusher. bot lane morde is not. Instead, he is walking numbers, hence x2, x3. Everything new morde does is just \"muh numbers.\"\n\n\"Morde either won or lost the 1v1 with no room to outplay mechanically from either side because his kit is so underloaded and braindead\"\n\nWait wait wait. Are you telling me that bot lane morde, the literal 3 hit Q, doesnt even do this worse?\n\n\"Solo lane Morde was either broken or terrible. Bot lane Morde at least has a chance of striking balance.\"\n\nDon't get me wrong, Solo lane morde, as much fun as i had playing him, he was slightly toxic. Not broken really, but toxic. HOWEVER, bot lane morde is even moreso.  With old morde, while i do agree his old kit needed a slight rework, forcing all the power into one skill, of which you are almost assured to die is NOT more healthy than a pusher who could be still forced down if he wasn't ahead. bot lane morde has less of a chance to strike balance than solo. At least solo lane morde was less binary than 3 Q, win game.","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-10-15T22:58:27.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. All old Morde ever did was push, walk up, use his undodgeable E on you, and then use his other skills if you tried to retaliate. New Morde not only has to be right next to you to do meaningful damage but has to charge up his Q to really get his damage rolling. New Morde's 3 Q system provides infinitely more opportunities for meaningful interaction than old Morde's E spam ever did; If you can stall out Morde's 3rd Q long enough for it to time out, you now have a significant period of time where you can wail on him with little threat to yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"JediSenpaiNP","date":"2015-10-15T23:12:58.523+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But how is that more opportunity for interaction? Wait out singular spell, GG WP. Get hit, GG WP. its 1 opportunity. The reason pushing morde was ok was because with all his pushing came extreme risks of being ganked. With every wave, you went deeper in the dungeon, so to speak. Literally this morde is a more binary version of old morde. Kite old morde, or manage to outbruiser him, which i will admit was rare, and you beat him. but this is also kite morde and abuse his melee. just like kite morde and abuse the e range. Not only that, old morde, while e was a major staple, the kit as a whole was used. You could use everything well together. now, we don't have more of a kit. The opportunity of interactions hasn't actually changed very much at all, but instead provides even for the enemy and LESS for the actual morde player.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rozzeta","date":"2015-10-17T13:35:06.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those who deny this is a serious possibility obviously weren't around when Eve's stealth lasted a minute and could stun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ahferroin7","date":"2015-10-16T16:08:46.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No the really sad thing is that at worlds, he's been banned or played in more than 90% of the games, and has not lost a single game he's been played in, and they still don't appear to care.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-15T13:49:25.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"But..
