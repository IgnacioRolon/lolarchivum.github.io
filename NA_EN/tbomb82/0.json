I am personally up for a champion select where I will get to be what role I want to play.  But will this champion select place me against people not my level because that's where they can play there role at. If that's so then will team builder end up being the same where only level 25 and up can play. With all these changes will it really benefit the community to play what roles they want, or hurt it by placing people who want that role against some one of higher level?  Will this be the best update for League of Legends or the worst?","replies":[]}
