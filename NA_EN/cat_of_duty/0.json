It isn't that bad but my ping will randomly spike to 300+ for a few seconds and I will start teleporting around and shit. This happens a minimum of like 7-8 times a game and has definitely affected my gameplay. I have died multiple times from lagging in the middle of a fight. Is there a reason why this is happening or a fix to this? My internet seems as normal as it always has been on everything except league.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-12T22:17:09.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game requires a strong and constant connection, otherwise you'll suffer from input delays or lag spikes.  In this case, it sounds like you have some consistent packet loss, so I suggest running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) to see what's going on.

Again, my connection seems fine on everything else except league and it only started happening on the new patch. Is there anyway it is the new patch? I can't exactly run a cord from the router. \n\n[This was my log reader after my most recent game I tried after the firewall method](http://imgur.com/a/V5W1Q)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-15T16:38:32.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the information!  Even if your internet works fine, you can still have issues reaching a specific server.  In this case, something is causing you to suffer from packet loss which can be due to a local network problem or even how your ISP is routing to the specific game server.    Running on wi-fi can certainly be the culprit here, and I would highly recommend trying a wired connection even to just rule out possibilities.  Additionally, I suggest going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help strengthen up your network.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
