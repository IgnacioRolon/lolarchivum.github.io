Recently, I&#039;ve seen a few threads post a fan-painted edit of the skin, showing what they believe are improvements to the skin. Of course there are always those who disagree and comment below, but the degree to which those comments have been shouted down is staggering. Without giving my own opinion on the skin itself, I haven&#039;t seen Boards be this much of an echo chamber in some time. Sure, pack mentality comes into play in any given thread, its bound to happen, but for every thread that thinks one thing, there&#039;s usually a thread that thinks the opposite and is highly upvoted. \r\n\r\nEven dissenting arguments aren&#039;t typically downvoted into oblivion on a thread unless they are cruel in some way or flat out incorrect. With these past few threads I&#039;ve witnessed simple disagreements or sensible counter arguments become &quot;click to show&quot;. What is happening? \r\n\r\nSome of these posts aren&#039;t aggressive in any way either. I literally saw someone simply say &quot;I like riot&#039;s version more&quot; and was downvoted into &quot;click to show&quot; status. Since when are we downvoting pure opinions? These are supposed to be discussions, I thought this was part of why we generally don&#039;t like Reddit. Someone disagreeing is not a reason to downvote. \r\n\r\nAgain, I&#039;m pretty neutral about the skin, any changes or lack-thereof don&#039;t affect me at all. I don&#039;t have a horse in this race. But please, try to actually discuss with people and not just hound anyone who may feel strongly in the opposite way to you. That alone is not grounds to silence them.","replies":[{"poster":"Blakiepug","date":"2018-03-26T16:22:12.708+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":8,"body":"People take this upvote-downvote thing way too personally.

Her reworked winter wonder irelia doesn't even have much of a headdress anyway, there's a new hairstyle which has unpopular reception and a little broach.

The difference is that the gold on the **champion  model** is muted and does not have the same level of attention grabbing that the gold on the blade and headdress do.\n\nAnd yes, if you compare **JUST** the blades from the PBE and fan version, the fan version has more contrast.

And when you add that much more contrast and bright colors to something that is not supposed to be the focal point of the champion, it creates clarity issues.\n\nPBE Frostblade model is dull, and uniform colors, meanwhile the blades are a bright highlighted blue, making sure they stand out against the more muted colors of the actual Irelia.\n\nFan Frostblade model is bright, drawing attention to the model itself, which naturally takes away from the attention that should be the blades.\n\nAnd yes, in gameplay, the attention focused on where the champion is dangerous.

He didn't get downvoted for saying he favors the old skin - that'd be a valid opinion (I know people have been getting downvoted for that, but that's not what's happening to wolf king).
