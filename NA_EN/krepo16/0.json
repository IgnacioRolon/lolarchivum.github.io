For all the jungle changes, he is still going to be picked in most competitive games. His mobility is out of control with even the slightest concept of the champion and he only needs to build one damage item for the entire game to out damage most other junglers. If you cannot compete with Lee Sin in the jungle, you cannot jungle.  There is no other jungler that has been this persistently overpowered throughout every season. We've even seen Rioters come right out and say that if he wasn't so popular he would've been nerfed long ago, yet here we are, 4 seasons later with the same stale jungle meta because champions like this continue to dominate no matter what the jungle items are, or how difficult the camps may be.\n\nThere's a simple way to open up the jungle to other characters and that's getting rid of ridiculous characters that no one else can realistically compete against. Riot was fine doing it to Elise, they didn't bat an eye when they did it to Eve, so I think it's about time we bring the golden boy down from S-tier.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2014-12-04T18:05:18.251+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":19,"body":"> why Lee Sin is the only jungler that is still absolutely, ridiculously broken. \n\nLee is probably still quite strong.

In fact, take away the ult and he is a worthless champion. Lee sin's kit is wayyyyyyy too well rounded, he has the damages early, wave clear, a shield for sustain, AS steroid for even faster clears, a SHIT ton of mobility, and a hard CC. No champion should be this well rounded, in fact the only weakness for Lee is that \"he falls off late game,\" however, how often do you see lees being useless late game? It is not that hard for a mediocre lee to make some \"plays\" because of his amazing kit, and snowball. Besides, even if he falls off late game he is not useless, because he can splitpush well, and ult a carry into your team etc...","replies":[{"poster":"eyes wide shut","date":"2014-12-05T03:57:10.787+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":22,"body":"you literally just said he was a bad champion because his kit was designed really well. please stop. just stop.","replies":[{"poster":"chumbler","date":"2014-12-05T04:38:46.767+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"> you literally just said he was a bad champion because his kit was designed really well. please stop. just stop.\n\nUhhh no.

Which riot has attempted to do several times but hasn't been largely successful.\n\nI would say it is more the jungle defining the junglers rather then lee sin defining the jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"Krepo16","date":"2014-12-04T21:31:46.669+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Short of his release in Season 1 there was never a point where Lee Sin was a bad jungler. Even in Season 2 he was still considered a high tier jungler. The fact of the matter is his high base stats, powerful kit, and insane mobility have always been a problem. He will always beat these tanks in the jungle because his stat distribution makes it so that he does more damage, while still maintaining high survivability from his kit. I started playing Lee in season 1, back when you could W halfway across a lane. I assure you, he was still good back then.","replies":[{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2014-12-04T21:39:20.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"He ahs always been a good champ, yes. However he will not always be able to beat tanky champions. If riot keeps balancing the way they are he will be stronger earlier but doesn't scale well. However if they go back to season 2 and mr and armor being absurd tank junglers would probably be better at all points of the game. I mean he was very obscure in season 2. You really didn't see him much. Was he good? yes but he never defined anything. So you bring up some points worth talking about but you make broad statements that are just not true which makes it hard to debate your points.","replies":[{"poster":"Krepo16","date":"2014-12-04T21:41:44.370+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with using Season 2 as an example of him \"not defining the meta\" is the fact that he just didn't define the NA meta. In Korea they figured out very quickly that a champion that had a kit that was this absurd could be used to do all kinds of crazy things. It's called an \"Insec\" because we didn't learn how to play him well, they did. If anything we were just behind a trend that already existed. You could still build Lee Sin like a tank and he did just as much as anyone else, he just did it better.\n\nEdit: I also went back and looked at my season 2 stats and Lee Sin was my most played champion so...I think you might be exaggerating just how uncommon he was. Theoddone for example also had him as his most played champion and he was one of the premiere professional junglers at that time.","replies":[{"poster":"Circuit Bear","date":"2014-12-05T00:18:23.489+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Too add onto this. There was Diamondprox who became a pro only playing Lee Sin at first. When Gambit picked him up that was his only solid character.\n\nLee Sin was about on par with Shyv if not slightly below since his slow actually allowed him to duel shyv efficiently at the time. And this was back when he still had the aspd, spellvamp/armor/lifesteel whole bit. The only reason I would say he wasn't top tier was cause the philo/heart of gold wasn't the greatest route on him and sightstone didn't exist. Like shyv at the time, only haert of gold was okay on him compared to the tank junglers which got both. \n\nBut as a character he was never below maybe second tier in Season 2. He just didn't have a billion videos on the gimmicks you could do with him nor was there an LCS to advertise him every week(LCSBIGPLAYS Dawg... 90% of them have Lee in them somewhere.)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Alpharite","date":"2014-12-04T20:56:29.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":20,"body":"If he's so broken, why is his winrate so low in ALL levels of play?","replies":[{"poster":"Krepo16","date":"2014-12-04T21:36:04.731+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really have no idea why Reddit spread this idea that solo queue win rates are the sole metric by which a champion's power can be determined. I keep emphasizing here, he is picked in 100% of competitive plays at the highest level because he is so versatile and powerful. Even if you look at NA's Diamond/Challenger Ranked 5's he is maintaining about a 50% win rate consistently. Solo queue is not a good metric for determining a champion's power by itself. The games go much longer than they should and there are far more mistakes made in solo queue games than there are if something is played to its full potential.\n\nEdit: Also as of right now Warwick and Pantheon just happen to have good synergy with the new jungle changes and both of them are being nerfed next patch which I suspect is going to change the way those graphs look real quick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saint Millay","date":"2014-12-04T21:44:43.421+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"His win-rate is low because his play-rate is so high.

I don't know why everyone has to moan about an early game champ. His late game is being hit near every patch, and he struggles in the new jungle. He very vulnerable to counter jungling if he tries to farm.\n\nPeople complain about Lee who relies almost purely on reaction to the other team when their is Yi who can just farm till late game and run in and 1v1-1v5 depending on the enemy teams comp. Honestly the junglers that synced with FF and now Devourer are so much more toxic than Lee is now. Why? Because Lee falls off hard and takes a lot of skill to play while most of the junglers that use infinite stacking are late game champs. Lee struggles to duel any ADC or AS heavy champ late game due to the nerfs to his tempest awhile ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Krepo16","date":"2014-12-04T18:43:42.529+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean that's just not realistically the case at high levels of play. Yi is very easy to play against due to how susceptible he is to CC and being instantly burst down. You have to have a lot of gold on Yi and a lot of items in order to do anything.

Honestly if Riot changed his scaling, as in lower his base stats and give him better percentages then he'd be more balanced, the issue is because of how easy it is for even awful players to make plays with his kit if he has good percentages then he becomes unstoppable, so changing this around would be a huge risk.\n\nBut yeah, trying to defend this broken as sh*t champ by talking about less then stellar late game while everyone else is talking about his ridiculous early game won't help him out too much.","replies":[]}]}]}
