Fly in and my game would freeze i would teleport from where i started it and i would die where i had it indicated to go, I wouldn't get to see what happened at all.\r\nAnyway during one of my ranked games today my internet completely died out for about 10 minutes i reset the modem and after a few minutes it picked up again.\r\nI rejoined my game (thankfully team didn't give up and we ended up winnning) but now the same thing is happening again and i am unsure how to fix it.\r\nDoes anyone have this problem or a solution to it?\r\nThanks in advanced!..

In this case, I'd recommend reaching out to your ISP so they can assist you with testing the hardware and replacing it.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
