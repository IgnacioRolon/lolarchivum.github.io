It just dropped a bugsplat kk, i needed to restart league bcs of it, then my team did \"/remake\" and for fcking bug shit i got \"LeaverBooster\" So this is the problem, remove \"LeaverBooster\" or \"/Remake\" from normals.\r\nI personally think that is usefull but it has some minuses and pluses. I think that u could leave it on rankeds bcs its usefull if someone is afk but, not on normals. And one huge plus \"LeagueOfLegends\" comunity would play more rankeds and play better in total.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-04T21:28:27.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"/remake and leaverbuster are enabled in all matchmade modes, because it still causes other players a negative experience for being down a player.  The best thing you can do is work towards resolving whatever is causing you to leave games.  Bugsplats can occur from outdated drivers or corrupt files that cause the game to not render properly.  I recommend going over our game crash guide to fix this up.  I recommend testing it out in custom games to prevent further leaves.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"TheTevasLTU","date":"2016-08-05T07:45:43.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks. :)","replies":[]}]}]}
