They added masters and it lowered all previous tier values but a tier at the bottom has a better effect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ben Sharpio","date":"2017-05-20T01:31:03.282+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"i feel like people would just troll to get the shits and giggles of saying \"im wood 5\" if it ever came out. plus, i think adding another division would be a bit weird. dividing even more players within the system seems like it would not be good for queue times.
