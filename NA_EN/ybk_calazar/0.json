A mode or setting where players can&#039;t look you up. To able to play the game without feeling like you&#039;ve been spied on would be great for those who don&#039;t use 3rd party software to gain insight into the other players. Being harassed because of my rank is also ruining some of the fun. You&#039;re rank should be something you&#039;re proud of but when people say and i quote,&quot; A plat player should be able to hard carry his team in these silver matches...&quot; (Which for context it wasn&#039;t a silver match there was just a single silver player). I know this isn&#039;t as simple as I want it to be, but I would kill to be able to remain anonymous.","replies":[]}
