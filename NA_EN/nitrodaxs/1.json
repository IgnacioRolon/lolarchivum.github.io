In a lot of cases when I see this, the issue is caused by problems with the modem or router that your PC is connected to. I'm curious what specific network hardware you're running (model numbers) and if any other devices on your network lose their network connectivity when this happens to your main PC.\n\nLet me know, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"NitroDaxs","date":"2016-08-21T18:47:03.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\n\nI can see the number of my modem but its TP-Link with one antena (10 years old) i have a friend in the same network zone he has the same problem i have it for an mounth and a half he has it for a week now every device loses connection not only my laptop.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-21T23:46:33.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting.

If your premade friends are on a similar or the same ISP, there may be issues with the ISP infrastructure that are causing the issue.\n\nI'd like you to first ensure your local settings are good by going through the steps in the connection guide I previously sent you.
