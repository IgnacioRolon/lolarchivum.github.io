(morgana spellshield,olaf ultimate,poppy ult on the opposite team). if these champions pop zhonya during their anti-crowd-control zhonya will work then why bard ultimate isn't working when faced against? If his ultimate give a free zhonya in some sort to anybody would it be safe to say that it should work on anyone no matter what are their status condition?","replies":[{"poster":"RavenMagus","date":"2015-05-19T18:14:52.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a difference between using your own activated item, and being hit by a spell from another character.\n\nIt's supposed to look and feel a lot like Zhonya's, sure - but it's not supposed to be _exactly_ the same.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tis a nice day","date":"2015-05-19T05:38:59.734+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if bard's ult works on allies with morgana's spellshield","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rand0mH3r0X","date":"2015-05-19T03:51:55.584+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was that the only special case?
