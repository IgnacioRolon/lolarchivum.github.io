Guinsoo's really isn't that great. You get an extra 7.5% on your basics, but the AS is virtually wasted. The AoE really doesn't do anything either and the AD is sorta nice, but it's still pretty crap. Gunblade is sorta nice since it gives AP Ez some sustain, but compared to what a bigger AP item or a CDR item could give him, it's just not slot efficient.\n\nAlso, Fervor is horrible on AP Ez. It can give UP to 80 PHYSICAL damage ON-HIT. That's... That's really not a lot. If you poke with the Q, the other one, the one that does 20% of your AP over 3s, does a LOT. Poke with the Q or the W and you're essentially getting a free 20% upgrade on your abilities. Your R also applies that 20% to every champion it touches, meaning you're going to do a LOT of AoE damage by pressing R into 2+ people and even in a 1v1, the 20% can kill them as they try to run away.\n\nBut yeah... There's also the fact that this build would do more hybrid damage than anything and Hybrid damage, especially with the two MR items getting boosted to 70 MR, is pretty craptastic. It only takes one MR item and you'd be pretty worthless since a tank's base armor is about 70ish late game, the equivalent of 40% reduction and unless you get ArP, that means any and all physical will be, at the bare minimum, about 40% reduced since the new LW only affects bonus armor. Plus Lichbane, Gunblade, and Rageblade would be three items already, next would have to be a Void staff. What would you finish it with..? You have no defensive items at all there, yet you're only sitting at about 300ish AP after runes and masteries. 300 AP is... trash. Plus you'd be lacking in the CDR that every form of Ezreal requires to get that Q spam going.","replies":[{"poster":"Dremiist","date":"2015-10-31T16:01:43.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zair Umbras,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kfPda9Z5,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-10-31T08:27:15.917+0000)\n>\n> This... is actually sorta bad.

That's a base of 390, then after the Rabs, that's 526 AP. 526 is something most AP's get a lot sooner. \n\nI should note the physical damage will be ignored since the squishiest ADC, Vayne, has 73 armor late game and most mids have 80-90 base armor. 80 armor is about 44% reduction to your physical damage. Your Q is going to do a whole lot of nothing. Can't even get a LW to help with that either since it does bonus armor now and you can't run ArP runes since you're going more AP focused... So they'll end up with a Zhonya's, giving them another 45 to reduce your damage by over 50%, making your physical damage worthless. Then there's the fact your magic damage won't burst ANYONE. At 526 AP, your Q will do 115 base, about 198 from the AD ratio, then 40% from AP, so about 210, which is a total of 523 damage, but that'll be halved to about 211.5ish because of that armor you can't ignore... The 15% of your AD from Rageblade will only be about 7.5%, and since that's of your bonus, it'll only be 6 extra damage. The AP portion will only be about 39.5. Lichbane will do 213, probably reduced by about 30% since they'll have maybe 42 MR (30 base, 12 flats), so it'll do 149. You're looking at about a 400 damage Q... That's pretty pathetic. You built to make that Q and AA's hurt and in reality, you didn't do anything.\n\nI don't need to try a Rageblade to know it's a horrible item on a burst champion. Ezreal is not a DPS machine, he doesn't repeatedly AA and do DPS, he does huge burst with his high ratio E, R, and W with 'some' sustained damage from a Lichbane Q. AP Ez's typical combo, E+W+AA with Lichbane does 205% of his AP, with Luden's that goes up to 215% on top of the high bases. With the new Deathfire keystone, that also goes up to 235% with the addition of 20% over 3s. So you can either insta-gib some one and have low CD's with a Nomicon, Rabadons, Luden's, Void, Lichbane, and CDR boots, or you can try to do some sort of absurd hybrid build using an item made for Jax and Corki who do DPS... on a burst champ.\n\nI'll take my 80+80+120+100+70 AP items since that'll total 450 base, which is 607.5 with a free 100 damage and 10% ratio added into the combo. I know Ez well, I play him a lot. He's been one of my favorite champions for a long time. He's a poke-based champion that bursts hard when he goes in deep. He's not a DPS machine and you can't build him to be a DPS machine. His kit simply doesn't work well with it. He's so much better off with either pure AD with focus on his Q and R or you go AP and focus on his W, E, and R.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chief Mayonnaise","date":"2015-10-31T06:29:01.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you clarify if Fervor of Battle stacks fall off one at a time or if they all fall off at once?","replies":[{"poster":"Dremiist","date":"2015-10-31T15:48:08.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PresidentSkroob,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kfPda9Z5,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-31T06:29:01.139+0000)\n>\n> Could you clarify if Fervor of Battle stacks fall off one at a time or if they all fall off at once.\n\nall at once","replies":[{"poster":"Chief Mayonnaise","date":"2015-10-31T18:30:52.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool thanks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-31T08:16:25.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All at once.","replies":[]}]}]}
