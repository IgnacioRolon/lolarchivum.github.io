Basically last patch we didupdate a lot of the Death Recap system so it would play nice with champion damage, but we didn&#039;t fix a bug where Death Recap had inverted the priority listing for damage types. In other words, Death Recap was properly calculating the damage you were taking from champion spells, but it was not stack ranking them properly. Instead of displaying the top three highest sources of damage, it was showing you the bottom three.\n> \n> So&hellip; yeah. Fixed.\n> \n> REVIVE STILL DOESN&#039;T DEAL 12 DAMAGE\n> \n> Fixed a bug where Death Recap was showing the lowest three sources of damage, rather than the highest\n\nSo in the end you fixed a bug that wasn&#039;t even there until you tried to fix the death recap and ended up fixing a bug you created during your attempt instead of fixing the real issue with the death recap.\n\nSo...yeah. ~~Fixed~~","replies":[{"poster":"Sachabot","date":"2015-07-22T03:47:43.594+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because updating piles and piles of code is a magical, quick, easy job.

We identify that the biggest issue is that the right data isn't getting passed to Death Recap to display.\n\nPatch 5.13: We fix some stuff so death Recap now generally gets the correct data. That then reveals that Death Recap's not sorting that data properly. That issue was there previously, but it wasn't possible to distinguish that from data simply being absent, so we'd missed it.\n\nPatch 5.14: We address the bug where death recap's prioritizing small amounts of damage instead of large. Hopefully that puts it in a much better spot, if not it will assumedly reveal other problems we can fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Dremiist","date":"2015-07-22T16:43:17.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E8l3iemA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-07-22T08:08:43.518+0000)\n>\n> Patch 5.12 and before: Death Recap's not very functional.
