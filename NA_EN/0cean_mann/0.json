His Runepage will also affect his ultimate\n\nPassive - Empower\nHis rune page is slightly better than usual ( Doesn't affect the main keystone rune eg. aftershock, conqueror etc.)and it will affect how his ultimate functions\n**Precision** - Slows and debuffs enemies in a wide area, Doesn't deal damage\n**Domination** - your generic AOE damage ult ( Similar to Neeko's)\n**Sorcery** - Arcane comet shower, It doesn't deal tons of damage but there will be many falling around\n**Resolve** - Fist phase is to push enemies away from the center slowing them a bit then the Second phase is to pull back the remaining enemies into the center rooting them 0.75 seconds\n**Inspiration**- Buffs your allies, simple as that\n\nQ - Offense combo ability\nPassive - for every 3rd auto attack nearby allied minions get bonus attack speed and damage for 2 seconds (doesn't stack though)\nActive - You recall your Demacian training and swing your sword in an incredibly small area 4 times. \n1st is a slash to the side --- 2nd is a stab --- 3rd is a slash --- 4th is another stab. The range is really small but you can move around but you deal more damage if you stay still\n\nW - Structure/ Charges      only 2 can be placed at a time 3 once its at rank 4\nYou plant a small rune in the target area. It will take time to grow and once it does it rises up from the ground and shoots laser like projectile to champions. Lasers stop on first champion hit or doesn't pierce through. Its really vulnerable during its growing period and bushes can't hide them. The structure will has charges and once it runs out it will just go back to its growing state to go through the cycle again. The lasers don't do that much damage nor do they have big width but it has long range and fires on visible champions only\n\nE - Banner of command but weaker                          3 minons at rank 3 - 4 minions at rank 5\nIf you don't know what banner of command is its an old item removed by riot since it just keeps giving them balancing problems since it goes really good with tanks. It empowers 2-3-4 minions (also gives them a reskin) and they follow you around. The longer they live the stronger they become. Once you die they either die fighting or retreat back to base and wait for you\n\nR - an AOE effect that depends on what runes you have\n**Precision** - Slows and debuffs enemies in a wide area, Doesn't deal damage\n**Domination** - your generic AOE damage ult ( Similar to Neeko's)\n**Sorcery** - Arcane comet shower, It doesn't deal tons of damage but there will be many falling around\n**Resolve** - Fist phase is to push enemies away from the center slowing them a bit then the Second phase is to pull back the remaining enemies into the center rooting them 0.75 seconds\n**Inspiration**- Buffs your allies defensive stats and health, simple as that\n\n\nHow to play him\nHe is a top/mid laner and all you do is just establish a siege point and occasionally send your minions to die. At mid to late game just push sidelanes and occassionally pick off champions that are alone with your personal army. You will be doing a lot of sieging and destroying since for you kills don't matter objectives do \n\nMaking skins will be hard for this champion mostly because of his Ult but I'd recommend Cosmic or Project for him","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-29T02:16:21.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is a guy whose gimmick is that he can augment his rune page being given these random minion augmentation abilities?
