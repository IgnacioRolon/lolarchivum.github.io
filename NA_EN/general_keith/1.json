I'm sure you don't even realize it. But I'll try to be very clear about it. You feel entitled to playing with people who are good at this game when you get on. The issue with this is you are not entitled to that idea at all. You don't' seem to understand that the world does not in fact revolve around you and maintaining your happiness. This is a multiplayer game and it is available freely to the public. Let me put it another way, when you go out in public you are not entitled to only see people who you know/like. You are going to interact with strangers most likely and many people might prefer that his didn't happen. However, we live in a society and part of living in a society is in fact living with other people and their wants/needs. You have no right to demand that other people be good at this game. The fact that you think it is disrespectful to you when you happen to play with someone who isn't good is a sign of how entitled you feel you are. You call other people brats for not respecting other players but it is in fact you who does not respect the other PEOPLE playing this game along side you. If you cannot handle the idea that you will play with people that are not up to your expectations and have to rely on those people, than you should not be playing a team game with strangers. This sense that you have about it being disrespectful for someone to play a game they are bad at with other people is in fact an incredible selfish world view. You are quite literally stating that the world revolves around you and you should always be considered first when ever anyone else makes a decision to do something around you. You are the child, I'm sorry to burst your bubble but that is in fact the reality. When you agreed to play league of legends you agreed to play with other people. That has nothing to do with their skill level and in fact you never agreed to be good at this game yourself either. So when you have a bad game next time or decide to learn a new champion it will be unreasonable of that toxic jerk to yell at you when they do. Grow up man, the rest  of the world has just about nothing to do with you.","replies":[{"poster":"iamdestinos","date":"2015-09-17T22:24:48.130+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is true so many people I have seen think that you are required to be good at what skill level they are at a time you play anything with them not realizing you could be a noob like everyone is at one point in their life and just want to have some fun","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lakega","date":"2015-09-18T03:42:36.477+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"First I want to say I completely agree with you 100% Eternal Zen. \n\nI do want to say however, that while I do think Dragfin is extremely childish and narrow minded, not to mention everything else you say. I do feel there is a middle ground between both of your extreme views. \n \nWhile he wants to bash everyone who isn't \"good\", and you are totally ok with everyone no matter the situation, I do feel there is a middle ground. \n\nI think most of DragFins annoyances and pissy attitude come from people who say \"It's just a game\" and leave it at that. It's these people that are I believe who he's calling selfish, and disrespectful. Sure, they play, and I am not within the righto bitch at them for being as good as I am, that doesnt' mean they are in the right to simply say \"well its just a game\" and not try. There are people who use this excuse to not better themselves, and continue to make the game hell for their teammates and doing the most simplistic day 1 mistakes 3 years down the road. I do not believe they either have this right, as it all comes down to respect. \n\nWhile I agree with the OP, normals by all means, is a place to practice, play, and have fun. Nobody has a right to complain to them for not being awesome at the champ they chose. \n\nOn the flip side, it is a game, and a game is meant to be played properly and in the way it was intended to be played. There are a handful of people, (more than I care to admit), who simply log in, screw around in a game, and albeit playing it properly, really don't care about anything than spamming a few buttons, csing some stuff and logging off. This isn't entirely respectful either, and is just as bad as DragFin in all honesty. \n\nIf you're going to play a competitive game, where the objective is to beat the other team, but you're the only one on the team, not caring to do your best, or trying to learn and get better, then you also are a problem, and in that sense, people do have the right to complain in my personal opinion. \n\n----------------------\n\n\"It's just a game\", is never a legitimate remark or defense, because it's not just a game, and is in no way an excuse to screw around or not take it seriously. It's also the time of the players on your team and the opposing team trying to have a good, fun  match, and that attitude generally results in pissing people off one way or another. \n\nLike-wise, you're entering a competitive team based game. This naturally by its very nature, is going to attract all the serious players, and players who want to win, play the game to its most, and do the best they can. Then there are players who just aren't good, or don't care. \n\nNeither of them are inherently wrong, but both need to respect each other, unfortunately in this situation, the ones who are less competitive and don't take the game seriously, need to respect that this game is not for them in the long run, and should respect those who wish to play it properly and get better at it. \n\n-----------------------\n\nI'm kinda going in circles in my explanation and I feel as though I may have not exactly expressed it completely, so I'll attempt a TLDR \n\nTLDR: Competitive games attract competitive players, and while everyone has a right to play, both competitive players and non competitive players need to respect each others mentality towards the game. The over arching problem is that league doesn't have a way to split these people up, allowing the game to be more enjoyable for both spectrum's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devack The Holy","date":"2015-09-19T15:42:51.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://media.giphy.com/media/11hT2MBlanROko/giphy.gif","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linthe","date":"2015-09-17T21:10:04.972+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dragfin,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=fJhKei2v,comment-id=000000010000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-09-17T20:28:52.402+0000)\n \n> Send me you address so I can send you a box of tissues because you don't like what I have to say.\n> \n> There should be some kind of action taken on people who can't play a competitive game with no intention of bettering themselves for the people who they are playing with.

Using his soldiers to jump over walls correctly and avoid ganks by using his soldiers properly. Just going into a normal and trying to learn how to CS with him isnt going to improve you at all. If you do not have the mechanics it wont matter if you learn how to cs with him or not you will still die to that 30 cs annie 20 mins in even if u have 100 cs.","replies":[{"poster":"Anomander","date":"2015-09-17T19:39:21.339+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"And if he does learn it.

He prolly does not even know what attack move is at his level. \n\nHe does not have the RAW mechanics of an auto attacking champion to play the character to a decent degree and all that hes learning is how to CS improperly with Azir. Because 90% chance hes not attack moving. \n\nI mean I could continue but that mechanic alone would make any Azir ... useless.","replies":[{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2015-09-19T22:35:51.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you need to check yourself if this how you just generalize everyone.

As a general rule, you shouldn't be close enough to your opponent to cast ignite on them. Barrier is generally my go-to with Azir. Secondly, I always rush Nashor's Tooth first with a second Doran's Ring to help with mana. My standard item order is generally; {{item:1056}} {{item:2003}} {{item:2003}} > {{item:3108}} {{item:1056}}  > {{item:3101}} > {{item:3115}} > {{item:3116}} > anything else. (Boots somewhere in the early/mid game.) Of course, it's going to be situational depending on what you need for defenses, but if all is going well, that's what I do. Not sure of what you do with your skill order, but most agree on R > Q > W > E.\n\nAlso, QUICK CAST WITHOUT INDICATOR. It's hard to get used to, but it's almost always a good idea on any champ. It forces you not to hesitate to cast abilities and helps you learn to keep track of yourself better while visualizing your own range.","replies":[{"poster":"Mirage Seraph","date":"2015-09-17T20:25:12.480+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I could make a suggestion?\n\nConsider taking Teleport over Barrier. A lot of the time, Barrier isn't going to save you in a teamfight (especially if they're an all in comp, which Azir is weak to) and in lane it's usually a better idea to uber farm and poke from out of range than it is to go for a duel since that early on your dps is very limited to a single Q. Teleport is... well, I mean it's teleport. Map Presence. The lowered CDR also works on your passive turret so something I do a lot of the time is go to their inner turret, set mine down, B and tele back and siege with full resources. \n\nI just feel it's much stronger than barrier for Azir, I've been running Teleport on Azir since about a week after he released and I realized ignite is utterly useless for him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dakuraigun","date":"2015-09-17T21:16:43.873+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing is, is that in the end, it's just Normals.
