(gold-dia currently)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Player Recruitment","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"T l version; \r\nShutting up and practice to actually get toward the point of being able to compete on at least an amateur pro level's good. You're good to show up, practice, and do your own thing until the teams at a competitive place where talking's effective. I.e minimum of north america masters level. There's a reason for this. Some forms of verbal communication are good and others bad or in line with toxicity. For this team feeling free to speaks good when it's your opinion with a period on the end instead of a meme that's hanging there and causing confusion. Or information about some_thing_. Gossip is less than acceptable. Those first two things you are good to do here. \r\nSending a friend req means you agree to these things. Breaking agreements = living double standard.\r\n\r\nThis post is to captivate your mind toward the idea of a working functioning team. There's something about synergy that's able to allow for new plays/boundaries, and heights reached as a unit. That's the key word there, it's teamwork. Teamwork's a relatively beautiful thing in the sense that it allows for experiences, also opportunities, experienced that are unavailable experience-wise solo. It's a good thing too. Teamworking that is. That's why you're here. There's something good about community. Regardless of how toxic it is, which, yes it's bad. Things' change though.\r\n\r\nAs you are interested in being in a group that plays league, makes progress, and moves forward together (and individually too) then here's an invitation to join. Another of the words', interest, is required. Here's the list of requirements for joining, or in another light, expected with your joining. Staying silent during the game unless you're sharing information about a topic. Hanging out afterwards is still an option. This is towards avoiding distractions. It's representing relative importance for an atmosphere toward focusing in.\r\n\r\nThere's 2 hours of practice which requires the team's agreeing of when on, to be attended. Which ties into the last expectation. That's for you to be talkative. Talkative's definition depends on how it's looked at though. You're able to talk here. There's topics' for discussing. Things to agree on. Walls which are climbable, through discussion, which is good. When you see problems, here's the way towards solving it. Discuss, unless it's solveable on your own, which good amounts of problems' are. Relationship-wise, relationships are important in League too, talk's your solution. The majority of amateur-pro groups' fall apart because of underlying issues.\r\n\r\nThis one's staying. It's time to bring out the best you you're able to. Sending a friend request means you are agreeing to the things listed above. It's also indicating you're ready to start building synergy, and begin practicing. Bringing yourself is good enough. You're a good person. Anything is possible. Good job on reading this wall of text.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Samuel","replies":[{"poster":"Këvin Gates","date":"2016-05-07T16:57:49.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me. \"Lord Birusu\" currently in between plat 5/4.
