Could you possibly forward this to Riot Tech with the intent that they may investigate on their end?\nI ask this since I doubt that all the players having issues and posting here are from Western-Europe. \n\n(PS. Posting the requested logs in the other post  where you replied :) )","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"P3NANC3","date":"2017-08-29T08:13:31.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have had the same. Reported on it here, and through a support ticket. At request I sent them ping-logs, and they told me it is my connection, despite the only ping / packet loss issue is to the Riot server in Chicago.","replies":[]}]}
