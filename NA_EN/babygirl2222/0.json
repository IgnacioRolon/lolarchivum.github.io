Cheshire cat came to mind because yes she looks kinda like a cat (I know shes a fox)but the characteristics of the Cheshire cat do seem to apple to her . such as Appering outta no where and being hard to catch. I drew a very rough drawing of her and all the white (blanks) other than her skin would ether be a glowy purple or electric blue, gold eyes, and yes those are some kind of leather pants with buckles on them. I spent like 15 -20 mins on the drawing and if needed I can re draw for a better more presise look. Sorry for all the spelling errors. ----Thx >.< sincerely Jade =^._.^= (hope fully the picture shows up)if not I will put a link in the comments","replies":[{"poster":"MaliceCity","date":"2013-10-29T22:41:30.627+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this idea.

The normal basketball-esq joke animation could instead use her head.
