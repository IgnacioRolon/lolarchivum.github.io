I&#039;ve been thinking about this for a few days now and am ready to present the concept in a sort of beta form. Feedback and Criticism is welcome, I will be taking comments to better improve the concept when making the next iteration.\r\n\r\n**General Overview**\r\n\r\n&gt; Mordekaiser&#039;s kit has been most problematic due to the abilities that have been most loved by his mains, his passive and his ultimate. This concept is going to be replacing the passive completely while revamping the ultimate into something just as interesting while attempting to keep the playing field more balanced for both teams. Mordekaiser&#039;s current Q, W, and E will see some changes to make Mordekaiser more of a teamfight menace, utilizing his allies as if they were mere puppets in his army while leading the charge towards victory. Details about particle effect and ability presentation descriptions will be given to make Morde&#039;s kit feel more Metal and Soul themed.\r\n\r\n**Kit Concept:**\r\n\r\n**Passive - Voice of the Soul**\r\n\r\n&gt; Units that Mordekaiser has killed with give him *Soul Essence*. *Soul Essence* powers up Mordekaiser&#039;s abilities and allows him to upgrade one basic ability every 100 collected *Soul Essence*. Mordekaiser&#039;s ultimate can be upgraded at 400 *Soul Essence*. Amount of *Soul Essence* earned depends on the unit killed. (**NOTE** I&#039;ll be referring to soul essence scalings as SE)\r\n\r\n&gt; *Soul Essence* Count:\r\nMelee and Caster Minions = 1\r\nSmall and Medium Monsters = 1\r\nLarge Monsters = 2\r\nCannon Minions = 4\r\nEpic Monsters and Champions = 10\r\n\r\n**Q - Mace of Spades**\r\n\r\n&gt; Mordekaiser primes his mace, Nightfall, with necromantic energies for 10 seconds. For the next three basic attacks Mordekaiser gains 50 bonus attack range and his attacks gain bonus effects. The first two attacks deal 10/15/20/25/30 (+ 0.2 SE)(+ 0.4 Bonus AD)(+ 0.2 AP) bonus magic damage and the third attack will slam Nightfall down on the ground at the target&#039;s location dealing twice the bonus magic damage of the first two attacks in 150 unit radius around the target. (**NOTE** The third attack is a dodgable skillshot like Lucian&#039;s Q).\r\n\r\n&gt; *Soul Essence Upgrade* - The first two attacks shred target&#039;s magic resistance by 10/14/18/22/26% for 4 seconds. This effect does not stack but the duration will be refreshed if applied again.\r\n\r\n&gt; Cooldown: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds after the last basic attack goes off or the duration runs out.\r\nCost: None\r\n\r\n**W - Harvester of Sorrows**\r\n\r\n&gt; Mordekaiser sends out shards of his own armor to a target location, creating a storm of metal shrapnel for 6 seconds. Enemies in the storm are dealt 10/15/20/25/30 (+ 0.25 AP) per second. Mordekaiser or his allies can walk over the center of the storm to make it follow them for the duration, this will grant the storm&#039;s carrier 10/20/30/40/50 reduced damage for all instances of damage. At the end of the duration or if Mordekaiser reactivates this ability the storm will return to him in a straight line, damaging enemies along the path for 60/100/140/180/220 (+ 0.8 SE)(+ 0.6 AP).\r\n\r\n&gt; *Soul Essence Upgrade* - Upon the storm&#039;s return, Mordekaiser is healed for all of the damage reduced (+ 0.6 AP)\r\n\r\n&gt; Cooldown: 20/18/16/14/12 seconds\r\nCost: 20/30/40/50/60 health\r\n\r\n**E - Iron Maiden**\r\n\r\n&gt; Mordekaiser slams Nightfall into the ground and begins to charge for up to 3 seconds. Upon recast, Mordekaiser swings Nightfall up through the ground causing a cone of metal spikes to rupture damaging and slowing enemies by 30%. Charging increases range, slow duration, and damage dealt to enemies for each second charged.\r\n\r\n&gt; Damage: 10/30/50/70/90 (+ 0.8 AD) physical damage + 4% (+ 1% per 100 AP) maximum health magic damage up to 30/90/150/210/270 (+ 2.4 AD) physical damage + 12% (+ 1% per 100 AP) maximum health magic damage.\r\n\r\n&gt; Slow duration: 1 second to 3 seconds.\r\n\r\n&gt; Range: just in front of Mordekaiser to to about rank 1 Zac E in length for rank 1, width being Annie W. Maximum length being rank 3 Zac E at rank 5.\r\n\r\n&gt; *Soul Essence Upgrade* - Enemies hit are grounded for the slow&rsquo;s duration.\r\n\r\n&gt; Cooldown: 18 Seconds\r\nCost: 50/45/40/35/30 health\r\n\r\n**R - Children of the Grave**\r\n\r\n&gt; Passive - Dragon Force\r\nWhen Mordekaiser damages a drake, it is afflicted with *Dragon Force* for 5 seconds. If Mordekaiser or his allies kill the drake while it is afflicted, Mordekaiser gains a pet Ghost Drake. (This is all the same as current iteration).\r\n\r\n&gt; Active -\r\nMordekaiser targets a dead ally, channeling for 3 seconds. At the end of the channel the ally is resurrected with full health at the current location and gain *Call of the Zombie*. Allies with *Call of the Zombie* have healing from all sources reduced by 100%. While near Mordekaiser, him and allies with *Call of the Zombie* gain 10/15/20% bonus AD and AP. *Call of the Zombie* is removed upon death.\r\n\r\n&gt; *Soul Essence Upgrade* - Mordekaiser is healed for 12% of damage dealt by allies with *Call of the Zombie*\r\n\r\n&gt; Cooldown: 180/140/100 Seconds.\r\n\r\n&gt; Range: Need to be on top on the dead ally.\r\n\r\n&gt; Being stunned, silenced, suppressed or displaced interrupts the channel.\r\n\r\nAnd there you have it. Let me know what you think :)","replies":[{"poster":"Luxrom","date":"2018-04-26T22:19:19.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Makes me laugh.\nTo anyone that would happen to read this message, Dota 2's Doom Bringer is what Mordekaiser should be. His ultimate is a 10sec DOT and silences the opponent, his weapon's slam briefly stuns the opponent, his W doesn't need an ally, does a fair amount of damage, heals a bit over time and gives a nice movespeed buff to allies in it. And on top of all of that, because his base stats are really bad, nothing to do with Mordekaiser's joke of base stats, Doom Bringer has Nunu's passive to give him some more movement speed, armor or hp regen.\nI think that's the way Riot should watch for a Mordekaiser rework.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Metal Boy","date":"2018-04-25T14:36:04.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ult is meh. What makes him unique is the fact he can take enemy ghosts to push lanes and win fights. Passive is interesting. I do like that. I think his old W should stay the same, but just give him an automatic movespeed buff with allies instead of the whole moving toward each other crap.\n\nReally interesting read though! As a Morde main, I love reading stuff like this :){{champion:82}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"iBard XD","date":"2018-04-25T00:50:29.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't like it.

He needs some kind of skill expression, and auto attack empowers don't really fit into new champ designs since they are just stat increasers with no counterplay other than to be out of range.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2018-04-16T16:11:31.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rework concepts #141.
