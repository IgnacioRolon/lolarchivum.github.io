Champs with CC immunity or cleanse effects like Eve or GP. If you get caught by his wall of pain, then you will infact be in pain cause thats at least 2 Qs you will probably eat.\n\nSo any champ going up against him mid lane would have a much better laning phase if they bought {{item:3111}} . Even if youre AP you can sell them later. They will significantly aid in avoiding his Qs, help take fewer Qs when you get hit with wall of pain, and help offset the magipen from the wall. Another option is {{item:3009}} for avoiding Qs and recovering from wall of pain.\n\nChamps like Yasuo, Zed, and Kat have the mobility to avoid repeated Qs and Zed and Kat can bypass the wall potentially if they get caught on the wrong side or want to continue an assault. AD champs can of course build {{item:3814}} for timed ult avoidance. Anyone can build a {{item:3102}} and have a decent chance of ignoring a few ults.\n\nThe most important thing is to never focus down a Karth first at an objective like Baron or Dragon because he will still be there as a ghost from his passive using attacks in the area. If you kill him in a general teamfight, leave the area. He will still be there and be vengeful.\n\nProbably the best tip I can give is to really keep track of the jungler on Karths team. I know I slam my ult when the jungler is ganking bot every time I can. If I KNOW it will kill my enemy mid laner I will possibly do it, but sometimes I resist the urge and wait on that botlane gank. It gives me a good shot at either 2 assist, a kill and an assist, or a double kill.\n\nAlso if youre keeping wards up, it should be easier to avoid Karth ganks because if he comes to your lane with wall of pain then life is about to suck.\n\nAs was mentioned Soraka can really help take the sting out of a Karth ult, and avoid him getting a post teamfight/gank triple kill from anywhere on the map. Champs like Kayle and Lee Sin on your team also can aid in spot saving people from death.\n\nIf Karth gets ahead then avoiding him and trying to take objectives he isnt near till you can catch up is helpful. If hes really ahead then MR and playing smart are the only choices because if he ever gets to a point where he can ult and the lowest damage he does to anyone is 500 then other people may be taking 650 or even 800. At 500 AP and lvl 3 ult his base damage on ult is 850. With enough magipen he can ult and cut the HP on some of the enemy team by 1/2 to 1/3. It may also hit the enemy team with {{item:3116}} .\n\nIf people play smart, dont feed Karth then he can be burned down quickly. Leaving the immediate area and resetting the engage will still have him doing some damage to your team, but hopefuly avoid any deaths.\n\nLastly {{item:3026}} can help deal with him if isnt very strong but definitely a threat. Its another way to negate his ult as a killing tool. Its also a way to avoid giving him gold if he manages to take you down with his death passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JJI744","date":"2017-04-21T10:33:22.947+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should always try to capatilize off misplays, but \"hope your opponent is terrible\" is not good advice for how to play against a champion.

Especially with your jungler.  Pantheon is such a lane bully that if you're not playing specific anti-Pantheon champions (basically high armor tanks or characters with better range harass than him, such as Quinn) your best bet is to just farm, and talk to your jungler and team.  The worst thing to happen to me as a Panth main is a jungler camping my lane.  \n\nBut here's the thing, so long as you keep him from killing you and stay roughly even with your cs you win.  A Pantheon that doesn't have 3+ kills by the time mid-game starts is a Pantheon who is going to be having a very bad day.\n\nNow, because of his ult, if you're playing too passively for him, he may jump to other lanes.\n\nThis again, is countered by you talking to your team.  You MUST tell them that Panth has his ult up.  You MUST tell them when he hits 6.  Your job is to make him waste his ult jumping on someone who safely gets out of the way making him whiff his ult and about half his mana in the early game.  And allows you time to keep farming your lane.  \n\nKeep coordinating, keep talking, and stay safe.  Organize ganks with your jungler.  If he's a usual Panth player he will start taking greater and greater risks to get kills which you can try to capitalize on.  If he's smart and just tries to farm, hopefully you have gotten to the point where you can at least survive his burst and get out and back to heal and keep farming.\n\nAfter that, you've won.  Pantheon falls off incredibly hard.  If you make him money starved during the mid-game, his usual time to try and finish up a game or set up his allies to victory then you're basically now playing a 4v5.\n\nSadly, all of this depends on your allies willingness to listen to you.  Try to be polite, when giving your warnings and asking for help.  Try to let him push so he looks like a tempting target for your jungler.  And understand if there's something a bit more important than you currently in play (say a dragon fight) you're on your own.  Your job is just to survive.  It may not be fun.  It may be a pain in the ass, but know you're making that douchebag playing Pantheon on the other end not having fun either.
