Well, there's a small variety of ways to approach situations and fully develop Yi, in comparison to more wild types of duelists, a fully developed Yi who understand nearly every intricacy could tell you with full confidence there are so many better picks than Master Yi to fulyl master. Yi has about 2 styles to approaching a fight besides using the terrain: Run forward and slice things, or Alpha strike to avoid the CC and hope that the system doesn't decide the CC hits first. The difficulty in these approaches is the equivalent of running at somebody with a knife saying \"I'm going to kill you\"; not hard at all. Yi is one of the few champions i'd argue has the game's lowest skill ceiling in terms of just outright maximizing his potential. Compare it to {{champion:54}} , a champion who seems very binary but provides a wide variety of tactics to his assault: ulting in, picking off a target with his Q, buying {{item:3025}} and flashing with an E>AA>W>AA, or ulting in, or ulting back to defend his backline. Yi can't really do anything besides his alpha and rushing forward (without ult or not) and slicing. His W is generic sustain which makes his decent in the jungle, and the true damage to rip through ganks so his gimmick of slicing up targets works against almost all targets. Why use Yi when you could use {{champion:19}}, a champion with an equally low skill floor, but ridiculous skill ceiling with so many ways to approach ganks, be tanky while dealing damage, hunt down targets, provide tankiness or damage, or a variety of clearing and pathing. \n\nTo agree Jack, Yi's pretty binary. He doesn't have a lot to f*ck up besides his autoattacks, managing his alpha, and... that's about it. Positioning and prediction rely more on general game knowledge, something Yi introduces at a minimum for early on players until they can access and try difficult or different characters.
