In paragraph 2, it states: \n\n* Being a good team player begins at champion select. Be open minded when considering the needs of your team. If you're the last one to pick, try to fill a niche in your team that hasn't already been filled. If everyone's picked and something stands out as a deficiency in your team composition, try asking for another player to fill the gap, or change roles to embrace that responsibility yourself.\n\nWhether or not you _like_ that this is a rule is a different matter. But as it currently stands, selfishly troll picking a \"strategy\" that requires your entire team pick and play around your poor choice, and/or refusing to play your assigned role in any Draft mode just because you don't feel like it, _is against the rules._ Now, it will take multiple games of this to actually see punishment so if you wanna skirt the line every now and then, they won't catch you. But do it consistently like Nubrac did, and you will receive punishment. \n\nThis is not my _opinion_ on the matter. This is and has always been Riot's interpretation of their stated rules. Stay safe, and be a team player.\n****\n\nIt's exactly like following the chat rules. Whether or not you agree that calling people trash every game should warrant a punishment, it will.\n****\n\nEdit: I'd like to mention, if you want to do such a thing in Blind pick, where roles are not assigned, you could make a much stronger case for not following roles. But if you want to play either Draft mode, Normal or Ranked, then your duty to support your team begins by following your assigned role. Or at least asking if anyone will trade you and accepting their decision. \n\nIf you don't want your role assigned, then you're free to not play the Draft mode. As it goes, whether you decide to only play normal blind or decide you're fine getting punished for it, you'll miss out on the Victorious skin either way. The punishment you receive is the consequence you get for deciding not to be a team player. If it's worth more to you to get to be selfish, then by all means embrace the punishment you asked for.

Nightblue called his teammate a 'r%%%%%' and went afk from minute 12 (3 minutes which leaverbuster would deem as autoloss/punishment). You can say what you want, and trust me I play teemo support, but nightblue created a toxic environment. If someone in your team tilts you, and you go afk and call him a r%%%%%, you'll be banned. If Nightblue does it it's okay because muh it's only one game etc etc. Giving people a pass because they stream and have some influence is hypocrite as hell and it surely does not make the community a better place. \n\nThere's standards in place to avoid toxic environments altogether.

She gains no major powerspike at 6 compared to mages.\". Have you ever *played* Irelia? She gets a gigantic powerspike at level 6. You know that little cage of her? The one that gives her an instant mark for a Q reset, does a decent amount of initial damage, and also cuts off the primary escape route with further damage and a 90% slow? The one that you use in pretty much all burst combos because its better and more reliable than just her E? Yeah, turns out that thing is a serious powerboost. \n\nSecond, yes, TF cant use his usual level 6 teleport ganks in that scenario. But not for that reason, but for the simple reason that his bot is winning by default anyway. The situation is so lopsided that he has to do nothing to win. Thats quite huge for his team. \n\n\"Sivir CAN EASILY hold bot solo\", well, lets add Sivir to the pile of champs you talk about while having clearly no experience with them. No, of course Sivir cannot hold bot solo until she gets items. Her W does pathetic damage at level 1, and even her Qs waveclear is mediocre before she gets at least a BF sword. Instead what happens is *exactly* what we saw happen in the game. They get pushed in hard, lose a ton of CS and a lot of turret platings. The lane is lost by default.\n\nNow, if maybe mid got an actual advantage, that couldve maybe worked (though his refusal to communicate still makes it banworthy). Except mid didnt. He fell behind severely in xp and was just not a major factor anymore. Ontop of all of that, Teemo himself was useless, so it was a 4v5 with everyone far behind.\n\nHis team played the game. They lost hard and only went afk when the game was clearly over. And no, Teemo was easily griefing his team. He screwed over botlane, making Sivir, a scaling ADC, fall behind hard in CS and Platings, losing a lot of gold and basically making that lane lost. He screwed over midlane, making Irelia, a champ that *needs* levels be unable to get those levels. And he even screwed up his jungler by forcing him to play around botside meaning that toplane was easy pickings.\n\nAnd yet, the majority of players playing on the level where they would encounter this guy have come out clearly stating that yes, he *is* trolling and that they absolutely support the ban. Oh and worse yet? Turns out Riot investigated and found out, he only does this \"strat\" when playing with streamers, and when he plays this strat, his win rate is 38%.

Her ult is damage and a Q reset, but overall isnt much compared to her normally, as opposed to someone like annie who cant kill you until 6, or syndra or TF who gets a large teleport for free.

In fact its a much bigger spike than Tibbers is for Annie (who can in fact kill without tibbers quite easily, whereas Irelia will find that fairly difficult without her ult that early on).

They AFKd only once the score was 2-9, the enemy team had 2 turrets and 8 platins, the Sivir was a total of 50 CS down, the Irelia 2 whole levels down, and the enemy top and jungler fed as hell.

Im sure the Irelia and Sivir didnt try their heart out, and didnt just lose because of a hopeless situation they were thrust in. Im sure they put no effort into attempting anything, and the trolling teemo definitely was trying. They were berating him because they quickly realized he was going to lose them their game (or in one of their cases, has met the Teemo before and knows what he is doing). And he did. They tried, but when youre getting trolled, winning is hard. And its not like the Teemo is even subtle about it being trolling. Its intentional. Its only when high-profile streamers are there, and he knows its awful and makes his team far more likely to lose.\n\nIn fact, here is a fun exercise. Go into his recent games, and look at the teemo ones. Try to guess which ones were him actually trying, and which ones were trolling (hint, if you look at levels and CS, its easy). Then look which ones he wins, and which ones he loses.

Those times have changed. And though I will forever be the type of person to challenge the meta and the concept that the lanes need to be assigned in a certain way to begin with, Riot has indeed decided to limit the playstyle of a typical game by assigning a 1/1/1/2 layout. I wouldn't call that a meta anymore, I'd call it a template. It's part of the reason this game's become a meme.\n\nThat being said, the meta shifted to this template as early as season 2, and really hadn't changed all that much since. Riot attempted to force that change once by essentially trying to make bruiser/support or double bruiser bot a thing, which would've definitely changed the meta in the long run, but they determined after completely screwing adcs and making all games take 40 years (read, \"fuck the tank meta\") to instead  more or less lock in the current model.\n\nImo, that locking of a template is hurting their design space almost as much as the new runes setup and their items.\nThink about it that way, and you know why I personally don't like it. You see a new strategy like the \"support mid, funnel the jungle\" strat, and everyone now *loses their collective shit* about it until it's nerfed. You see Jungle Karthus making a comeback - nerfstick that, Karthus is a mid laner! Don't EVEN get me started on top - nobody, even riot, knows that the hell's going on up there. It's like the \"misc\" drawer for LoL at this point, and though people like me have the most fun with that sort of aspect of randomness, I understand the rage of top laners currently. In a game where every other lane only needs to know how to play 2-3 champs, and know how to play them *against* a few FotW champs that are more or less pick/ban for their lane, it's definitely not as fun being the guy who needs to know how to play about 5-7 champs against damn near 2/3 of the game that may potentially show up there.\n\nWhile I agree with the *concept* of abolishing this template and making the game feel more open again, I still do not agree with the means that were used in this one. There's a clear difference between fighting the meta, and just non-chalantly doing what you want without any regard for win/loss. Supporting mid in my book is not a troll tactic - that's fighting the meta. Supporting mid without telling anyone you're supporting mid, and not communicating a damn thing while everyone on your team is unable to comprehend what the hell it is you're working towards, is trolling.\n\nEven when I do insanely off-meta things like Hail of Blades mid Nami, I tell people straight up before locking it \"I plan to play pretty aggressive with my E in lane and just dominate early. I'll be building more for damage than for support, but I'll pretty much be a support by late game, so jng should pick for heavy dps. I'll try and roam a lot once I hit 6. If it seems like I'm failing, just gank mid a lot and take the farm, we'll play this as a boosting strat.\" A bunch of steps to say \"I know what I'm doing, and if it turns out I'm bad, here's what to do to cover for my dumb ass.\"\n\nIt's not \"permission.\" It's communication. There's a huge difference between the two. I agree with PF - you don't need your team's *permission* to play something. But if you're not going to take the time to explain what you're doing so people know how to work with or around it, then you're trolling them. And in a case like Nub vs NB3 here, if your off-meta tactic is going to affect multiple other people's usual sense of how to play, they definitely get a say in whether they feel comfortable trying it or not. I've had plenty of games where I've won by just being open about doing something wacky and my team doing really well with joining me. I've had just as many completely ruined by someone just locking something super off-meta and gallivanting around the game doing something only they understand. To anyone who doesn't get it, it looks like trolling.\n\nNB3 didn't get it - Nub looked like he was trolling. And he very well may have been. It's not exactly easy to say it was his intention to sabotage his team, but he did. And without communicating anything, it does surely look like he never planned to work with them from the start, which doesn't help his case.\n\n(EDIT: This is NOT a defense of NB3. I posted elsewhere - NB3's reaction looks EXACTLY like a classic PB shitpost, and we all know that like 90% of PB shitposts fall in line with \"yes, this was bad...but you're JUST as bad.\" So inb4 \"stfu NB3 fanboy!\" understand this is specifically my regards to Nub.
