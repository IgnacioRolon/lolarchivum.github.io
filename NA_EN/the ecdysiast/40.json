So yes the anivia would lose out on her W but then again so would the Talon. Also the animation isn't exactly short so you can easily stun him since you'll know exactly where he'll land. Chasing him and blocking him off though no will no longer work but that's what they want for him.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2016-10-19T22:08:33.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only one who has the option to stun him out of those 4 is Anivia. \n\nNo cooldown.
