That way he has to use the Q to heal if he wants lane sustain. \n\nEither way, he needs something to somewhat compensate taking away two of his strengths. \n*****\n\nEdit: More options I thought of.\n\n* Allow him to use his E again in a row if he attacks a champion during its AD steroid duration. \n* Buff the damage of his Q outside of the sweet spot.\n* Boost his healing or damage against targets chained with his W. \n\nSo many things that could be done besides just flat reverting the changes. And I mean just one of them. Obviously not all of them.

Seeing as they voted without commenting (which should definitely not be an option), that's all we can assume. \n\nBut yeah, I think so. Of course, there are plenty of other options. Increase the damage of his Q outside of the sweet spot, maybe even give him a second E if he attacks a champion within the duration for its AD boost.","replies":[]}]}]}
