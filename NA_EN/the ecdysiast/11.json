My issue with this is that it's strictly a stat nerf on top of a bunch of other nerfs to domination. That won't solve the underlying issues, it'll just keep the Electrocute champions who aren't Zed from being able to do their job. \n\nWhile there are several factors contributing to Zed&#039;s uncharacteristically safe laning phase despite being a melee assassin, I believe his ability to proc Electrocute from an incredible distance with effectively no resource cost is the most important. Contrast that to a very similar champion such as Leblanc, whose abilities also strike the enemy multiple times in single instances rather than DoT, and she doesn&#039;t have the luxury of them interacting incorrectly with Electrocute. \n\nHowever, I don&#039;t think we should nerf him or Electrocute. We should replace it with the original, far-more-versatile Thunderlord&#039;s. It would be better for more champions than simply taking Electrocute away from those who use it.\n*****\n\nElectrocute treating single casts of both his E and Q as separate was clearly not intended, as you can see by  the slight differences between it and Thunderlord&#039;s:\n\n* Thunderlord&#039;s allowed for a 3 second window between _each_ attack, for a total window of 9 seconds to apply it. This allowed champions without 3 damaging abilities (or with them on cooldown) the chance to proc it with auto attacks even at level 1. And it counted ticks of damage from DoT spells as separate instances, allowing champions who rely on such damage to apply it as well. \n\n* Electrocute, however, requires that all three attacks be done within 3 seconds, limiting the pool of champions who can use it drastically. And no longer counts damage from the same ability as separate instances, limiting it even further. \n\nAnd while some may say it was a problem that so many people brought Thunderlord&#039;s, that same problem wouldn&#039;t exist today. There other, more effective damage runes for other classes that simply didn&#039;t exist when Thunderlord&#039;s did. Fighters took Thunderlord&#039;s because Bloodlust wasn&#039;t great for them, for example. \n\n*******\n\nBut I do recognize that such a change would make Comet all but obsolete. My suggestion for that would be to combine Glacial Augment and Comet into a single rune, with the effect:\n\n* Damaging an enemy (by any means) hurls a comet at their location, _slowing_ them for 2 seconds and dealing damage. Damaging an enemy with an ability or active item effect reduces the cooldown.\n\nAnd, you know, come up with something to fill that third spot in the Inspiration tree.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2018-08-12T00:37:17.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Did you not read the friggin Electrocute Rework? 8.16 literally turns Electrocute into Thunderlord's.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2018-08-12T04:01:59.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did not.

The Marks applied for purposes of Thunderlord's decree EXPIRE SEPARATELY. spacing out hits did NOT allow you to 9 second a Thunderlord's Decree. After 3 seconds, your first mark expires. If there is 2 seconds between your first stack and second, the second stack will expire at 5 seconds. \n\nThe best result you could hope for was hitting 3 times within 3 seconds, because of this function.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2018-08-12T04:11:43.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.surrenderat20.net/p/current-pbe-balance-changes.html\n\nIt now basically does a little more damage than Thunderlord's, but with a higher cooldown at later levels.
