I&#039;m only advocating for a different method which doesn&#039;t see players getting their access to content they&#039;ve paid for removed, essentially having their money legally stolen from them since it&#039;s in the agreement. \n\nThere are two ways two control what is said in a game&#039;s chat: \nproactively, by enforcing a chat filter so that players aren&#039;t able to use offensive or hateful words in the first place, \nor reactively, by giving players the ability to be offensive or hateful and then punishing them afterwards. \n\nThe proactive approach is more conducive to a healthy online community. I don&#039;t just mean asterisks replacing words, but the words being impossible to send or even type in the chat to begin with. If the words are removed from the chat&#039;s capabilities, then it&#039;s impossible to say them. So no one can be hurt or offended in the first place. This would not only prevent the tilt caused by offense, like if someone were to call you shit, a lot of people would start to tilt, int, or even leave from that. But it would also prevent worse outcomes, like if someone tells you to kill yourself, it could have emotional effects outside of the game. Some people may even cause harm to themselves from getting such treatment in a game they use to escape their usual emotional pain. \n\nConversely, the reactive approach of punishing people after the fact is not conducive to a healthy community. People are still free to offend and hurt others,  just with the safeguard that they _might_ get their account banned for doing so, though most people who lend to this community being known as the biggest, most toxic one do so sparingly enough that they don&#039;t ever get punished. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that an approach like this is **ONLY** relevant to online chatrooms or game chats, and does not stretch to other aspects of life or law. This is one of the only situations where a proactive _approach_ is _**not**_ the same as a a proactive _punishment._ No one is _punished_ by a chat filter. It's akin to forcing people to wear seatbelts in a car, or taking a friend's keys if they're drunk, rather than getting the ticket for having no seatbelt or the DUI.

It's not the people who understand this is a game and know no one means any hurtful things they may say who report others. It's the people who aren't mature enough to understand that fact who do so, and it's them who need to be restricted like this. \n\nAnd like the other reply said, make it impossible to type single letters, albeit making it impossible to type single consonants would be enough. \n\nIf people will use abbreviations, then the obvious solution is to censor the abbreviations as well. \n\nI for one would say don't punish people for using the chat if it's going to exist with an optional filter. Since now almost everything related to the game state that you could be saying in chat, the chat is no longer required. \n\nBut since they likely wouldn't do that, I've suggested a better option than punishment.

The only way for a chat filter to do what you want it to do is literally make it the most obnoxious and frustrating thing ever, even for those who never curse and even then people still are able to bypass that sort of filter.\n\nSorry but no filter is going to stop anyone that really wants to be toxic. I have seen so many different types of filters and it's hilarious that you actually think that they do anything at all","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-23T01:30:01.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not being able to see trash wont make it less worthless or less destructive.\n\nPeople who got permed already proved they are incapable of behaving, there is no reason the trash should get special treatment at the cost of everyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2018-05-23T22:42:11.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People who get banned for chat are synonymous with people who go into ranked to int.
