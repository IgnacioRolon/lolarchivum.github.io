You are responsible for any emotions that arise from your incorrect interpretation of clear gaming terms. It also makes you look like a pansy when you whine about it. \n\nEdit: To address the counterargument that it's harassment if it's used that way: no, it is not. Even if used in conjunction with other things, like, \"wow, you should uninstall the game and kys,\" then the mention that they fed is still _not the part that is harassment._ If a player is mentioning k/d/a in an attempt to hurt someone's feelings, then it's most likely other things they say will in fact be against the rules. But simply mentioning it is by no means harassment. \nAnd here's the nail in the coffin as proof that it doesn't just become harassment because you feel it is:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player \n\"2) DO NOT REPORT A SUMMONER FOR USING STRONG BUT NON-DEROGATORY TERMS TO EMPHASIZE AN EVENT IN THE GAME\" The example given is, \"that tower fucked my harder than the entire Demacian navy.\" \n\n_Repeating_ the fact does not make it derogatory. Additional words may be derogatory, like if you add to it by saying, \"you fucking suck at Tristana, how did you feed an adc Darius?\" But \"Tristana fed Darius,\" is not. \nRiot removed the Spam report a while ago, so even spamming dragon's respawn timer when your jungler missed the smite is not harassment.

That makes no sense when it comes to objectively well defined terms (otherwise water could only possibly have qualities that either hydrogen or oxygen have), it makes even less sense when looking at subjective terms like \"harassment\" in the context of language; which is even more weird to define properly, given that it constantly changes (see the term \"literally\" as an example)","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2017-05-12T16:21:05.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your example doesn't fit the situation at all.

Which is too narrow to be fair when they should know from experience what people on the internet are mean. \n\nThose three things, even together, do not make it harassment. As far as punishment goes for words, it must be done on a completely objective purpose. The words themselves decide the meaning. Legal agreements are written so that the writing decides the agreement regardless of anything spoken out loud, so that there is something to refer to that both parties must agree upon.\n\nIt is unfair to the speaker to add the other player's misconstrued feelings to the definition of the terms.

I.e., Riot determines the meaning and context of a flagged player's words, and makes a judgment on that player. If it determines there is sufficient levels of toxicity, it'll issue a penalty.
