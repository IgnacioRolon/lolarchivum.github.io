If you just use his W to clear the Jungle (it's all he needs), then there's no issue. He's MEANT to have a limited mana pool, since HP is never a problem for him.

What you just suggested is ridiculously broken. Looking at your profile tells me that you're not even level 30. Please come back once you have a better understanding of the game. Warwick has weaknesses (like no ganks pre-6 and invades) to counteract his strengths. What he needs are one or two SLIGHT buffs to be relevant again.\n\nWarwick is not meant to nuke people, he's meant to deal sustained damage while staying healthy in a teamfight.

It isn't hard to sweetspot attacks, and this would still rival Hecarim's ult because it has range and a lower cooldown. Not only that, but it challenges Sejuani's ult as well. Once again, Warwick's identity is that of a tank that has immense sustain at the cost of CC. You cannot start tacking on Crowd Control and expect that sustain to stick around.

His W is still quite strong in team fights or to push towers/secure Dragons. And his ultimate, yeah it's less useful, but he still does want he wants to do with it. WW can't 1v1 with his ult and ensure a kill anymore, unless fed. But that's fine. That would be toxic. Instead he needs a team follow up.\n\nWhat he still does well:\n-Early clears: duh\n-Early Dragons: a bit slow, but easily done at level 4, if not earlier. Just gotta watch the map\n-Duels: not an ensured kill with his ult, but you probably won't kill him if even on levels\n-Teamfights: isolate a priority target, sustain off them. W in fights goes largely unnoticed, but it's helpful\n-Pushes towers: his waveclear isn't anything exciting, but then towers disappear. Especially with team help\n-Itemizing: he has his optimal build path, but he actually has a variety of itemization paths. I prefer BoRK 1st, or 3rd\n\nWhat he doesn't do well:\n-Gank pre 6: duh\n-Move about the map: lacks mobility. I use MS Quints for this\n-Stick to targets: blue smite/MS Quints help\n-Early dives: even at 6, it's iffy. Much easier later on you have armor\n\nAs for his kit, it's not toxic. It's just outdated. It's not interactive, fairly binary, and also pretty easy mode. WW's predictable in what he does, and QSS nullifies his engage.\n\nI'll elaborate on any of these points as I'm needed to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SleepyLionCub","date":"2015-04-23T01:31:43.729+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"His ult should do physical damage. \n\nIt's so weird that it does magic damage  for multiple reasons. \n\n1.

And not depends at all of the enemy because he can beat any other jungler, but Xin and Udyr are \"decent\" duelist that can put troubles on him.\n\nIf you know how to play the champion, you will NEVER have mana issues with him. Don't use Q in the Jungle (farm with W) and only use it to finish off a foe. It makes him stop for an extended period of time, allowing the enemy time to escape. You don't know what mana problems are until you play Amumu, who almost always needs blue: regardless of your mana management.\n\nAmumu only has a slightly bigger pool than Warwick, but ALL of Amumu's abilities have bigger costs than his:\n\n* Bandage Toss costs 10 more mana at ALL ranks\n\n* Despair exceeds Hunter's Call in cost after 4 seconds (while Hunter's Call still has 2 more seconds to go)\n\n* Tantrum has a mana cost of 35 (thus exceeding WW's free-to-toggle Blood Scent)\n* \n* At rank 1 the two ults cost the same, rank 2 CoTSM costs 25 more, and rank 3 it costs 50 more\n\nAmumu may have a bigger mana pool than Warwick, but Warwick has better base mana regeneration. Once again, Warwick's mana pool is the least stressed of ANY champion if you know how to use him. His clear is incredibly cheap in the Jungle, saving most of his pool for ganking. You should almost always back after ganking anyway.\n\nNow, if you say that I cannot compare their kits, let me just say this.\n\nWarwick has better focused damage, so in a teamfight he can lock down the ADC easily. Amumu has very poor focused damage, so he RELIES on his teammates to finish what he starts. Curse of the Sad Mummy does not keep the ADC from attacking (Infinite Duress does).\n\nTheir clear speeds are about the same, however Warwick will have more mana and HP coming out of the Jungle (he doesn't need abilities to clear, Amumu does). Amumu also has to take pots and Ranger's Trailblazer to sustain his clears. Oh, and I'm assuming that they are both using ONLY W to clear, since that's all they SHOULD ever use (unless they have Blue, obviously).\n\nAmumu does have better AoE damage, but can go OoM if the teamfight goes long. He needs mana for his only gapcloser, so cleaning up might be hard. Besides having a targetted gapcloser, Warwick also has one that is completely free (Blood Scent); cleaning up is easy considering he stays healthy throughout the fight.\n\nWhile Amumu has MUCH better pre-6 ganks, Warwick can secure an early Dragon at level 3 or 4. Amumu will take a lot of damage to Dragon at any and all stages of the game.\n\nThey are both weak to early invades, but later on Warwick has a better 1v1.\n\nNow, I'm kind of insinuating that Warwick is strictly better than Amumu. This would be true (and was true) until the meta allowed tanks with teamfighting kits to become relevant again. AoE damage and CC which is seen on Amumu, Gragas, Sejuani, Zac, Malphite, Sion, or Maokai is favored right now, and teams are picking and banning accordingly. Warwick, Skarner, or Shyvana don't have this, which is why the current \"tank meta\" has left them out of the Jungle (Shyvana is instead a toplane monster).","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-29T19:09:01.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I built Frozen Heart on WW so I don't have mana issues after that, but Warwick mana pool its very low...","replies":[{"poster":"PalPlays","date":"2015-04-30T21:18:55.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Venowolf,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NWP3Ui8E,comment-id=0002000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-29T19:09:01.420+0000)\n>\n> I built Frozen Heart on WW so I don't have mana issues after that, but Warwick mana pool its very low...\n\nIt's low, but once again (if you read my post at all) his mana costs are extremely low when compared to other champions.
