It&#039;s just... not normal for League. If someone wants to call you bad, they call you bronze, a feeder, boosted, or even just trash. But it&#039;s only people who started within the last year or so that think it&#039;s normal to say noob.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-18T00:22:21.160+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iron memes are on the rise, bronze is the new challenger.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-12-18T02:34:18.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't call them noobs.

I dont use newb as an insult, its just a state of being. Its not some trendy cool thing to say, its just a fuckin word. If youre new, youre a newb, not trash, not bronzie.
