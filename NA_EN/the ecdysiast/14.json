It&#039;s just that all towers were weakened and bot&#039;s happens to be the most accessible to the enemy team. \n*Note that it isn't often the bottom tower is taken within the first 5 minutes. Fortification serves only to make sure top and mid don't go down from a single kill. \n\nAll they&#039;d need to do to fix this is increase that one tower&#039;s defenses and damage. There shouldn&#039;t just be &quot;risk&quot; involved in a 4-man gank, with a chance someone might die if they&#039;re stunned while getting targeted  by the tower. It should be a guaranteed trade of 1 kill for the tower and most likely the dragon.  \n\nSomething like the third or fourth tower shot from the bottom lane outer turret being a guaranteed kill would suffice. Since at the point where a tank should be able to survive 4 normal tower shots, that turret _should_ be long since destroyed.","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2017-01-28T00:19:32.347+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, you're wrong. \n\nThe bot lane tower IS weaker. \n\n>     Unique Passive - Fortification: 50% damage reduction from all sources, this effect expires after 5 minutes. (Reduction applies before armor.)\n    (Fortificationâ€™s damage reduction does not apply to bottom lane turrets.) \n\nRiot intentionally did this so that teams are more likely to press and contest the bottom lane tower instead of abandoning it in order to lane swap and trade their bottom lane tower for the top lane tower. \n\nAnd it isn't defenseless. \n\nThere are two players guarding it.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2017-01-28T00:29:02.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Doesn't happen before 5 minutes. It was not implemented to force bot tower as an objective, it was implemented so that top and mid don't get destroyed within 5 minutes from a single kill. \n\nThe point still stands. \n\nAnd ignoring the two enemies attacking it is a lazy argument. Besides, the issue isn't the enemy bot lane. It's the 4 and 5 man ganks that lead to a guaranteed acquisition of a second objective at the same time. \n\nYou could actually put some input into the suggestion instead of ignoring the known problem via information that is already a given and is already proving to be part of the issue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-28T00:23:50.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All this madness started when riot decided to enforce meta by making bot turret a forced objective.","replies":[]}]}
