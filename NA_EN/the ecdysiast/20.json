I wanted to mention some experience I&#039;ve had with Riot. \n\nWell, not me personally since I have never once been punished on any account, but my brother who has had several accounts banned because he likes to make ridiculous names and jokes about Lucian and Ekko that are in poor taste. \n\nI&#039;ve seen the emails with Riot Support, and they will outright lock the ticket and ban you from making additional tickets if you even _mention_ taking legal action against them for the false claims they make in and regarding their &quot;agreement&quot;, as the thread I mentioned pointed out. They&#039;re afraid, but unfortunately player opinion on the mute function is so biased towards banning people who hurt your feelings instead of doing the right thing and protecting yourself in the first place, that they can get away with stealing from teenagers with no repercussions. \n\nThis doesn&#039;t effect me, since I abide by their &quot;rules&quot; anyway, nor does it effect a majority of players. But for those poor souls who get treated unfairly by the system, there&#039;s no way out. What are they going to do? Go up against a huge game company, spending thousands in legal fees, over maybe 1000 bucks? No court would take that seriously.","replies":[]}
