And that's mainly a product of it being composed of 3 items. But while the vast majority of items are composed of two tier 2 components, and must make up between 700-1100g with combine cost, Trinity Force gives you stats during that time. \r\n\r\nIf anything, Sheen and Phage should have their stats and cost reduced, with Trinity having its combine cost increased. Though that's just one suggestion.\r\n\r\nI just don't think it's going to be okay to _reward_ Garen for already building the wrong item, just because the item is so much better than the intended one on everyone who builds it.","replies":[{"poster":"Jimmy Rustles","date":"2019-08-16T20:24:08.986+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldn't garen building TF over BC say something more about BC being crap since very few bruisers build it anymore","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-08-17T01:01:04.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes. \n\nThat's why it needs to be changed, and Cleaver needs to be more suited to the class it's intended for. The fact they're no so strong they can simply ignore building their core item in favor of one with less defense is the issue. They should be fixing Cleaver, too. \n\nNevermind that this would also stop other fighters from having such a strong mid-item advantage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-08-16T23:27:09.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"BC isn't crap, Riot has been making strange balance decisions regarding its users that have made it continuously less desirable to its original demographic.
