But make them realize chromas are not worth so much of your money. You wouldn&#039;t pay $100 for a King-sized candy bar, why pay that much for a $2 chroma? \n\nAt the very least, we need to show them that the Prestige theme needs to actually include changes to the model and animations, actually making it a different skin. Something an amateur can do in three hours is far below the standard they&#039;ve set.\n\n######*Just pointing out that it's not literally gold, so it's indistinguishable from brass color-wise.
