And I say \"for a time\" because no one owned DotA, the devs come and go on the fly all the time since it's an open-sourced mod. I have no idea how many heroes they made on the DotA mod during their extended stay but it's possible that when they made League, maybe some minor ripoff happens sure, what's more interesting to see is that if they only \"blatantly ripped off\" the heroes they themselves had created.\n\nIcefrog, the de facto owner of DotA to many, did not design the vast majority of the mod. He was just the last dev of DotA mod. \n\nBut somehow people see Icefrog as the owner of DotA, which is like 90% he didn't make himself. And we hound Riot for ripping off the things they'd contributed greatly in creating in the fist place.\n\n..........\n\nAlso, even old Blizzard has always been ripping off games left and right. They were just really good at marketing and polishing their games; originality was never their strongest suit if you look retrospectively.\n\nWarcraft nicked the Warhammer. Starcraft nicked the Warhammer 40k and Command &amp; Conquer. Diablo is I guess the only original IP in their \"Big Three\" but it's based on well established Abrahamic myths so it's not like it's that new; the gameplay was the real innovative part at the time tho I can give it that. WoW was a ripoff of Everquest. \n\nAnd Overwatch, another actually original entry unironically coming from the new Blizzard, is about a cast of diverse \"no-stereotype\" characters that's full of blatant stereotypes.","replies":[{"poster":"MichealasCheeks","date":"2019-07-21T06:15:06.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tldr","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-07-21T06:22:31.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"....

I was placed exactly 4 tiers lower then what i ended with last month. After 1 game  a win i am now at bronze 3. Exactly 4 tiers lower then what it said i was a month ago. You know whats funny enough? You can only possibly go up 4 tiers during placements.  After my second win. both games S or above so its not like i played bad im now bronze 3 with 48lp. whats this mean? I was placed to where i could get even to where i was before or lower then but not ahead. If they are going to do this kind of system it would make sense to start where you ended last season. Not just place people so they can only climb to even or less then what they had last season in placements.  After talking to about 10 other people at all levels its the exact same thing. except above diamond.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ã‡hÃ¥ryzÃ¥rd","date":"2019-01-26T17:17:20.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I don't understand is do you get like a different rank based on what roles you play?\n\nFor example, I'm projected Bronze 1 for mid and Silver 3 for support.\n\nDo I just have 2 different ranks?
