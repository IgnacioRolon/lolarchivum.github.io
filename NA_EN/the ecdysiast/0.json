THEN it should have been decided whether or not she was too tanky/fast to have a low-aoe 0.75s knockup with the base damage of a single adc auto attack.

They want to play the champion and game they signed up for. I still miss my AP Kog from S4. They don't want it to be turned into something else they don't enjoy when it's perfectly functional as is. \n\nWhat if I really liked chess and when I sign up for a chess tournament I find out that it's actually for checkers and mislabeled? This game has no stability and it feels bad to invest serious time into understanding it, maining some champs, finding your favorite items and builds or even your favorite role. \n\nEvery few months you guys make all of this investment nearly worthless. Even after you do supposed reworks or item changes, they get rehashed another dozen times so there's zero trust that I will still have the game I enjoy, the items I want, etc. in another few months. Any normal game like poker, tennis, Starcraft (much more mechanically intense though) etc. I can have some confidence that my investment isn't flushed down the toilet every few months. \n\nI know there are some problems now and there's a lot of work to still do on this game for various champs, roles, items etc. but I hope there's some sort of end in sight for the frequency of high impact changes. Fix what you need. Change what you need but eventually let me actually enjoy a balanced game where I can find my preferences instead of being at the whim of the meta forced by so many nonstop changes. The game wasn't changing this radically all the time even from S4 to S5 when I was really getting into it. \n\nOnce things are more settled, let the meta develop more organically and step in only if it's clear certain strategies are out of line or severely underperforming. If next year is going to continue to be this disruptive, I don't think I can take it seriously and invest so much time anymore. It fees like I'm punished for caring and studying the game.

But I'll try to be a bit more constructive than that.\n\nI'll start with the one point where I agree: yes, if you're enjoying a single champ with a single specific playstyle, you've no guarantee that they'll keep the same for a long time. And yes, even though it's not my case, I do understand that it's painful and frustrating. That would actually be a reason for me to leave the game.\n\nBut you don't HAVE TO main a single champ with a single playstyle. You can main a same champ through different meta and adapt to different playstyles. Even something as simple as Garen of all things has gone through 3 or 4 main builds over the last 2 years, and it can be fun exploring and learning even after hundreds of games on a champ. It can also be fun exploring and innovating and beating people thanks to your innovation. **Things changing is not necessarily a negative.**\n\nAnd things changing doesn't mean your \"investment is flushed down the drain\", that's just a plain, gross exaggeration. If the build you mained is nerfed or fall out of flavor, there is still another build taking its place, and as a main of your champion, you should have a much easier time adapting to it than someone who's just trying to pick up the new flavor of the month.\nLikewise if it's the champion who's affected instead of the build. If you played a Juggernaut or an ADC or a Burst Mage to hell and back, even if they are reworked and you don't enjoy them anymore, you should have an easy time picking up another Juggernaut, ADC or Burst Mage that you enjoy more and that you'll learn pretty quickly based on your experience with similar champs.\n\nAnd on top of all that, whatever the champ you're playing, LoL strategies and macro-play principles always stay the same, and if you master it, it will stay with you no matter what champ you end up picking. Saying that LoL 8.10 is to LoL 5.7 or whatever what checkers is to chess is a ridiculous analogy. The details change all the time, but the core of the game is always the same.\n\nAlso, the game wasn't changing as much in S4 / S5? That's rose-tainted glasses right there, you might wanna re-read the Patch notes of that time. I barely had learned the S4 Jungle that it changed all over again in S5. The game was *always* changing.\n\nEDIT: oh and what's that comment about chat even mean?

Give him some Q buff that helps his laning in terms of trading better and healthy rather than **WAIT** for his Q off CD and not interact with the enemy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2018-05-10T05:49:01.462+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, their balance changes don't go through real safety tests, the PBE is only capable of testing bugs.

Riot has a bad and stupid habit of trying to make champions cover everything which just pushes champions who specialize in anything in a bad place because league is a game that is supposed to change based on what people decide to do in the game thus people who can handle any situation to a moderate degree are always gonna beat out specialist champions who can only do one thing.\nand that is exactly what this change was for to try to push poppy in a more general can handle anything state but Unlike when they buff mages and adcs they didnt give her what they wanted to give her then nerf the other parts if it was too strong they just nerfed her numbers and  gave her a bit of range. But they didnt give her range on what she needed it most on the push part of her E not the intial range of the E. The E range increase is an overall nerf because poppy needed that movement speed to get her casted and the tankyness after the casting to fight. the cast of the E is the same but its a nerf to every other situation you use the movement speed form W for engageing without e, getting passive, running away. And a nerf to her in fight tankyness.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DW Diana","date":"2018-05-09T18:17:28.331+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maple Nectar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4vxqEyPe,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-05-09T18:08:37.905+0000)\n>\n> SolCrushed - the designer on the Poppy VGU had wanted to do those changes for awhile, and got some time after Irelia shipped.

It doesn't _feel_ like an ultimate ability. It's a simple 0.75 second knock up on a really long cool down with incredibly low damage.\n\nI think there should be a decision process involved in choosing to either fully charge her ult or snap cast it. Currently the decision is to either use a real ultimate ability or to use a budget Alistar/Aatrox Q that does 100 damage on a 140 second cool down. That doesn't feel good to use; it feels like you're trolling when you snap cast it.\n\nIn closing, I think ults should feel impactful and distinct from basic abilities. In my opinion, Poppy's snap cast does not fit either category.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlueHeart","date":"2018-05-09T22:14:23.073+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"So i dont want to sound like an asshole, or be mean, but what about the outcries of the poppy mains who said they didnt want this? There was more then 1 post that said that these changes were at best mixed among us. And many even claimed that these changes made her weaker (the current drop is around 2% in winrate) so why ignore us? why not talk to us? After videos from the likes of Huzzygames and and RossBoomSocks, i felt riot was going in the direction of \"We want feedback\" hell the other day i even got a feedback flag asking why i played maokai, yet again we get barely a scrap of return feedback. Why isnt such feedback mention in its own devblog called Feedback Responds. So that we KNOW that you guys actually heard us when we (be it the poppy mains, the ADC players or the Mage players) Have had our concerned noted and if nothing else a counter argument/thought process given back. You guys want feedback with your changes. We so do we. we WANT to know what the thought process is and WANT to know if things like, \"We feel the MS nerf to poppy is not compensated by the E increased Range\" Is heard, noted and then ask for what could help. Why cant we get the feedback, for our own feedback? cuz with this whole poppy thing, myself and many other poppy players feel IGNORED and again not trying to be an asshole, but its REALLY FUCKING FRUSTERATING to feel like im talking to an abyss that is more than willing to take my thought and then do NOTHING with it and note even reply to why. Of course replying to each individual comment 1 by 1 is not effective or even possible, but when somebody makes a 7 PAGE ESSAY that is the combined thoughts of MANY poppy players and it gets read and not even acknowledged that it was read, does that not feel like a waste of time, and put some of us in a state of why the hell would i even give you feedback when you wont listen to it anyway? there is a trade going on here, we give YOU feedback, and you give us the acknowledgment that such feedback lead to such a change. or that such post was considered and heres X reason why that doesnt work but what do you think of XYZ solution? transparency is a word that continues to be thrown around for how opaque riot has been. if you want GOOD feedback then PLEASE give us some in return, thats how talking planning and discussions work, replies keep conversations going. Sure im not Redmercy IreliaCarriesU Gbay Huzzy or some other youtuber, but they are high players who are polling information from vast audience and being our speakers, so when somebody like isajohoff makes a huge essay and surveys almost ever member of the poppy mains discord youd think that we could at least get a comment saying this was read and considered.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2018-05-10T05:58:16.246+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My question is why the change was overall nerfs, with range buffs disguised as compensation. The explanation we got on the patch note was that the goal was to give her more strength on the things she can only do once a fight starts in exchange for the losses on higher-duration/passive aspects of her W. But the changes weren't buffs to the damage of her passive or the duration/damage of her E, but rather the ranges of both.\n\nAnd while I'll concede that a range buff to the E does follow that line of reasoning, the loss of movement speed on the W makes it so that it is far more difficult to get within that range in the first place. As for the passive, it directly contradicts that line of reasoning, as the nerf hinges on the idea that she should be in the thick of combat. But giving her no damage increase/scaling on the passive, opting instead for a slight buff in range doesn't actually do anything unless you want to cheese norms with a rapid firecannon Poppy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Let Me Bot Pls","date":"2018-05-09T23:23:31.066+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think she still needs to be stronger than that even, shes very weak for a top lane right now.

This is what we don't understand. She's not a good tank since tank items and runes are nerfed, she's not a good brusier there are tons who have better CC and damage, and she's not a good support.
