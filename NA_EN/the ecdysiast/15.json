But in this game, _most often_ doesn&#039;t imply _most effective,_ and even then, most effective doesn't imply _effective._\n\nAnd she&#039;s suffered because of it. Her performance against counters is terrible compared to her performance against champions she&#039;s supposed to counter. (roughly 58% loss rate vs. only 54% win rate)\n*****\nI personally like a more damage-oriented Poppy. It hearkens back to her pre-rework &quot;pick someone and shove your lollipop in their chocolate factory&quot; playstyle. But they aren&#039;t going far enough to make her focus damage. Her passive should have some kind of damage scaling, at least. Even if that means reducing the shield.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-29T01:33:14.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Total AD scaling just means even less incentive to build AD, since you get less percentage increase for buying it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2018-06-29T01:57:38.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"korean poppy","replies":[]}]}
