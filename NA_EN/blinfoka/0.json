While additionally making the loading screen cooler. Which I thought Rito games was all about. But what Rito games is actually all about these days is cutting corners and putting 10% into everything while charging a 100% mark up compared to everyone else because Rito Games is like that x3.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Clair de Lunee","date":"2016-12-01T03:25:59.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you receive it as a gift, do you still get the boarder?
