Before the server moved I used to get 40 ping. Which that was around a year or so ago? At the moment I currently get 96 and it DOES NOT drop below this at all. Even if I have nobody home on the internet it doesn't go below that. Around 10 months ago I used to get around 60 ping. Then around 6 months ago I used to get 86 and it wouldn't drop below that. Now I am stuck at 96 and it doesn't go below that. I would love to find a way to make my ping drop atleast to 60 again. The game is very hard to play atm because this ping is rather unbearable.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-14T22:16:14.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Latency (ping) is the measure of how long it takes for your connection to hit the servers.
