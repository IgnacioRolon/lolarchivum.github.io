Before we had rune pages each cost either 6300 IP or 590 RP, now RP is a form of real currency it can buy things, it can be bought. The value of 1 RP is ~ 0.006€ so 1 rune page is ~ 3.58€. Now for example I had bought 2 rune pages (on top of the 2 I already had.) so for me its's a loss of ~7€ which isn't a lot but if you think most players have more than 2 rune pages the number of money they gain from this is actually quite large. From past statistics League has ~40 000 000 active players. If even 1/2 of them have bought runes this would mean riot is actually scamming tens of millions in real money by not refunding rune page's to RP. What do you think? I'll take it as proof if this is deleted.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-09T21:38:18.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The rune pages weren't refunded since you can still use all of the ones you bought to create new rune pages. With that being said, we *did* give everyone some skins based on how many they had bought, rounded up. So even if you only bought one page you still got something.","replies":[]}]}
