It then gains an \"ice blue light\" after learning the skill to indicate it is active.\n---\n---\n\nThis skin concept has been brought up before (and a few of you may have already seen it), but I think it deserves more spotlight because it&#039;s just TOO damn good. A lot of other Vayne players have been expecting something badass for a long time since none of her current skins particularly stand out, but have been disappointed yet again by a release of another mediocre skin (Sorry rito but we&#039;re looking at Arclight)\n\nIt might be a while before she gets her next skin, but the idea remains incredible. It doesn't have to be called Pulsefire (can be Project: Vayne or whatever); this art is mainly to show how a mech&#039;d-up, futuristic Vayne (in heels!) would look; and I personally think that this theme suits her more than anyone else. I see a lot of potential for this to be a legendary or even an ultimate skin.\n\n\n**Edit 2:** I know she isn&#039;t a particle-heavy champion to begin with, this skin might just give her that &#039;spark&#039; that she needs by shooting laser beams instead of arrows.\n---\nDisclaimer: Not my work.

(I have seen Unprepared Garen plenty though, I try to keep up with as much as I can)\n\nWithout her dark hair/ponytail, tri-tip cape or high collar she doesn't really read as Vayne, I think she needs at least a couple of these features to be retained. I really like the big chunky weapon and Dead Space/Terran Ghost design language - I wish we could do something like that for a bunch of our champions.\n\nA pulsefire/ghost skin makes the most sense on Caitlyn, but I think an early exploration of that concept ended up as Headhunter Caitlyn if I'm not mistaken.

Although if this is supposed to be a legendary or an ultimate skin, isn't she supposed to have a completely different feel? (Forecast Janna or Omega Squad Teemo completely changed their personalities.) Not to mention, if the idea is supposed to be futuristic, I think a cape would look out of place.\n\n\nAlso, a question: What does it normally take for a skin concept to get implemented? 3 Rioters so far commented on the concept (IronStylus: http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2011340&page=33) and the past thread garnered almost 1100 upvotes (see link in original post)\n\nWhat exactly are you guys looking for in this subsection?","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-04-21T05:02:06.602+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess the difference is that you still recognise Omega Squad Teemo as Teemo, and Forecast Janna is definitely Janna, but I don't recognise this character and go 'oh that's Vayne'. Maybe Quinn or... gender swap PFE? She doesn't need ALL of her defining qualities, but she does need some of them. Maybe keep the hair blonde but make it closer in silhouette to her base hair style, or feature a sfi-fi version of her collar etc. It's true as Saixos Yewark says in his post that the animation and pose goes a long way to making a character recognisable and that's something we discuss on the skins team a lot - just how far can we push things when it comes to identifying the champion?\n\nI'm fairly new to the team, but when it comes to implementing concepts we usually have a direction or specific theme in mind when we start concepting and from there the team makes decisions as a whole about which direction to move in until we hit on something we are all really excited about executing on. The direction/theme and the champion are some times quite broad (come up with some champions that would fit into skin line \"X\") and other times very narrow (design \"X\" skin for \"Y\" champion). If it's broad and we are exploring some different options then we will often bring up fan concepts as a potential launching point (this surprise party fiddlesticks idea is amazing and popular, I'm going to do some designs on that theme and pitch them) or even just as a good talking point (maybe there is a theme that would work with another champion, or a theme we don't want to pursue but want to talk about why not). \n\nI feel the need to clarify that the boards aren't for submissions - we aren't 'looking for' anything. Not all Rioters are active on the boards either. Rather it's a place to share great ideas and art with other players that love the game as much as you do. I've been on the boards/forums since I started playing and I am one of those players that love the game, I'm just a Rioter now as well. I want to post often and sincerely because I remember what it is like before I was working on the other side of the curtain. Having said that I'm always checking the boards and other sites for awesome concepts and when I find one I definitely bring it up with the team because the community has kick ass ideas.","replies":[{"poster":"Zeref","date":"2015-04-21T13:19:20.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, I wasn't expecting an in-depth explanation but I do appreciate it.\n\nThanks for clearing everything up though.
