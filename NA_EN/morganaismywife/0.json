Bad enough we barely get any Noxus or Void stuff(actual void stuff, not just Kaisa) Remember the conflict with Kass and Malz? Hell do you guys even remember that you have champs like Yi who gets no love in anything? Wasn’t he your star character years ago? \r\nThat Darius comic was great! Why stop there? “Alright guys we added in one Noxus character. That’s our quota so let’s make skins for Akali and make another Ionian champ” \r\nHell even Ekko and the Shadow Isles will get their own game!\r\n\r\nRemember The Black Rose?\r\nWhat’s going on with Morde and Noxus?\r\nRemember General DuCouteau? Talon just stopped looking for him right? Is he dead? Oh no that’s not important. Garen and Kat making love jokes is important! You still haven’t made that official btw. The teasing is annoying.

Maybe it has to do with the market, maybe the designers in their teams are simply more excited about investigating Ionian themes, I don't know. But it can't really be denied that the bias is there if Ionia already has 19 champions in total while over half of the regions in game can't even break the 10 champion threshold.\n\nAlso they kinda have shown that Ionia gets alot of special treatment.\nWhen we got Urgot and Warwick as VGUs from Zaun, Riot told us that they are taking a break now from Zaunite thematics because they have released these 2 so close to one another.\n\nWhich I thought is fine back then. Then the same happens with Ionia, Akali and Irelia get reworked close to each other. Such statement that they will take a break from Ionia has never been made.\nOther regions have to wait up to 6 years for a new champion release, Ionia never had a waiting time even close to that one. And Ionia can still claim to be the only region which got **3 champion releases back to back** with Kayn, Xayah, and Rakan.\n\n________________________________\n\nIt just feels really discouraging as a fan of other regions of the game to see that Ionia is getting so much more love than any other part of their world.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2020-01-27T09:11:05.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ionia lends itself a bit more towards having tons of subfactions though, because all the other factions either have either a central city(or are just one city). The only exception outside of Ionia(and Bandle and the void, who are more like places of origin) is the freljord, but even there you've got 3 main tribes.\nBut Ionia doesn't have that, its very base structure is made up of small subfactions.\n\nWith that being said, I do think that they could start to put more focus on some of the subfactions of the other factions(like Buhru in Bilgewater, the fighters pit in Noxus, or heck any of the noxian/demacian territories that aren't the main city). It will likely not be as many as Ionia has, but there can certainly be done more with them.\n\nAnd I agree that ultimately Riot is biased. The most egregious thing about that statement, about taking a break from Zaun due to it getting 2 reworks in a row, was that it was made after ionia got 3 new champions in a row and was followed up by ionia getting 2 VGUs in the next year.\n\n*sigh* at least Ionia didn't get anything big in 2019....","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2020-01-27T14:31:58.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really get why you think that having a capital (or as a region be a city like Zaun and Piltover) necessarily means that there is less potential for subfactions.\n\nFor example, if you consider the 3 tribes of Freljord as own subfactions, then literally every big clan of Piltover and every Chembaron of Zaun can be considered an own subfaction.

With some help from LB and Vlad(who already had some experience in having enough of some evil lord's rule and killing that lord). Now he is back and wants his Immortal Bastion back, and the remaining world as a bonus. Sure, this isn't resolved really, but you cant expect Riot to show us how Mordekaiser solo clears the whole Noxus, or how united powers of Swain, Vlad, LB and Noxian armies managed to kill him again. They are a champions of the actual game and can't just die in lore.\n> \n> Yes, I do. No, Talon didn't stop, he just haven't found him yet. We don't know, perhaps he will appear later as a champion or in some other champion's lore\n> \n> The teasing and \"not making it official\" is why this is so popular discussion topic. Nobody cares about Xayah/Rakan making love jokes, there isn't much to discuss\n> \n> I would say most of them DO have a personality. Irelia, Zed, Shen, Yasuo, even Akali. And those who don't really have much just didnt have a way to show it, being somewhat old and outdated, like Lee or Wukong\n> \n> Skins don't give money just because they are made on a certain champion. If a skin was sold a million times, this means that a million players now have a bit more fun playing League, which is not bad by itself.\n\nActually about Morde, they said they will kill champions in the future. That doesn't mean they won't still exist in the game however","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Camille Ferrøs","date":"2020-01-27T02:16:55.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not only annoying that one region is getting this much but the others getting neglected is bad.
