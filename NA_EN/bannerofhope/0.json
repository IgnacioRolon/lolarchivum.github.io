This may be the last time I can access my account. Attempting to switch emails sends a email to the problem account, and now my password is saying invalid password. It makes absolutely no sense. If Riot cannot fix this problem and switch my email address then just ban this account since I will not be able to use it again. It's a painful procedure attempting to change emails when your primary email address was hacked. The only thing they did was remove the verified status off the email, but it does absolutely nothing when the email can change all the other data on the account. I spent a couple years playing this game and is now switching my emails because of said hacking. If any Riot personnel can please switch my email account or at least revert my password back to before today, that would be great. I'll attempt to stay on for as long as I can, but there are only so many hours that I can wait.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-22T16:11:05.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can help out with this!
