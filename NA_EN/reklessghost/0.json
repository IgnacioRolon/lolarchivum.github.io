I downloaded the game from the LoL website, opened the .dmg file and copied the launcher to the applications folder.  I launch the game from the applications folder (not the dock) and I see the LoL splash screen and then nothing.  Sometimes I get the white dot but sometimes I do not.  I checked the activity monitor and I see the UserKernel is not responding.  I have tried sitting there at that screen for 15+ minutes and nothing changes.  The game will not open.  I also tried downloading a fresh copy of the game and that had no effect.  I get the same behavior.  I added an exception to the apple firewall for LoL to allow all incoming connections but there was no change.  I also tried running as root and this is what I got:\r\n\r\n> Craigs-MacBook-Pro:Applications craig$ sudo League\\ of\\ Legends.app/\r\n> Password:\r\n> sudo: League of Legends.app/: command not found\r\n> Craigs-MacBook-Pro:Applications craig$ sudo /Applications/League\\ of\\ Legends.app/Contents/MacOS/RiotMacContainer\r\n> Craigs-MacBook-Pro:Applications craig$ 2017-01-01 13:35:28.566 UserKernel[1656:125043] WARNING: nextEventMatchingMask should only be called from the Main Thread!
