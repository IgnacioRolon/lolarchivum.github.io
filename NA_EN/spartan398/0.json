As my league of legends client becomes unresponsive and freezes even in mid animation of movement on the league client. This is especially cumbersome when I try to play a game as draft queue will go by and then during champion  select the client will seize up and not allow me to click on anything. If someone knows how to fix this I would greatly appreciate it. \r\nNote: I've tried resetting the data in the C drive as well as updating my nvidia drivers and even deleting all league files on my computer and reinstalling and the same problem still keeps coming.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-04T23:50:43.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client is disconnecting from the game platform, which causes the freeze and eventual crash. This is often caused by network settings that don't play well with League, so I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a next step.\n\nLet me know if those changes resolved this issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-10-02T12:34:59.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, are you a Windows 10 user who got a recent W10 Anniversary update?
