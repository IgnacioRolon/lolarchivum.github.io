Simply playing games gets you a small amount of honor, as well as actually BEING honored. If everyone honors someone on your team, you also get another small boost as well. \n\nPlaying more games is a good way to bump up your honor, so your friends might just be playing more often. There's also the chance that they're getting honored more often by their team. Everyone is going to rank up at different paces, you shouldn't be comparing your progress with others.","replies":[]}]}
