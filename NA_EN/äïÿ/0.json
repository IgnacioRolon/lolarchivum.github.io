If you got a chat restriction, it was most likely justified, but you are welcome to post your chat logs in a post so that people can be the judge of that. Otherwise we can't empathize with what you may or may not have said. \n\n3) If this is your second time getting a chat ban, you obviously aren't handling people being rude very well. Your best bet would be muting the person, which solves the problem and prevents you being in a flame war that warrants a chat ban.","replies":[{"poster":"äïÿ","date":"2017-03-28T00:57:45.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the first one, ill admit, was my fault, this time though? no. absolutely not. but like i said, if i ever see the chat log (which i havent yet) ill post it here.","replies":[{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2017-03-28T01:00:45.282+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"My fault on the chat log part, those are only given during bans in email format.
