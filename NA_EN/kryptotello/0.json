In my opinion, this champion&#039;s ability to freely dash all over the place devalues the flash or dash you sometimes hold for dear life. I for one, see this as a huge problem, how a champ can literally dash from his mid tower, to your mid tower before you, with a head start!!!!! ... I believe his dash should be like Irelia&#039;s. where it only refreshes if she kills the unit. that to me sounds more fair. he already stacks so much crit, blocks any projectiles, and can ult from 2 towers range, but he also dashes infinitely. come on... I&#039;m not one to complain about a broken champ because usually RIOT sees it too and fixes it cough cough Master Yi, Riven, Master Yi again, Darius, Zac. But this one does not seem to fall under Riot radar, that is a lot of mobility for one champ. You could literally dash 3 times with Ahri, and Yasuo would pass her by while waiving, and even she has a 1 sec cool down after using it.

Other squishies generally have range or high enough burst to kill something before it retaliates. The reason Yasuo gets away with being a squishy melee champion is the combination of mobility and damage negation inherent to his kit.\n\nWithout those things, he can't survive in mid lane, and his defenses are too low to survive adequately in top lane, let alone function has an engage/tank/whatever.\n\nYasuo literally cannot function as a champion without his gap closer being the way it is. Irelia can dash in, stick, survive burst damage, and get her kill. Ahri can kite constantly and her 3-charge dash is a non-conditional gap closer.\n\nThere's so much to say on this subject that it's difficult to know where to start.","replies":[]},{"poster":"undesirable team","date":"2015-11-09T06:57:46.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ANOTHER YASUO QQ THREAD??? jeez, these things are tooo many.  the only thing you have to do to balance yasuo is have those little circle markers that show how long till he can dash off them ..  this would make alot more prediction and alot more easier","replies":[]}]}
