The in-game is on the lowest settings with a resolution on 1280x800\r\n2. I have been using the **Hextech Repair Tool** several times without any results. Even posted the results to the Riot Support.\r\n3. The Riot Support has told me to reinstall **League of Legends**, even though I have done it many times with no results.\r\n4. All my drivers are up-to-date, and I use **Radeonâ„¢ Software Adrenalin Edition** to boost the performance of the game.\r\n5. I have been trying to use some sort of a program, which decreases the visuals of the game. (It makes the game look like it was designed by my left hand.)\r\n6. All programs (also anti-virus which runs in background), are always closed. This helps a bit, but not enough.\r\n7. I have not been counting on how many times I have fully restarted my computer from scratch. This is the **only** solution. But then I have to do it 2 times every week to keep the performance optimal.\r\n\r\n**This is my specs:**\r\nTime of this report: 1/28/2018, 17:55:13\r\nOperating System: Windows 10 Home 64-bit (10.0, Build 16299) (16299.rs3_release.170928-1534)\r\nSystem Manufacturer: Hewlett-Packard\r\nSystem Model: HP 15 Notebook PC\r\nBIOS: F.34\r\nProcessor: AMD A8-6410 APU with AMD Radeon R5 Graphics (4 CPUs), ~2.0GHz\r\nMemory: 8192MB RAM\r\nAvailable OS Memory: 7112MB RAM\r\nPage File: 5520MB used, 2744MB available\r\nWindows Dir: C:\\WINDOWS\r\nDirectX Version: DirectX 12\r\nDX Setup Parameters: Not found\r\nUser DPI Setting: 96 DPI (100 percent)\r\nSystem DPI Setting: 96 DPI (100 percent)\r\nDWM DPI Scaling: Disabled\r\nMiracast: Available, with HDCP\r\nMicrosoft Graphics Hybrid: Not Supported\r\nDxDiag Version: 10.00.16299.0015 64bit Unicode\r\n\r\n**This is the display device:**\r\nCard name: AMD Radeon(TM) R5 Graphics\r\nManufacturer: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\r\nChip type: AMD Radeon Graphics Processor (0x9851)\r\nDAC type: Internal DAC(400MHz)\r\nDevice Type: Full Device\r\nDevice Key: Enum\\PCI\\VEN_1002&amp;DEV_9851&amp;SUBSYS_22CE103C&amp;REV_05\r\nDevice Status: 0180200A [DN_DRIVER_LOADED|DN_STARTED|DN_DISABLEABLE|DN_NT_ENUMERATOR|DN_NT_DRIVER] \r\nDevice Problem Code: No Problem\r\nDriver Problem Code: Unknown\r\nDisplay Memory: 4562 MB\r\nDedicated Memory: 1005 MB\r\nShared Memory: 3556 MB\r\nCurrent Mode: 1366 x 768 (32 bit) (60Hz)\r\n\r\n- If anyone has a solution on how they can turn my {{item:2009}} into a playable computer, I would be very happy.\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-01T04:26:37.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like you've covered a lot of the potential issues, definitely helps to narrow things down a bit that's for sure. Your pc seems to meet the min specs as well, so I don't think the problem lies there either. Take a quick second to make sure the Windows Game DVR feature is turned off too, since that's been known to turn itself back on after Windows update and can cause a lot of fps issues in certain games. I'd also consider testing League *without* the Radeon Software to see if maybe it's been negatively impacting League possibly.\n\nI'd also maybe consider opening your ticket with the techs again, as there might have been more steps they needed to try if what they gave you hasn't worked yet. Feel free to poke me here in a reply if my suggestions haven't helped yet either. Sometimes we need to go through a lot of troubleshooting to narrow down what the real issue is, but stick with us here or in the ticket and we'll get something figured out for ya ^_^!","replies":[]}]}
