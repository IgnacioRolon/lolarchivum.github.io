I missed out on some very special skins, and I'm sure that I'm not alone. Say, with this new skin-oriented event (4 skins and a MAP skin), perhaps a personal shop/legacy shop is in order? Maybe I'm just desperate, but as we missed one last Christmas (not to mention the lack of such an event this new year/Lunar Revel), perhaps the time is nigh. What say you, Rito?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-01T05:37:55.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I'm not on the team that makes these sorts of decisions, nor have I seen any announcements for such an event anytime soon.
