You can play the game and someone, if they are even a tier higher then you in the ranked system apparently have the ability to talk to you like you cant play the game. &quot;Trash silver player&quot; I&#039;ve been ranked for like a whole week and this is the kinda of talk that anyone higher than me seems to think they are gifted. I get that you are a higher tier and you&#039;ve probably earned it but that gives you ZERO right to talk down on other players. calling other players trash does not help anyone get better Plat 1 or Silver 5 we should all have the same respectful mindset.\r\n Its not that hard to say good play or be happy, do we not play video games for fun also? {{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2018-09-28T19:16:49.593+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK, but if a Bronze/Silver player tells me that Lux has sustained damage instead of burst.....

Her mouse is shit and she likes it, because it looks pretty.\n7. She struggles to understand why she shouldn't afk for facebook.\n\nWhat opinion about bronze players should I have? They don't care about winning the game - they don't take it seriously, they have anger management and connection issues, no mechanics and game knowledge.\n\nOf course I am going to look down upon them.

It's not your ,\"*fault*\" that you started so low, everybody starts at silver. It's a baseline, themajority of players, rating is not something you inherently are - it's something you worked towards.\n\nEven if you can potentially enable your brain to play a challenger game and carry, it's worth nothing if it's not consistent. And consistency is proven by the number of games, which you are lacking. \n\nI look at your match history and it's pretty empty. You could be a smurf, but it's impossible to know.\n\nAnd one-trick something. Take every chance to play the champion.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Reachlaser5","date":"2018-09-28T02:30:32.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way i see it is that you can view yourself better than lower tier players, like if you were gold or plat looking at bronze or silver.\n\nI would only trash talk someone if they trash talk me in the first place.

Just mute them when you see the first form of toxicity from them and keep on playing.

Focus on your own gameplay and don’t look at the chat of the toxic people in your games.","replies":[]}]}
