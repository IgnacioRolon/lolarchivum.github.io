I feel when watching high elo streamers after the game they look at &quot;damage dealt to champions&quot;  and its one of the only stats they look at. Maybe its just me, but it seems like a lot of lower elo players see these streamers look at that stat and after games its the only stat they look at. Now I am curious League community **How important is the damage dealt to champions stat?**\r\n\r\nMy question is based off my last jungle game. http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=dukues\r\n\r\nMy damage dealt to champions as VI jungle in my last game was only 8.9k. I know pretty embarrassing. But I would argue that one stat doesn&#039;t paint the whole picture. op.gg doesn&#039;t show, but although I only did 8.9k damage to champions did roughly 172k total damage in game. Not sure if other sites show this stat, op.gg doesn&#039;t so I am going off memory. My 172k total damage was roughly 30-40k higher than the next person in the game. I also had earned most gold in game. Now I understand stats such as &quot;most gold&quot; doesn&#039;t necessarily mean too much, but its another stat to look at when comparing end game stats. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind this is a mid to low gold elo game so none of us are pros, especially myself.  But I want to take a chance to explain why I feel my only 8.9k damage dealt to champions but total 172k damage dealt in this game was important, despite how some of my teammates felt. Honestly this game felt like a classic silver game to me. I do see 3v5 of the enemy were silver so I guess my mmr has just tanked recently. Anyways, after the few minutes of the game I felt confident we were going to win. I got first blood along with securing my bot lane 2 kills by level 6. The game turned into typical ARAM by around the 20-25 minute mark. I personally hate playing ARAM on summoners rift so I started clearing jungle camps and pushing out other lanes. Always paying attention to the enemy and my team but most of the time not much was going on. We secured 3 dragons early (1 cloud, 2 mountain) with a 3rd mountain drake about to spawn. Being the jungler I should have been bot to help my team. But seeing the enemy t2 top turret open with our minions pushing towards it along with the enemy jungler top trying to stop me I figured my team had the dragon. Well I ended up dying like a noob, but had the enemy jungle and mid laner chase me, so my team took our 3rd mountain drake easily. That&#039;s when I started getting bitched at for not being with the team. \r\n\r\nAfter 3rd mountain drake we got a push going and took top inhib. The reason we took top inhib you ask? Well its because I was split pushing bot and drew the attention of the enemy adc &amp; mid. They literally chased me to our t1 bot turret before killing me..... lmfao. I could have lived but kept going back in so they wouldn&#039;t/couldn&#039;t back as I saw my team was in their base. \r\n\r\nAnyways a couple more minutes of ARAM before my team checks baron for wards and wants to kill it. I tell them to wait until we get a pick &quot;I hate low elo baron calls and hate doing it most of the time). We did clear wards and had 3 mountain drakes so I get why my team wanted to do it. Instead we waited a sec and got a pick on one of the enemy players. While the enemy retreated we grabbed baron. \r\n\r\nNow with minions pushing top and no inhib, we start pushing mid. While my team sieged outside mid turret I see our minions pushing into the enemy base from top. I {{champion:254}}  Q dash over the wall, baron empower my minions, and start focusing enemy inhib turrets. Since {{champion:254}} E can hit turrets I literally melt the enemy nexus turrets. I took both nexus turrets and killed the enemy nexus without the enemy even contesting........ No idea wtf enemy was doing besides playing ARAM with my teammates. \r\n\r\nAnyways then my salty teammates give me credit for doing something. But then after hearing &quot;look VI only did 8.9k damange to champions&quot; I sighed. If you only look at that stat then it looks like I am the worst {{champion:254}} jungler to play the game. But if you were in the game you would have realized I was one of the main reasons we won the game.\r\n\r\nNot sure how you all feel, but I hate when people look at one line stat in game and think it means everything when there are plenty of stats and other things to consider each and every game.\r\n\r\nCommunity thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2016-10-28T15:56:44.921+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love when I see a 9/10/3 carry bitch about damage to champs.

If a tank dealt twice as much damage overall as an assasin, but split it up rather evenly amongst all opponents, maybe even more to front than backline, when he wasn't not neccesarily better than that assasin if the assasin dealt ~90% of the damage to the opposing carrys.\nThere are also alot of imprtant things that can't really be measured statistically like map preasure(unless you can see a probabillity map of ones position maybe.

However, it's a less great stat to look at if:\n\n* You're playing a tank. The tank isn't there to do damage.\n* You're playing a support. The support generally isn't there to do damage.\n* You're a jungler. The jungler spends a large portion of the time in the jungle, away from enemy champions.\n* You're playing a splitpusher. You spend a lot of time by yourself.\n\nAll of those things benefit the team, but do so in a way that gives them less than stellar DTC stats. As long as that's understood, DTC can be a powerful tool to help provide feedback on which carry was pulling their weight and which carry just last hit champions. It's much less deceiving that just looking at KDA.\n\nThat being said, DTC isn't the only important stat you should be looking at. Tanks value damage taken, supports sometimes value damage healed (and would also love a damage shielded stat), towers taken can be useful for splitpushers, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Dukues","date":"2016-10-28T16:10:37.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yea I usually look more at it when I am playing adc.
