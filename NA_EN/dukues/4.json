You still climbing? Give up? Happy where your at? I personally am excited because season 6 will be the first time I get to receive a victorious skin and change my stupid silver border. Literally had this damn thing since season 3 its time for a change.\r\n\r\nIf you still climbing I want to wish you good luck and strength on your journey. Anyone who has spammed ranked in any given season will tell you it really is a grind. It tests your patience, your sanity, and it honestly takes a lot of perseverance to reach the rank you want. \r\n\r\nSeason 3 I was so damn excited to reach silver. I got a new border and wanted to show it off to my friends. In the end no one really cared, but it was w/e it felt good to me. Season 4 and 5 were a real let down however. I really struggled trying to climb the ladder in silver. I could not get past damn silver 2. It was my kryptonite. There literally was an invisible wall at silver 2 100lp that would not let me pass. I think it took me 8 tries in 2 seasons to get stupid silver 1. Sadly didn&#039;t reach gold in time for season rewards so this will be my first season finally achieving the rank I always wanted on time. \r\n\r\nIts kind of cool in a way. I went from always thinking I was alright at the game but always struggling to climb. To finally admitting defeat and realizing there was tons of stuff I didn&#039;t know in this game even though I have played it since season 1. I am only gold 3 but honestly I am having so much more fun playing this game now than I have in the past. I guess its more just being aware of my surroundings more than anything. I realized I am just bad at the game and still am, but I learned more and have been able to play more consistently and now I win more than I ever have in past seasons. Now when I get outplayed in the jungle (usually by you damn diamond/low plat smurfs :( ) I think to myself &quot;how did they gank that lane so quickly&quot; or &quot;how did I lose this match up so badly&quot;. Yea I still get frustrated with my teammates time to time but honestly more of my frustration is with myself more than anything. I still do dumb plays all the time and get really confused why I did what I did when I know I shouldn&#039;t have. For me making this game more fun was growing and accepting there is tons to learn and that I didn&#039;t know everything. Maybe doing this can help you as well.\r\n\r\nSo whether you high elo or low elo I just wanted to take a moment to say I wish you all success on your journey and hope you reach your goal rank. If you don&#039;t that sucks but its not the end of the world. There is always next season and damnnnnnn does season 7 look promising. I personally am  a little worried about the assassin meta as I don&#039;t really play assassins, but just like every season I know I will adjust to whatever changes are made.\r\n\r\nGood luck and good fight.\r\n\r\nDukues","replies":[{"poster":"invisiblecat1","date":"2016-10-10T16:52:02.897+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahahhahaha I haven't even STARTED playing
