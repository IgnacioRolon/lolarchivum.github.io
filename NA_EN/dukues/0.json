I have also had my current desktop since 2014. During that time I have never had an error running LoL. Ever since I want to say patch 7.17 every time I install a new patch my game breaks and there is some sort of windows error. I can't remember the first errors but I basically just removed a file one time and it fixed it. Maybe that's the problem but here are my current errors.\n\nAfter Installing Patch 7.18 I got an error saying yaml.dll was missing. I reinstalled the game since this was the 2nd patch in a row where I had an error. Reinstall did nothing and I got the same error. I looked it up online and eventually downloaded a new yaml.dll file. Game worked after that.\n\nNow with patch 7.19 install I got 3 errors (keep in mind I had the game running earlier today after I originally installed patch 7.19 but closed because I was on lunch break). So I was in the client with new patch downloaded at one point. \n\nC:\\Riot Game\\League of Legends\\libssl-1_1.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support. Error status 0xc00000020. \n\nC:\\Riot Game\\League of Legends\\libcurl.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support. Error status 0xc00000020. \n\nC:\\Riot Game\\League of Legends\\zlib.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support. Error status 0xc00000020. \n\nAny ideas as to what is happening and how I can fix these errors permanently? I have had no issues with other video games.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-28T01:09:54.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason you're getting those dll and yaml errors is that the files weren't properly downloaded or installed.

This getting really frustrating mainly because I have no idea why after all of these years suddenly this is happening. Could it be a Windows/Firewall issue. And if so any guidelines on how to find out? Really don't feel like reinstalling League every week.....","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-05T20:50:33.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could absolutely be a firewall issue tbh. Sometimes certain firewalls or antivirus' can mess up the files while League is installing, so you *could* try running a reinstall again (yea I know, not the best answer =\\ )  but this time make sure all firewalls are disabled while installing.

Really sick of reinstalling the game every 6ish days. Don't know what to do about it anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dukues","date":"2017-10-05T20:57:51.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the help I will keep messing with it. I am pretty sure last time I didn't install as admin like I thought I did. This time I made sure to not auto startup League and manually made sure to install as admin. Hope it stays fixed this time, but if not the hunt will continue.\n\nThanks again for the follow up {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dukues","date":"2017-09-28T13:23:46.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=75wuhTm0,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-09-28T01:09:54.770+0000)\n>\n> The reason you&#x27;re getting those dll and yaml errors is that the files weren&#x27;t properly downloaded or installed.

I used the tech support list provided by Riot and went through each step. The last step was to reinstall as admin. The first time I tried it didn't work, but I never deleted my old C drive folder. So the second time I made sure to delete it and also restarted my computer and then reinstall worked. Game is working great now. \n\nMy advice to anyone else if they ever read this would be reinstall the game as Admin and MAKE SURE! to delete your old Riot Games folder on your C drive before reinstalling. Thanks Broporo (amazing name btw).","replies":[]}]}]}
