I am laughing out loud right now, yes I have probably gone insane at this point but please look at this. This honestly more embarrassing than your dynamic boost season. Seriously people take a moment and look at this and have a good laugh. As FYI I know Gold isn&#039;t that great of an achievement. \r\n\r\nLook at my last game and go to my {{champion:222}} profile. Notice how she was silver 2 end of last season? Now by some miracle is in gold? Ok look at her last few solo/duo games played. Most recent game 2-9-3 jinx with 6.3 c/s min. 2-2-6 veig game with 5.2 cs/min. 0-4-0 TOP NAUT WITH 4 C/S A MIN! LMFAO. got some really good jungle games in there too like 0-4-1 {{champion:421}} 2-7-2 {{champion:121}} yet somehow has a positive overall win rate..... hmmm interesting.\r\n\r\nOr look at my amazing {{champion:45}} Also by some miracle gold with a positive win rate with 170 games played yet look at his past performances. Also.... wasn&#039;t ranked the season before............. hmmm interesting. \r\n\r\nGo back to any of the games I played today or yesterday and just take a peak. No doubt most these players in gold this season and hell some were even plat last season. Its so funny because I was just playing this game 4ish weeks ago and playing higher mmr players and players who actual belong out of silver elo and games were fun and competitive and even. Now it&#039;s just a barnyard explosion of bordem and madness. \r\n\r\nI had a fun game 4 games ago as {{champion:154}} with my 6-12{{champion:55}} my 4-13 {{champion:18}} &amp; 0-8 {{champion:89}} . They even gave me the classic &quot;wtf Zac why no gank bot this all your fault&quot; like 6 mins in when they died for the 3rd time each ... hell probably more actually to the 2v2. I always thought {{champion:89}} was good against {{champion:53}} too.... interesting. Best parts though? THE FUCKING OTHER TEAM BOT LANE WAS LEGIT SILVER LAST SEASON AND STOMPED THESE FOOLS LIKE OMFG IT WAS HILARIOUS. Also best part? TRIST WAS PLAT LAST SEASON! (plat 5 though lul). She literally would get to lane and W onto closest target and die instantly to fed {{champion:21}} and then cry about us being bad. Haven&#039;t seen shit like that since bronze was spicey. Could really start making a video series of my amazing solo queue journey this season. \r\n\r\nI am used to getting trolled I have played this game way too long to have avoided it. But god damn does it piss me off seeing all these players getting free rewards and achievements while playing at lower level. And I should know.... I have ranked 3 accounts a season to gold from low ass silver or bronze last couple years and I know what different low elos play looks like. And what I am seeing right now is nothing close to gold w/e stuipd elo these kids supposedly in. \r\n\r\nSucks but I guess the only thing to do now is quit playing. Worked for me last year... quit until these kids play enough where they drop back to their actual elo or quit playing ranked because they found something new to play or get sick of losing when they finally start dropping. That time can&#039;t come soon enough but like always it will be here one day.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-19T05:13:57.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Somewhere in this painful rant you missed explaining what the fuck the point is.","replies":[{"poster":"Dukues","date":"2018-02-19T16:12:02.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=daJfOvP9,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-02-19T05:13:57.328+0000)\n>\n> Somewhere in this painful rant you missed explaining what the fuck the point is.\n\nJust want to apologize for my prior comment. Honestly I am just frustrated with myself. I am too old to care about this game and honestly I am upset that I am this tilted from playing it. I thought I was more mature but once again I got sucked into ranked. I guess I just feel betrayed from false hope after not playing much in 2017 to having a personal great couple weeks playing in preseason and now just upset my luck and play as turned the other way. Ah well going to take some time off playing and focus on other things. Still plenty of time to rank up later in season.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-19T21:47:33.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dukues,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=daJfOvP9,comment-id=00000002,timestamp=2018-02-19T16:12:02.370+0000)\n>\n> Just want to apologize for my prior comment.

The place is intolerable.\n\nHave you tried treeline? It seems to be a bit more mature in general, and 3v3 makes each player a bit more important.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ayanami3rd","date":"2018-02-19T09:02:02.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your summoner's name.
