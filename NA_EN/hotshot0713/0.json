I have not the slightest idea why. I hardly ever speak while in-game and when I do it is to promote team morale after a good team fight. Or I will even speak up and give my opinion on how to approach the enemy team when playing ARAM. Have only been suspended for a time due to leaver buster and that was mainly because of my poor connections at the time (that of which I would stop playing knowing I would my teams the matches). I was wondering if anyone may have similar problems that I have. I researched into the suspensions and bans and found out that people usually get an email telling them why they got suspended or banned but I never got one telling em what I did wrong. So far, all I have done is submit a ticket to Riot asking for a clear explanation and if it is possible for an account recovery or if they made a mistake and give it back to me. If someone knows already what happened then please let me know ASAP so I can stop wasting my time over this. Thanks.","replies":[]}
