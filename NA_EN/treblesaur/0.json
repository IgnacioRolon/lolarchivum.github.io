It sounds like that you disconnected during your Ranked Game and when you reconnected, you needed to download a patch, but failed.  Since you got disconnected in game and had patching issues, both of these strongly point to a larger connection issue that you might be having in regards to League of Legends.  \n\nWhile we can't make any exceptions regarding your LP, we can make sure that you do not experience any disconnects or issues patching again!  Make sure to complete all of the steps in this guide:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/26932010-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nI know that there are a ton of steps here, but every single one is crucial and critical to helping fix your issue.  If you experience any issues like this again, you may want to [submit a new ticket ](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new)to us in Player Support so that we can look into it further!","replies":[]}]}
