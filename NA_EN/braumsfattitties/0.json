Garen is the captain of a battalion of soldiers, he is very strict towards magic (but in the comics of Lux, we saw his kind side with his sister) but he is still very loyal to his country and i'm not sure he should love Noxians people. I don't understand how Garen can fall in love with a noxian and especially an assassin, it's make no sense. Katarina have killed Demacians people, she is a murderer. \n\nFrom Katarina side, her personnality don't really fit to love Garen. The only common point of both would be their loyalty to their nations but if they are loyal, they won't try to love someone who is an enemy of their nation. \n\nI don't undestand this ship, i know it's popular but from a lore perspective, i don't think it's make sense. \n\n\nThen i would say {{champion:44}} and {{champion:81}} because they never have met.

Jayce is a scientist who is proud of himself and Vi is a tomboy who loves to kick asses. Vi would probably be pissed at Jayce bragging and end up to crush his face.

You can't be in a relationship with Evelyn, she is a demon.

Amumu is probably very old, like 100 or 1000 years old, he is a mummy so he can live forever since it's a spirit in a dead body wrapped in strips. A little girl with a 1000 years old mummy is weird if you think about it.
