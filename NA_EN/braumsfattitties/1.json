The point is each splash art is drawn by a **different artist**.  There will never be a consistency. An artist is given the essentials and goes into action. Not to mention each artist have their style and drawing preference. \n\nhttps://www.cosmiccomics.vegas/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/return-wolverine-cropped-1024x471.jpg\n\nhttps://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/36/590x/secondary/wolverine-x-force-1244915.jpg\n\nhttps://cdn1us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/styles/article_width/public/2018/01/wolverine_death_nemesis.jpg?itok=6evwxpcZ\n\nTake Xhin Zhao:\n\nThis is his splash art\n\nhttps://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/XinZhao_0.jpg\n\nThis is him in the game: \n\nhttps://i.ibb.co/2vQF1D0/fff.png","replies":[{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2019-02-26T03:19:49.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I laughed out loud when I saw that Xin Zhao pic XD","replies":[{"poster":"BoringLittleF","date":"2019-02-26T03:29:14.519+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rathar Dashing,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=T0A6BAhT,comment-id=0008000100010000,timestamp=2019-02-26T03:19:49.296+0000)\n>\n> I laughed out loud when I saw that Xin Zhao pic XD\n\nhttps://i.ibb.co/k2XXtCR/2umolf.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thisisatest922","date":"2019-06-30T23:53:33.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no one cares what champions faces look like in game LOL","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-02-26T13:06:28.281+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"But just looking at their splashes arts every girl has a unique facial structure.\n\nEven in her provided examples.\n\nLeBlanc has a narrow face, with a long sharper nose.\n\nXayah has a rounded face with a small dull nose and wider eyes.\n\nAhri's face is plump and her bridge is more straight with Fuller lips.\n\nSyndra has thin lips a shorter face and eyes that slant upwards on the inside.\n\nKai'Sa has a long but not narrow face and a slightly upturned nose.\n\nAshe has a rounded yet thin face with a curved bridge.\n\nIt's why Sora's winter icon was disliked, it didn't have her facial structure.","replies":[{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2019-02-26T20:08:29.496+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This too, they are different, they're just all very attractive because you know it's fantasy and we like attractive people.\nAlmost all the guy champs have chiseled jawlines, but there's still variation.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2019-02-25T21:52:03.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean for Morgana they show her in-game design, so one would assume in-game models are included.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GrReaper96","date":"2019-02-25T20:36:46.225+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"I admire your dedication there","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thisisatest922","date":"2019-06-30T23:53:09.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realize this is not how the champions look in their splash art, correct?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2019-02-26T20:06:47.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best part is of the champs the OP uses in their argument\n{{champion:7}} Illusionist whose entire appearance is probably a spell.

They just think that Riot puts one face type on the pedestal and discards other face types as \"not pretty\", which is not correct. \n\n1) League of Legends has not any power to define, make or explore  beauty statements and influence the opinions.  It is here to create bright designs for a MOBA game. Hundreds, thousands of people play games and build IRL relationships just fine because they can separate the two. Those, who cannot do that, need a therapist.\n\n2) Style is a thing. Talon, Lee Sin, Yasuo, TF don't look like themselves on all their skins because these skins were drawn by different artists. That means that the features you see on splash arts are not set in stone and they can be tweaked (safe for skin color, eye and hair color, general structure, etc) according to the setting. \n\nhttp://www.comicsbeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ashe_Warmother_Vakueva-1-740x400.jpg\n\nhttp://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Nk8J667ScEgbRdYofzcJc-1200-80.jpg","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aeolus2000","date":"2019-02-25T18:22:45.599+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":2,"body":"Right!!

So, when they needed a new splash art, the artist didn't have anything to work with as for the facial features or take freedom with their clothing (people are known for throwing a tantrum \"Make character A look like their splash art or fuck you Rito!!!\"), so they focused on their abilities (Leblanc casting illusion and sneaking away on her art, Ashe shooting her bow with Freljord on the background) which was a smart decision. \n\nAlso the OP has selected faces drawn from the same angle which already makes them look similar and does not give a clear view of their features, which is not really trustworthy.
