Last year, the only really convincing move up from Challenger was Origen, a team built by seasoned professionals who were re-qualifying. The teams attempting to make the step up to LCS caliber have a giant hurdle to overcome just trying to get the practice they need to improve.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you have players who still have the skill to be professional players, but lack the opportunity (a parent, for example) or motivation to become one. Players who have retired from professional play but still maintain a professional _level_ of play are still out there, streaming and enjoying the game.\r\n\r\nWith the kind of sponsorship and investment teams are starting to see, wouldn&#039;t it be worthwhile to invest in offering professional-level scrim opportunities to Challenger teams that would otherwise not have the opportunity to get adequate practice? Contracted, reliable, highly skilled players could easily be coordinated by someone with even a modicum of project management experience, ensuring efficient scrims and even opportunities for analysis to rising teams. This way you&#039;re not shutting out competition, you&#039;re supporting and nurturing new talent, etc.\r\n\r\nCompared to what your overall LCS budget must be I can&#039;t see this being unfeasible. I&#039;m not saying that you _should_ do this - I haven&#039;t exactly done a cost-benefit analysis on this. (Though if I did, I&#039;d probably look into per-game rates for high-level players, with an amount to be at least comparative to successful streaming revenues in order to ensure they&#039;re not working at a loss.) However, it would certainly be worth looking into. And if it wasn&#039;t run by Riot, this could potentially be an opportunity for private investment to grow the scene.\r\n\r\nThink about it, get back to me. Your people can contact my people and we&#039;ll do lunch or something (the &#039;or something&#039; is code for &#039;chicken and red velvet waffles&#039;).","replies":[{"poster":"Tiza","date":"2016-03-29T23:25:59.979+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The CS teams in both NA and EU often scrim with pro teams, some regularly.  Teams handle their scrims independently of us, and LCS teams are usually eager to practice with the stronger CS teams.\n\nIt's not our place to mandate how teams practice.  Our role is to build the system they compete in.  LCS teams should be setting up their practice partners as they see fit, with the goal of making their team as strong as possible.  They are not responsible for elevating their competition.","replies":[{"poster":"EyesOfTheFox","date":"2016-03-30T16:06:52.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most professional athletic sports are the way you mentioned above. For instance most NFL teams will often times set up scrimmages with other clubs during training camp. The NFL allows them the opportunity to do this, but it is not mandatory. The NFL does not set the teams they can scrimmage against either. Scrimmages are set up mutually between the two organizations (for various reasons). I personally like Riot's approach. If Challenger Series players really want to get to that next level, they should (and most cases WILL) find a way to practice at a higher level.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ale non Ã¨ male","date":"2016-03-29T12:41:20.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The EU CS teams didn't make it just because this time didn't have enough talented players to beat even bottom LCS teams roster, training has nothing to do with that\nThe only remark that can be made is that the new rules gave too much leverage to someone like Giants who could make the necessary last minute roster changes to keep their LCS spot without being punished for fielidning an inadquate team in RS, but that's pretty much all\nIt is not a problem of training, in the  previous promotion tournament G2 was capable to beat a bottom LCS roster - and a not super bad  one I would add as 4 of those guys have played in LCS this split and 2 have made the playoffs in their new teams - because they had enough talent in Perkz, Hybrid, Kikis and SmittyJ, and among those only Kikis had LCS experience, while the other were fresh Challenger talent that was good enough to make the cut, and look now, G2 had gotten to be top 4 at least team in EU with Perkz, Kikis and Hybrid in the team","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mat7itan","date":"2016-03-29T00:00:48.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is up to the teams who they scrim with, and a lot of the pro teams do scrim with the challenger teams.","replies":[]}]}
