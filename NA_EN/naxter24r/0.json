As a proof, i had around 70% wr up to S2 promos, then i couldn't win anymore, and not because of me (check history, before \"git gud\" and stuff like that) and i'm on the verge of going back to bronze again.\r\nLast game i had my jungler AFK. If we were 5 we would have won, i was beyond fed and i could have carried the team but we were 4, as i said.\r\nI get the game will balance out eventually but i think riot wants us in a specific elo and they do whatever they can to keep us there.\r\n\r\nSure i can get better, sure i can 1v9 harder, sure, but i'd be an LCS player in that case and i think there is some middle ground between a \"i deserve more than silver\" and LCS right?","replies":[]}
