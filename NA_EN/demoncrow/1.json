Most symptoms here are showing signs of a network problem struggling to load your assets, so our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide can help with that.  Getting the client to launch at all may depend on your OS, so let me know unless the guide helped!","replies":[{"poster":"DemonCrow","date":"2017-12-14T07:18:28.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm good already.
