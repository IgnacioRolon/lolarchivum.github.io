Try the following steps and let me know if that fixes the issue for you:\n\n- Navigate to your League of Legends installation folder. (Typically C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends)\n- Scroll down until you find \"LeagueClient.exe\" and delete the file.\n- Open the client by using \"lol.launcher.admin.exe\"\n- Repair the client by selecting the “?” button in the top right-hand corner of the Patcher window (the first window that appears) and under the options menu, select Repair.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
