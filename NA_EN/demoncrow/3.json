But some of us got penalized by the game for leaving the game which we arent doing on purpose and end up having a leaverbuster. Even when we tried alot of times to log in.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ezoroth Roze","date":"2016-07-20T12:32:19.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just dropping by to let people know that I got in after the same thing happened, so it was probably just a bump in the server/network.

That sucks man, I lucked out and the enemy team surrendered at 3 min (they had an AFK) right before the ordeal happened to me. I wish you the best of luck, if you have leaver queue's, I'd recommend playing mini-games (slither, agar, minesweeper) or watching videos on youtube to pass the time. It's what I did when I first had to deal with the queue's due to being disconnected.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MLGB NENG BK","date":"2016-07-20T12:27:27.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same i do not know why","replies":[]},{"poster":"Luna Qt","date":"2016-07-20T12:25:03.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes!
