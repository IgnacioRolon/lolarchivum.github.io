So I reinstalled LoL but then this old icon is here and can't get my hands on the new icon anymore, which I use to use. I doesn't bother me at all but I wish to get the new one because I have use to it already.

Anything else may cause issues like only temporarily saving files, requiring a repatch every time you launch.  Since things are a bit wonky here, your best bet may be to download the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and perform a clean reinstall.  That should clear away the grime and fix up your files!","replies":[]}]}
