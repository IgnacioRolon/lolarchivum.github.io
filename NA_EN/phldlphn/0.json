Since the update when a game launches and I tab out while it's loading or during game and after a game ends, the screen will either blur, or more frequently it begins to flicker like mad, best described how a screen can just go haywire if you drop your product and it's damaged. It probably has something to do with the graphics settings, I don't know anything about that. But anyway, this is serious, I have bad eyes and I'm worried it's going to fuck up my MacBook Pro which was fairly expensive and I don't think my warranty covers issues your game will cause, so pleaseeeeeeee could I get some kind of response?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-25T23:49:04.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe this is actually causing damage to your Macbook, but it certainly sounds like it's causing a headache. Since macOS Sierra has only been out for a few days, there are some issues going on between it and the League client. \n\nJust so I have a bit more context, are you running an external display or just the built-in on your macbook? Additionally, does this happen if you set your display resolution to 1920x1080p or 1600x900? You can find a basic guide on changing the resolution [here.](http://www.macworld.com/article/3024239/macs/how-to-adjust-your-mac-displays-resolution-settings.html)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarcasmkills","date":"2016-09-27T01:46:56.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't tried changing the resolution but for whatever reason closing the MacBook and opening it again fixes t he flickering. but after i figured that out I noticed that my character is running in slow motion compared to the rest. as if it just can't figure out how to draw it faster, others move fine. i move slow and then it eventually catches up.  I'm using the navtive display to my MacBook and not an external one. I haven't tried changing the resolution. I might just revert back to el capitan for a few weeks until this gets figured out.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-27T16:10:22.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for providing a bit more context.

I can kill LoL during the flicker and the flicker stops. Closing the display for a few seconds and then reopening the display seems to bandaid the issue until you:\n\n1) Start another game and enter the loading screen.\n2) Tab out while in the loading screen(seems reproducible this way most of the time)\n3) Ending a game and the LoL client closes.\n\nAll of these issues seem to point to the LoL Gameplay Client and not the launcher/patcher/find game UI. Ill try and grab logs the next time this happens, but I am disappointed that this issue is ongoing for over a month and Rito has not taken any action. This is obviously an issue on their side and needs to be resolved.\n\nIm assuming since the majority of players use PC and not Mac that this issue will not be resolved any time soon and remains low in their priority list.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AryaLutz","date":"2016-11-20T01:25:21.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same exact thing happens to me. After I did the new update on my mac I can't play LOl without the screen flickering and going hay wire after I play a game. .... not every game but most.

I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but the flicker also happened for me when I played Shovel Knight on steam. So it might be something more general about full-screen gaming? I'm taking my laptop to the Apple store today to see if they have any ideas.\n\nI am using the native display on a 15\" MacBook pro, and the flicker started after updating to OS Sierra.","replies":[]},{"poster":"M0ust4ch3","date":"2016-10-21T15:00:21.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've got the same thing, OSX Sierra","replies":[]},{"poster":"ˇ ok ˇ","date":"2016-10-07T16:54:38.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem, plz fix it ! its killing my eyes!","replies":[]}]}
