I redeemed some Rp, got a few chests, and started a game. I got to champ select like normal and after the screen switches to the loading screen, I get a bugsplat. I tried to reconnect and the same error occurred. I tried a number of solutions from the support help page and even downloaded the Hextech tool to try to solve it there. I have submitted a ticket to riot, but I have a feeling I wont hear back from them for awhile. I even uninstalled and did a complete reinstall today and I thought that fixed the problem, so I loaded a custom game and it was fine. I quit the custom game and start a draft. everything was fine again until the loading screen where the error popped up again. I waited it out until the stats screen (they remade the game) and now I cant get keys or chests anymore because of this damn bug.{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} RIP Me. If someone could help me find a solution, that would be amazing... I am playing on a windows 10 dell with 1tb of memory and a I3 1.90Ghz processor with 4gb of ram. It worked perfectly before I plugged the mouse in. {{item:3073}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-02T23:56:57.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grats on your new mouse!  It shouldn't impact your experience in champion select, but instead something like a permissions issue failing to read game files for champion select.  It could be a corrupt game data issue too, but I suggest starting off with making sure access is being allowed.   Run through our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure of that.  Test it out in a custom game and let me know your results.","replies":[]}]}
