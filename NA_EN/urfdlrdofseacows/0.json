Now granted he does have a temper and he has had chat frozen for being inappropriate but this time he was not and hasn't been since he got his chat restriction lifted. Trust me I made sure of that ...  I don't want him to loose the obscene amount of actual money and time he spent on skins and other items. Please review this chat dialog and let me know what you think.  Please take into consideration the fact that everything is an immediate response to what they started.  All I want is for RIOT to actually review the game and not just make a decision based off of a flawed AI and automated system.  Jhin on his own team called RIOT \" dog shit \" and told everyone to report him after harassing him the entire game ...... there has to be a line of leniency for those who are actually trying to better themselves. \n\nGame 3074167887:\nLongDongSilva: oof dont even start with that\nLongDongSilva: cool\nLongDongSilva: u guys wanna afk and then ff @ 20?\nLongDongSilva: im asking a question for the drama queens over there\nLongDongSilva: What bro\nLongDongSilva: What is it lux\nLongDongSilva: Lux can you settle on the toxic please\nLongDongSilva: Asking only once\nLongDongSilva: get rid of ward\nLongDongSilva: I need a successful gank top since 1969\nLongDongSilva: not just coming up and taking a peak and going b\nLongDongSilva: GET HIM\nLongDongSilva: im coming\nLongDongSilva: get him\nLongDongSilva: now they're getting jungle\nLongDongSilva: Too bad I'm bad?\nLongDongSilva: Bro I could run circles around you\nLongDongSilva: dont blame me for that mess @ bot\nLongDongSilva: alright im done with your level of toxic\nLongDongSilva: i dont care at this point\nLongDongSilva: it's your game too\nLongDongSilva: so enjoy\nLongDongSilva: nah\nLongDongSilva: nah\nLongDongSilva: fam\nLongDongSilva: im done\nLongDongSilva: not talking not caring\nLongDongSilva: so enjoy the game\nLongDongSilva: i said im going to stop talking\nLongDongSilva: please continue to talk if you'd like a report\nLongDongSilva: glad you're confident\nLongDongSilva: keep talking crap jhin\n[All]LongDongSilva: Oh believe me.

The rules apply to everyone regardless of circumstance. You dont suddenly get a pass to break the rules just because someone else did so before you. That would be a mess of a way to handle things. Sorry but your friend engages in arguements and negatively communicates with his team. He really should have stopped talking like he said he would. Threatening people with reports and calling them dog shit is what got him punished, and maybe even egging them on.

I disagree.\n\nI also said it doesnt matter who started it. Riot expects you to mute people who are offending you. Mute, report, move on. \n\nAlso, number of reports in a single game dont matter. So everyone reporting him has nothingto do with the punishment. One report would have the same effect. \n\nAside from my opinion thrown in at the very end, I'm working off Riots rules. Im trying to inform you so you and your friend can better protect your accounts in the future.

Mute players when they start being toxic or /mute all when the game starts. Don't respond to toxic behavior. If it's not helpful and not neutral/kind, don't say anything.
