This season, especially since I switched to the new client, has been fraught with disconnects and lag issues, including frame rates of 6 fps.  Trying to rise in ranked queues is extremely frustrating with these kind of issues,  and I recently got put on the LeaverBuster list for a d/c  after a crash at loading screen.  (no, guys, it's not my computer, I have an AMD FX-8350 eight-core processor and a gtx 1070)  \r\n\r\nI'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to, as I've seen others in chat complaining about it, and an increase in 4v5s and afks.  Is this something anyone can do anything about?  Is it just a matter of working out the kinks in the new client?  Am I just kvetching to no avail?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-12T23:42:16.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The client and game servers are independent of each other, so updating to the test version shouldn't impact your connection strength.  Even if you have the best in specs for your PC, you still need to make sure that your drivers and hardware are in good shape.  You can also return to the legacy client at any time during the testing period if you don't want to test:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nYou should go through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your connection to the game server is strong.  \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"FetchABeer","date":"2018-03-18T17:24:50.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that's not good.
