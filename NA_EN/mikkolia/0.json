Anyways I usually play comfortably with my ping sitting around 108 - 112 which occasionally rises to 120 but for me that's fine. However, it's ever since Sunday my league ping has been fluctuating in to the thousands and is always over 200. I did internet tests, contacted my ISP and even had one of the engineers to come out to check if there's an issue, when the engineer came everything seemed normal and he even changed my frequency hoping that it might help the problem but it didn't. I reset the changes he made and it's exactly the same. PLEASE HELP MY PING IS NORMALLY 109 and now it's 200 - 10000 never sitting at one ping always jumping, one second it would be 224 and the other it would be 796.. PLEASE HELP!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-10T17:07:59.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're playing from a super far distance, so your ping is naturally going to be pretty high.  It's likely that your ISP might be changing how it's routing on that day, though I'm not entirely sure why.  When this happens again, download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a traceroute to 104.160.131.1 for about 5 minutes.  This will help us see how you're routing to the server and where the snag is coming from.  Remove the IP only on the first two rows and let me know what you find.","replies":[{"poster":"Devoch","date":"2017-12-30T20:16:43.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Porocles,\n\nI used to play in NA with very good ping, around 50 but some months ago the ping i started to have is now of 94, did this thing and i post my results, i hope you can help me because i really want to play in the NA server. i'm playing from Mexico.\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                          x -    0 |  398 |  398 |    0 |    0 |    9 |    0 |\n|         dsl-servicio-l200.uninet.net.mx -    0 |  398 |  398 |    3 |   15 |   26 |   17 |\n|  bb-la-onewilshire-17-be4.uninet.net.mx -    0 |  398 |  398 |   35 |   48 |   65 |   52 |\n|                  las-b24-link.telia.net -    1 |  387 |  384 |   33 |   46 |   88 |   45 |\n|                  dls-b22-link.telia.net -    1 |  395 |  394 |   66 |   77 |   90 |   67 |\n|                  dls-b21-link.telia.net -    0 |  398 |  398 |   65 |   78 |  104 |   73 |\n|      riot-ic-315570-dls-b21.c.telia.net -    0 |  398 |  398 |   67 |   77 |   99 |   76 |\n|                          104.160.134.35 -    0 |  398 |  398 |   66 |   78 |  102 |   78 |\n|          ae35-br02.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  398 |  398 |   86 |   96 |  112 |   96 |\n|           ae1-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  398 |  398 |   86 |   95 |  111 |   89 |\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |  398 |  398 |   86 |   96 |  112 |   96 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider\n\n\n\n\nRegards","replies":[]}]}]}
