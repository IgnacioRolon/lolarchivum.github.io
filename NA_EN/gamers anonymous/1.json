I want to bind it to one of my summoner spells. All my previous key bindings were recently spontaneously reset for some reason by the game client... and I have been able to restore all my key bindings via the in-game settings menu except for the CapsLock binding :-(\r\n\r\nPreviously, I first bound the CapsLock manually by text using the \"input.ini\" file in the relevant LoL subfolder. But I think the in-game settings, including key bindings, are now saved server-side by Riot, so input.ini is no longer useful for this purpose? (In any case, I haven't changed anything in the input.ini file and yet the binding were still spontaneously reset, so it doesn't appear input.ini is useful anymore.)\r\n\r\nPlease help! Thanks so much.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-23T04:43:12.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I cannot assist you in modifying your League files.

I don't understand why it is treated so differently to other keys on the keyboard, I can't imagine it would be hard to just permit it to be bound via the in-game settings.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-27T23:15:35.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It may be re-bindable, however, it's not re-bindable through the in-game settings nor is it guaranteed to function properly. Caps-lock is pretty important to regular function, so this change may be pretty tough. You can certainly do more research online and try giving it a go, but it's not something we support, so I cannot assist you further with this.\n\nIf you have any further concerns, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Gamers Anonymous","date":"2016-12-07T11:12:28.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Targons Blade,\n\nI just discovered that in the latest patch (6.24) update for the New Client the CapsLock key can now be bound via the now added option of making key bindings in the client itself outside of an active game!!\n\nI know you already know this since you work on the technical side of things; I'm just posting this new solution here for anyone who come across this thread in the future looking for a solution to the same problem.\n\nCheers.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
