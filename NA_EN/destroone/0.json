You mentioned {{champion:154}}. Since he MUST remain goop-based, and all his abilities involve throwing, morphing, or dropping parts of his body, it would be very difficult to make a new, good looking skin. Compare that to Ahri, who not only would be very easy to make a skin for, but is a very flashy champion that would make the skin very visible. Now why it is taking so long to make a new skin for Jinx, I have no answer.
