Both were major losses, as I added up the amount of money I spent buying riot points, it came out to just a little above $14,000. On my first account I had almost every skin in the game. The second account I was almost caught back up to how many skins my first had.\n\n...yeah I know. I'm an idiot with no self control.\n\nThat's why this feature is perfect for me! I don't even have the ability to chat anymore. I can't be toxic! My only problem was flaming and arguing with people, now that I can't do that, I am able to enjoy the game! God I wish they added this sooner (or I found out about it sooner, I have no idea how long it's been in the game) it would have saved me a ton of time, money, and months of depression I went through after losing those accounts :P haha. Sorry just had to get this off my chest. I am so happy I am able to enjoy league for what it is without losing all my time and money put into the game\n\n**_ANYWAY_**\n\nSeriously I mean this from the bottom of my heart, whoever thought of this idea, you're amazing!! Thank you so much!!

So unless the amount you've spent on League is such a small amount of your income that it doesn't even matter, you need to be at a therapist yesterday, my dude.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Diopsideˆ","date":"2020-02-28T08:27:34.476+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Lol I could potentially buy a 2k17 car with that amount of money.
