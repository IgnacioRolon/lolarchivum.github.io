I went 2/11 as Morgana support the other day.  My mid was 0/6 to kassaddin by 10 minutes in and the kassadin would continually one shot me in team fights while I protected my adc.  We went 1/0/3 bot lane. I might have been able to survive, but I felt like I was fairly powerless in that match. \r\n\r\nIf someone can figure out why I'm just this worthless, uncarriable monstrosity of a player I'd really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Rock MD","date":"2019-03-31T01:36:21.375+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Morgana Deus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EenKsm5e,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-03-31T00:14:48.975+0000)\n>\n> https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=morgana+deus\n> \n> Game 1:  6/5/8 Malz mid.   My top is 3/11.  My adc is 5/8  My jungle is 0/5 and did 3k player damage.   This game is my fault.  What did I do wrong? \n\nYou didn't place a single ward until 4 minutes into the game. \n\nYou didn't roam until 10 minutes, and when you did it was purely off Ahri overextending AFTER missing a CC. You didn't even notice Udyr fighting Rek'Sai level 2. Your lane control is atrocious. Your csing is behind her even when she's picking awful times to roam. You exert zero pressure because you're so focused on staying safe that the lane ends up getting shoved to you as Malzahar and you're still down in cs to the guy roaming the entire time. You have terrible back timings. \n\nLike, it doesn't even matter that you eventually solo kill Ahri as you've given your team no reliability from the midlane for the entire time while trying to protect your KDA. You don't ward at all and you bought 2 controls over the entirety of the game. \n\nYou take ignite but that's for aggressive players, and you don't play aggressively at all. You get kills off punishing their mistakes but you never make plays or play proactively at all. \n\nWhat you need to do is this.\n\n1. Pay more attention to how you shove the waves. When she uses her Q you can use your W since she can't clear them as easily now. You've now forced her to focus on the waves instead of you. Backing on cannon waves is more efficient, and try force the waves into her tower. 3 minions allows her to freeze so you do need to step up and get her to play back pre-6.\n\n2. Put a ward in the damn pixel brush at 1:20.\n\n3. Pay attention to the map. You're picking bad fights and allowing yourself to get caught. Sometimes you just don't even show up for good fights.\n\n4. Don't blame the toplaner when most of his deaths go to you letting your opponent roam. \n\n5. Take teleport. It's more important to have presence for the team than pick up the odd solo kill.\n\n6. Stop playing Malzahar, he teaches way too many bad habits, and it seems you've picked up most of them.\n\n7. Stop using statistics to justify how well you did. That's what boards does and that's half the reason they struggle to climb.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smashed Hash","date":"2019-03-31T00:24:54.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone will respond and say, \"you need to place more wards\".

Control wards or regular wards?\n\nIt actually does a world of difference.  Buy control wards and get a new one each time it gets cleared.   Then place them offensively or defensively as the game progresses.  Vision is extremely important, even if u don’t roam, it provides warnings for when the enemy roams, allowing u to play better due to having more information.     As a midlaner I’ll always try to have a control ward in the brush near scuttle and try to get my jg to ward the opposite one,  then I place a normal trinket ward near the enemy raptors (during laning phase).   Try to get everyone to buy and place a control ward","replies":[]},{"poster":"MarshallpKqTc","date":"2019-03-31T07:28:26.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Anivia Hentai","date":"2019-03-31T11:24:30.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked is luck based.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-03-31T00:25:59.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you look into the abyss of blame you will go into madness.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-03-31T01:47:33.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not\n\nIf you are winning your lane it is one of the other players on your team that made you lose.","replies":[{"poster":"Morgana Deus","date":"2019-03-31T01:49:22.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XXXMurderPenguin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EenKsm5e,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-03-31T01:47:33.755+0000)\n>\n> Its not\n> \n> If you are winning your lane it is one of the other players on your team that made you lose.\n\nEven if that were true it doesn't help you climb to just blame your teammates.

It has to be something subtle somewhere in decision making.  But every game is different and its like how do I know whether I made the right decision until after I make it?  \n\nCertainly, there are times when its like, \"wait a minute I've been in this situation before and this is how it played out last time...\"   But that's not all that often.  So you rarely get to even see feedback on whether your decision making has improved.   \n\nWhat's worse is I'm sure I've won and made poor decisions, but I don't know they're poor decisions because I wasn't punished for them adequately.  It honestly seems very difficult to figure out.","replies":[]}]}]}
