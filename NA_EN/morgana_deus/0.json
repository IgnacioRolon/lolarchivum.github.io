But there's also certain carry kits that boost their own bonobos and get ranked without even respecting the game.  The lack of clarity in knowing your allies rank at champ select just ends up biasing it toward carries so you end up with a pool of people who can't play anything else with the game knowledge and attitude of a level 40 bronze.  But yeah I've seen a lot of people boost people out of bronze into silver and it just adds to the difficulty because noobs are noobs.
