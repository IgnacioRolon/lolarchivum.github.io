They gain a baseline provisional score higher than anyone else, and easily maintain their 5%+ of the community status.\n\nThe game is invariably easier for them to accomplish Challenger/Masters than anyone else to. What changes is generally simply the order or ranking in that 5% or less.\n\nSkill does matter when you're comparing a Sub-Gold to people above gold. But..... it's generally knowledge to abuse some reset assassin, or hard counter mechanics. It's not always \"Skill.\" \n\nYesterday, I had the pleasure to have a Diamond + Zed in a Silver game. I as Nami got a Jinx to rage quit vs me and a Vayne - literally every time she got back to lane she was instant dead. She wasn't even playing bad - She just ..... got hit by accurate bubbles, while E slow did the rest. She didn't even have room to \"play safe.\"\n\nDidn't matter that we hard stomped the game. The Zed was better. We were fed beyond belief, but this Zed..... had 0 counterplay, simply because Nami skills have delays, she's squishy even when she embarks on a nonsquishy path, and because Zed began purposefully hunting me.\n\nWithout me, the Vayne couldn't do much either. Her play requires her to actually have time to go through 4-5 volleys of attacks, while Zed only has to hit everything in .5 seconds. So they'd dance awhile, and Vayne would actually be mechanically playing better than Zed, get in  3-4 hits, but somewhere during her Ult, when she popped out of invisibility, Zed would just annihilate her.\n\nI think we actually won the game, because Zed's team surrendered the 4v5, but if they didn't realistically, Zed purely controlled the game simply because there was no counterplay to a good Zed.\n\nSkill matters some. What champ you express that skill through matters more.

Mind you, I am support main, and my first pick is always Lux so if my adc is not as good, I can at least hold the lane with the damage. Also, I did end up carrying 1-2 games by going full AP (I only do that when asked/ needed). However, if the adc cannot avoid skillshots, and jungler happens to be busy somewhere else, that lane is gone. And if the adc is so bad at avoiding skillshots that they end up dying from poke damage, well, you can imagine what hell will come mid lane after they take down bot turret.

I know people have been making that dire prediction for years, but this season feels especially bad and in my OPINION it is because for the last year (maybe 2) Riot has explicitly stated they're trying to make the game faster so that you can get OUT of bad games quicker to move on to the next one.  Instead of devoting their efforts to making EACH game better, they explicitly changed their focus to allow for QUANTITY over quality, and I think for a LOT of people, it's just not gonna be worth the grind of so many BAD games just to get that one really good one.\n\nMaybe they have enough people addicted to prove me wrong, but all I know is my last dozen or so games have been an AWFUL experience to play through and my main is currently in the META.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Colte","date":"2019-03-21T09:09:51.585+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"looking up players during champion selection and queue dodging a sure loss is also skill. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"AORVAL","date":"2019-03-21T08:26:43.504+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol I just stomped this dude like 4 games ago.
