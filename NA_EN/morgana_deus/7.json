Here's an unpopular opinion: how about every single hook champion is overpowered and only Morgana has reasonable counter play. \n\nA hook from Thresh, Pyke, Nautilus, and Blitzcrank is essentially death and literally the only counter play to it is to either 1.) dodge it all the time or 2.) flash.  \n\nYet we've been told by the community repeatedly that expecting people to dodge is not reasonable counter play.  See Zoe.   How is it different with hook champions?  \n\nDo you think its a coincidence that the some of the best ADC players in the world like Tyler1 strong prefer aggressive hook champion supports?  He knows how good they are.  \n\nI played a normal game yesterday against a bunch of silvers.  I'm a mid/high plat Morgana one trick.  I've played thousands upon thousands of Morgana games.  I was randomly matched with a gold adc main.  \n\nIn lane the enemy Nautilus was able to completely zone us and kill my adc.  Nautilus hook has a 14 second CD.  Black shield has a 23 second, and soon to be 26 second, cooldown.   My Caitlyn was unable to dodge a single hook in lane and died 7 times.  \n\nSo you're telling me that Morgana completely hard counters CC champions and I'm a high plat/low diamond Morgana one trick pony and my adc goes 0/7 in lane to a silver Nautilus?  What an insane hard counter!  Imagine if I was Janna or playing against an evenly skilled support.  I guess my adc would have gone 0/14.  \n\nThe truth is that the hook class of support champions are simply too powerful right now.  Yes, Black Shield will stop plays from being made, but most CC abilities have around half of the cooldown of black shield.  So consistently engaging against Morgana and her adc will almost always work.  Dark binding isn't even enough because it doesn't stop damage from being dealt by the enemy adc.  \n\nAnd keep in mind I'm talking about Morgana.  She is the BEST champion in the game against this class of support.   There is literally no counter play at all to hook champions besides dodging except for Morgana.  And you're nerfing Morgana.\n\nWhat's worse is that players who play these types of champions honestly believe Morgana is the unfun champion to play against.  Because everyone sure loves fighting Pyke, Blitz, Thresh, and Nautilus where one misstep means death.  \n\nIf Morgana is going to be nerfed and banned consistently then other supports need to be buffed/nerfed.  \n\nJanna and Lulu need some major buffs.  Hook champions need some damage and cc nerfs.\n\nPeople queue to play League of Legends.  The keyword here is play.  Being CCed and unable to act for 10 years because Pyke has 14 stuns is not enjoyable for anyone except for the Pyke.  \n\nIt's time for a reality check: the real cancer in this game are the hook champions.  They have all the power of dive champions but none of the risk.  Blitz isn't going to suddenly die if he misses a hook.  Neither are Thresh or Pyke.   Compare that to any of the enchanters in the game who miss an ability.  They're dead.   \n\nHooks need severe nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-04-30T21:08:22.593+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Oh, Blitzcrank hooked me into his team?\"\n\n{{champion:32}}\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saC13RJ8CUs","replies":[{"poster":"Morgana Deus","date":"2019-04-30T21:13:30.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol I've seen that happen a lot of times.

I'm a m7 Blitzcrank main that doesn't hook well in all honesty and I can say he definitely does not need a nerf. His q starts around 20 seconds without any cd at the beginning of the game, and on top of that a Blitzcrank can only pull 2 maybe 3 at the beginning due to his Q costing 100 mana per pull. Thresh Q is also around the same cd at the beginning of the game. Pyke and Naut (Naut who needed some buffs in all honesty) is another champion like blitz though his Q can be used on terrain and has a bigger hitbox. I can go on and on about the times I thought I could hook someone but the minion that happens to be a hair out gets pulled instead. Hook champions don't need nerfs like you're stating. Apologies about the ADC you got in your morg game but that doesn't constitute a nerf on all hook champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Morgana Deus","date":"2019-04-30T21:11:29.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blitz is probably the worst of the hook champions atm.  His kit is sorta out dated.  Are you pleased with the changes in 9.9?  \n\nBut the truth is if he does land a hook it is death generally or its going to burn flash.  He has tremendous kill pressure and just the fear of a hook is a lot of pressure. \n\nMorgana versus Blitz doesn't have the same pressure.  Morgana simply cannot possibly do enough damage to kill blitz unless the blitz is consistently out of position.  Morgana is completely reactive in this match up, and that gives Blitz lane priority which is a big deal.","replies":[{"poster":"Noodle Wacker","date":"2019-04-30T22:33:28.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just said Blitz is the worst hook champion atm and are still claiming they need to nerf him. When he goes to pull hes standing still which gives opportunity to cc him. Besides that he has to get up close to really do much besides pull, meanwhile morg can q, e, auto at him without really worrying about being pulled. Have minions? Stand behind them. Blitz and other hook champions cannot do much vs a wall of them. Thresh is the only one who can really do much only because of his auto range.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2019-04-30T21:00:54.889+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"probably the fact that \n\n1) hook champions have much, much shorter ranges of influence, due to minions\n\n2) morgana has free instant aoe wave clear from w \n\n3) t1 prefers aggressive supports because he plays hyper aggressive adc's\n\n4) your caitlyn should flat out have never been in range to be hooked, and has e to dodge it. she just got outplayed. \n\n5) what's cancer about morgana is how far she can move without actually putting her self in danger and getting decent harass, as most hook champions you just mentioned are melee ranged.\n\n6) hook based champions missing a hook does mean they practically cant act until that hook is back up regardless.","replies":[{"poster":"Morgana Deus","date":"2019-04-30T21:06:43.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"She has the auto attack range of thresh and her W does no damage for its mana cost.  All the weaknesses you claim hook champions have also apply to Morgana's Q.  \n\nYou can definitely beat Morgana as any hook champion if you're good at the champion.  You just have to be able to land your skill shots.  Worst case scenario you go even in lane.  \n\nIf you ever die to Morgana in lane you've severely misplayed.  She has no kill pressure versus any of the champions I've listed.

I do not feel morgana needs a nerf (like, come on. I already try to max my E second but that is a little rediculous for a cooldown) nor do I feel hook champions are over powered.\n\nI pick Morgana if I see a enemy hooker, but yet I also pick Blitzcrank into Morgana (cause i like to troll and bait out the black shields :^) lol)\n\nThe only \"support\" champ that i feel needs a bit of a nerf is Fiddlesticks's point and click instant cast 3 second fear. Which its funny that people claim Morgana is op because of her bind, but he fears for the same time and it absolutely ruins Yi and any phase rush champs trying to engage. Plus it acts more like a stun, and he can silence from a distance as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Morgana Deus","date":"2019-04-30T21:22:56.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana support is situationally decent and perhaps underpowered, but she's received a lot of attention due to her update and so people bandwagon ban her.  \n\nHer mid situation is a bit more complex. \n\nThe funny thing is that Bliz has a favorable win rate versus Morgana last I checked.  Most of the hook champions can and do be her in even skill match ups. But since most players in this game are silver and have no ability to do things like bait black shield and Q they just bitch and moan.  \n\nI think the only supports Morgana actually stomps are Alistar and Leona.  \n\nBut yeah a lot of good blitzcranks will just run at you hoping you pop black shield reactively or throw a Q.  The really good cranks I see generally go for an E knockup rather than an initial hook. \n\nYeah, the fiddles thing is ridiculous, but he's not in the spotlight right now so he won't receiving any nerfs.  If he got a skin next week or something people would be crying about him.  It's so predictable.","replies":[{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2019-04-30T21:37:42.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldnt say underpowered, but not overpowered, but yes.

That's not \"skill.\" That's \"basic use.\"\n-Mobis allow them to easily bypass minion blocks. That's not skill.\n-On board tankiness and no item damage outstrips fully built offensive champions in most cases.
