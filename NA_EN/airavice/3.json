More along the lines of Jayce, Caitlyn, or Vi finding out and deciding that a person holding that much power should be brought to justice.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nOh and for any Developers who want to jump in on this question, feel free to clarify.","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2018-09-03T03:51:36.965+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's assuming anyone in the present time would be capable of identifying a World Rune if they saw one or even comprehending what it's capable of. \n\nLike the Rune Wars was centuries ago, possibly pre-dating the settlement of old Zaun as well.

Unless you have that, your arguments are invalid. We cannot compare certain weaponry on either side because we do not know what the developers intended when it came to those particular weapons. Just because a weapon is called a \"death ray\" doesn't mean it is that powerful, it is up to the creators discretion. As for your arguments with Ryze, we will have to leave that interpretation up to the creators of the comic because I interpret that scene completely different from you. You also should understand that \"almost instant\" is NOT equal to \"Instant\" which means there is still a gap in reaction time. While I am not a mage by any means I am a Martial Artist and have been doing it for 14 years now so if you want to argue with me about the limits, and uses, of a persons reaction time be prepared for the fact that my experience trumps any arguments you have to the contrary unless you have cold hard evidence to back it up. \nTo finish this off, you have constantly been claiming things that have no proof or have never been said in any of the lore: \"Against Yago, ,Yago is an experienced mage, he disspeled the Rune Prison.\" There was never any statement that said his rune prison was dispelled; as far as the sentence I showed you before is concerned, yago waited till the time limit ran out. \n\nNow if you want to keep arguing this point, be my guest. Just be prepared for the fact that: unless you bring unadulterated evidence to the table (Like the quote i provided in my previous comment), your arguments are just going to be disproved. For the arguments that you claim which are based on opinion or visual interpretation: we are going to need a developer to verify if that is true or not; and if it is true then I will gladly back down. \n\nThank you for your participation in this forum, while I am a little miffed at the debate it has offered some information i needed and helped to answer my initial question of Piltover's behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RyzeTheSmurfMage","date":"2018-09-07T05:12:43.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First,  Ryze's Rune Prison didn't dissapear when Ryze wasn't holding it against Brand while he was teleporting. It dissapeared after because Ryze was out of range. Against Yago, ,Yago is an experienced mage, he disspeled the Rune Prison. And the Rune Prison still stoped his spell. Some of Ryze's spells ARE instant,  the arcane beams are almost instant  (beams are almost instant in general, he used those against Brand). His fire spell is instant. \"The older man clicked his fingers. With a purple flash, the bundle of deadwood flared to life; a campfire born in a single moment of willpower.\". He can set them both on fire instantly. His Rune Prison is instant. He can also spell flux them both and kill them by doing so. And any reaction feats for Vi? The only thing she brings to the table is her strenght which is usless against Ryze cause she will get trapped or blown up before she reaches him. AoE spells can't be dodged, Ryze blows them both up with an Arcane Burst.Let's assume that Vi somehow manages to get close to Ryze. Regardless of her strenght Ryze 1 shots her even in close range like he did with the bandit. \nCait and Vi's tech being the same tier as Viktor's and Jayce? Wtf? Viktor can cause gravity fields,  electrical storms, shields, and a death ray,  while Jayce has a transforming Hextech blaster whose blast is more powerfull than any of Cait's bullets.  Caitlyn's hextech rifle doesn't even shoot energy bolts,  only bullets, and bullets are inferior in League lore  (Ryze's normal arcane blasts were moving as fast as MF's bullets and the blasts are much more powerfull than a normal bullet). Vi's hextech gaunlent is not something uncommon, there are many hextechs that enhances your power. Viktor and Jayce made their own hextechs and they are the 2 smartest men in Piltover regarding technology. Viktor is a f**** cyborg ffs don't tell me Cait's rifle is on par with that. And Ryze is out of Cait and Vi league those 2 are weak asf and have no way of defending themselves or hacks like Ryze does.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Airavice","date":"2018-09-07T01:26:45.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all you need to back up your accusations with facts. There is no evidence that Ryze can use telekinesis as when he grabbed the word rune he was using a rune prison to move it, and once the connection was broken it fell to the floor. Now if you are going to use the logic that the rune was moved with telekinesis then fine, but that means the actions against the two creatures in the comic were arcane blasts NOT telekinetic blasts. And no he didn't blast them into one another: He was firing at two attempting to jump on him at once like the one did two panels previously. Now since that part is up for interpretation, and I am quite sure you did not create the comic, let us agree that that panel should not be used for evidence. As for his fight against Yago read the text carefully :\n\"Coming to his senses, Ryze rooted the frost mage in place with a ring of arcane power, giving himself just enough time to get to his feet.\nRyze and Yago circled each other, clashing with powers the world had not seen in ages.\"\n\nJust enough time... it doesn't last forever unless he holds it and the prison doesn't stop a ranged user from firing outward attacks.\n\nAs for your last statement ... everything you said was false. I am going off of facts here, as in what is stated in the lore. Not spouting things that are simply not true. Maybe in the game a Caitlyn and Vi matchup is bad but in the actual lore there are far stronger than the game makes them out to be. You also have to understand that Vi and Caitlyn have just as powerful hextech as Victor and Jayce. While the two may be geniuses it doesn't change the fact that both the hammer, the rifle, and the gauntlets are made with a very similar power output; they just have different uses.\n\nAlso, as i said before: THERE IS A CAST TIME FOR ALL OF RYZE'S SPELLS!!! Nothing he casts is instantaneous. There is always enough time for someone with quick reaction to dodge them, such as Vi.\n\nWhat we really need is a Dev to intervene and show us what would actually happen.\n\nI should also point out that just because he is one of the most powerful mages around doesn't mean he is way out of anyone's league... with the exception of beings like Zoe and Aurelion Sol, he is still human.... just with purple skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RyzeTheSmurfMage","date":"2018-09-06T09:39:40.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You clearly are underestimating Ryze. Ryze is still the most powerfull mage if we exclude Xerath. Ryze had to hold the Rune Prison because it was BRAND, against Yago he did it with a mere gesture and didn't have to hold it. Those weren't energy blasts they were telekinetic ones. Ryze holded them both then smashed them into one another above him. He didn't blast them into one-another. And Ryze has shown also shown telekinetic grabs when he was grabbing the World Rune from Brand's reach. Ryze can use other spells while he is doing it actually, he was blocking Brand's attacks with 1 hand and disspeling one of his beams with another. I doubt Vi can dodge an Arcane Beam since that sh** is almost instant. That duo is weak asf against most champs tbh and it's very overrated. If the duo was replaced by Jayce and Viktor then yeah the battle would be 50/50 since Jayce and Viktor have incredibly powerfull Hextech, imo the most powerfull devices and weapons in Piltover and Zaun that can be carried by 1 man, and are geniuses. Ryze could just blow them both up instantly with an arcane burst. Or just set them on fire instantly. And the burst is instant unlike a storm. Or spell flux their a** since those 2 don't have any ways to def against it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Airavice","date":"2018-09-06T08:31:34.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all i never said that they could simply \"beat him.\" I said it would even the odds, and Ryze isn't as powerful as you think. Remember, his cage does not last forever: he had to constantly hold the spell (in the comic at least) for it to hold Brand; when he left the spell evaporated. His telekinesis does not exist, as the panel you are referring to is him blasting two of them in the air with energy which he, again, has to charge and hold. You're right his shield based on the comic, but he also can't use other spells when it is activated; plus Caitlyn would not be stupid enough to keep shooting and waste her ammo on something that wouldn't break in the first 2 shots, her main weapon is intelligence after all. \n\nNow: Let's say for a moment that Ryze can easily cast 2 spells at once what would the scenario be? Caitlyn would stand far back out of Ryze's range in order to hit him, while Vi charged him up front. Ryze would catch and hold Vi: but if he tried to shoot her Caitlyn would fire, if he tried to raise a shield then either he backs away slowly or Caitlyn fires a huge net at him that could disrupt him enough for Vi to get free. If he fires at Vi, he risks her dodging and making this up close and personal where Vi is at an advantage and where Caitlyn can take advantage of the distraction despite a shield, he is still human and can only react so fast. Teleporting away would then be his best option before the fight starts, or during if he can manage it; but there is a caveat to that: it takes a while to cast and Caitlyn could have set traps around the area where he could teleport most easily. \n\nIn short: While he may be able to get away with ease or hold them at bay, he is going to have a hell of a time defeating the duo. It doesn't matter is he is the most powerful mage when the champions he fights against can counter his actions. Even if he summons a massive storm that can blow them away for some reason, they can just shoot him as he does it; magic in the universe is known for its power not necessarily its speed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"UomoAfide","date":"2018-09-03T23:53:46.593+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering this is Piltovians we are talking about i wouldn't really put it behind them to have created some sort of magic-dampening device, possibly developed by using imported petricite... possibly?
