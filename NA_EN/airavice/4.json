I imagine it is made up of docks on the outer rim where the city then flows into a mass of buildings that merge with the forest and the plains before it reaches the base of the mountain. \r\n\r\nI am not that great with architecture so if any of you guys have thoughts, or a developer can answer this, that would be great.","replies":[]}
