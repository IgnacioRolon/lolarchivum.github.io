She might be a little on in years compared to the character but her facial features and acting as a ruthless character might just do it.)\r\nAmanda Righetti - Miss Fortune (Her actions in Captain America speak for themselves, but maybe we can see a solemn but stern pirate princess from her.)\r\nBen Kingsley &ndash; Ryze (I have seen this man play sooo many roles over the years so it would not surprise me for him to fit the role of a depressed mage who struggles with the temptation of power every day.)\r\nAlex Pettyfer &ndash; Ezreal (The movie &#039;I am number four&#039; is not the greatest but I think it was underrated when it came to the acting. Alex might be able to pull off the adventurous young ruin searcher.)\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nOh, and for those who are interested: I am trying to get reply&#039;s for my other post &quot;Locations of Stories in Runeterra?&quot; in the &#039;Story, Art, &amp; Sound&#039; page; if anyone has any input on that question i would appreciate the help.","replies":[{"poster":"Choke Me Chun Li","date":"2018-08-20T22:09:40.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mf = Christina Hendricks. cuz of... reasons.
