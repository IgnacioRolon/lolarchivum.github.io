Hybrid ratios. This is frustrating to me since when I see hybrid damage ratios I start thinking of possible itemization. The Trinity force AP is removed which was the good item on skarner if you were able to get snow balled. The other good spell blade item Ice born also had it&#039;s AP removed. Rageblade I&#039;ve used on skarner once or twice awhile ago and maybe I&#039;m wrong but it didn&#039;t feel strong (AFAIremember). Gunblade I&#039;ve honestly never tried or considered on skarner. All of his abilities scale off AP, and his Q and R scale off both. His Q is a big damage source, and it mostly scales off BONUS AD, also having a pretty nice .3 Ap ratio. Was this champion left behind by IBG/TF reworks a bit? Should I be trying a rageblade/gunblade build?\r\n\r\n2. Power Budget. Why is all his damage (power budget) tied up this way with mixed ratio? Is he meant to have an impossible or awkward build path to access his potential damage? Back in season 5 you could access your ratio&#039;s with a trinity force buy, if you were doing well enough to justify going that big damage route, and it all paid off for skarner (maybe not the crit chance.. but the rest was gold). If you needed more armour you could go IBG and still get some AP for your mostly AP scaling abilities. I remember some people building runic echo (out of sheen) on skarner and that was pretty nice. It feels like his potential is there but he has no god damn items to buy anymore. I&#039;d rather have stronger Q passive and ditch the AP ratio, or maybe change the damage type while charged from .8 bonus AD to .8 total AD,  but no,  they spread skarner power budget out too thin. No, he&#039;s gotta have his Q  power budget spread out so much he can never actually realize it, because it requires BONUS AD, AP, attack speed (not required, but it encourages you to build attack speed)\r\n\r\n3. Zephyr was a great item on skarner. WTF RITO\r\n\r\n4. Build Questions. Is it just me or is every single jungle enchant probably viable? I have only used Cinderhulk forever now, but it&#039;s so clear that skarner wants to use devourer - but devourer doesn&#039;t feel good on skarner to me so I quit building it, I felt like if I went devourer it was bad unless I kept going into damage, skarner devourer isn&#039;t like Yi or Xin devourer, it&#039;s not as much about the on hit build it&#039;s to basically put your Q on instant cool down constantly. \r\n\r\n5. Skarners shield.  I miss the time when skarners AA&#039;s reduced the cool down on all his stuff, but I mostly miss it on his shield. You COULD play him like Udyr if you were able to bring his shield up more often. I know people probably don&#039;t think of it too much but I think of skarner as kind of like Udyr, runs fast, spams, shields, stuns, hard to kill, mixed damage ratio/types, any item at all will work on this champ... But does anyone actually play him like that? Not really because his shield doesn&#039;t work like Udyr&#039;s. I don&#039;t really know what to think about this because it does work pretty good but you don&#039;t really ever get to use it optimally. Like, you can&#039;t spec for it properly, no AP yet again. Why did they put his power budget into an AP scaling? It&#039;s just an excuse to keep it shittier I think. Take the AP ratio away and give it missile speed or base damage or missile width or longer stun or stronger stun. Or make an item that supports mixed damage tanks like skarner or Udyr instead of making them play like either damage OR tank, like the mixed damage items (a total of 2...) and life steal type stuff.\r\n\r\n6. Does anyone else feel like skarner being reworked in 5.16 and them doing a large AD over haul and removing items a couple patches later was short sighted as hell? Steraks gage could be a beautiful item on skarner if his Q scaled off total AD.  Steraks would buff his autos and his R, but they nerfed his R damage a lot. IBG/TF changes, zephyr, runic echoes, all these changes didn&#039;t help him IMO.\r\n\r\n7. Intended identity. Riot calls him a juggernaut. His kit is run up to you and duel you to death, not instantly but over a little bit.

The biggest factor separating them is the speed of their damage application. Udyr can activate his R or Q and immediately proc a huge amount of damage, then just run away a bit with his shield on.

Other than his shield scaling off max HP (as well as AP...) and the historical play style of skarner, what really makes him a tank? why can't he be a damage dealer? if Udyr doesn't build damage he doesn't DO any damage, not quickly anyway like you're saying. He only does big damage when he is built for it. You're saying because his meta builds don't include AP that he was balanced around not having AP. I say you're forgetting triforce and sheen used to give AP when he reworked, so why wouldn't the designers include that in his possible damage potential? you're talking like he was reworked during the current itemization options. Why are you claiming his AP ratio's aren't really counted? Did Riot say that?\n\nZephyr had 10% MS and tenacity. Swift boots ... it was a build.

After you said it is total, i went and checked lolwiki and started up a game and you're right it is total. I think I knew that before because I did used to buy steraks on him during 5.16  but I must have read the riot site at some point and assumed I had been wrong prior. I don't know why they can't update their site, this skewed my whole thought about his AD damage\n\nSkarner stacks up a rageblade faster than most champions can.

All of these makes him very, very easily countered as a damage dealer but far more resilient as a tank.\n\n>if Udyr doesn't build damage he doesn't DO any damage\n\nYes he does. Udyr's base damages are insane. That's why he's an incredibly threatening fighter even if he only builds one damage item.\n\n>Why are you claiming his AP ratio's aren't really counted? Did Riot say that?\n\nIt's a generic design principle that they use for a champion. If the strongest build for a champion doesn't include a certain numerical aspect of their design, than that design aspect is not a part of their balance. This was recently discussed with the AP ratio on Poppy's W. People were asking for it to be removed and replaced with something she'll use because she doesn't build AP, and Riot pointed out that because she doesn't build AP, they can't replace the AP ratio on her W with something she'll use because that would just make her stronger. The decision to make the W stronger or not is completely seperated from the AP ratio because the AP ratio isn't part of her power budget.\n\nBecause Skarner's strongest builds all incorporate no AP, the AP ratios aren't a part of his balance. Sheen and Triforce used to give a small amount of AP, so the AP ratios used to provide a very small amount of his total power. Now that they don't, he doesn't have any more AP items that he builds, so the AP ratios are irrelevant. If he's strongest with Cinderhulk and no AP items, than the AP ratios aren't part of his power budget right now.\n\n>Zephyr had 10% MS and tenacity. Swift boots ... it was a build. I doubt you ever bought it TBH\n\nI've built literally everything on Skarner. It was mediocre. It wasn't terrible, but you could literally always find a better build no matter what you were trying to accomplish. Some people found it enjoyable, and that was fine, but if you wanted to use the best builds.\n\n>You have a 1 dimensional view of the champion because of how you've played him.\n\nYou're making a really, really wrong assumption about me right now, and you need to stop that. I have played a LOT of this champion. I've played any build you care to suggest for Skarner. I've used devourer, and I've used rageblade, and I've used them quite a few times. That's why I can say with confidence that they are weaker options than tanky builds. They can be enjoyable (or really, really frustrating if the enemy is competent), but they are strictly weaker, particularly if the enemy knows how to play against them. The pure autoattacking style just doesn't work out for him because of how easy it is for enemies to not be autoattacked by him.\n\n>I used to build him triforce/swift/zephyr and it was fun tbh.\n\n\"Fun\" is the key word there. You want to build him for the sake of fun, and that's fine. You can do that, and the kit allows it. However, I'm talking about the builds that work best. If you want the strong build, you are unfortunately limited to tanky builds. If you don't want the strongest build and you want to play what you'll enjoy more, that's perfectly fine and it's a valid choice to make. There's nothing wrong with that and more power to you. Seriously, I mean that. If you're having fun, there's no reason to change anything.\n\n> I don't know why they can't update their site, \n\nYeah, that would be nice, wouldn't it?","replies":[{"poster":"CHEAT ENGINE ssd","date":"2016-04-15T06:00:00.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man I probably don't know what \"scaling\" means I guess and am using the words wrong. When I play Skarner and go cinder/IBG  I feel like I do a lot of damage and can 1v1 most champs, and often times I'll even go for the 1v2, to me it feels like I'm killing people and doing good damage to them. It's not like an ADC late game auto attacking a mage or something, but it feels good, and that's with tank items. The odd time I've built more damage I feel like I'm doing good damage. I'm not a calculator or even a math guy, I go by feel more. I will say that wit's end does not feel like it adds much damage to skarner. \n\nI understand what you're saying about the power budget but to me, when I see a ratio there, and think back to the Tri Force, and them calling him a juggernaut, I wonder about what the designer intended on him. I read awhile ago that Vi was intended as a top laner, but players play her jungle. I think Skarner was balanced and designed as a juggernaut and probably intended to use triforce and rageblade. He stacks his rageblade really really quickly, I bet quicker than most champions do in fact. Spellblade feels so good on his kit, it has always felt like a great item on skarner. \n\nI think tank skarner being the strongest skarner is true, but is it possibly because tank ANYTHING is pretty much the best version of that champ right now?

It's not like an ADC late game auto attacking a mage or something, but it feels good, and that's with tank items.\n\nSure, but this is because Skarner's inherent damage over time is good and his base AD is amazing making sheen items incredibly strong on him. The thing is, he doesn't actually get that much more damage from building a damage item. His AD and AP ratios aren't that great, particularly since he uses total AD ratios that are lower than comparable bonus AD ratios would be. He doesn't get to actually autoattack very much because of his poor sticking power and mobility, so items based purely around constant autoattacking like rageblade aren't very strong.\n\n> but to me, when I see a ratio there, and think back to the Tri Forceand them calling him a juggernaut, I wonder about what the designer intended on him.\n\nJust to be clear, power budget is not something set in stone when the champion is designed. It changes on a patch-by-patch basis. If Skarner can't buy AP this patch, then AP ratios aren't part of his power budget now. If he can buy AP in the future, that will change.\n\nThis means that it doesn't really matter for his power budget that triforce used to give AP. It just has no bearing whatsoever on what his power budget is right now. It gives historical context on why he has AP ratios, but that doesn't change the fact that they aren't part of his power budget right now.\n\nAs for what the designer intended, I'm not sure it matters so much because even they admit they didn't succeed. They thought he would be a juggernaut, and since then they've said they failed because he ended up feeling like a tank with identity issues. They regret having him as part of the juggernaut rework (it wasn't large enough), and they've scheduled him for a larger full gameplay rework that they say will make him more of a tank.\n\n>I think Skarner was balanced and designed as a juggernaut and probably intended to use triforce and rageblade.\n\nTriforce, yes. He has a very high base AD, a spammable spell, a need for sticking power, and a lack of scaling with true damage items. That makes him an ideal triforce champion, although it competes for that slot with Iceborn Gauntlet, which also fits him very well.\n\nRageblade, kind of, but not so much. They designed Skarner to not be able to reliably autoattack targets multiple times under most conditions. That's the key aspect that determines whether or not rageblade is usable. Stacking it fast is a nice side benefit, but that's pretty unimportant overall, particularly for melee champions. it's not the core aspect determining the item's usability. Potential to autoattack freely is the number one test determining if the item is beneficial, and Skarner very often fails that test.\n\nRageblade is highly situational, and relies on you facing a team where you can constantly autoattack targets for DPS without either A. Getting bursted down early game when you pick it up over defensive items, B. Getting kited, displaced, locked down, or anything else that could prevent you from autoattacking, C. missing out on the opportunity to try to lock down a priority backline target, or D, getting outtraded in melee combat by a pure duelist like Shyv. Basically, you need a heavily melee team that isn't going to burst you down, kite or peel you too hard, and aren't made of superduelists. If you can meet those conditions, it actually is a competitive item. Those conditions are just relatively rare, even in the tank meta that we've got going on right now. It has a place on him, but it's very situational.\n\n>I think tank skarner being the strongest skarner is true, but is it possibly because tank ANYTHING is pretty much the best version of that champ right now?\n\nTank Skarner has been the best Skarner since the rework, and we've gone through times that have not been particularly favorable for tank items since then. Given that he's remained best with tank items constantly through that, it's a fair conclusion that this very likely isn't due to temporary item trends. We would have expected damage items to have been superior for at least some period, particularly during the time when rageblade was OP as hell.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CoolMike127","date":"2016-04-14T05:27:12.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"U build him 40% (or 45%) CDR tank with cinderhulk or AD on-hit with Warrior of Devourer","replies":[{"poster":"Beldair","date":"2016-04-14T05:43:57.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see a spam abilities under tower enemy death play going on with that build.","replies":[{"poster":"CoolMike127","date":"2016-04-14T05:51:41.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skarner is dependent on his abilities and auto-attack combo effects, so it makes sense, he was always a spam your abilities champion.
