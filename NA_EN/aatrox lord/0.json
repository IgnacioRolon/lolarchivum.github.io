But every now and then I see a dedicated  {{champion:112}} and they're always a threat.  If you continue to play him it will be an uphill battle, but possibly rewarding in the end.\n\nI would say that {{champion:61}} is probably the easiest tier level champion to learn if you want a more reliable pick in the meta.  {{champion:42}} is also reliable and not brutally demanding and offers room to grow.\n\nIf you want to master a truly high skill level pick - but one who can carry incredibly hard and has sustain other mages lack - {{champion:8}} can make plays no one else can, but you'd have to study some of the LCS players dominating the scene with him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"directioner boy1","date":"2018-07-24T14:08:01.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the strongest mid laner to carry is orianna cause she helps a lot at teamfights but talon can carry 2","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oxyrotten","date":"2018-02-21T12:56:50.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the love of god just don't {{champion:157}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Get Ogre Here","date":"2018-02-21T04:27:39.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In terms of assassins Talon and Katarina are very good.\n\n* Talon is personally my main, and I love him, I'm pretty much a one trick at this point. He's a lot of fun and, especially in low elo, it's fun to see the enemy not expecting your level 2 cheese.\n\n-He excels at roaming mainly, because really his only mobility is his wall jumps. He roams very effectively and if you do it right you can go right around common warding spots.\n\n-Be careful if you do play him though. He is in a pretty bad spot right now. He's getting buffed tomorrow but not by a ton. I think he'll get more in 8.5. We'll see though.\n\n\n* Katarina is also very good, but takes a lot more skill to play. I haven't played her in a while but it seems like she's pretty strong right now and for good reasons.\n\n-She has pretty good poke in lane and you can get an easy electrocute proc off by Qing and Eing to the blade as long as it's very close to the person. \n\n-She has a ton of mobility and can easily juke skillshots and out-maneuver opponents. This also helps, along with her AOE passive and ult, to make her very strong in teamfights. \n\nIn terms of mages like Viktor I'd have to say Orianna and Taliyah.\n\n* Orianna is a very strong champion in SoloQ and LCS. She brings many things to a team and can fill many niches fairly well.\n\n-She has a pretty strong laning phase because of her long-range poke and the ability to Q-W very fast before most players can dodge it. She also has her shield to win trades and help out teammates in ganks or skirmishes.\n\n- Her ulti makes her very good in teamfights if used well. It can take some time to perfect her ulti but when you do it's pure gold. Be prepare to have your genital sucked all night if you consistently land 3+ person ults, as you can solo-carry just by having this skill.\n\n* Taliyah is decently strong for slightly different reasons, but still can be played effectively in SoloQ and LCS.\n\n-She is very combo-reliant so if you can't land her combos you will do almost nothing. It took me until I got mastery 4 on her to get the hang of her combo (E-W-Q), but for some people it comes naturally.\n\n-Her ulti makes her one of the better mages for roaming because she can flank laners with relative ease from a pretty good distance, especially at ulti rank 2-3.\n\nI would give you Viktor tips, but I haven't played him much so I don't know much about him. Sorry! ^.^\n\nEDIT: Sorry if the formatting is weird, I don't really know what happened lol","replies":[{"poster":"Aatrox Lord","date":"2018-02-21T12:53:26.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I freaking can’t play taliyah to save my life but my sister is an ori main also I am absolute trash with Katarina but I might try ori\nThx","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-21T04:14:17.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most assassins _are_ midlaners, though?\n\n{{champion:84}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:142}} come to mind, or maybe {{champion:134}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:103}}  for something a bit different.","replies":[{"poster":"Get Ogre Here","date":"2018-02-21T04:30:02.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TaEs67yH,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-02-21T04:14:17.233+0000)\n>\n> Most assassins _are_ midlaners, though?\n> \n> {{champion:84}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:142}} come to mind, or maybe {{champion:134}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:103}}  for something a bit different.\n\nI like how Syndra come to mind as an assassin before Talon, Zed, or even Kayn XD","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-21T05:33:55.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Get Ogre Here,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TaEs67yH,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2018-02-21T04:30:02.954+0000)\n>\n> I like how Syndra come to mind as an assassin before Talon, Zed, or even Kayn XD\n\nI was kind of assuming OP already plays some of the AD top/jungle assassins.. but yes, Syndra.
