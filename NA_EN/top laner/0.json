But Garena who runs certain regions of League of Legends was able to. At this post here. Vietname is also the second largest region according to riot. https://lienminh.garena.vn/thongbao/loi-hop-huyet-nguyet-mo-ban-bang-tinh-hoa-lam they state.\n\n​\n\n&quot;On the morning of January 11, 2019, while adding items to the store for patch 9.1, there was an incident that caused the Blood Moon Capsules to be sold for 1 BE, while the actual value of this item is 140 RP. The price was up for about 20 minutes, during which, some players bought the Blood Moon Capsules with BE.\n\n​\n\nTo ensure fairness, the technician team reverted all the Blood Moon Capsules purchased with BE, including skins, related skins, gemstones, and (I&#039;m not sure what &quot;crystal fragments&quot; are. Skin shards maybe?) were removed from accounts.\n\n​\n\nIn the future, some measures will be implemented to prevent similar incidents from happening.\n\n​\n\nBest regards!&quot;","replies":[]}
