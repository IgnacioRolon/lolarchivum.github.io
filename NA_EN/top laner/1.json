People exploited this and got literally thousands of chests for free! Now instead of doing a revert on this, they are letting people keep them. Letting people keep hundreds of gem stones and hundreds of skins for bug abusing. This is pretty sad and devalues anything any of us has bought from this company. But they are reverting prestige points for the new Aatrox skin? You can look at the twitter comments for examples of what people have gotten.\r\n\r\nHeres two tweets from a rioter. \r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/KenAdamsNSA/status/1083506611052634113\r\n\r\nheres him saying no revert on chests.\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/KenAdamsNSA/status/1083507179921887232","replies":[]}
