I had over 300 rp left, but now that I logged off and back in a few hours later, it's saying I'm only have in the 100's. Could I be told why? And how I can get my RP that I paid for back? It happened multiple times before.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-21T21:59:03.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look into this, but was unable to see anything out of the ordinary.  After Popstar Ahri, it looks like two championship chests were also purchased just a few minutes after.  You can also check your purchase history in the store, under the account section.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[]}]}
