Same old story with these companies take,take take, never give back just bleed you dry and then wonder why everyone leaves.\r\n\r\nIf they actually punished these players then maybe there would be less of them so we could all have some fun maybe.\r\n\r\nWell riot I for one am very disappointed with you and you are not the only game around anymore, so the ball is in your court do something or watch your player base slowly dwindle and then all you will be left with is the higher divisions and their smurf accounts.\r\n\r\nAs for all you League players who actually play to have fun, try and climb the ranks and do your best, I wish you all the best of luck in your future games and I do hope that none of you have to suffer too much with all these people who want to spoil your fun on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfhaven32","date":"2016-06-26T05:21:28.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would help if in blind picks new players were not dropped off in the deep end of the pool. They have player levels in this game they should be using that or something. The new players in the game need the time to learn player vs player and the long time players don't want games where they are babysitting or having bad games because one player is just to new. It's not any fun on the side of being called a feeder they just need a better way of sorting out players in blind picks. New players are good for a game. It's all about the sorting out in blind picks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Im Genie","date":"2016-06-24T17:18:29.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only see Riot bans toxic players but not troller or feeder. cuz after that game they got win and nothing happen. Riot should add kick button when someone in team troll or feeding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhoenixUprisingX","date":"2016-06-23T21:59:24.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea it was good before, players who deserved it got punished and you felt like they had your back, but now it seems like we are all alone and riot does not GAF about if we are having fun or not as long as they get their money. I hope they sort it soon because it is getting really silly now, over half the gamesI play have 1 of those types of players these days.\n\nI will say that coincidentally now that the schools have finished for the summer there seems to be a lot more of it going on, I have only been playing for about 10 months but I have seen a drastic increase now compared to any other time I have played.","replies":[]},{"poster":"yeulx","date":"2016-06-23T21:49:20.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it happens to everyone.. it takes time to punnish them since if im right riot is now using an automatic system untill they decide what to do with the tribunal system... wish they brought it back.. i loved the power that came with it when u had all of ur cases correct","replies":[]}]}
