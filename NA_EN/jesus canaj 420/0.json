The target will have 0 health. After intense calculations, this means that you will always gain 0 bonus ad according to the tooltip.

Monsters get marked occasionally by Wolf, until you've completed 6 hunts. Damage from Mark of the Kindred is uncapped, so in an infinitely long game you could get infinite damage. In reality though given the CD on the Mark and the way you need to kill a specific pre selected target you won't normally be able to get as crazy late game as Veigar or Nasus frequently do.","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2015-09-16T08:58:55.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I think I got it.
