The ping is fine 40-45 ms. I cannot move or cast a spell from the champion i selected for 2-3 seconds, after , it`s normal, then again, 2-3 seconds cannot cast or move. It`s quite difficult to play a game, when you are toplaner or jungler (or everylane), cause in this time , you can kill or be killed.  I`ve searched for previous fixes to this problem, none worked. Please, a solution or a half of solution would be fine.\r\n\r\nTy kindly.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-10T22:41:41.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This definitely sounds like bursts of packet loss that you're experiencing.

It goes from 30-ish all the way to 3-4 thousand in a matter of seconds. I have tried this on multiple computers on multiple networks, so it can't be because of my network. And I can't even do anything because every few seconds I get the \"Attempting to Reconnect\" sign. I also have been getting hit with the leaver penalty over and over again. I can't even play the game. After all the money I put into this game, why are there so many issues...? Can I report Riot after game for latency issues?","replies":[]}]}
