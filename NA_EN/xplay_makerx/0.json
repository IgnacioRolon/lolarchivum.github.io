Additionally, higher grades for wins (such as S or S+) won't increase your chances of earning more key fragments, but playing in premades with friends will increase the chance to earn fragments a bit more.\n\nFor a complete rundown on the system, check out our [Hextech Crafting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide).

The system has been out for 6ish months and I'm sitting on 7 chests and only 1 key fragment. About 2 dozen match made games in the past week or so means i play enough that i think i should be netting enough keys to open chests, but i just don't get them.\n(I own all the champions so the bug described on the linked page isn't the problem) \n\n I haven't been in the local probability minimum for 6 months because in that time it should have reset several times, so this is a long term trend. \n\nAs i think about the problem what might be happening is that on day 1 all 12 key frags are available, and if in the month you earn 10 of them the system resets and you have 12 available, ignoring the fact that 2 went un earned. If in that same month i earned 3 chests the fourth is still available to earn after the month is over along side the first chest of the next month. In short the chest drop distribution system is a smoother function than the key drop distribution, allowing someone to earn more chests than keys under certain circumstances. Worth looking into maybe making keys drop in 3s weekly to correspond to chests instead of 12s monthly and allowing the unearned keys to pile up (up to 12) the same way chests do (up to 4).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lew","date":"2016-09-13T03:53:19.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The key fragment droprate is a curve and as you get more fragments you have less chance of getting another one.
