Hang in there friend we can make it through!\n\nits just really frustrating to have invested so much into a game (I've played since season 4 and spent almost $2000 on rp{{summoner:3}} ) that in the long run wasnt really worth the frustration n the end, but i met allot of cool people on it and i just wanna play again with my friends. Hopefully Riot will release a fix for it or atleast give us a fix for it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rickynewt","date":"2019-06-26T02:19:26.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this happens to me, sometimes it lasts like 3 minutes of zero FPS... every time between 6 minutes and 10 minutes game time, only once a game, every single game. sometimes it only lasts a few seconds, normally about 45-60 seconds. i'm proud of myself because i suspected this was on riots end. o well hope its fixed soon","replies":[]},{"poster":"Furry Erotica","date":"2019-04-19T08:09:37.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's 100% a memory leak.

Though there are various issues I've seen players report regarding the League Client, I haven't seen something specifically like this. \n\nFrom what you've described it would normally sound like a memory leak save the fact that the performance issues you're seeing are happening right after running the client. Normally for memory leak issues, the problem doesn't show up right off the bat, but it just gets worse as time goes on. In either case, it might be helpful to check your Task Manager to see if the League Client is taxing your CPU or how it's utilizing your RAM.\n\nCan you reach out to my colleagues through a Support Site ticket?
