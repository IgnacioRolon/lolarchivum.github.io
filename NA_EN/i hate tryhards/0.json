I'm a support main like you currently in Plat V. When it comes to currently strong supports my recommendations are Janna, Nautilus, and Nami.\n\nJanna is a peeling powerhouse that will keep your carries alive if you can master her and all the same you can use your W and Q to effectively make picks. Every single one of her abilities can be used for peel, especially her passive. She is great with sieging comps due to the bonus AD from her shield and dissipate almost any form of engage (except Sion, Vi and Malphite) with her ultimate and Q.\n\nNautilus is currently a better version of Leona. Leona holds a bit more damage in her kit, but Nautilus is a tiny bit tankier (a lot tankier late game) thanks to his W and base stats. Leona is great and holding one target still for a kill which makes her powerful in teamfights, and nautilus is great at the same thing with his R and Q. HOWEVER, he offers more AoE damage through his W and E, and can peel for his carries with just an auto attack.\n\nNami sits nicely between being a peeler and engager. Her kit allows for both but isn't top tier at both. She works well against hard engage and poke comps, but is weak to siege comps. She excels at making picks with her E and Q, while can be an excellent peeler with her W and R. Only downside to Nami is that her best support builds involve high Mana Regen and tank, while her kit doesn't synchronize well with the tankiness.\n\nIf you can master these 3 climbing should become easier for you. If you want help learning some things with Thresh or any of these supports feel free to  hit me up.

But since she's been brought up, I'm just going to throw this little footnote here:\n\nJanna is probably one of the hardest supports to *truly* play. However, she is also consistently one of the strongest. She's also reasonably safe from changes. Her win rate was the highest in the game for a while (I don't know if it still is), but Riot deemed her healthy and balanced.\nShe's like Leona in that she's super specialized; but her specialty (peeling) is *always* in demand.\n\n*But, as before, I'm just some unranked scrub. so feel free to ignore me.*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-07-13T04:21:59.701+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nami is my favorite.

However people often (ADC usually) overestimate Nami's damage or tankiness and that leads to easily losing a fight or trade. \n\nIn lane however Leona has the ability to get her ADC fed and snowballing, but she has very little peel, poke or  lane presence apart from every so often throwing a blade at the enemy, hoping the thresh does not flail her off. However Nami can poke, annoy, cc and even heal her ADC all in the comfort of behind the minion wave.\n\nIn my opinion Nami would be a better choice, she is safer and lets you work on actual support mechanics and decision making without dying from a simple mistake or slip of your \"e\". BUT dont be devo if you get her and things dont work out, she is a tricky support, but hey, im a Thresh main, i think he has a great kit, good poke, good engage, good escape, good cc so maybe try picking him up and seeing if he fits your needs (Another tricky kit however)\n\nAnyway Good Luck with supporting and if you have any question throw them my way mate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Delphinium","date":"2015-07-13T16:19:44.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally scared to play Leona in soloq because there is always a time where adc or teammates won't follow up for damage and I ending up dying.

Some of the ADCs she meshes best with are Varyne, Varus, Caitlyn, Miss Fortune and Lucian. Nami is bad against mobile champions (Ezreal, Leona, Lucian, Graves, etc.) who can dodge her sill shots or close the gap and outtrade her poke with their all-in potentials.\nI like Leona better and if you pick her it would give your roster much more versatility as her style is different than what you're used to. Leona is an in your face, all-in, kill-or-be-killed style support. She is a kill/poke style support yet her lack of sustain leaves her vulnerable to poke. Leona is a much better team fighter than Nami is as Leona likes to be in the middle of the action whereas Nami skirts along the outside of the fight poking, peeling and healing as she sees fit.
