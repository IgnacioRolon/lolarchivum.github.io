I also can't comment when I go on somebody's post. It says that I have to be level 7 or above to post, but I am; I'm level 23 at the time of writing!\r\nIs this a common bug or is there some other reason I can't post, and it just doesn't tell me?\r\n\r\nBy the way, I'm sure that this would fit in a much better board, but when I press the \"Choose a Board\" scroll-down button thing, it just comes up with two options: \"Choose a Board\", and \"Help &amp; Support\", or something like those names. If somebody could tell me why that is, it would also be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-22T00:49:13.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, it's not *super* common, but this is definitely something that happens here and there. Most of the time you can simply post here in H&S to get your boards level to sync up with your Summoner level, and it looks like this one must have done the trick since I can see you as level 23 now!","replies":[{"poster":"TacoPochaco","date":"2018-02-25T00:04:58.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VoTerra","date":"2018-03-24T15:58:45.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully this makes it work","replies":[]},{"poster":"o8Zeki8o","date":"2018-03-23T22:27:53.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem, acct is lvl 43 :o","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fourcast4","date":"2018-03-14T20:29:44.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hm...","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeraldoftheBaron","date":"2017-09-12T00:02:05.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the fix!","replies":[{"poster":"deXtrapatoR","date":"2018-03-10T20:41:17.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"test","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Low Elo Ganks","date":"2018-03-08T21:01:30.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue.
