Is this something that consistently happens or just a one-time thing?\n\nIt is happening more and more since Riot refuses to address the problem of Primary and Secondary roles and supports. \n\nI used to go Jungle / Support, but after 50 games of only ever getting Support (except when I was on a premade) I changed to Jungle / Top.  The pool of support players is drying up, thus wait times are increasing.","replies":[{"poster":"Grey Wolf","date":"2016-03-22T01:49:37.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Queued Jungle/Support got support in 5 seconds.\n\nQueued Jungle/Top at for nearly 8 minutes before getting Jungle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ArlanKels","date":"2016-03-21T23:31:19.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotBok,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=IAfGgWHt,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-03-21T19:24:23.501+0000)\n>\n> Hmm...this doesn't seem normal.

If you don't choose support or fill(Which means you're being support 90% of the time) then you're going to see some extremely long queue times.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MurkCentral","date":"2016-05-05T03:37:34.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fix the wait time for rank bronze or disabled it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gold55","date":"2016-03-25T00:48:33.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"only 17 minutes ??   that is fast. me and 3 friends in ranked -- all picked fill  at  b5 --  took over !
