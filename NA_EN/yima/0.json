I lost my red buff because the adc stole it, then im trying to get to lvl 2 but the enemy jungler invaded my blue buff and kills me. Then I was level 1 and the khazix was lvl 3 and stole my buffs, I go back to farm my jungle but he is waiting for me. I don't understand, I fell behind and couldn't even farm my own jungle. Then their midlane kassadin invades into my jungle and kills me too, I fell so far behind. \r\n\r\nAll of my deaths were due to my jungle getting invaded while im trying to farm, how is trying to farm in my own jungle while getting invaded count as intentional feeding. Just because i have a poor performance score of 0/12/1 doesn't mean i was dying on purpose. \r\n\r\nCan anyone help me? How do they not distinguish having a bad game vs intentional feeding. Also my own teammates told everyone to spam report me in the post game lobby. How is telling everyone to report me after a bad performance okay?","replies":[{"poster":"I Wanted Candy","date":"2020-02-24T19:24:40.098+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your first death, at 2:17 was under the enemy turret in botlane.","replies":[{"poster":"Yima","date":"2020-02-24T21:45:04.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"i was never in turret range, i was trying to get lvl 2 because i couldnt farm my jungle. u see the pyke intentionally grief me and steal my red?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2020-02-24T04:35:12.106+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us\n\nYou should submit a support ticket and ask them to manually review your punishment.  Keep in mind that the intentionally feeding ban is an umbrella for a host of other categories that do not necessary just about feeding/dying intentionally.  Griefing, trolling, intentionally afk, etc. are also captured under the intentionally feeding umbrella.  If say you afk jungle the entire game after that avoiding all team fights or doing anything to push for a win until that surrender vote at 22 minutes, it can be punished under the intentionally feeding umbrella of griefing/trolling/afk.  I'm not saying that you did this since I can't watch the replay. Just giving you an example.  No one on this board can help you and nothing I see jumped out at me as out of place.
