I do not want to change my default device in the control panel. Since I want to get sound from google chrome for Pandora to come through my stereo system and the sound from league to come through my headset. If i change my default device all my sound comes through the speakers or headset. Google chrome has no options to change the playback device but games usually do. I Can't find it however.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-24T01:32:12.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's definitely possible! You may need to find some audio manager software such as Realtek HD Audio Manager in order to set it up. If you use that program I know the option is called 'Make front and rear output devices play two different audio streams simultaneously', check that and then choose your audio outputs, then you should be good to go.","replies":[]}]}
