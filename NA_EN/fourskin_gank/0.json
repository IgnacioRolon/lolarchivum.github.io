That being said though however, I do agree with LegendaryLemur's analysis on the chat log in that there are a couple of points here and there where you are pretty negative in-game. While it's not the most toxic chat log I've seen, I'd still definitely punish it for sure though, but that's just me. Try to use this time to improve on your behavior and remember, if someone refuses to stop being a jerk/troll after you've asked them once or twice to stop then just mute and report them after the game instead of retaliating negatively against them. You can defend yourself as long as it's done in a respectful manner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"M1CH43L","date":"2015-11-14T01:43:56.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you talk and someone gets offended or pretends they're offended then yes, it's considered toxic according to Riot.  \n\nMoral of the story, don't talk in game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Samus72","date":"2015-11-14T02:05:44.485+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I read through that log twice.
