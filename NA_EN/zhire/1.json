According to the Q&A it says as long as you own Gangplank or get him before the end of the event, you will get the free skin. Along with also playing a full game that is not custom mode, of course. So here's the deal, I would gladly buy Gangplank but you guys have him not buyable anymore, so the question is will you guys at least make it where we can buy him?? I know he has to be locked and everything because he's right now getting his arm fixed but I really would like to have that skin considering all the grinding I am doing just for those icons.","replies":[{"poster":"ULTRAF0RCE","date":"2015-08-03T13:39:21.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he will be purchasable before the 10th","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Markus Kruber","date":"2015-08-03T04:24:56.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wan't to ask Riot to give me an extra refund so I can sell gangplank","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noctix","date":"2015-08-03T03:08:48.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I'd like to know is they announced it yet he's disabled....which they did a day or two after the event started.
