I try relentlessly to try and reconnect to the game but it doesn't and riot sees that as me abandoning the game. In one day, I got two different sets of penalties, all because of this spontaneous server connectivity issue. I've check and there is nothing wrong with my internet nor is there anything wrong when i'm using league's home-screen interface. \r\n\r\nI just think it's unfair that I keep getting these penalties even though I'm doing nothing wrong. Riot needs to review these issues or else they might lose players over it, me being one of them. It's really annoying and time consuming to say the least. \r\n\r\nAlso, there now seems to be a regular occurrence of in-game crashes along with the loading page issue.\r\n\r\nRiot, please review, some of your penalties are harsh and unfair!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-04T18:09:42.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless if a disconnection is intentional or not, it still negatively affects everyone in the match. This is a big reason why the system treats all disconnections equally and why penalties cannot me modified/removed.\n\nIf you're getting a connection error when you're unable to connect to the match, then it's likely there's a problem that prevents your connection from reaching the server. As a first step, I recommend ensuring your local network settings are compatible with League by following our [connection guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nLet me know if this issue persists.","replies":[]}]}
