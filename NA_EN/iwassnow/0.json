So I quit the game, and attempt to reconnect. No luck. Close League entirely, relog, attempt to reconnect. Same thing. Restart computer, relog, attempt->sucess! and then two minutes after that, it happens again. Second time I tried to reconnect I got the endgame screen after it failed and a leaver flag. Pretty sure the number of those i have in the years I have been playing is not a lot; maybe one hand worth. So I want to know wtf happened before I bother to try another game.\n\nFew notes to eliminate the tedious questions:\n1. My internet is fine. I had flawless access to the forums here as well as anything else during this time.\n2. Antivirus and firewall are whitelist/not installed\n3. No changes to my system or internet have been made with the exception of League of legends client updates. This includes my antivirus, it's on manual updates for this exact reason.\n4. _Mostly sure_ that there are no ISP conflicts between here and Riot. Never been one before. If it's relevant, Service Electric is the provider, most of the infrastructure is owned by RCN.\n5. It only happened one game, I'm going to try a custom in a moment to see if it happens again, will update.\n\nPS: I'm not terribly concerned about the mark on my record, given that I never dodge or afk. Every leave record I have is probably from internet issue a few years back. I'm more concerned about it happening again.(and again and again...)\n\nEDIT: Ran a custom game 1+4v5 bots. No crashes, however I did get the graphical errors that happen just before. Namely, what seems like a minor lag spike with no latency gain, and an increase(yes, not a typo) in framerate when this occurs. My framerate jumped from my norm of 130~ to almost 200. When I saw it, I realized that my framerate was 200 when my \"attempting to reconnect\" message appeared. Now I'm an experienced network and pc technician and a computer science student, but I have zero idea wtf is going on.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-20T22:17:42.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your description sounds a lot like *Packet Loss*.

I probably should have also mentioned last night that I had access to pvp.net while trying to reconnect to the game. Anyhow, the rest of it doesn't apply. As I said, I don't have a firewall as they eat more resources than they protect, my antivirus has league whitelisted, my public ip is static, my NAT ip forces refresh on a very short timer and doesn't save them router side(forcing a renew every boot). Lastly I disable DNS caching. It's not enough of a speed boost for me to care. All other router configurations have been in place for a while, and since I'm the admin of my network, I know nobody else has changed that.\n\nAs for packet loss, if it's local it's a statistical impossibility to lose no packets on any functioning connection except the ones for the game client only, and if it's on the route, it would be very strange to creep up several games into the night unless some hop had a temporary issue. Local packet loss I can discriminate against, as a specialty of mine, I went looking for it right away, no verifiable symptoms.\n\nAs for the co-op game I played last night, I experienced fewer instances of what I got in the custom game, and far less severe. I am willing to chalk it up to things beyond my control if the issue does not persist. Going to play a few arams tonight. If it doesn't happen again, I will probably just let it drop. If you have any other suggestions(or if I actually missed something cuz I derped), I'll still give it a go. Either way I'll check back in here again tonight before I sleep.\n\nEdit: Scratch that, Doom bots, not aram.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-23T21:53:03.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you see this issue again, I'd be interested in seeing a 5-minute traceroute using [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/) to the server 104.160.131.1\n\nSimply export the results as text after the test has run for 5 minutes and paste them in a reply to me.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"IWasSnow","date":"2016-10-20T07:35:46.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Am going to try a co-op vs ai game to see if other players in the game affect it.
