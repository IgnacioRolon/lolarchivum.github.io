Help please....","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friend can't log in to his account. It says that the username or password doesn't match. Although he was playing today in morning an all was good. As he was trying to change the password and an e-mail should come to his mail, he forgot his pasword to that mail. But the main question is how can someone change someones password without the permission? I think here is something strange. Let say if he would be banned he could still log in to his acc or if someone would try to change his password or anything he would recieve an e-mail with confirmation, right? And then confirming that e-mail the password would be changed, but no one can get to his e-mail as no one knows his password there. It's so messed up i think. Can anyone please explain me this or maybe Riot can get to his acc and check whats wrong? Please Help as he is so desperate to get his old acc back with all his stuff, skins and etc. Thanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-28T02:11:10.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your friend is having problems logging in because it says his password is wrong, there's a chance someone else may have been on his account and made changes without him knowing! \n\nMy best advice would be for him to reach out to us through our [Account Recovery Form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) so that we can get that account back to its original creator.","replies":[]}]}
