It also gave that demonic touch he deserves.\nAlso it gives cohesion for the respawn animation. \nIf we want to look at the skin for what jhin is in the blood moon \"universe\", i think you could call him the \"ink demon\", parallel toclassic jhin who is the \"golden demon\".\nI'm sure that blood moon jhin with that pbe recall it would just be perfect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GRRM98","date":"2017-02-10T21:42:32.543+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was hyped up to see that the skin had the dark red model once again in the Hunt of the Blood Moon video, but it seems like the skin in game doesn't have it, at least from my experience.
