Just recently I tried to login to my main League account and it didn't work. I can still login to my other account (this one) but I can't for my other one. I don't get any emails for password or username changes when I tried to recover my main account, iBunny17. I submitted a ticket regarding this. Thank you for any help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-16T02:57:21.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fret not! \n\nI've got your ticket pulled up and we should be responding relatively soon. Our agents focus on one ticket at a time to make sure we give the attention that each account deserves. Keep in mind that if you respond to your ticket before they get to it, your ticket might be pushed back in the line.","replies":[{"poster":"Mythical C00kie","date":"2017-05-16T10:07:24.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok.
