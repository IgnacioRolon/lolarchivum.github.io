I can tell you that it is. The only not toxic part of this chatlog was 'gg'.

Even if she was really useless, all the automatic system is going to see is an insult.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't have reported you for all that. But someone did report you, and you have enough negativity in all your complaining to be the straw that broke the camel's back. After a two week ban, any toxic chat can get you a permaban, and the system counts this as toxic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zardo","date":"2018-04-07T19:32:03.826+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your whole log was toxic.
