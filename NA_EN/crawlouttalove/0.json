I had to read responses off my roommates screen. It also caused me to run down lane endlessly trying to get me to where I was nonstop. I'd really like a loss prevention on that seeing as that obviously was something out of my control. I guess, I won't play til they fix these issues. It's terrible because we had a chance to comeback, and lost because I couldn't play and kept running to the team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kelfear","date":"2017-06-17T16:42:15.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been haveing this problem for over 3 mouth now.

Let be clear, I am not going to come in here and say that it is your computers fault or your connections fault.  I've looked at North America as a whole, we do not see any widespread issues.  It still could very well be on our end, but we need to start looking at the most common root causes and eliminate them so we can find the true culprit.\n\nThe best way to start eliminating the most common root causes is to complete all of the steps in our Connection Issues Article.  If none of these steps seem to resolve the issue, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) we can start looking more in-depth at some other more rare root causes.
