Now, as an ADC, her build path is strange, because her base stats are so low since her scaling used to give her free damage. This makes building items on her a pain. Building AD, you have very little innate attack speed. Building AS? No AD. Building Crit? Not worth it since your base AD is so low. Her mark minigame is no longer fun, since range has very little meaningful or impactful meaning to the player. You can shoot a little farther, but can&#039;t take more marks or effectively do more damage. What little bit of range really matters, from a player perspective? There is nothing interesting or &quot;juicy&quot; for players to latch onto in her kit anymore. Her core gameplay hook - hunting down marks and slowly becoming an unstoppable matriarch of death - is completely thrown out because she can no longer effectively get marks in the first place thanks to her low base stats and nothing to compensate for them.\r\n\r\nKindred&#039;s rework was a failure. She is mechanically weaker, more difficult to itemize properly (do I build AS? AD? Crit?), has a much less interesting gameplay narrative (getting marks that deal damage Vs. getting marks that let you... shoot slightly further and empower your skills by a /slight/ amount.), and her kit no longer feels like a cohesive whole, but rather disjointed skills. She worked as a diver, players became attached to her as a diver. Having a squishy ADC, who needs to get farm, in the jungle, is two different gameplay narratives that - much like Kindred herself - is tearing her into two.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2017-06-07T15:06:01.224+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been only one patch, it's expected for reworks to have wonky balance on release and need some numbers adjustments to get into the right place.\n\n> range has very little meaningful or impactful meaning to the player.\n\nYou have no idea what you're talking about.

Her use pattern (long range ADC that is farm reliant, and late game carry), is conflicted by her role as a jungler, who is supposed to gank early and support lanes. Her build pattern and optimization pattern is unclear, due to her low base stats and conflicted role, having to clear the jungle, and gather marks/kills, and later on siege and take objectives. Junglers, especially weaker junglers in the context of 7.X patches, are known to be gold starved, and Kindred, being susceptible to counterjungling in a patch that has strong counter-junglers being in the top (Nunu, WW), puts her in an especially bad position.\n\nI understand that Kindred's place in the game has been questionable since launch - and although she never really saw meta play after her initial round of nerfs, she was still a fun, cohesive champion. Now she's completely lost the identity as a flashy, kill hungry assassin-diver.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fuffychan","date":"2017-06-07T09:57:56.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Riot doesnt care.
