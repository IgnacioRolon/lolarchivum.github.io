The game freezes, the screen turns blue, then the computer restarts itself. After logging back in to my computer, the desktop takes 4 minutes to refresh and show its icons, as does the taskbar. The whole process takes 7 minutes. I've learned it's a problem with LoLReplay conflicting with Patch 6.10+, so I've uninstalled it - This issue is not my fault at all, I didn't \"actively go afk\" or \"disconnect\" or \"leave,\" yet I got a 5 game LeaverBuster 20 min wait in the hell that is Low Priority Queue, being punished for something I can't control at all.

What a ridiculous way to come across this issue. You can't know something is consistent until it happens multiple times. Like I said, it seems to have been fixed after I uninstalled LoLReplay, but don't even try to blame me for those losses that happened during my DC time. I had idiots in on my team anyway, one of them being a 3/20 Yi.

That isn't their friend, they probably haven't played many games with them, they might not know that the player is toxic (and will probably remove them after this game in any case.)\n\nAt the least, make it so that premades only share the penalty if they've played more than a certain number of games queued with that person.\n\n\nI agree with everything else, though.  This kind of feature is long overdue in League.\n\n---\n\nI'm also in favour of an automated chat filter that replaces the words \"I'm afk\" with phrases like:\n\n> I no longer have the resolve to do my duty and complete this struggle.

I think I may be done.  I'm not sure what happened this season that makes this game so ugly but when I play ranked, I can start to get on a trend of wins.  Let's say I win 3 in a row.  Chances are, the next 3 games will have a troll, leaver, smurf, or something else to ruin it.  Games are ending up 4v5 very often.  Also, the queue times have gone up.  I'm playing in Gold 2 right now and I always praised high gold to be rid of most of the trolls.  I've been playing plat for the last 4 seasons, and I just don't know what is going on this season.  I liked the implementation of 'pick your roles' but people still get upset when they don't get their first choice.  Normal games have a lot less trolling and afk/leaving.  Not sure what it is.","replies":[{"poster":"Dankstin","date":"2016-06-05T16:03:41.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg yes the amount of games people dodge because the champion they planned on playing with is too damn high.
