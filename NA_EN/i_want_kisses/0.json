I was going to ASSUREDLY buy it at first, regardless of the overly-flamboyant and unattractive colors (and one color that makes it look like you only have his Classic skin) but if the Chroma comes back and you guys have acted on absolutely NONE of our feedback on the colors...then I really don't know if I'm going to buy this chroma, despite it being for my main for over two years. Maybe if it didn't take this long for the chroma to get \"fixed\", but there's really no excuse.","replies":[{"poster":"I Want Kisses","date":"2015-08-08T05:10:00.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really enjoyed the colors previously displayed for Chroma Zed. The red chroma was maybe a bit repetitive, but yellow Zed? Purple Zed? This ninja NEEDS some flamboyant colors in his life. He has this ostentatious laugh, a super pompous demeanor, and he always sounds like he never got over Shen's dad. Zed needs some of that silly flavor. Also, his contempt for the weak has been begging to be expressed through his garb; Zed is strong, and he could use some strong colors. I understand the want for weaker, darker colors such as dark blue or black; that would be totally cool, and then all of Zed's colors would be dull and almost monotone-- but it would still look cool, mind you. Classic red Zed vs blue chroma Zed would be adorable. But I am eager to see Zed adorn himself with strong colors!\n\nRegardless of any completed or impending changes to the Zed Chroma Pack, I definitely _will_ purchase this bundle when it releases. I hope it comes soon!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ZED G0D","date":"2015-08-06T04:33:01.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@RiotKateyKhaos \n\nDo you know if they will have any actual ninja colors for zed? gray/black chroma?","replies":[]},{"poster":"UncIe Zed","date":"2015-08-03T08:52:05.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"still unavailable on the pbe, cant say :/ , just hope it's coming soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2015-08-03T07:52:16.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's coming soon.\nBecause, of course it is.
