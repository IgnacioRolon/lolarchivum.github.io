Somehow though, my ult continuously would not bounce. I used it 3 times in a row (with the target being Corki) and all of those times my ult would not bounce to any targets. All 3 times Corki was in a group of minions so there were definitely targets for the Brand ult to choose. Later on, I would use my ult on other targets and it would work perfectly fine and I wouldn&#039;t use it on Corki again as I didn&#039;t want the bug to mess me up again. While this bug isn&#039;t big, it&#039;s still game breaking in a matchup like this and should certainly be looked into.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Illiad","date":"2016-02-09T23:44:08.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friend watched a Kassadin constantly make the ult going into oblivion, so maybe you are onto something bigger with brand","replies":[{"poster":"helper08","date":"2016-02-10T00:17:39.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Brand's R - Pyroclasm no longer forgets to bounce to minions if cast on an Ablaze enemy champion with no other nearby enemy champions\"\n-6.3 bugfixes\n\n:D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-10T00:39:26.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report!
