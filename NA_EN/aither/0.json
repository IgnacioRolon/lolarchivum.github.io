But I feel like champs with longer cooldowns could have their circle be almost full and have their teammates mistake it for being full via a quick glance.

If you know his ult is up, you're more likely to pull a better play (and often a more aggressive and exciting play) than if you don't know anything about its status and have to assume it's down.  Similar to jungle timers, this won't make players any dumber (just give them more information), so don't immediately assume that this will backfire horribly.","replies":[{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2014-08-08T21:09:41.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You do have an indicator for allied ults. \n\nI just do not agree on showing exact cooldown of one player to another.

This is something that could easily be included to the ingame hud without info overload, as it simply takes the place of the green dot.  It's simple, easy, and would add a great amount more clarity than the binary green dot we currently have.  If Amumu's ult is about to be off cooldown or has 15 seconds left, I want to know if I can capitalize on a situation so that I can know he can ult when he joins the fight, rather than having to back off because I didn't know it was almost up.\n\nAnd spell timers would be a nice addition if we could fit them into the hud.  I still don't understand why you're being so resistant to this when it's a simple change to make a little more information available to teammates.  All I'm getting from you is a feeling of \"I don't like my allies seeing what I can do\" and \"I don't like changes\" rather than \"This is how this would negatively impact players.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2014-08-16T08:55:51.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I must admit defeat.

Perhaps as they did with jungle timers, exact cooldown numbers can be provided on the stats menu.  Whilst items will tell you of their full CD while hovering over them, it's a lot more difficult to keep track of 120 ults and their CDs at each rank.
