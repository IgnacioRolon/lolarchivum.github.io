The ratio could be MUCH different.  \n\nThat's certainly true, but it's highly unlikely. Not because of anything they're doing, but because of math.\n\n> Plus I feel like the focus on just the 0 bad outlier really skews the data as with out other conversations there are people who get punished for partially false cases.\n\nIf you want to discuss that, let's discuss it in the thread it started in.\n\nFor the purposes of *this* discussion, let's accept that (at least according to Riot), there's no such thing as a \"partially false\" case - because the *overall* behavior is reviewed - not just the only-negative games.\n\nEDIT: I decided that I wanted to look at the difference between the two samples you put forth in your first paragraph. Specifically:\n\n> I mean say they reviewed 12,000 (random number to work with the 1:6000 ratio) and found 2 false positives, but if they reviewed the next 6000 and found 5+ more false positives.\n\nI'm doing this math on an actual spreadsheet, rather than my own head. As I'll show, I screwed up my earlier math, so I'll go back and edit that post to correct the screw-up.\n\nIn the first case, we see 2 errors out of 12,000 cases - an error rate of 0.01667%. Which means an accuracy of 99.98333%\n\nIn the second chunk, we see 5 errors out of 6,000 cases - an error rate of 0.08333%. This gives an accuracy of 99.91667%\n\nCombining the two, we see 7 errors out of 18,000 cases - an error rate of 0.03889%. This gives an accuracy of 99.96111%.\n\nI'm not drawing any conclusions from this, because it came from a hypothetical. I was just curious about what kind of impact that might actually have, statistically.","replies":[{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-11-05T08:59:16.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I trust Riot to do their work correctly and do solely blame the 'possible variance' in any margin of error.\n\nGiven that the false positive rate was based on an absolutely clean case, i can accept the 1:6000 ratio.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2015-11-05T08:24:14.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it doesn't.

During these tests, the system was recording live data and making decisions about games without actually handing out penalties. We'd then hand review the data, with multiple team members reviewing each case.\n> From this, we saw approximately a 1 in 6000 case globally where we saw a game or chat log that had 0 wrong-doing and did not deserve a penalty.\n\nAlso, you may have missed it, but I *did* mention that it could simply be a matter of them reviewing the minimum necessary to see that result. However, given the length of time he refers to here, and running a (probably inaccurate) estimate on the number of cases generated per day (~1% of players are issued punishments, ~27 million daily players = ~270,000 cases daily), it's reasonable to assume that they reviewed significantly more than the minimum number of cases.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-11-05T08:33:09.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No he is right, I didn't provide my source to their sample size because riot doesn't give out that kind of information.\n\nYou can get logs, you just have to be persistent.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2015-11-05T08:22:38.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or if they are told they are wrong.
