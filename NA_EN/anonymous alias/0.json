I then reopened the client and it fixed itself. I pressed the play button and I was told that the game I was supposed to be in no longer existed and I was 'free' to play another game. However, I received a lower priority queue. Sure, I dc'd in games in the past but I already received my punishment for those games. I want my lower priority queue removed without having to play any games.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-02T01:32:08.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really sucks that your game crashed from a bugsplat, but those four other teammates were left to try and 4v5 the rest of that game. We can't do much about LPQ's in these situations since it wasn't that one leave that left you with the LPQ, it was a culmination of the past AFK's.","replies":[{"poster":"Anonymous Alias","date":"2017-06-02T06:14:36.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not that they were forced to 4v5. The game REMAKED so it didn't really count.","replies":[]}]}]}
