And as a 1,2 million mastery points Yasuo I can tell you why we are like this. Due to all the hate towards Yasuo players, we constantly get shit from everyone that doesn't play him. So whenever we do good or pull off a play, we bm or show off our \"mastery 7 / thumbsup\" thing. You see, we feel that we actually did something good, and that we get some kind of revenge for all the hate towards him. If someone on the enemy team calls me out for being bad for just playing a certain champion, I will even bm harder if I'm close to that person ingame. \n\nI'm not toxic at all though when it comes to flaming in chat etc, I just love to bm or show off mastery level 7.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ghazter","date":"2018-05-18T23:43:25.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anybody who doesn't do that is usually new to Yasuo, I don't know why but apparently it comes with the champ.

Like OP for example.\n\nOh, and spamming thumbs-up is just psychological warfare. I want to win, and if you are too mentally weak to withstand a simple emote, you deserve to lose even more.","replies":[{"poster":"Ghazter","date":"2018-05-19T00:59:09.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know why you're yelling at me, I've just observed this over my time in League. I've seen the nicest people turn toxic after maining Yasuo; it's honestly scary.\n\nI don't know about the emote, that's just a meme at this point xD I do it with a lot of champs, especially when I've just killed them at low hp or when I've killed them and lost little to no hp. I don't think that's Yasuo specific.\n\nI think your theory does have merit. Everybody thinks that Yasuo is just a no-skill champ now because of how easily he can stomp bad players (I still think 100% bonus crit is over the top though), and so people criticize you over picking a champ like that.\n\nI think any champ that stomps does that; Riven, Talon, Master Yi, Zed, but they all have different ambient attitudes. Maybe I'll look into that actually... Map the psychological tendencies of different people maining different champs :P","replies":[{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2018-05-19T01:00:42.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ghazter,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TlgwJRIA,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2018-05-19T00:59:09.099+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re yelling at me\n\nDid you see an exclamation point in my post?","replies":[{"poster":"Ghazter","date":"2018-05-19T01:03:05.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, I got confused.
