Obviously I was irked and left anxious but I just left it at that.\r\n\r\nI'd usually ignore people like this, but I sometimes take things like that as poorly worded criticism that could help me. I watched the replay to confirm if I was right, and I did in fact have all my abilities on cd when my Rek died (what I did was miss all my abilities). Besides landing my abilities, was there anything else I could have really done?\r\n\r\nI'm honestly thinking if I should try to message him to clear things up, I don't like having people upset with me and I want to either admit to my mistakes or try to explain further what happened. That, or ask him what I could have done from his point of view.","replies":[{"poster":"Kanzler","date":"2019-09-22T01:59:03.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont miss your abilities.

You know that you played to the best of your ability and weren't just trying to KS, but you will never convince that jerk of this. Just forget about them and move on with your life.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Magnesium14","date":"2019-09-22T01:36:11.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean as a Neeko if you miss your abilities you have to get punished, I mean you messed up and you got punished for it by only being able to AA. If you think this is really a big problem for you play a heavily AA based champion like an ADC like Sivir or Jhin, or something Like Master Yi. Although even they require good use of abilities they are less reliant on abilities then say a Neeko or Sylas.","replies":[]},{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2019-09-21T07:46:14.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know what Neeko would build exactly, but what you describe, is about when (as a relatively new player) I began to get comfortable with using item actives. And reckoning CD as a consideration for which abilities to level up. And buying items with CC.\n\nAnd I'm typing this, and I'm thinking \"I don't play Neeko at all. Does she really have such options? How good are they?\" So, I looked up Neeko Support guides and sure enough there seem to be some highly rated (rather fun looking) Glacial Augment builds. Neeko uses at least 2 of the Glacial Items well, and one of them has a short CD. (There's NO CD on Glacial active itself, so you can stack all the item, if they work for you.) This would have given you, effectively one, possibly two additional abilities that can turn fights around. (Or set them up.) (Plus, the item is a point-and-click - you CAN'T miss. And once you procced Glacial, you won't miss your other abilities either. )\n\nThe build itself, is not very different from what you already do.\n\n(Shyvana can use at least 5 of these items, and stacking them all has been some of the most fun that I've had in this game in a while.)\n\nAlso, most ADC seem to get a big smile when they see that you brought GA.\n\n(Co-incidentally, my last match ALSO had a fed Urgot. Our toplaner dc early, so Urgot had a free lane. But even with his slow-resist, repeated Glacial procs brought him down, and we won the 4v5.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"AR URF","date":"2019-09-21T05:00:03.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find these types of people to not have any map awareness. \"hey mid why didn't you help me with the gank?\" Umm because my abilities were on CD? \nBut yeah That's just what I find to be true.
