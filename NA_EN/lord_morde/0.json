Generals are meant to be followed- not questioned. In a team fight if your Morde pings the ADC- go after the ADC please. Stop focusing the Volibear. Please.\n\nSIDE NOTE: Stop banning Morde.

CONNECT WITH ME**\n\nEven Yilang Peng (**Doublelift**) has jumped on board the Morde wagon with this tweet: _https://gyazo.com/8b47985397e8153cbb1d373de7959e72_\n\nRiot said it themselves in patch 5.16: \n\n**Morde&#039;s always been a jack of all trades, but a master of none.** (_shameless sidenote: If Morde is the &#039;Master of Metal&#039;- how come he doesn&#039;t have a FULL METAL skin? Do you want me to make a Gundam Kai Zah Wallpaper and show you how it&#039;s done? Cuz I totally will._)\n\nIn fact even Riot has had a difficult time finding a place for him:\n\n**I Morde&#039;s Recent History:**\n\nIn patch **5.4** Riot had this to say about the small number of people building Mordekaiser AD: _https://gyazo.com/7fd7c72ed6910463b04c74a243c1a417\n\n  - Basically eliminating AD builds entirely here- even though his Q still scaled well off items like: {{item:3078}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3071}} \n\nIn patch **5.16** Riot decided to take Morde&#039;s wave clear, his single spell burst and his AP ratios and trade them off for the ability to build drastically different and become slightly more &#039;viable&#039; bot lane: _https://gyazo.com/9bfa267049c763b13ea8eda3b54871ba_\n\n  - I&#039;ve said this once, and I will say it again and again till the dead horse is buried- Morde bottom was already strong before the rework. In light of the recent numbers change to Morde&#039;s W aura- I&#039;m willing to say that other than the Dragon pet- Old Morde was stronger bottom than our present Hue master.\nBelow is a screenshot of some generic high gold to mid platinum games as Morde and Leona bottom after patch **5.4** when Riot gave Morde a movement speed bonus and the ability to cast double W on both himself and his support. _pic related: http://gyazo.com/e56d3237727974ca02a3364a6fdd4b59__\n\n- Patch 5.16 more or less eliminated solo Morde players. I have spoken to 8 different Morde mains whose elo&#039;s range from **Gold** to mid **Diamond**. We are all of the opinion that without the armor and magic resist bonuses, as well as the ability to self cast- killed solo Morde.\n\n\nIn patch 5.18 Riot tweaked Morde&#039;s W numbers. I&#039;m going to break them down for you.\n\n- Before 5.18, Morde bottom had the following stats for his W spell: _pic related: https://gyazo.com/6e55b07e40e2a73a5190b84453abf139_\n\n_COST No cost\nCOOLDOWN 12/11/10/9/8 seconds\nDAMAGE 140/180/220/260/300 over 4 seconds.\nAFFLICTION FOREVER At the end of Harvester&rsquo;s duration (or when Mordekaiser reactivates it), he deals 50/70/90/110/130 damage to all nearby enemies, healing both Mord and his ally for the damage dealt.\nMETALLIC MASTERY Both Harvesters of Sorrow&rsquo;s DoT and its detonation can overlap, dealing damage twice to enemies hit by Mordekaiser and his ally\n_\n\n- After patch 5.18 Morde now has these numbers: _pic related: https://gyazo.com/aa1c0012c0ac2941039a70f446cb3832_\n\n_\nCOST No Cost &rArr; 25/35/45/55/65 health\nCOOLDOWN 12/11/10/9/8 seconds\nDAMAGE 140/180/220/260/300 over 4 seconds. \nREMOVED METALLIC MASTERY: Damage no longer doubles when the zones overlap\nZONE RATIO 0.6 ability power &rArr; 0.9 ability power\nDEACTIVATION DAMAGE 50/70/90/110/130 &rArr; 70/95/120/145/170\nHEALING AGAINST MINIONS 33% &rArr; 25%\nMAXIMUM UNITS DRAINED 3 targets &rArr; 2 targets\nCan be self-cast even when alone\n_\n\nSo what do these numbers MEAN?\n\nLet&#039;s say you play with **26 AP lvl 1** before you buy:\n\n**Morde 5.16:\n**\n\n- You W lvl 1 will deal 140 BASE DMG over 4 seconds + 15.6 (0.6% of AP) = 155.6 over 4 seconds for **38.9 DMG a second**\n\nNow 5.16 Morde does not reveal the ratio on his W second activation, (_the detonation heal_) so I will use patch **5.18**&#039;s [_0.307%_] ratio which I calculated myself.\n\n- Deactivation DMG: 50 BASE DMG + 8 DMG [0.3% of AP] = 58 DMG per target; Maximum **3** targets; so possible outcomes:\n\n3 minions = .33 x 58 = 19.14 per minion x 3 = **57.32 HEAL**\n2 minions + 1 Champion = 19.14 x 2 + 58 =    **96.28 HEAL**\n1 minion + 2 Champions = 19.14 + 116 = **135.14 HEAL**   [If you have both enemy support and ADC in aura]\n3 Champions= 58 x 3 = **174 HEAL** [If you&#039;re being ganked/roamed on or in a team fight] \n\n\n**METALLIC MASTERY: **\n\nBare in mind that before 5.18 Morde&#039;s DoT and his deactivation could both stack if your support overlapped Morde&#039;s W with you. So the same targets could take:\n\n\n- DoT = **311.2 DMG** over 4 seconds or** 77.8 DMG a second**\n\n- Deactivation: (_I am not convinced the HEAL stacked, but rather both Morde and his Ally split the heal evenly- but just in case I will include those numbers:_)\n\n3 minions = 38.28 per minion x 3 = **114.84 HEAL**\n2 minions + 1 Champion = 38.28 x 2 + 116 =    **192.56 HEAL**\n1 minion + 2 Champions = 38.28 + 232 = **270.28 HEAL**   [_If you have both enemy support and ADC in aura_]\n3 Champions = 116 x 3 = **348 HEAL** [_If you&#039;re being ganked/roamed on or in a team fight_] \n\nMorde 5.18\n\nNow let&#039;s compare those numbers with the new Morde W stats.\n\nRiot kept the same BASE DMG for Morde 4 second DoT, but buffed the AP Ratio from .6 to .923%; _pic related:  https://gyazo.com/59706ec8e19f9b398616c45ccdbb9db4_\n\n_Please also remember that Riot reintroduced an HP cost to cast W- beginning at 25 hp rank 1._\n\n\n- You W lvl 1 will deal 140 BASE DMG over 4 seconds + 24 (0.9% of AP) = 164 over 4 seconds for **41 DMG a second** (_This is 1.1 more DMG a second for a total of 4.4 more DMG for W lvl 1_)\n\n- Deactivation DMG: 70 BASE DMG + 8 DMG [0.3% of AP] = 78 DMG per target; Maximum **2** targets; so possible outcomes:\n\n2 minions = .25 x 78 = 19.5 per minion x 2 = 39 HEAL - 25 HP COST = **14 HEAL**\n1 minion + 1 Champion = 19.5 + 78 = 97.5 HEAL -25 HP COST = **72.5 HEAL**\n2 Champions = 78 x 2 = 156 HEAL - 25 HP COST = **121 HEAL**\n\nRiot nerfed Morde&#039;s W in 4 ways:\n\n- They removed METALLIC MASTERY which allowed Morde and his Ally to stack the DMG (_Which also rewarded the support to stick near his Morde_)\n\n- They limited Morde&#039;s maximum HEAL to 2 targets instead of 1- so in a team fight Morde can only heal **121** at rank 1 and **356** at maxed rank.\n\n- They cut Morde&#039;s already terrible ability to wave clear in half with the removal of METALLIC MASTERY\n\n- Bot Morde is incapable of catching intelligent players right off the bat in a fight. That&#039;s kind of why Riot gave him the EXP boost bottom so he could outscale in even the worst of match ups if he played wisely. In lane Morde is most likely going to have to rely on the relic charges and a smart support with potentially a healing mechanic like shen or taric or Ali- because he will NO LONGER heal in lane with what was suppsoed to be his built in sustain, W.\nMorde takes a LOT of harass bottom lane in lvls 1-4. He relied heavily on the healing powers of W until he could get close enough for a fight. In a difficult lane like Caitlyn for example- Morde will NOT be close enough to heal off enemy Champs (100% heal) and will be forced to make due with the 25% heal of not 3 but 2 maximum targets. This results in 14 hp every 12 seconds. Morde takes a great deal more DMG than this in his first few minutes of lane phase attempting to level. This change to W has further alienated him.\n\n- Bonus 5th reason- everytime they make a new change to Morde I find myself relying more and more on my teammates to do what needs to be done- which often leaves me feeling like this :^(\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZKXSl53Kg4\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**II MORDE IN LANE then and now**\n\nNow I&#039;m going to assume that the new W for Morde prioritizes Champions to minions when Mord&#039;es in the middle of a wave but also deactivating his W around enemy champs. But in the last 4 games I have played as Morde (2 as solo top and 2 bottom) I have noticed a significant nerf to my ability to stay in lane.\n\nNormally in Bot lane you depend on your ally support for sustain as ADC. With Morde bottom you depended on melee supports for several reasons:\n\n- Melee supports generally have the best engages in terms of sticking power and CC/PEEL\n\n- Morde&#039;s **5.16** W stacked for double sustain and DMG and thus having a support who sat inside the wave with you when W was active meant you had waveclear. Ranged supports tend to squat in the bushes or zone/harass the enemy duo leaving you to cs- however with Morde this cut your power in half, especially in a skirmish.\n\n- Morde&#039;s playstyle encourages beefy playstyle. Generally Ranged Supports are squishy and have kite and heals built into their kits. The Melee support have the tanky engage that Morde needs for his extended fights.\n\nWith the change to Morde&#039;s W, bot lane Morde will need more sustain supports, like {{champion:44}} , {{champion:98}}  and {{champion:12}} \n\nWith solo Morde the main issue was that Morde&#039;s flexibility was gone. If Morde was in a melee lane- it was easy to max Mord&#039;s old Q because it hit like a truck in single target situations. Morde&#039;s W was also really useful for super aggro tops like {{champion:92}} , {{champion:64}} and {{champion:80}}. This was because Morde&#039;s old W granted him not only AOE DMG over SIX seconds instead of four, but also granted him ARMOR and MAGIC RESIST which his shield scaled well with.\n\nNew Q is only effective in solo lane if he&#039;s opponent is a little negligent and the Morde uses the first and or second procs on minions before surprising the foe with the third while they are still in range.\n\n5.16 W was literally something you wouldn&#039;t take until lvl 7 unless you knew to expect your jungler top often. (_since you could no longer self cast_)\n\nHowever 5.18 W is now castable- but it only grants you a negligent heal.\n\nRank 1 in lane Morde&#039;s W will heal him for anywhere between 14 and 72.5 HP after you apply his HP cost and assume you can hit more than 1 target, a champ included. It does not deal DMG in an AOE- so this means that solo Morde still does not have the wave clear he needs to be viable solo lane. Any player with a good head will reset the lane by shoving it until they get it to push against their towers, and then they will simply freeze lane and wait for their Jungler to come gank Morde.\n\nLiterally what happened in my last game: \nhttps://gyazo.com/56a32f9519a5dea9510ecab3323fe760\n\n{{champion:17}} : But Morde, why didn&#039;t you rush {{item:3078}} ?\n\nWell for one I&#039;m being camped, but for two and most importantly- It&#039;s really important to remember what we know about Morde right now:\n\n- Morde has no CC or escapes or real sustain in a solo lane at this time. So if he does not build tanky he will die quickly if CC&#039;d.\n\n- Morde has some MASSIVE DMG in his kit right now. Even in the solo lane where his W does almost nothing. If Morde can survive long enough to deal that DMG then he can win the fights.\n\n- Morde lacks waveclear and that&#039;s a really big problem as last hitting for a champ that is paying HP for his spells and usually taking harass the entire time he&#039;s in lane (esp solo) is very difficult. Old Morde players expressed difficulty farming in lanes where they maxed Q or E in duo lanes- but found they were able to secure most of the cs in lanes where they maxed W. However in solo lanes maxing W does little to no DMG and provides less waveclear that the now diseased E we all used to love.\n\n- It&#039;s worth noting that even without your W, Morde can still make meaningful plays if he understand what his opponents can do and posotions himself and spreads out his spells properly to get the most value out of each (_like you do with sheen procs_)\n\nWatch how this Morde player handles a Thresh and a Lulu, (both with full HP versus him with 30%) with only his Q and E and studder step mechanics:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rBzUPomY8c\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**III. POSSIBLE WORK AROUNDS:**\n\nI have 2 ideas that I have not yet been able to test out fully and unless my upcoming premade 5&#039;s games yield amazing viral results- I doubt they&#039;ll ever become viable in solo que; but nonetheless I have this to offer:\n\n**DUO JUNGLE MORDE with a NUNU**- Morde&#039;s W grants ms speed to any aura&#039;d unit running toward the other. Nunu E slows. Morde&#039;s Q hits like a truck the third time and Nunu&#039;s bloodboil synergizes hugely. With a tanky engage top and bot and an ap burst/engage mid, Nunu and Morde can just bully the enemy jungler all day and make really good ganks bottom when the enemy overextends.\n\n**BOT MORDE WITH TWO SUPPORTS:** I am thinking Leona and Blitz would be the best fit here. Leona would take {{summoner:11}} since she has a gap close- but if you&#039;re worried about the Jungler outlvling the support it&#039;s reasonable for Morde who can keep up with and surpass the enemy Jungler because of his solo lane exp passive to take {{summoner:11}}  instead.  The only real issue that arises here is that the double relic you normally take is not as good because your second relic would be sending the slain minions to you or the other support at a 50% chance. It&#039;s not a major issue but it does take away from your lvl increase. The benefits of this strategy are that the enemy bot lane can be hard zoned and heavily pressured at multiple angles and it renders bot lane virtually ungankable for the enemy jungler. The major drawback is that your top and mid cannot tilt or lose their lanes badly before Morde snowballs bottom. This lane has amazing roam potential as well. It&#039;s something you pick when you want to guarantee Morde gets farmed and when the enemy bot lane tries to counter pick. ({{champion:432}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:429}}  {{champion:40}}  are all difficult lanes to verse)\n\n**APPEAL TO RIOT: **\n\nHonestly guys, I miss my old Morde. I love Dragon, I love the longer ghost timers,  love that you&#039;re trying to encourage new ideas and there&#039;s NOTHING wrong with that. But so far this latest direction with Morde has shown me we&#039;re going the wrong way with Morde. With the removal of METALLIC MASTERY- you&#039;ve taken away the reward factor Melee Supports and Morde players felt when they played their lane correctly. Which yes, even now is very difficult to do. I have to explain to 8 out of every 10 solo que supports to stop sitting in the bush and to stack with me (no longer an issue now- but the DMG cut has gimped Morde in all lanes now.)\n\nI miss the ability to make amazing plays MYSELF. I miss being rewarded for my own superior mechanics. Not that I&#039;ma GOD or anything- but I DID have my moments with old school Morde: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMfPX0lNLC8\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n{{champion:17}} : _&quot;What item paths have you found most useful with reworked Morde?&quot;_\n\n**BOT MORDE:**\n\n{{item:3302}} &lt; {{item:1028}} {{item:1036}} &lt; {{item:1011}} {{item:3053}} &lt; {{item:3044}}  OR {{item:1011}} &lt; {{item:3057}} OR {{item:1058}} &lt;{{item:3116}} OR {{item:3078}} and ofc you&#039;ll get boots 1 and 2 in there somewhere. Sometimes if you need to be extra tanky and need more DMG, {{item:3748}} can be really good.\n\nVideo showing the benefits of a sterak&#039;s rush:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OyuqRUaEac\n\n\n\n**SOLO MORDE:**\n\nI won&#039;t pretend to have an extensive amount of experience with solo Morde because everytime I attempt this- I either get camped hard, lose the lane because the match up is poor or stomp really hard because it&#039;s easy. I need more games in this lane to know for sure- but I speculate that a {{item:1036}} or {{item:1074}} or {{item:1001}} start is decent. One might even try old school {{item:1006}} {{item:1006}} and rush a {{item:3077}} into {{item:3074}}  or {{item:3748}}.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n**V.

Riot basically shot themselves in the foot by effectively eliminating what made him good in the first place.\nHis shield gain is weaker, his sustain doesn't help him at all in some scenarios and he can't do his job properly anymore.\n\nHe relies on having disgustingly high base numbers and on the unfair and tbh really unhealthy W mechanic to do well in Bot lane. Now I feel like I'm handicapping my team whenever I go bot with him since he requires SOOOOO much effort to pull of, making me question ever playing Morde again, which I thought wouldn't happen before armageddon.\n\nAnd yet here we are, Riot having effectively proven that they can't balance Mordekaiser with his current kit and condemning him to a state of limbo. Hovering around OP and UP and not having any chance at becoming a healthy champion.\n\nHeck, the common consensus is that old Morde had his flaws but he had more counterplay and was less Unhealthy, which completely invalidates their reasoning behind making him a duo laner when in fact he manages to make the game a living hell for TWO people instead of one in solo lanes.\nAnd what adds insult to injury is him having been able to duo before, with better results to boot, in a world where he was able to do things on his OWN.\n\nThe More I think about it the more I start to think that the rework was a poor excuse to band-aid fix him and what seemed to be one massive failure.\nMorde needs A LOT of tweaks, heck maybe even a second REWORK/RELAUNCH in order to truly live up to the Mantle of Master of Metal and become a healthy, balanced, interesting champion with unique themes and identity.\nleague's very own version of Sauron!\n\n\nThank you for laying this out for all of us to see, we Mordekaiser Mains should not let our voices be unheard and our call to arms be unanswered.\nHE WILL NOT BE LEFT IN THE DUST.

Here it is: \n\n\"idea for polishing his current kit:\n\nQ: FEAR THE MACE: slightly reduce 3rd hit damage, but allow half of the total 3rd q damage done to 2 closest surrounding units. When enemies are near, it prioritizes enemy champions before minons. Possibly up health cost a bit.\n\nW: MISERY LOVES COMPANY: Allow self cast do deal AoE damage when activated (buff w self cast), keep the extra armor, speed and current heal. When cast on an ally, w does half the damage compared to self cast, but when overlapping with an ally, does double and a half damage of the reduced damage done from the ally cast.\n\nE: AFFLICTION, FOREVER: More damage, LESS shield, hits all units in the E, not 2. Keep current range.\n\nR: HUEHUEHUE: Slightly buff the over time damage so it's not completly negated by a potion.\n\nPassive: No shield degeneration.\n\nOpinions?\"\n\n\nPersonally, I think even if just the w was like what he said, it would be amazing for any lane, as well as jungle. Although a buffed E damage would also be nice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2015-09-18T21:22:34.663+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"3rd link of gyazo has an extra underscore at the end, you may want to trim that off.\n\nAlso, I played morde a bunch pre-rework, found it fun considering I was taking half the map and killed any person who went for me (I got lucky in a 1v4 and got the TF[who was going AD top, for some reason] as the clone, killed all 4)\n\nPost rework...

I always found using Morde fun, his mechanics were just so simple, and yet so unique and complex. I would just think what to play, and then, suddenly, I would think: \"I wanna burst with Mordekaiser today. I wanna push the lane, destroy minion waves with E-Q and make enemy carry my carry. I want to wait in bush for unsuspecting enemies, burst them down with R-E-Q, and then read their moanings about how Morde is broken.\" Unfortunately, I will never again experience that ;( While at first, I was quite optimistic about the rework, after few matches, I saw what was wrong: literally everything. But now... Rito won't revert the rework, they're too proud to do such a thing, by doing so, they would admit that they failed. Waiting for another rework? Maybe we will get it, I don't know... in season 7, pre-season 8? But for now, I think I won't play Morde anymore, I won't use my Pentakill skin anymore. He went from funny champ I liked to pick from time to time to something that is just plain disgusting. Goodbye Morde.

You drive me crazy. Yes you. \n\nHe is banned for a reason; Even if he isnt that strong as some people say, his whole kit is just toxic with elements that has 0 counterplay in a duo lane. He is a viable Yorick really (and Yorick is according to Riot themselves, one of the most unfun champions to play against), with his bonus XP, extremely beefiness from level 1,  and his stupid pet drake.\n\nHis passive + heal of Harvester of Sorrow + duo relic shield makes it almost impossible to force a Mordekaiser, a melee champion, out of lane even with the most damaging harassers. Yes Mordekaiser needs some extra defences if he wants to be viable in bot lane, but its just to much now.\n\nHis xp passive is just broken; he 'wins' lane just by being there; he gets ahead level wise. Just to show how broken it is I made a small calculation: 2400 xp needed for level 6; a normal duo lane gets 65.2% of the minion xp, Mordekaiser gets full. This means if both enemy bot lanes got the same amount of xp Mordekiaser can be level 6, while the rest is still level 4 (2400*0.652=1564, 1700 xp needed for level 5). And this has 0 counterplay at all; its a broken passive and should have never implanted\n\nHis stupid pet drake; ow great our team already lost the drake, but while otherwise all their team members get a small extra buff, with a mordekaiser you have to fight a freaking large beefy drake too. It might be fun to play with your ghost drake, but playing against it is just frustrating (pet drake tanking the turret while your getting dived for example) and has 0 counterplay.\n\nThis combined with his high damage just makes him, in my opinion, toxic to play against; you cant harass him out of lane because of his beefiness and sustain, you will always be lower level if not far ahead, and if you lose control of Bot you have to fight a dragon... This combined with the inability to really fight an hard engage sup+ Morde duo lane (his high damage will destroy you), and the only thing you can hope for is a passive farm lane.  So much fun...\n\nSo yeah I don't really care if Morde isn't that strong as people say, his kit is just toxic to play against and that's to me (and to a lot of others) enough reason to keep him perma banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Morde","date":"2015-09-19T13:37:15.066+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Oi.\n\nYou.\n\nYeah you.\n\nShut up and read my post and check the numbers.\n\nPeople like you piss me off- signing on here, downvoting my thread and speaking their ignorant minds before they even take a look at the numbers.\n\nMaybe if you knew a damn thing about Morde you could counter him properly.
