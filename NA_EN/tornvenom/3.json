I.E. Entrances into river, steps leaving the base.\nIn middle lane, at the steps for the inhibitor turret for middle, it drops. When I say it drops, it literally gets smaller and appears to have dropped to multiple 3d layers down.\nVideo of it found here by me :\nhttp://youtu.be/0zsVEBXb-7w\n\nEdit 1 : I want to be clear about this. This is not just a visual issue, the stun is not being applied to enemy champions when the indicator has shifted. If using the quick cast feature, it still does this.
