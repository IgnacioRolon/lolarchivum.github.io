Detailed, storyline, lore, so many voice bits, bonus recall animation (I don&#039;t like the fact that the helicopter shadow still appears to the enemy if out of range to be seen recalling) and just all around awesome. More skins like this at a higher price than just the 750rp skins (marauder and warden), please.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-14T17:28:16.121+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey TornVenom, \n\nThanks for the kind words! \n\nThe issue you're referring to with the helicopter is being fixed. :]","replies":[{"poster":"TornVenom","date":"2015-04-17T08:02:00.857+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sweet!
