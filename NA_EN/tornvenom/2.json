I get that he&#039;s a mummy, but he&#039;s done up in fully Egyptian gear... like every other GotS skin. He even has an army of scarabs... which are mentioned in the GotS skin lines (cough cough {{champion:33}} cough cough). I&#039;m just curious why the name change when you could have cashed in on the very popular skin line that already existed that you just dropped 3 other skins for?","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-05-02T08:43:09.259+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"The name is one of the last things that gets set before a champion goes to PBE. When we were doing the design for Fiddle, only GotS Kha'zix was out and the other ones were referred to as 'shurima skins' (eg. Shurima Skarner). This skin is intended to be more seriously villainous than Fiddle's other skins, and we talked about him being the ancient Shuriman King that the Guardians of the Sands actually guard against. We also discussed the idea that we sometimes change named for similar skins at different price tiers and that, combined with the name being a little too long, caused us to choose something different: Risen Fiddlesticks!","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-05-02T09:26:19.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this mean that GotS Xerath is the \"good guy\" version of Xerath?
