Bot games on the other hand last less than twenty minutes and she isn&#039;t getting much further on learning. Tried doing blind pick but me being level 30 and her 10 and new to the game.. didn&#039;t do so well with everyone else that&#039;s level 30 (assuming at least 18 since masteries) so I tried making a new account which is actually worse as everyone&#039;s a Smurf playing talon/riven/volibear trying to kill people who don&#039;t know how to play yet. So I&#039;m kinda at a loss of how to actually be able to have an actual game with her learning something. Currently she&#039;s playing ADC and I&#039;ve been supporting. I&#039;ve not been playing chars that is going to get fed as I don&#039;t think she&#039;ll learn anything if I&#039;m just wracking kills up all game. Any suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Arcane Azmadi","date":"2017-02-12T08:41:42.181+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"...if you want to stay married, don't try to get her into League.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2017-02-12T08:45:39.357+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't play with her.

Let her play a few normals alone. Then, download the replay and watch it together, while you offer her advice. AVOID standing WHILE she plays. That's extremely annoying.\n\nFurthermore, team up for some aram games and create some custom games to effectively teach her how to capitalize on mistakes, solidify her cs'ing,  learn wave management, objective control and talk her into playing some 1v1's with you( you can use an empty mastery and rune page).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Proxy345","date":"2017-02-12T08:25:39.321+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play custom bot matches since they can last as long as you want them to if you don't push towers.

I'm gonna tell you that you should probably solo carry.  See, if you totally dominate (assuming you can do that consistently), say, as teemo support (huehuehue), everyone on the other team is going to be some combination of tilted and/or weak.  This will reduce their relative skill when compared to your wife, and allow her to do well, since she will most likely have several levels/items on the other people.  This ease will allow her to learn other aspects of the game, and, git gud, as they say.\n\nI actually highly suggest teemo support - I do it every time my friends want to try some derpy thing botlane (last time was ryze adc), and I often turn games around all by myself.  His shrooms give him a global prescence, and allow you to turn your botlane into a shroom fortress, making the game a lot easier for your wife.  Its also hilarious.","replies":[{"poster":"l Senseman l","date":"2017-02-15T23:45:06.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This actually works very well used brand instead. Solod bot Lane while she farms and then transitioned into AP carry afterwords turns out she doesn't mind as long as she doesn't die every five seconds. Plus really helps as it seems like the rest of the team are durps for the most part going to try Annie and malz as well although not sure on malzes damage early game","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A Basic Island","date":"2017-02-12T08:46:24.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh i think the best is to just get thrown into the fray and get your ass stomped till you know what you're doing","replies":[{"poster":"Caedmar","date":"2017-02-12T14:30:45.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So true.  I learned to play league with a bunch of friends who were all level 30, and i got absolutely destroyed for a while.  Turns out I really, really hate getting destroyed, so I learned very fast.  Learning that way teaches you one thing especially that you probably wouldn't learn anywhere near as quickly if you were playing games against other new players: the importance of good CS while staying safe in lane phase.  You can get away with a ton of mistakes, over-extensions, etc against new players, and that gets you into a lot of bad habits; but against experience players you're going to learn very, very quickly.  I should qualify this by saying, make sure the person has a sufficient competitive streak, or this might not work.  It worked for me because I really, really hate losing badly, and I wanted to get good enough to play competitively and help the team.  I could see somebody getting discouraged by this though, and not following through to reap the rewards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Unreformed Shaco","date":"2017-02-12T13:32:41.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Serious note, teach her to play support.\n\nMake her follow you around as Soraka or Sona.\n\nTeach basics like warding and importance of objectives.\n\nBesides, League could use more support players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-12T11:13:44.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go into a custom game, at first on her team to practice csing and orbwalking, then against her to teach her positioning, duelling, zoning, and things like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"grug","date":"2017-02-12T10:17:20.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wanna really teach her?\n\nverbally abuse her for months.\n\nh4h4h4h4\n\nthat is essentially what the game is pre-level 30.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2017-02-12T10:08:01.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always told my friends to solo it out.
