If I then exit the game, I cannot get the client to open, and I have to completely reinstall the game.  This is the 2nd time this has occurred in 2 days.

You'll want to run through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot, but do so in a custom game to prevent any penalties.  The other could be some pc stress while running idle, but a pc restart may help.\n","replies":[]}]}
