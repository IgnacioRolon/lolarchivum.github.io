But that is because i was having problems at home and i was taking it out innocently on the players in the game. And i was not even that toxic, i feel like a chat restriction would have make more sense in this situation so please. Or even a two week ban, which would make it my first temp ban ever on that account so please, if you can, review the case.

There's not going to be a way to get your ban reverted in that case.\n\nSounds like there are three possibilities here:\n\n1. Your interpretation of the behavior in question (\"not even that toxic\") is vastly different from both the other players in the game and the Rioter(s) who would have manually escalated your account to a permanent ban.\n - Your post here does not follow the typical pattern of an outrageously toxic player that believes they've been unjustly punished, (i.e. \"FUCK YOU RIOT UNBAN MY ACCOUNT NOW!!!\") which is definitely a point to your side in this Boards case you're making.\n\n2. Mistake on Riot's end.\n - Possible. Not hugely likely, but most definitely not off the table. Send a support ticket and have a discussion.\n\n3. The ban was for reasons other than behavior.\n - Regardless of the reason for punishment, you should have received an email about it. Check that and see if it might be a problem with chargeback or account compromisation.\n\n######P.S. Boards formatting for numbered lists is terrible. Can't get sub-points spaced correctly without screwing up the number format.\n\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F1HvNiEO.png%3Fnoredirect&key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&width=150","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2016-09-21T23:26:19.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you went straight to perma-ban, then changes are that your \"little toxic\" contained something riot severely frowns upon like a slur of some kind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teslyn","date":"2016-09-21T23:24:18.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"'The Luck Train' stopped here?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShadowxBlades","date":"2016-09-22T22:07:45.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shut up kid, ban hammer ban hammer!","replies":[{"poster":"The Luck Train","date":"2016-09-22T23:04:57.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Did ask for useless comments like this, get off my post.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Genuwhine36","date":"2016-09-21T23:16:56.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"In my experience this never happened to me.
