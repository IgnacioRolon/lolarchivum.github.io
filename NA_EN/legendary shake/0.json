It used to take 5 seconds max.\r\nI don't have any antivirus software installed, windows defender is disabled as is Cortana.\r\nIt was working fine a month ago but I installed MS Office and a few new games since I last played League. \r\nThere was an update but not sure if it had anything to do with this issue. I have uninstalled all games and MS Office assuming one of these may have caused it.\r\nMy specs, \r\nWindows 10 with Internet connection of 50 down and 5 up with in game ping averaging 70\r\nPC is Intel 5820k, 16 gb ddr4 2400, Nvidia EVGA 970 FTW and a Samsung 830 Pro SSD.\r\nDrivers are all up to date.

There are some known issues going on with the Beta Client in champ select, but I'll need more details to determine if this is what's going on with you. I recommend testing this with a few custom matches in order to avoid any penalties from disconnecting or failing to join a match.","replies":[{"poster":"Legendary Shake","date":"2017-02-28T07:59:42.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Until you brought it up I had thought that the original client was already discontinued. I tried with the classic and it's fine, loads champ select as soon as everyone accepts. It even loaded the game faster. Until recently I haven't had issues with the new client. Thank you","replies":[]}]}]}
