Everything is just broken so damn hard. When it comes to wining the game, it just comes to 2 criterias: Team composition and count of autofilled members on your team.  When im talking about team composition I mean the number of {{item:3124}} your team has. And when it comes to autofill, well, its something that you cant controll at all, most of the times.\n\nYou can bassicly tell what team is going to win at champ select and this makes me want to quit this game. As long as you pick right champion, no matter how hard you lose, you will still win, because of some broken picks that exist currently in this wrecked game.  Every other game of mine is just won by minute 10, BUT its enough for 1 champion like {{champion:10}} to shred whole team if she manages to reach lvl 16 to win a game SINGLEHANDEDLY. Same goes for {{champion:11}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:67}} + {{item:3124}} \n\nYou can open my match history and I guarantee you will see how \"Balanced\" this game is, it just cant be enjoyable playing solo, everything it too _fast and complex._\n\nEDIT: League of 20 champions. Rest is just hardcore difficulty to carry with.","replies":[{"poster":"Colton147147","date":"2019-05-04T23:29:36.033+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:223}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3151}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-05-04T23:43:28.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget that they are changing the {{item:3124}} passive to proc on every other 2nd auto in 9.10","replies":[{"poster":"Vicious Jq","date":"2019-05-04T23:48:31.440+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Galaxyburstz,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uI27kqf6,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-05-04T23:43:28.825+0000)\n>\n> Don't forget that they are changing the {{item:3124}} passive to proc on every other 2nd auto in 9.10\n\nYea and buff Yi to permabanned state","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ambitious Minnow","date":"2019-05-06T02:19:59.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like this because snowballing champions can be as many as *five levels above* the rest of champs playing in most extreme scenarios. Some kits are insane with big level difference.\n\nEach role is now managed by Riot, instead of Riot just managing champ power overall, so some lanes are behind, others ahead, each patch a chosen favorite role.\n\nThese were roles dictated by meta game originally, not LoL. Players constantly find ways to abuse all the extra wanky mechanics added for more snowballing.
