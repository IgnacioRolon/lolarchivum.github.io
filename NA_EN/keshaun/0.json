Barrier only lasts 2 second and ignite last 5 seconds with damage tics every 1.2 seconds after application.\nAlso that 40% only applies if barrier was active before ignite is applied so in reality its far worse, having ignite yourself is a better counter than barrier if you have any kill potential against the enemy as they have to play less stupid.\nEdit: fun fact heal negates 67.5 to 41% of ignites damage.","replies":[{"poster":"senior evil","date":"2018-11-09T00:43:22.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:1}}","replies":[{"poster":"wolvius","date":"2018-11-09T01:02:54.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=senior evil,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kGivmmbv,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-09T00:43:22.204+0000)\n>\n> {{summoner:1}}\n\nAnother summoner doesn't change that fact _**Barrier**_ doesn't counter Ignite.","replies":[{"poster":"senior evil","date":"2018-11-09T01:35:46.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:1}} is the counter not {{summoner:21}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Common Satyr","date":"2018-11-08T20:35:45.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KrakenKnight,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kGivmmbv,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-11-08T09:13:56.361+0000)\n>\n> Barrier is meant to be outperformed later in the game.
