In ARAM, if Zoe picks up two snowballs, there's a two-minute cooldown on the second W cast.

This includes her Q, but also would provide more opportunities to use her passive, as well as pop around in situations that don't just involve her Q. Effectively, lowering the cooldown could make her more versatile, and increasing the range would increase her Q effective range by extension as well.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Uber Deer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=onJsxYIA,comment-id=0006000000000000,timestamp=2018-08-07T10:16:03.850+0000)\n> \n> Considering that she is a damage mage and not a support, increasing her damage is the only way of buffing her unless you want to reduce the cooldown on her Q to Swain&#x27;s level.\n\nI don't follow.
