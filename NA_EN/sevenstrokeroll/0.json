We were able to deploy a fix that worked for some players, but we're still working on a permafix for everyone. If you're still experiencing this issue, I'd recommend trying to **ALT+ENTER** workaround once you enter the loading screen. This should toggle you out of Fullscreen mode (part of what's causing this to happen) and toss you into a Windowed Mode that should display with no issues.\n\nSince I don't work on the team that deploys these fixes, I can't provide an ETA on when you can expect the permafix for this to go out, but if you have any other questions, let me know!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Adicupidon","date":"2017-01-24T17:04:04.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem help pls!!","replies":[]}]}
