I believe this is happening due to the fact that i think i accidentally deleted old files from the legacy client but i want to know how to make it so it doesn't keep sending me bug splat errors every time i open the client. The client still opens and allows me to log in but the bug splat errors are annoying. Any fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-19T00:31:59.950+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't see for myself what's going wrong in those game logs, but typically bugsplats happen when certain files don't interact in the way they're meant to causing a crash.
