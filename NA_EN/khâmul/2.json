I think we can all agree that the Morde rework wasn&#039;t our best work from several different angles. We probably didn&#039;t get enough benefit out of the cost of changes we incurred here. Still stand by our position, that he is ultimately healthier and will continue to be tweaked towards the duo lane at least for the short term. I agree that long term, we probably need to revisit Morde and do a full overhaul, but that&#039;s probably far in the future unfortunately.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;we probably need to revisit Morde and do a full overhaul, but that&#039;s probably far in the future unfortunately.&quot;\r\nsad...I was waiting for something since end 2013.now i won&#039;t wait for anything.\r\nYou&#039;ve lost my trust so don&#039;t screw up on Yorick rework ,you&#039;ll end up loosing credibility. \r\n(no need for comments on this post,just posting it because i&#039;m angry about that)","replies":[{"poster":"Bootleg Gay","date":"2015-12-20T20:04:58.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I do agree with you; Mordekaiser is a train wreck of nonsense.
