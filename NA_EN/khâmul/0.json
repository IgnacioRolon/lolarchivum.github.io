Grammar school does not actually delve into the intricacies of the English language, and by the time students reach high school, the focus is split between grammar and literature.

This makes them very aware of correct spelling and grammar, but have poor accents and difficulties with the actual spoken language (slang, speed, slurring of certain words, etc).\n\nNative speakers, on the other hand, learn to speak the language before learning to read and write. Thus, spelling tends to be more difficult, as well as some parts of grammar, since speaking is more deeply ingrained (for English, especially, spelling is inconsistent, due to the many, many languages it is composed of).\n\nFor example, I learned Spanish as a second language. Spelling is ridiculously easy for me - if I hear a word in Spanish, I can spell it without having to think about it, even if I've never heard it before. Native Spanish speakers often can't, though.

I think it's better that they learn this in an environment  where a mistake has no consequences.

Who are you to say, \"You cannot/should not speak this way!\" Who are you to undermine the will of another? It's not your place to correct someone for their speech. If someone wishes to improve on their linguistic ability, they will actively seek out the required learning on their own.\n\nLet's go back to the analogy I made in my initial post, character acting. If an actor is PURPOSEFULLY speaking in an improper manner in order to better emulate a certain type of person, you would not correct them. So why then would you treat an actual person in such a manner? If anything, THAT is spitting on their perceived level of education. \n\nNow let's use another example: I am an african american male, as I am sure you are more than aware, in the United States the stereotypical \"black/ghetto\" community does not speak proper english, it's practically it's own dialect of english. I myself was raised to speak the language properly, and pride myself in doing so, but I would NEVER walk up to a fellow african american and tell them that their speech is improper, because it isn't, it's simply how they speak. I did not go to a special school, same public school as them, same underpaid teachers, same poor family background, etc. I simply had the gift for articulation in a way that my peers didn't. \n\nFor many, language and patterns of speech are learned not from school, but from family, via mimicry. You learn how to speak from your parents, it is a part of your identity, cultural or otherwise. Then a teacher comes along and teaches you the fine print of language in school, you either adapt or you don't, and either is fine. It has nothing to do with intelligence, for many people speaking in a certain way is comfortable to them.\n\nTHAT is why it's rude to correct another's speech. THAT is why people get \"triggered\", because you aren't just correcting them, you are attacking their identity, you are placing yourself ABOVE THEM and saying, \"The way you speak is wrong.\" You have no right to do so. You are not better than they are, and unwanted constructive criticism is incredibly rude. \n\nWhat you are implying when you say \"I don't care if I'm corrected, the more bitter it is, the faster you learn, the longer you remember.\" is nothing short of glorifying shame culture.  \n\nIt has nothing to do with ignorance, nor lack of education, and everything to do with identity. \"Live and let live\"\nYou are but a single amoeba in a larger organism, don't go making the other amoeba sick.
