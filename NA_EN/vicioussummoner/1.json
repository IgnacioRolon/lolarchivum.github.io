My normal 45-60 has now dropped to a 20-35 and even lower sometimes going from 9-20 FPS. The worst I've had was a game where my FPS dropped down to a 0-5 FPS. I've only noticed this while in windowed mode. I don't experience any FPS issues with fullscreen.\r\n\r\nNote: I do not play on fullscreen because the game will sometimes not connect, and in other cases just crash. As well fullscreen will crash more often than windowed while in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-30T21:44:19.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes when the client updates you need to make a few other updates to your computer to ensure the client still interacts with your system in the correct way.
