The reason being was that I  was unable to get into a game because the client literally kicked me out twice while trying to load in.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-14T22:12:10.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you were having issues with your client, we should probably try and get those straightened out first. Let me know what was going wrong with your client and I can help you troubleshoot, and after that, I might be able to help out with that LPQ.","replies":[{"poster":"ViciousSummoner","date":"2017-09-16T09:44:39.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The LPQ was only for 5 games and has already passed.\n\nMy main issue is with the client. During the time that I received the LPQ the client had said that I was disconnected from loading, but I was not experiencing any connectivity issues. Closing the window and attempting to reload the client is just not possible because it loads too slowly, or it just flat out prevents reconnection due to the reconnect button not appearing. Upon trying to reconnect after opening a new client, in-between loading, the client forces me out of loading and back into the reconnect page where it displays the message of, “this game is still in progress,” but it shows no reconnect button either. So, for a second time, I have to close this client and open a new one, but by that time it’s already too late. I’m not sure if these issues just stem from me using the Mac client, using the option to close the client while in game, or because my hardware is not up to par.","replies":[]}]}]}
