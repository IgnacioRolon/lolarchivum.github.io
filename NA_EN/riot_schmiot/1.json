Now that most players have made the transition, we’re going to be taking the next step towards enabling Riot’s long-term capabilities towards supporting multiple games: removing the region selector from the login screen. \r\n\r\nDon’t worry: **this update will not stop you from playing in different regions (or on PBE)**. Instead, since your Riot Account is now globally unique and each account is linked to a specific League of Legends region, you’ll just need to log in on the Riot Account associated with that region to play there. You can [read this article for more information](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043328413-Regionless-Accounts-League-of-Legends).\r\n\r\nIf you haven’t yet updated to a Riot Account, you’ll get an error message when you try to sign in and will **not be able to get past the login screen**. At this point you’ll need to head over to the [account update website](https://update-account.riotgames.com/) before you can play. You can find out more about the Riot Account update by checking out this [Riot Support FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037264394-Riot-Accounts), which includes more details, some additional context, and a few tips that might help out.","replies":[{"poster":"Generic Ninja","date":"2020-02-18T23:02:24.100+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, but we have still yet to learn *why* this change was made. Seriously, all we know so far is that Riot Accounts are downgraded League Accounts, that they will feature lower functionality and security, and that all publically stated reasons (such as its needed for the accounts to be usable accross multiple games) were simply completely wrong (as shown, for example, by the fact that LoR is the only non-league Riot Game thats out right now, and likely the only one to be out within this year, and it works *perfectly* with a League Account). Is it too much to ask to be told why in the world we have to lose our usernames just so the account system can be downgraded, replacing the existing league accounts with inferior riot accounts?","replies":[]},{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2020-02-20T16:34:09.053+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems like a massive step backwards? I thought the point of Riot accounts was to solidify everything and make one account universal across all your games/systems..... And if that wasn't the goal then what is the point of it? Take a look at Blizzards launcher for example... one login... all your games and can switch between different iterations(i.e. WoW Retai vs WoW Classic) with a few clicks on the mouse. Why are you making something that should be inherently simple far more difficult than it needs to or should be? You implemented a change which I think was a positive one and now follow up changes are working counter intuitively towards what many would place as the goal for the initial change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"im izded","date":"2020-02-18T18:20:09.567+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this also mean we get cross region language selector, ive always wanted JP voices without using third party stuff","replies":[{"poster":"Moody Jazz","date":"2020-02-18T19:32:08.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=im izded,realm=EUNE,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=gITIu50r,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2020-02-18T18:20:09.567+0000)\n>\n> Does this also mean we get cross region language selector, ive always wanted JP voices without using third party stuff\n\nNo third party stuff works anymore. The only possible way is to change the locale which would change both text and the voices. They could easily implement it (I mean PBE has basically every locale possible, except the Chinese and Garena ones) and you can also do that now by making a LeagueClient.exe shortcut on your desktop and editing it's properties by adding a space and --locale=ja_JP after the end of the path. You can swap the ja_JP with ko_KR, zh_CN (the home screen doesn't work because they have a different client), fr_FR, es_MX (LA Spanish), es_ES (European Spanish), de_DE and many other, you get the idea.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Generic Ninja","date":"2020-02-22T01:08:52.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, so not only do you push a *very* unpopular change through despite a ton of people telling you that they hate it and how bad of an idea it is, without even explaining why the bleeding hell you did it in the first place, but the system you chose for how usernames are distributed, that rewards inactive/abandoned accounts also remains after the change? Seriously, I cant see how in the world a system that actively ensures that *many* desired usernames would become permanently inaccessible, lost to abandoned accounts that will never play the game again, got through even the first stage of testing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The23rdGamer","date":"2020-02-19T14:27:24.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we choose more languages in our clients when we launch then?
