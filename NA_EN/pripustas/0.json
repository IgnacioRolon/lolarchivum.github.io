As far as assassin elements go, she has pretty good backline access and up-front burst, but she's not very slippery and doesn't really have outs or defensive tricks that many assassins do.  On the fighter side of things, her sustained damage is quite high, but, even considering her shield, she doesn't get quite as tanky and doesn't operate quite as effectively with dedicated tanky builds.\n\nThese elements result in her having a very all-in playstyle, and makes her pretty snowbally as well. She is pretty powerful, but I don't think at this point there's a definitive argument to be made that she's too far out of line at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"BuzzinTate","date":"2015-09-02T09:10:02.561+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She feels like another version of akali when you lane with her, the only difference being she gets a shield and has some CC","replies":[]},{"poster":"pripustas","date":"2015-08-16T05:53:56.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, she doesn't have escapes.

I think some bug fixes on the Q/R reset and a faster rotating speed on W (which was a surprisingly nice change). Aside from that, her real strength comes from Runeglaive smoothing out her item path by giving her a little bit of everything she needs and letting her hit her midgame power spike faster. She's in a good state right now but her strength relies completely on the strength of runeglaive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2015-08-15T19:26:10.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is the only viable assasin with high burst and sustained dmg atm + she has a shitty laning vs ranged champion pre 6.","replies":[{"poster":"pripustas","date":"2015-08-15T19:39:37.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"Guess what?

Rengar get additional 30 to 100 armor and magic resist so he gets more effective hp, same applies to Kata and her dmg reduction. Invisibility isn't useless even if you enemy has a pinkward because he has to wast time to place this pinkward.\n\n\nDiana's passiv deals around 750 damage after 3 AAs\nEkko deals around 550 damage after 3 AAs OR spellhits + 15% missing hp if you are under 30% max hp per hit\nFizz deals around 200 damage per hit + a 350 + 8% missing hp dot\nAD Assassins deals around 400 - 1200 damage per hit\n\nI can't see why Diana should be op, especially if you consider that she has no escape and can't go out after she killed somebody.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2015-08-15T22:01:09.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=orneff,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E7AgHpGT,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-08-15T19:39:37.270+0000)\n>\n> Guess what?
