I just got off a two week ban not too long ago, so I already knew I was on thin ice. I got autofilled adc with a 300+ game Zilean main, so we&#039;re already off to a good start. I went through the entire laning phase without typing, but Zilean clearly wasn&#039;t very fond of my Lucian skills, so starting midgame he was spam pinging me &quot;?&quot; left and right, and instead of just outright harassing him which of would&#039;ve done in the past, (hence the two week ban,) but I&#039;ve been watching a lot of the new reformed Tyler1 and watching how he deals with teammates in a more passive-aggressive way without going out of his way to actually offend anyone in game, so I said something like &quot;so I&#039;m just going to get spam pinged by the Zilean who didn&#039;t land a stun in lane, give me a f**king break.&quot; He did the whole &quot;you&#039;re garbage at adc stop playing this game routine&quot; so I muted him after saying how he barely hit a q in lane and then the game went on as usual, with a few comments from teammates telling Zilean and I to stop talking, which continued for a bit even after I muted Zilean. Later into the game after two lost teamfights mid, with our team having baron during one of the fights, I decided that we should be focusing on out-macro&#039;ing the enemy team and getting objectives. \r\n\r\nSeeing how the only tier 1 tower on the enemy team was top, I starting pushing top and told our team &quot;top tower is next, group with me top.&quot; I expected our Singed to split bot or something because he had teleport, while instead he followed me top and everyone else stayed mid. This was after the enemy team had backed, so we had an opportunity to group top and get a free tower while drag was down. Instead my other 3 teammates died at mid trying to force a 3v5, and Singed ran down river and eventually got caught and died, then called me stupid for wanting to group top instead of mid. When I died trying to defend our base on my own, everyone just spam pinged me and insulted me and told everyone to report me, etc. I think it&#039;s possible that the reason I was penalized was because I said some things in chat like &quot;if you don&#039;t think we should group anywhere other than mid then I don&#039;t know what to say,&quot; and &quot;this game is over,&quot; etc. The enemy team had a stronger lategame and a bigger lead, so the only way I saw we could win was by out-macro&#039;ing them and getting objectives, which my kda does not indicate, and I don&#039;t think I was anywhere close to being toxic enough to warrant any penalty whatsoever, let alone a permanent ban, but I&#039;m asking you all to be the judges.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nPre-Game\r\nMlgWeeaboo: ya\r\nMlgWeeaboo: not very good\r\nMlgWeeaboo: yeah ok\r\n(this was just joking around about one of our teammates having the clan tag feet)\r\nIn-Game\r\nMlgWeeaboo: heim\r\nMlgWeeaboo: want to lane swap\r\nMlgWeeaboo: I think u do better vs ez\r\nMlgWeeaboo: and I can poke out akali better\r\nMlgWeeaboo: so does heim though\r\nMlgWeeaboo: ya but what about before then\r\nMlgWeeaboo: zzz\r\nMlgWeeaboo: why is nunu just staying bot\r\nMlgWeeaboo: he has much less farm than eve\r\nMlgWeeaboo: as nunu\r\nMlgWeeaboo: i just got to lane\r\nMlgWeeaboo: zzz\r\nMlgWeeaboo: I&#039;m going to get spam pinged all game\r\nMlgWeeaboo: by the zilean who only hit one stun in lane\r\nMlgWeeaboo: when I wasn&#039;t even in lane\r\nMlgWeeaboo: give me a fucking break\r\nMlgWeeaboo: I think that was one of the very few times he even hit a q at all\r\nMlgWeeaboo: sorry bud\r\nMlgWeeaboo: objective is to win\r\nMlgWeeaboo: not to argue\r\nMlgWeeaboo: as far as I&#039;m concerned you haven&#039;t helped me win so\r\nMlgWeeaboo: you don&#039;t deserve to ping me\r\nMlgWeeaboo: you never used it on me\r\nMlgWeeaboo: you never did anything\r\nMlgWeeaboo: look at thresh gold on support item\r\nMlgWeeaboo: vs you\r\nMlgWeeaboo: because you never hit anything\r\nMlgWeeaboo: who\r\nMlgWeeaboo: the muted zilean\r\nMlgWeeaboo: well he died mid when we were all at baron\r\nMlgWeeaboo: so he probably got a fear of mid\r\nMlgWeeaboo: so he went bot alone\r\nMlgWeeaboo: because he thinks he&#039;ll be less likely to die there\r\nMlgWeeaboo: top tower is next\r\nMlgWeeaboo: idk if you think I&#039;m splitting\r\nMlgWeeaboo: I&#039;m telling you where to group\r\nMlgWeeaboo: k\r\nMlgWeeaboo: you see a difference\r\nMlgWeeaboo: in towers there\r\nMlgWeeaboo: which is the easiest to take it\r\nMlgWeeaboo: if you sincerely think we shouldn&#039;t be grouping in any other lane then mid then I don&#039;t know what to say\r\nMlgWeeaboo: nobody wants to cooperate\r\nMlgWeeaboo: and they all only want to group mid\r\nMlgWeeaboo: I say to group top\r\nMlgWeeaboo: because you still have 1st tier tower top\r\nMlgWeeaboo: singed calls me dumb and says to group mid\r\nMlgWeeaboo: they only want to group mid\r\nMlgWeeaboo: they don&#039;t know there&#039;s 3 lanes lol\r\nMlgWeeaboo: I try to ff\r\nMlgWeeaboo: idk what to do\r\nMlgWeeaboo: and zil never hit stun in lane\r\nMlgWeeaboo: but he says I&#039;m the bad laner\r\nMlgWeeaboo: when he leaves me in lane to 2v1\r\nMlgWeeaboo: and I still kill thresh\r\nMlgWeeaboo: someone get me out pls\r\nMlgWeeaboo: eve went from 1 death to 7 deaths\r\nMlgWeeaboo: because she &quot;forgot she didn&#039;t have ult&quot;\r\nMlgWeeaboo: just end\r\nMlgWeeaboo: pls\r\nMlgWeeaboo: I still have less deaths than eve...\r\nMlgWeeaboo: no it didn&#039;t\r\nMlgWeeaboo: you not knowing how to play your only champ did\r\nMlgWeeaboo: I am autofill adc\r\nMlgWeeaboo: and still have to 2v1 lane\r\nMlgWeeaboo: and watch jg feed\r\nMlgWeeaboo: ggwp friends\r\nPost-Game\r\nMlgWeeaboo: the game was lost\r\nMlgWeeaboo: we have a onetrick jungle\r\nMlgWeeaboo: that doesn&#039;t know how to play their onetrick\r\nMlgWeeaboo: we have a zilean that doesn&#039;t land stuns in lane and blames adc for leaving them to 2v1\r\nMlgWeeaboo: we have a singed\r\nMlgWeeaboo: of all champs\r\nMlgWeeaboo: singed\r\nMlgWeeaboo: who only thinks to group mid\r\nMlgWeeaboo: and not top or bot\r\nMlgWeeaboo: like\r\nMlgWeeaboo: you take teleport\r\nMlgWeeaboo: they have first tier tower top\r\nMlgWeeaboo: you go bot\r\nMlgWeeaboo: send 4 top\r\nMlgWeeaboo: because you said we shouldn&#039;t be grouping top\r\nMlgWeeaboo: no lol...\r\nMlgWeeaboo: there&#039;s a right place to group\r\nMlgWeeaboo: and a wrong place to group\r\nMlgWeeaboo: but here&#039;s the thing\r\nMlgWeeaboo: why were you all mid\r\nMlgWeeaboo: and not top\r\nMlgWeeaboo: when top had the easier tower to take\r\nMlgWeeaboo: not you\r\nMlgWeeaboo: don&#039;t go mid\r\nMlgWeeaboo: if you go mid you lose\r\nMlgWeeaboo: because you shouldn&#039;t be going mid","replies":[{"poster":"I MUST WIN","date":"2018-07-08T20:27:14.914+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I've been watching a lot of the new reformed Tyler1 and watching how he deals with teammates in a more passive-aggressive way without going out of his way to actually offend anyone in game, so I said something like\n\nHow about NOT trying to impersonate someone else. Especially when it involves something that can escalate to just pure annoyance and harassment for others.\n\nThe **best ** way (In my opinion btw) to handle teammates is to try and reach out to them NICELY and not aggressively, they are your allies, not enemies. If you are unable to do that or they are toxic themselves just simply mute, and go on with playing the game. They can't do anything to you anyway.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-07-08T20:20:04.607+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> MlgWeeaboo: by the zilean who only hit one stun in lane\n> MlgWeeaboo: I think that was one of the very few times he even hit a q at all\n> MlgWeeaboo: as far as I'm concerned you haven't helped me win so\n> MlgWeeaboo: you don't deserve to ping me\n> MlgWeeaboo: you never did anything\n> MlgWeeaboo: look at thresh gold on support item\n> MlgWeeaboo: vs you\n> MlgWeeaboo: because you never hit anything\n\nBelittling your teammate's performance and saying they don't deserve to use in-game communication features isn't okay.

As soon as I let everyone know I was autofilled adc they lost it with \"oh that explains why you suck so much\" and so on. I strongly believe that my gameplan was correct, but seeing everyone else want to keep doing the same thing that hasn't worked when they know it won't help us win is very discouraging. I understand that in a vacuum my chat was not acceptable, but having an evelynn onetrick rudely telling you how to play your champ when you get autofilled and are forced to a pick a champ you barely know how to play is very hard to deal with, and as much as I wanted to mute them, I still felt like we had a chance if we just grouped in the right spots and played around our strengths instead of engaging head-on, which my team continued to do, and then blamed and harassed me when it didn't work.
