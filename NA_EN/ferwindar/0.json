So the second pick called top and decided to go with talon.\n\nOur team last pick didn´t go with a jungler, which was the last role available, but went with xerath instead. I only saw this after the loading started (i´m to blame). And i thought: \"no biggie, we can still do fine\".\n\nThen came this talon out of the blue, claiming he \"called mid\" in a ranked match. Now if he&acute;d asked nicely, i could let him mid. But he went like: \"stfu your fault you took a support mid\". Even though i told EVERYONE i was going morg mid.\n\nAt this point i already know it&acute;s a lost match, since i&acute;m already behind on farm, i&acute;m pissed and i won&acute;t perform like i would in a normal situation.\n\nSo i have three choices: \n\n1- stay mid with him and we both get underfarmed. He will still somehow manage to get the support of the rest of the team and i WILL be reported for not going to another lane.\n\n2- Back down, accept the abuse, join another lane, perform poorly (see above) and get reported anyway.\n\n3 - Open /all , say something like \" I&acute;m sorry everyone, there&acute;s a troll on my team and i won&acute;t be abused.\" Then DC right away and go do something else. Oh, and i will probably be reported for Leaving/AFK.\n\nUsually i go with option 3, just cause i know i&acute;ll have no fun, and i just can&acute;t stand trolls getting away with the things they do. Yea, i know the rest of the team is going to suffer because of this, but for me is still the best option.\n\nUsually, after trolling and abusing ppl like that, the trolls will generally try and throw the rest of the team against you. Funny enough, they always succeed.\n\nI mean, the whole team saw that i was abused, trolled and bullied out of my lane and somehow i&acute;m the bad guy all of a sudden? And the troll will get away with what he wants. This is not an isolated case, every troll i come by will do the same thing, and i will still be reported.\n\nWhat&acute;s the problem with you people?\n\nTL;DR : i get trolled AND reported. The troll gets away with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsugaga","date":"2015-03-31T19:16:39.867+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've had this happen many times actually(I don't AFK though), and it is very odd that people usually side with the troll.

But i didn´t say a word the whole match, either.\n\nThe troll spent so much time throwing all kids of bad propaganda about me.\n\n And since i was out of my lane, against a way stronger oponent, i was like 1/2/0, then 1/3/1 and my team started to agree with him and by the end of the game they all agreed to report me.\n\nEven if i did great, even if we won the game, does this change the fact that this player was abusive, toxic and a negative influence on the game?\n\nLike i said, surrender timers should be shorter, and 3 players should be enough to pass a vote.

Riot isn't going to make it so 3 players can pass a vote.  They already have people demanding that surrender be removed from ranked play, so they won't make it easier to surrender.  I agree it can be frustrating to be in a match you know is unwinnable and have 2 people who refuse to vote for the surrender, but that's going to happen.  There are a lot of people playing LoL who have a \"Never give up, Never Surrender!\" attitude.

I'm not usually the only one asking either so that helps, but occasionally NO ONE says a word except for me, which I find weird in a team based game.... but then again this community is generally just sh*t anyway so I shouldn't be surprised.\n\nOn another note, I never miss a champ selected by my team in champ select, NEVER!  Knowing which roles you have and which you must fill is very important, so I always pay close attention and have never gotten into a match thinking \"oh well didn't notice we don't have a jungler!\" or a champion in a strange role.  Have missed someone taking the wrong summoner(s) before though, sh*t happens lol  But anyway due to this I can take the correct summoners to fill the position that I must for my team.\n\nAlso most my main champions fill multiple positions.  I main Rengar, Aatrox, and Sion, all three can jungle and top perfectly fine and I can perform well in just about every match up with them, I can even mid as Aatrox in certain match ups should I really have to (but don't usually like to, something has to get REALLY screwed up for me to do this).  I also play Galio, Viktor, and Azir in mid lane, and all three can also top lane just fine.  I'll be focusing almost exclusively on farming in most match ups and my builds get altered a bit but I have done it to satisfy idiot teammate's needs.  Galio also makes a decent supp sometimes, so I can do that.  My supports are Braum, Thresh, and Nautilus (been doing Naut supp since mid season 3, so no I'm not a bandwagoner on this one lol), and obviously Naut can jungle well and I've even done Braum jungle a couple times in normals matches when some prick locks in a support for his duo even though me and my duo have locked in, or just I have.  Not very great but I've done it, and I can also Thresh top, not so great anymore but again I've been forced to do it a couple times and I've never fed, even beat a Riven and a Quinn on separate occasions lol  As for adc... I just don't play adc much so I always try to get someone else to :P\n\nSo in your position there, the Talon may have screwed you over but I would still have just walked top, Morg does fine in top lane where as Talon doesn't fair well against almost all the top laners, and if Talon went mid at the start of the game you should have at least asked way before the minions spawned so you wouldn't have to deal with falling behind.  Afterwards I'd have just taken the hit to my cs and levels and just played SUPER safe and bugged the jungler for some help, pointing out that Talon screwed up and it has set me behind.  If the jungler doesn't help or can't help you just cannot leave your towers side, fall behind, lose in cs, maybe even get dived, but you HAVE to stay back to avoid just feeding more and more.  Happens in the lcs all the time and they can usually avoid hard feeding, unlike most solo Q players.  But basically be the bigger man and your team will see that, if they do not cause their queued together or just morons then simply ignore them.\n\nI was forced top lane Viktor a while ago, before the rework in fact, because someone had said \"top/supp pref\" in champ select, then after I had picked a mid champ and it got to his turns he FLIPPED out about taking his mid.  Was obviously a troll, but I don't like feeding into their childish antics so I just went top and his duo queue partner harassed me like crazy which some how got the rest of the team upset with me even though I'd said like 3 things, none of which directed at anyone else.  I then unfortunately lagged out and had to restart my client and for some reason my dude never walked back to base and the Renekton top killed me like the dick he was.  After I reconnected, saw I died, and then started to get hardcore flamed by my whole team, I just muted them all and went back to farming.  We ended up winning because I froze my lane out of Renekton's reach and farmed from afar with my E when I had to, even gave up the first tower cause back then at lvl 6 Renekton basically got a free dive and kill just by hitting all his abilities, so I then froze the lane at my second tier, and kept LOADS of wards up so he couldn't just pop out on my mid laner, even though he had put me in that position in the first place.\n\nIn the after game chat screen they STILL tried to harass me for some reason, but I just reported them all for verbal abuse and said \"gg other team, report mine for constant flame please\" and left without really reading what anyone said after that.  I got 3 honarable mentions and a report warning, but nothing ever came of it anyway.\n\nSo yeah I think there were FAR more solutions to your situation then you say there were, you for some reason refused to consider anything positive or constructive and ONLY considered the possible negatives.  If you keep thinking like that you'll never be able to find the bright side of things or possible ways out of bad situations, in more then just this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-03-31T20:44:27.083+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Ferwindar\n\nI know how you feel mate...\nThat's the society we live in, where one who screams louder is always right.

You take mid, I'll sup. It'd be great if you could roam a bit, too.\". Say nothing if he does bad, and \"sorry, doing my best\" if anyone bm's you. Humble pie.\n\nIf punishing the troll is your #1 priority, it becomes more fun and interesting: It is now time to become a successful **COUNTERTROLL**\n\nYour objective: Make sure the troll gets the *exact opposite* of what he wants from this game.\nIn this game, we can see the troll wants either to A) play his favorite role and enjoy himself or, failing that, he wants to B) cause a scene and make you mad. You must make sure he does neither.\n\nObviously, you first must deny his primary objective for trolling: He doesn't get to solo mid. Get mid items, and go mid. Make one very calm comment, such as \"Sorry guys, as first pick I'm going to insist on taking the lane I called\". That is the ONLY time you should acknowledge the situation. Ignore any arguments from other team members.\n\nNow he will move to plan B, in which he tries to make you mad by A) disrupting your usual play, B) verbally harassing you, C) turning other players against you and D) possibly intentionally causing a loss. You must thwart tactics when you can, and defeat their overall intent to make you mad.\n\nThis means do NOT acknowledge him, or his trolling, at all. Countertroll \"don'ts\" include:\n\n**DON'T** say \"report X\". No matter how much you want to \"set the record straight\" DON'T do it. It will start the \"No, report Y!\" frenzy. This makes you look petty, it gets both teams ranting about who to report, it muddies the water and makes it unclear who really started it.\n\n**DON'T** appear overly invested in the outcome of the game. Appear calm at all times, as if you're just having fun. This means avoid any comments like \"OMG!\", \"WTF?\", or spamming pings. It means not placing blame on anyone, nor discuss if your team is winning or losing. Do not say \"we need to\", or use all caps. Do not say \"gg\" early or \"FF at 20\". \n\n**DON'T** reference how the trolls actions make your game suffer. No comments like \"Normally I'm better at...\". No acknowledgement of negative feelings that could make the troll feel empowered.\n\nNow for some DO's:\n\n**DO** ignore the troll completely. Don't say anything to him. Put him on mute, or make damn sure you NEVER respond to a comment of his. Don't remark when he dies or makes a mistake, since he'll do the same to you if you fail later. Don't BM him, as it will make you look bad to other players. Remain COMPLETELY UNAFFECTED by anything he says.\n\n**DO** make positive comments to team mates, and good-natured banter with the other team. It will get the other players on your side. They will see you are  a friendly, level-headed person, and the trolls badmouth and requests to report you will be held against him. This positive attitude will also show the troll he's failing to ruin your experience.\n\n**DO** try to secretly ruin his game. Steal his CS and/or kills, take any buff he's trying to get, lure into fights then leave him to die. DON'T MAKE IT OBVIOUS. You want ONLY the troll to know your doing this. This will make him rage against you, and lower his score, making him appear to be the toxic one. Don't try too hard! Don't waste big spells or flashes on KSing or buff stealing. It will make him happy if you fail, and the other players might notice what you're doing.\n\nIf you do everything right, the following will happen:\n\nThe troll will have an awful game, and no satisfaction from trolling. He didn't get to play the role he wanted, the person he tried to make mad never even acknowledged him had fun anyway, and everybody else in the game is pissed at him and reporting him. The next time he thinks about troll-picking, he will remember this feeling of defeat and reconsider.

It's an explanation, but that counts for little.\n\nThe problem here is that you entered the game knowing there was a chance that you'd run into an emotional and angry person with no morals who sees nothing wrong with abusing other players.  And this isn't unique to LoL.  Its an endemic problem on the internet.   I remember when blogging was just getting started and many people joked that it was angry young men living in their parent's basements and wearing pajamas doing it.\n\nNow those angry young men are just playing video games.\n\nI can bet that if I asked around in the most popular 10 or so MMO's/online games I'd find that there are trolls in all of them, and no matter what method is used by the company to try to control them, they do manage to break out and cause trouble.  My girlfriend plays games on her tablet and says that they are endemic in most of the games she's tried.  I've run into them in every MMORPG I've played and even in one MMORPG became a volunteer who tried to control the behavior with visible punishments and a clear demarcation line where a certain number of incidents got the account banned/deleted.  And that didn't work because trolls would just create throwaway accounts to troll from.\n\nYOu have to realize that by DCing you allow the troll to \"win\".  He can feel like he's a big dog because he chased someone from the game.\n\nIf you argue with him, he's got a good chance of turning people against you, (you escalated the incident) again, he wins.\n\nThat's why you have to be passive against an internet bully.  no one likes the bully, but they often can hide behind the reaction if the reaction causes more harm.  You just can't react like you would in a classroom or work environment.\n\n-----\n\nMy other recommendation is that you have to have a thick skin towards abuse on the internet.  Remember that the troll doesn't know you, what you look like, where you live or anything.  He's using you as a proxy for all the bullies at his high school who kicked dirt in his face and threw him in the trashcan in front of the senior class during his freshman year.  You are a proxy for every girl who laughed at him when he tried to talk to her.  For the coworker who was promoted faster than him, and for every failure he's ever suffered.  You can't \"win\" against that by fighting it.  At best you can ignore it and it will quickly wash away.  No one will remember.  I can guarantee you that the rager probably won't remember your username the next day.  He's not focused on you, but on the anger.\n\nYes, they shouldn't be playing a competitive game, but that's for Riot to act on.  For you, ignore, finish the game, report and move on.  The fact that you keep playing \"yes but,\" with me shows that you allows the troll to win.  You are obsessing over it to the point that I'd almost recommend that you never play LoL again.  You need to be able to deal with this kind of situation without allowing it to rule your life.  Trust me you'll run into similar situations for the rest of your life.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ferwindar","date":"2015-03-31T20:32:03.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RookPusher,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2q58g3GL,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2015-03-31T20:03:24.749+0000)\n>\n> People aren't naive, they're just selfish.
