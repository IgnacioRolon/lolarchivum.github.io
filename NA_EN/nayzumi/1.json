Diana has really high ap ratios, if she finishes an item or two she will hurt with electrocute, considering it's basically an extra passive dmg ability.\n\nDiana doesn't play well from behind. Unless the adc / support / low resist targets are at less than 3/4 health she isn't going to do enough damage to kill them, and will kill herself in an all in. You need to respect her burst damage, as you would any other assassin or burst mage. You probably made poor choices to close the game out which led to her turtling back.\n\nWas there any mr itemized against her, after she started to bring in kills, zhonyas?\nI can't find this game in your match history, so if you'd link it i'd be happy to review the kill timestamps to see what happened possibly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2017-12-22T03:43:56.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"k","replies":[]}]}
