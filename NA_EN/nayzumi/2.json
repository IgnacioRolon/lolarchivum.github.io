Wtf do you mean \"risk their position\"? His point you cited was talking about costs for power spike, not map control\n2. No shit stattik doesnt cost 5k\n3. The point of some champions is to exist next to the enemy so that they can't do anything. Have you heard of tanks? Maybe Braum? Or a golden Fiddlesticks?\n4. Of course juggernauts won't 2 shot an adc, he's just saying that adcs can be killed if left alone\n5. Juggernauts aren't just Nasus, they include Udyr, Darius and Trundle. And Nasus DOES have a tool that helps him catch adcs, its called Wither","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"makkii","date":"2018-03-19T15:44:37.160+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, from a balance perspective, it makes zero sense as to why there’s a single item build that’s more expensive than an adc’s, considering they have the highest ceiling in terms of overall power(aka scaling), this the title “carry”. imo they should reduce bruiser build gold to around 16k and move adc build gold to 17.5 along with the slated statikk nerfs that would make adc’s balanced imo","replies":[{"poster":"no to toxic","date":"2018-03-19T16:17:47.444+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":5,"body":"ahh yes one crit item is stronger then a black cleaver or trinity force on it´s own it all makes sense now god thing I lack the braincells to question this falwed argument","replies":[{"poster":"makkii","date":"2018-03-19T16:50:37.250+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=no to toxic,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dmo48zl9,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2018-03-19T16:17:47.444+0000)\n>\n> ahh yes one crit item is stronger then a black cleaver or trinity force on it´s own it all makes sense now god thing I lack the braincells to question this falwed argument\n\nOne thing you seem to be missing is that an adcs items multiply each others power whereas a bruisers does not, which must be considered when balancing\n\nAnother thing to consider is that cleaver and trinity aren’t the only items I’m talking about, imo hydra should be cheaper, steraks should be cheaper, DMP should be cheaper etc","replies":[{"poster":"no to toxic","date":"2018-03-19T18:06:16.487+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"Do you even think about the items you want to be cheaper offering more things than damage.
