I have had games where my premade and I both reported someone and only one of us got the message, so you can know for sure that you don't receive one at every chance that you could. As for what actually determines whether you get one or not I don't know.\n\nIt is also fairly difficult for you as a person to gauge whether or not a specific game should get somebody punished, the only times you can be certain are when they use zero tolerance terms or have obvious troll builds like all tears. The report system uses previous games so that they don't punish someone for having an off game, saving punishments for repeat offenders after they have built up a case.\n\nThat being said, worry less about whether or not the other players in your games are punished and more about having fun with the game and increasing your skill. The IFS works the same way whether you worry over the results or not, and it just causes you unneeded stress.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mindspeaker","date":"2017-12-09T13:01:42.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The notification system is very  rare and inconsistent.
