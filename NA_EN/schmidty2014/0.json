Well it seems today that LoL does not feel the same. I go to load up the game after champ select, and get the infamous \"Retry\" button. So ok, fine, I load up the game again, and you'll never guess what happens next. \"RETRY\". Finally make it into the game, and the remake option has come through. Being a good sport, and full well knowing I'm useless right now, I press yes. Say sorry in the chat, and exit the game. I come out and heres leaver-buster knocking at my door with five 20 minute queues. Thanks guys. Real cool.{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \r\nGuess I'll serve this out AGAIN for basically no reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T04:24:08.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically, this comes down to the fact that even though you were able to get back in for the remake, your teammates were still pretty heavily affected by those disconnections. It's not meant to really be a sort of punishment, but rather a warning that you might need to do some troubleshooting before hopping back into those queues.\n\nLet's run some quick basic troubleshooting on your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure everything is still in order. Pay close attention to how to flush your DNS and how to setup port forwarding, test it in a custom game, and let me know how it goes.","replies":[]}]}
