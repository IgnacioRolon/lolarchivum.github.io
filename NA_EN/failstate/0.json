First had this happen 2-3 days ago, and have experienced it a total of 4 times in the past few days.  Seems random, game before and game after connect perfectly fine.  I cannot comment as to if it started right after 6.16 or not, but still occurred post update to 6.17.  Have ran the hextech setting tool that was provided in another discussion of the problem, but have experienced error after running the tool.  Have restarted computer, restarted game, re-installed, still nothing.  I had found another thread discussing releasing my current IP lease and refreshing, though I cannot confirm if this fixes or not.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that these failure to connect errors (while I will admit is not the responsibility of riot, it is definatly something that I chose to have happen and have been taking action to fix), have caused me to be given queue penelties by LeaverBuster.  This is very frustrating as you can imagine.  Also hilariously over the top is sitting in a 10 minute inflated queue, and have someone be AFK, to get put out and then right back into a 10 minute inflated queue.  Feels bad man.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-25T20:13:14.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there may be some inconsistencies in your connection to the server.
