Normally it's only 15 since I live in chicago, but lately it's been reaching 500-20k even. At random times everything will freeze on my screen and it will take about a good 10 seconds (or more depending on how the ping is) for everything to catch up. And since this causes me to frequently dc and rc in the middle of a game, I've received leaver buster punishments for something that isn't my fault. My internet is also fine since I can play other games such as H1z1, Overwatch, WoW ETC. without any lag or problems. If so can someone look into this? I'm not the only one on the boards posting about a lot of lag this patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-03T03:50:53.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network routing to the server may be really messed up.
