Seems like a system similar to Diablo 3 would work really well (I say Diablo only because I have played it). When terrain is interfering with your camera it is cleanly faded out of view, and in the case of League were it&#039;s not a static piece of terrain your removing, the hit-box could be moved to the base of the now \"cut in half\" turret. This would also not interfere with Spectator. Would also make CS'ing under tower a lot easier. \n\nEdit 1: Really want to see someone from Riot respond to this, seems like most everyone is for it so far :D","replies":[{"poster":"SS Enforcer","date":"2015-05-17T19:41:09.075+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":1,"body":"I read the title as \"turtles\" instead of \"Turrets.\"\n\nTranslucent Turtles sounds like a really funky band name to be fair.","replies":[{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2015-05-18T00:12:58.394+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"new {{champion:33}} skin","replies":[{"poster":"Adstract","date":"2015-05-18T00:19:21.895+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NyX Reks,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5L4HUlzH,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-05-18T00:12:58.394+0000)\n>\n> new {{champion:33}} skin\n\nwhat?","replies":[{"poster":"ayNigerianPrince","date":"2015-05-18T02:13:00.869+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chrohma,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5L4HUlzH,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-05-18T00:19:21.895+0000)\n>\n> what?\n\nI believe that was his response to \"Translucent Turtles\"","replies":[{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2015-05-18T15:40:35.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"yeah\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-05-19T21:54:06.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok\n\nftfy","replies":[]},{"poster":"RangoTangoGanko","date":"2015-05-18T02:26:29.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dense bread","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MacDthree","date":"2015-05-18T14:12:43.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"but rammus isn't a turtle. \nhe's an armadillo","replies":[{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2015-05-18T15:41:02.096+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"yet theres a tutle ninja rammus skin","replies":[{"poster":"MacDthree","date":"2015-05-18T16:39:52.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"where? \nI see a \"Ninja Rammus\" skin...\nthat is an armadillo as a ninja... nowhere do I see it saying Turtle.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninjaboy1409","date":"2015-05-19T02:17:23.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah...","replies":[{"poster":"MacDthree","date":"2015-05-19T03:21:21.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how does this make sense at all?\ni gave an answer... lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sìel","date":"2015-05-19T00:34:25.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MacDthree,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5L4HUlzH,comment-id=00010000000100010000,timestamp=2015-05-18T16:39:52.068+0000)\n>\n> where? \n> I don't see any ninjas.\n\nFTFY","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"gafratt","date":"2015-05-18T15:10:29.694+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"*armordilo","replies":[{"poster":"Ninjaboy1409","date":"2015-05-19T21:50:29.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"armordildo*","replies":[]},{"poster":"MacDthree","date":"2015-05-18T16:40:57.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"touché","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KidSpectre","date":"2015-05-17T19:44:22.822+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can actually hide traps so that they are hidden from view (notably Caitlyn's cupcakes).
