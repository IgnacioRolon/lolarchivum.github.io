That aside the sensitivity argument I've found is often use by those who don't like being held accountable for their behavior and would rather everyone else deal with it rather than changing their own poor behavior. As for smack talking, even in pro sports it has limits, and if you cross that line such as with racial slurs, death threats and continuous toxicity then you can expect to be punished since \"it's smack talk\" is not a catch-all excuse. Why? Because at that point you're not trash talking, but talking like trash.

Would you be punched in the face for telling someone at the bar to go kill themselves? Probably.\n\n>It's not 'PC'. It doesn't take 'testicles' to hide behind a monitor and tell someone to kill themselves or call them a racial slur. In fact, I'd say it's quite the opposite.\n\nFrom [Ulanopo’s Knowledge Base](http://(http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4086541&amp;page=1#post43465401)): \n\n>**People who report are simply being oversensitive. The mute button exists for a reason.**\n\n>Let’s start with the Riot quote on this (link (http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=30696571#post30696571)):\n\n>**_Why is verbal abuse punishable if there is a mute button/language filter?_**\n_Players shouldn’t need to rely on features like the mute button or language filter to engage with other players in positive ways. When a player verbally abuses another player and forces him to use the mute button, they have already created a negative experience for that player._\n\n>Simply put, Riot says no. You can scream and cry all you want, but it is their house and their rules.\n\n>With that out of the way, I think the topic deserves some further discussion. The theory is that, if people resolved to care less, then they would be happier. I often refer to this as ”Argument from Stoicism” and I think it is a fairly weak philosophy because it places the burden on the person being expected to endure the behavior rather than the person exhibiting the behavior. “You should be able to handle it” is just a flimsy excuse for being a bully or a jerk. I have to be the bigger man so that you can do whatever you want? That hardly seems fair.\n\n>There is also the issue of how I spend my limited free time. Like most people, I am constantly required to make value judgments between the different forms of entertainment that are available to me and, let's be honest, we live in an age of nearly limitless entertainment options. If I'm having a bad day in League, I can just fire up Steam and play a whole bunch of games that don't require me to put up with someone's BS.\n\n>This is not an issue of weakness or thin-skin; it's a question of choosing activities that don't leave me feeling frustrated and angry. Too many of those experiences and I'll just find something else to do. Riot knows this.\n\nBottom line: Times are changing, and more and more people are deciding that poor behavior online is not acceptable &amp; are cracking down on it, arguably more so than in the early days of online gaming. You can either accept that and adjust your behavior or you can act like everyone else is to blame and suffer the consequences for it.
