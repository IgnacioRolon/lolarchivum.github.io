You have to just google it up before you buy the skin. Why? I can see my ward ingame models, but not my skins unless I buy said skin, or look it up? Make it so people can see the skins ingame, I refuse to buy a skin just because it's anime art looks cool.","replies":[{"poster":"H00KIE","date":"2019-04-29T21:24:33.564+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Many of you seem to be missing the point. I don't care that I can try any skin I want on the PBE. The point is that when you browse skins in the shop you should be able to see what it looks like ingame, without going on the PBE or looking it up.\n\nThis is a horrible market strategy.
