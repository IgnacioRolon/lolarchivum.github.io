The language is simple, but gives explanations for how things were made and I don&#039;t know why but just feels the same as those real life stories. The fable involving Anivia and Ornn is probably one of the closest to a real life fable about gods you could get without it actually being real. Simple language, someone is arrogant and is taught a lesson, and it over-exaggerates to a ridiculous extent. I love Ornn&#039;s story so far, and cannot wait to see what else they do with him. (And especially Anivia and the surprise Volibear reappearance.)","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2017-08-09T13:57:00.576+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This really made my morning.

Not a shaman? Not really liking that direction) It would be nice if you released his new lore.\nAlso was the narrator Ashe?","replies":[{"poster":"Placentas","date":"2017-08-09T14:15:45.591+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have to remember the story was told from the perspective of a descendant of the Heartblood clan, the clan that Voli apparently helped destroy. \n\nWe don't know Voli's side of the story; for all we know Ornn could have been a huge dick to Voli first. \n\nThe narrator was not Ashe but an elderly descendant of the heartblood/home clan.","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2017-08-09T14:20:47.155+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Placentas,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=MFTjvdJy,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-08-09T14:15:45.591+0000)\n>\n> Have to remember the story was told from the perspective of a descendant of the Heartblood clan, the clan that Voli apparently helped destroy. \n> \n> We don&#x27;t know Voli&#x27;s side of the story; for all we know Ornn could have been a huge dick to Voli first. \n> \n> The narrator was not Ashe but an elderly descendant of the heartblood/home clan.\n\nThis.

Not 100% true. It's how the storytellers who favor Ornn view the Volibear.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LordHippoman","date":"2017-08-09T20:46:39.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really enjoyed it as well, and knowing he still has a Bio and Color Story coming really just shows how much Lore has been stepping things up lately.","replies":[]}]}
