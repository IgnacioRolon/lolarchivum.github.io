There&#039;s a guy up there who said he was around since Season 3, and yadda yadda yadda. These younger League players (in terms of years played not actual age) didn&#039;t know what it was like back then. Back in the dark ages. During old League, there wasn&#039;t really a team. There were five players on a team, and five players on an enemy team. You took turns slugging it out on the jaw before one team died and you won the game. Jax used to be unkillable, with free dodge chance and the ability to dodge fountain shots with his E. Tryndamere used to be able to use his ult to survive fountain shots too. Feral Flare was basically Devourer, but even worse to go up against. I bet half you new fish don&#039;t even remember what Ninja Tabi used to do. Ever wonder why Ninja Tabi gives you armor, despite being called &quot;Ninja&quot; and having the blur effect behind them in the icon? Those used to give out dodge chance. Release date Darius was a terror to behold, Master Yi could build full AP, heal everything you dealt at him with his Meditate and then proceed to kill you anyway. LeBlanc and Kassadin both had silences, and could both lock you in a silence tornado of CC before snuffing your pathetic candle of a life out with a fucking tsunami.\n\nI get it, balance is kind of wonky right now. Actually, it is REALLY  wonky. But when you play for so long, you see the patterns and the changes. People always complain about balance, people always complain about champions they deem overpowered, people always cry over the smallest of things. This game used to be so simple. But over the years it evolved, and became more and more complex. You might as well rename the game &quot;League of Math&quot; for how much arithmetic I need to do in order to properly calculate if X amount of skills will deal Y amount damage to remove Z amount of health and win the duel. Evolution may seem bad, jarring at times. Sometimes Riot seems to throw darts at a wall of post-it notes with balance information on it blind folded and implements it into the game. But you just have to roll with the punches. Speak up against unjust things, but don&#039;t scream. A sane man on the street&#039;ll ignore you if you scream at him as apposed to talk to him. And that&#039;s just what the men and women at Riot are, people. They&#039;ll make mistakes. You have to see them not as a massed together gray blob known as &quot;Rito Game&quot; but as individual people trying their damnedest to keep a successful company running, and maintain a healthy relationship with the player base.\n\n**AUTHOR&#039;S NOTE:** This is, to be honest, an extremely heartfelt post. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;ll stop you from downvoting me or just leaving me to the abyss of obscurity, but please try to consider what I have just said. I just realized today that I have played this game for six years now. Six fucking years. I wanted to make this post to explain my feelings.

His q had a 3 second silence with a range longer than caitlyn's auto attack range. Both this ability and his e had about 280 base damage at max rank on top of 70% ap scalings. His ult also had a much lower mana cost, twice the range and a 70% AP scaling. All lil Ethy had to do was mash q in lane and he would terminate anything that showed up on the other side of midlane and then he could easily take over the game by one-shotting everything with his absurd AP burst. His entire match history would soon be entirely full of kassawin victories. \n\nRemember children, this was a time when there were actual new players and the smog of toxic smurfs hadn't choked them all out yet. The other noobs didn't stand a chance. Eventually, pro players also realized what an op monster kassadin was, and kassadin reached one of the highest ban rates of any champion in soloq, and a basically 100% pick ban in pro play. This went on for over a year.\n\nLeague is not the most balanced it ever has been right now, but it far from its worst. Riot is also more responsive to op champs than ever before. Increasing levels of competition at the highest level cause a hyper awareness of the meta. Additionally, more people are continually exploiting smaller and smaller advantages. Now, simply giving a few free things here and there can send a champion from relative obscurity to being a must ban.\n\nPersonally I'd say the balance teams only big mistake were the juggernauts. Skarner and Mordekaiser are worse off then when they started while Garen and Darius are basically the same. The worst part is any idiot could have told you that patch was completely asinine (Yup I'm still bitter about Morde). Other than that they have basically only improved at their jobs since the beginning. And their job is getting harder. It took a long time for a champ as insane as Kassadin to be discovered en masse. Now OP champs are discovered overnight. \n\nI'd personally guess Riot is trying to make champions generally stronger rather the playing nerf whackamole with every new power pick, and things might take some time to get worked out. Some champions are ALWAYS going to be stronger than others. At this point what makes one champ better than another will soon come down to only minutiae. My only apprehension is that I think Riot introduces new variables to quickly which is making getting the game as balanced as everyone would like it basically impossible. This is one things that Dota has generally done better, but I don't really want to get into league Dota comparisons right now.\n\nBasically I'm agreeing with the OP and trying to pitch in with a little perspective.","replies":[{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2016-02-14T17:18:53.768+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":">This went on for over a year.\n\nNow this is an interesting statement. It's true, I was there for it as well. And if Riot's balance team back then had two brain cells to rub together, it wouldn't have lasted one month; let alone one year. This was back when if a champion was a serious problem the standard operating procedure was to gut the living hell out of them, leave them there for a couple years, then put them on a rework list that only kept getting longer.\nHell, Yorick is still on that same list today.\n\nBut for some reason, despite him singlehandedly making all games have five bans for an entire season, Kass wasn't meaningfully touched. That's not ignorance at that point, that's neglect. And Kass was only the worst example, not the only one. Nid back then used to take off 3/4s of a squishies health with one Q, from the fog of war, with a hitbox the size of a Morgana Q. Renekton ruled top lane with an iron fist, to the point where Riot attempted to buff other top laners up to the \"Renekton bar\", and failed miserably. Lee was the king of the jungle, but I'm tempted not to count that since Lee is the king of the jungle every season (especially when Worlds is close).\n\nRiot nowadays isn't neglectful for the most part. They're so much quicker at bringing things down to a reasonable level today then back then. There are a few exceptions like GP, but at least they haven't been fucking things up for a year or more.\n\nNo, current Riot's balance problems are more quantity over quality. Back then we had a handful of really powerful champs lording over everyone else. Nowadays we have several handfuls of slightly less powerful champs lording over everyone else. It's certainly more diverse, I'll say that. Instead of having three champs being very powerful top lane, now we have six or seven to choose from.\n\nSo... progress? A step maybe not in the right direction, but sort of diagonally towards it? Baby steps where the baby got dizzy and sort of veered off to the left? Either way it's certainly better now than it once was, but it's still far from where it should be.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2016-02-14T10:04:40.032+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Screaming?\nOh, no, no, this is technically chanting now.\n\nhttp://img.pandawhale.com/77535-wrestler-NO-NO-NO-gif-WWF-Imgu-cLym.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-02-14T09:04:09.311+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Here is what happened, one thread got a lot of attention for complaining about the balance team, it even got Red responses.

They'll nerf a low play rate champ because of a Keystone (Swain) yet they turn around a buff a champion that synergies really well with updated items (Xin).

I personally don't feel like Riot are doing a terrible job at the overall design, but perhaps they could improve their balancing. In the end, the ultimate goal of League's balance [isn't actually to make it balanced, but to keep it as fair as possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e31OSVZF77w).\n_\nEDIT: After watching the video I'm linking, I feel like I need to disclaim that certain details of the video concerning LoL are dated. Not that you couldn't still find elements of cyclical imbalance in the League, but a big part of its fun factor is erased by the mainstream nature of modern LoL. The part I want to highlight is from 0:26 to 4:16._","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-02-14T17:59:22.172+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It may have been frustrating for assassins and the like, but you fail to see the most important thing here.\n\nAssassins by design aren't suppose to jump on tanks.\n\nThe fact they can is a sign of imbalancement.","replies":[{"poster":"Gorgiolio","date":"2016-02-14T18:54:35.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But cinderhulk tanks were suppose to be able to jump on anyone and kill them themselves?

Those guys created a playable Sub-Class but only had success in experienced hands. \nMost players considered LB (WITH HER SILENCE!) or Talon weak, because their lack of Teamfighting potential. (And they were completely fine at that point. I played LB regulary because she was fun.)\n\nWhy? You may ask. Because in older days, we had a ton of targeted abilities to elimiated squishy melees with ease when they've made a mistake. Today, you have to throw so much on a single squishy without any guarante for a kill for the sake of 'counterplay'. (Fun thing.. those Assassins them selfe tend to lack this holy counterplay... so much that our only option left is to counterbuild them....)\n\nTo make thing clear:\n\n**I'm sad that League lost alot of its 'strategic' aspects and gained alot of 'action and reaction' aspects - some may like it, I as Chess and RTS-Player definately dont - sorry**","replies":[{"poster":"cuddlykitten4","date":"2016-02-14T16:26:54.785+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wait.....you are under the impresion that Talon and LB used to be weak?

There were a few of us that recognised the cheese for what it was and spoke out, but we were downvoted into oblivion and told to 'get gud' and 'lurn2dodgem8'.  \n\nMy friend mained Talon in those days, and I played a lot of immobile mages.  I saw my friend wreck face with Talon, regardless of who/what he was against, and I was so very glad that he was on my team.  Even back then, Viktor was my most-played champion and LBs had a field day against me.  It was a nightmare and there was nothing I could do.  In-game I am normally a very positive person, with a 'we can still win this' attitude.  Fighting LeBlanc made me want to surrender five minutes into the game.  \n\nIn those days Zed was also considered to be one of the weakest assassins, and looking back I don't really disagree.  Sure, he was annoying, but I'd have much rather fought a team of Zeds 1v5 than fight even one LeBlanc back then.","replies":[{"poster":"Odinakos","date":"2016-02-14T17:27:38.342+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Confirming that LB has been considered UP for long periods even with silence.
