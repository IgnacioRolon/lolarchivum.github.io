I ordered Mechs vs Minions last week on Oct 13th, first shipment, and it still says pending on my account. I've attempted to email them multiple times but no response.

Since you've already submitted a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), I recommend waiting for a billing specialist to get back to you.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Eliseth","date":"2016-10-21T15:41:29.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The website said it would take 1-2 business days to ship the order, it's been 6 and the order hasn't shipped. I would have no problem with this if I had some communication from someone about the order.
