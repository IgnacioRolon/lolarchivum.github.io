There are no prior warnings to the crash coming. There is no ping spike, no FPS drop, no gitter, no nothing to warn that it is coming. I will be playing just fine one second, and the next, the game just shuts out - equivalent to if I had used CMD+Q to quit the game.\n\nFor the first few weeks after upgrading, this would occasionally trigger just a Bug Splat. Starting this last patch, is it now consistently triggering both Bug Splat and Mac OS Crash Reporting.\n\nEach time, the client itself (new shiny icon, out of game area) stays up and running without issue. It is only the game section (old blue square icon, separate on the doc if you ALT+TAB out of the game screen) that closes itself out. It takes about 15-20 seconds for the game to realize I've disconnected, sometimes longer.\n\nETA: It also only does it one time per game - with the exception of having it crash twice in a row one game (but hasn't done that again, and never did it before).\n\nOne thing to note is that I have the option set to \"override OS hotkeys\" (something to that equivalent) so that I can use CMD+Q, CMD+W etc to quick upgrade abilities mid fight. Before High Sierra, this was never an issue though - I've been playing with this setting for several months, and only upgraded about a month ago. I do not believe that this is the issue as the crash is not consistent on \"leveling up\", though it does happen the most during trading in game.\n\nThere is also a random jitter in the game that, when it happens, I know the game will NOT crash. So it seems like possibly a process or resource issue that High Sierra might be trying to take care of (IE, a perceived memory leak that it tries to shut down?). If it can solve the problem, it doesn't crash the game (but I see the tiny skip while it rights itself), if it can't, then the game is closed. That's what it feels like (not necessarily what it might be). It also happens at random times throughout the first part of the game but I've never had it happen past somewhere around the 10-15 minute mark. It's always either within the first few trades in lane (where it usually gets me killed), or if I don't play aggressive, after a few waves (again, get caught just standing in lane before it realizes I've DCed). It has happened 1 time while leashing for the jungle (I took the buff by accident because it kept autoing). And it happened 1 time in ARAM almost immediately after loading in. But those two times seem to be special cases.\n\nIs this a known issue? I see issues with High Sierra being posted, but I don't seem to really fit most of those scenarios as I don't have any other issues besides the game just deciding to close itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-08T18:11:07.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a really strange case, I'm mostly concerned of the OS crashing beyond the bugsplat.
