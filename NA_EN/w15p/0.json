Even if one was to master every champion, it would hardly make a dent in a veterans blue essence stockpile.\n\nThe blue essence emporium in the grand scheme of things is pretty meh. Generally one picks one icon and sticks with it, with a rare breed seeking to catch em all. Rendering almost all of what is on offer, a real downer. The essence discounts are irrelevant to people with this much essence, rendering name change, rune pages, XP boosts.\nThe one saving grace is the urfwick skin. However it is definitely expensive essence wise (despite buying almost nothing with blue essence in years, I'm sitting at around 50K) and isn't that exciting in the grand scheme of things.\n\nThis leaves allot of people with zero progression outside of LP if they play ranked at all unfortunately","replies":[{"poster":"Boo Koo God","date":"2019-04-19T18:10:00.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kind brings to question  why do we even need it or want it? . honestly, I think more people play for ranking than in game currency that imo feels useless outside of name changes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tactlesschaos","date":"2019-10-24T06:12:10.219+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=W15P,realm=NA,application-id=okOuNvuT,discussion-id=gIVqz3Fx,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-04-19T01:56:38.179+0000)\n>\n> So I've been playing since season 2.
