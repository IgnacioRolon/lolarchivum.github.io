Predict 3 hours - actually is 6.  Predict 24 hours - actually is 12.  The estimate on where you are in the queue and how long you have to wait is just going to be wildly wrong.\n\nA big factor involved is that there's a cap of how many they can have logged in and people need to log out to make space, so at the end you'll see your position hit 1 then bounce back to 40.  You're actually at 1 or close and ready to login, but there's no space on the server.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RodionS","date":"2019-06-30T20:36:52.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"15 min for me, but I think sheduler is a liar)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yacyk","date":"2019-06-30T19:47:58.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gutkeeper","date":"2019-06-30T19:42:22.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last day off before work and this happens, there is no god!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SabotageMD2","date":"2019-06-30T19:41:52.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can riot pls give more info about it ?{{champion:25}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"TruthBring3R","date":"2019-06-30T19:36:40.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://imgur.com/a/ouTHHaM\n\nApprox. waiting time: 66h 48mins\n\nGuess Im going to sleep lul.
