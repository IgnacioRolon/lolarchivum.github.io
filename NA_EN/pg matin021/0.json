Learn the chess peices and look for level 2s early on. Based upon what you get you can then flow into another comp. If your teamcomp sucks just get a draven or elementals later on and they will carry you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nea104","date":"2019-06-29T20:43:53.178+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Made in Rito, what did you expect?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Light of Madness","date":"2019-06-30T05:54:55.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One game one guy had 5 3 start champions at the end of the matche, I was trying to have one simple tristana","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deathhawk888","date":"2019-06-30T03:42:19.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to know true BS, Iâ€™ve gotten a Tier 2 Rageblade Vayne from just the minion waves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"yay pink","date":"2019-06-30T14:14:06.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"All these posts about RNG and items....
