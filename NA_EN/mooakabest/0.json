I have tried eveyrthing that I have read. From unistalling and reinstalling about a million times. Also tried using Hexatech repair but that did nothing. I really need a solution because what's r%%%%%ed is that I can log in into my other account and garena works completely fine. Please Riot fix your godamm bugy client. This is not the first bug but this is the worst. I can't do anything. Even though my account is still crap I had memories playing with my friends and this will just really be a bummer. Lot's of people are having the same problem so please Riot update ur client or upload another patch that fixes this.\r\n\r\n> **FIX THIS RIOT**","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-04T17:52:25.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your connection is blocking you from reaching the authentication server.
