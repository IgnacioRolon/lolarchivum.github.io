I used to play with 270-280 ping which was fine by me since I am playing in the American servers from Asia. But after patch 7.22 or the one where you guys introduced \"blue essence\" which made people who did not want to waste a single penny on champions to just spending a lot of money to buying champions. **CHAMPIONS.** not **SKINS. BUT CHAMPIONS.** But thats another topic. So after that update I could play about 2 or 3 games without lag then my ping was higher than normal. It was above 300ms which was unplayable for me, So anything below 300ms is fine by me. So I have tried almost everything and I wonder what was your suggestion. \r\n\r\nBTW, I can play on Garena servers just fine with normal ping. Is it maybe because of inteference with the files from Garena to NA account, Plis gimme soliution Riot so I can play more League on NA servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-07T01:22:00.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That high ping you're getting is probably just due to the physical distance your connection has to travel to reach the NA servers. It's best to play in your home region or one that's closest to avoid unnecessary lag like this. \n\nIf NA is the only region you're interested in playing on, I'd suggest only using ethernet (wired) for the best connection, but also make sure you've updated your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as well.","replies":[]}]}
