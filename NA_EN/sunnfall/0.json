So far we have Varus and Kennen, how about we add Zed, Master Yi and Lucian to Arctic Ops, Just throwing it out there and would love to hear other ideas for champs in this squad and pictures if you got them! \r\n\r\nI also have some images found online but other fans who support this concept.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-07-20T04:04:02.712+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nautilus?
