Let me know if that helps!\n\nHi Porocles. Thanks for assisting me regarding my fps issues in game. Just for a bit more information I'll try out the FPS guide you have mentioned me and this FPS issue has just started like last week and before that I was having no problems in game even with max graphic settings. But now whats happening is that this problem has now started occurring in game too while I'm playing and not just with recording. By the way I am using a mac book pro 13inch (mid 2012).","replies":[]}]}]}
