I am not being able to launch both the alpha and the legacy client. While launching the alpha client it told me that \"they have restored this installation to an older version of league of legends. Now we will try to patch it up to the latest version\" this followed by \"there was a problem patching league of legends. We'll restore a backup version and try updating after you restart the patcher\". I restarted but it showed me the same messages again and again. Then I thought of launching through the legacy client and said \"unspecified error occurred please check the logs for more info\". I have no idea whats happening and the weird part is I tried installing the whole game from scratch but it showed the same exact message that it showed me in the legacy client.\r\n\r\nAlso I cannot send the HRT log files in the ticket since it tells me 20 megabytes is the largest file one can send thus hindering the tech support to understand where the problem is occurring.\r\n\r\nBy the way I am using a Macbook Pro Sierra. Help would be greatly appreciated {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Hugmeharder","date":"2017-01-22T03:53:37.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Porocles thanks for attending to my comment. I solved it but I had to factory reset my mac and only then I was able to pass through the \"error\" message. I don't know what caused the error to come again but it is kinda scary if this happens again and I have to factory reset mac again in the future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkest Laugh","date":"2017-01-20T10:40:44.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Download the Hextech Repair Tool and make it do a clean uninstall and reinstall.\n\nThat's what I recommend, at least.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-21T00:07:37.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The HRT won't be able to perform a solid repair if he's already installed the updated client, since it's currently most compatible with the legacy version.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkest Laugh","date":"2017-01-21T07:28:18.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, okay. I didn't know that. I haven't used it in some time though, so yeah that's good to know. Does that mean there might be a new HRT some day?
