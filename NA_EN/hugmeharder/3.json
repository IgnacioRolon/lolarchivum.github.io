I get a screen saying that \"we have restored an older version of league of legends. Now we will try to patch up the latest version\" and then it says \"there was a problem patching league of legends, we have restored a backup version and try updating again after a restart\" but after restarting these 2 messages popup again and it continues in loops.\r\n\r\nThis is happening to me on 19th January, 2017 and it was working fine on 18th January, 2017 which was just yesterday. I will also attach 2 screenshots of the messages.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-20T04:41:15.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you continue to experience these same issues if you launch League from the **lol.launcher.admin.exe** file as admin (right-click, *run as administrator*) within your install directory?

I tried sending the HRT logs in the support ticket but it told me that 20 megabits is the maximum size one can send.
