I don't know what to do. I really need to secure my account but I can't. I have already submitted a ticket to riot but that person is still logging in my account and the worst part is he's used rp and ip to buy items from the market.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"Hugmeharder","date":"2016-12-08T11:29:21.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Targon's Blade it has been 5 days since I last heard from riot it would be helpful if one could update me on the status in which my ticket is since I'm right now lost whether it reached them or not. The ticket number is #24528516 regarding an unauthorised login. Also while sending a recovery ticket to riot it said I have to remain logged out but how am I supposed to know when an account specialist contacted me if i'm supposed to stay logged out of the riot support website. The email verified with my account is not accessible to me thus the only communication between me and them is through the support website.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-05T05:55:25.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We cannot address these types of situations on the boards, but putting in a support ticket was definitely the best move to make in this situation.

I can't change the password for my account since the email address with my account has been deactivated. I did mention though that if they could send me a verification code on my current email address It would be helpful so that in the future I can change the password of my account.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-05T21:27:22.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, this is a fairly common occurrence, so the recovery specialist you're assigned will know just the thing to do!\n\nSit tight and we'll get back to you in your ticket. ^.^","replies":[]}]}]}]}
