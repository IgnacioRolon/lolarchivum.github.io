I would be grateful if you could update me on the status of my ticket number which is #24528516.

Looking into this for you, it looks like the account team is waiting for an account recovery form to be filled out.  You'll want to do this by logging out of your support account and going directly to the [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416).  You can also do that via Incognito mode to make sure you're signed off.  We'll respond back as soon as we can!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
