I sent a ticket to riot on 3rd December, 2016 regarding an unauthorised access on my account and its already been 5 days. After looking through the forums some people had mentioned they had to answer questions regarding their account for proving that your the member. I clicked on sending an account recovery ticket to them but it said I have to stay logged out of their website for security reasons and I got no option to fill out those details. Will riot send me a reply in which I have to fill them out or I just missed something?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-09T05:32:32.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your tickets and it seems you need to first ensure you're **logged out** of your account from the [Riot Support site](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) (Be sure it says *Sign In* at the top-right of the page.
