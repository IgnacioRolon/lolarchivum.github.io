I&#039;m a relatively new player, I&#039;m S4, started playing season 7, and don&#039;t have all the champs I want, so I was excited to  see I could get two free champions from the event, but HOLY MOTHER OF GOD. Why offer a reward for new players, when the event is meant for a team of five fakers? What&#039;s worse is, i don&#039;t play mid or adc, and I already got my win on a utility champ (Got backpacked as soraka), so it&#039;s even more impossible for me to make progress towards getting the free champs. I just feel like, if you want to make an insanely difficult PvE event, that&#039;s fine, but why taunt new players with Free champions, that you KNOW we&#039;ll never get, and veteran players don't need.","replies":[]}
