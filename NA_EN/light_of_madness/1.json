I remember playing velkoz when you didn’t even care about that passive, you just build magic pen and operated around your base damages. \n\nI mean, I do enjoy velkoz as he is now, but I definitely get the feeling that he is perhaps a little too well rounded at _everything_. Poke? Check. Burst? Check. Dps? Check. Squishy killing? Check. Tank shredding? Check. CC? Check. Waveclear? Check. High high range? Check. Low mana costs? Check. The only thing he lacks is mobility.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RegardsKitty","date":"2019-11-05T14:05:03.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DalekZec,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iFUeAiAa,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-11-04T19:12:19.181+0000)\n>\n> As a Vel'Koz main, how about...\n> NO.\n\nDisgusting champion","replies":[{"poster":"DalekZec","date":"2019-11-05T15:24:58.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RegardsKitty,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iFUeAiAa,comment-id=00010002,timestamp=2019-11-05T14:05:03.499+0000)\n>\n> Disgusting champion\n\n{{champion:84}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:555}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:498}} \n\nDisgusting my ass.\nA glass cannon who has to land all 3 abilities to be able to deal true damage.\nVel'Koz is one of the most fair champs in this game.","replies":[{"poster":"RegardsKitty","date":"2019-11-05T17:52:28.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DalekZec,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iFUeAiAa,comment-id=000100020000,timestamp=2019-11-05T15:24:58.154+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:84}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:555}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:498}} \n> \n> Disgusting my ass.\n> A glass cannon who has to land all 3 abilities to be able to deal true damage.\n> Vel'Koz is one of the most fair champs in this game.\n\nLand all three abilities, more like hit one, then just throw the rest because he has a shitload of CC and you can't miss his spells.\n\nAlso his ultimate does true damage and slows you so you can't avoid it.

Also, his ulti applies his passive overtime, so not hitting all 3 abilities doesn't mean you won't deal true damage. Disgusting champion.\n\nAlso I like how you upvote your own posts with an alternate account.","replies":[{"poster":"DalekZec","date":"2019-11-05T21:11:50.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RegardsKitty,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iFUeAiAa,comment-id=000100020000000100000000,timestamp=2019-11-05T19:54:57.096+0000)\n>\n> 3 ability hits to proc the true damage, in case you didn't understand, hitting one CC spell means you get to hit the rest for free unless you have the intelligence of a potato.

Disgusting champion.\n> \n> Also I like how you upvote your own posts with an alternate account.\n\nYou were talking about Vel's ulti saying it only does true damage and also said you only need 1 spell to proc the passive. Next time think before you speak.\nFine then. Here's where my specialty comes in with that squid.\nVel'Koz's passive requires him to land 3 abilities to proc his true damage and have the enemy \"researched\" so that his ulti can be more deadly. Its early game damage isn't that much until he gains enough AP in the mid game all the way to late game.\nHis Q set cast is slow af but 2nd cast it's fast but due to its 1st travel it's often easy to dodge its 2nd cast (that's if you're aiming geometrically). And slows at a decent amount.\nHis w is 2 wave ability. 1st wave explosion does little damage while 2nd wave explosion does increased damage but can be easily dodged.\nHis e is a short knock up, pretty low ranged compared to his Q and W and to get to its range is often a big danger for Vel'Koz.\nHis ulti is a magic damage laser that slows but not compared to his Q. It's a scary ulti but not always too threatening unless the passive has been proced which makes the ulti from magic into a true damage.\n\nVel'Koz requires to land combos upon combos to dish out his damage. Usually the ideal method for many vel players is landing Q 1st in order to get an easy access to landing the e and W (or 2nd wave of the w). While the number of combos for Vel'Koz are quite at a decent amount, it's easier said than done to land the combos ESPECIALLY how easily they can be dodged from either vision, utility, mobility or even a mistake like wrong timing.\n\nThat's why it's not often recommended to simply ulti in without passive proc (unless fed) and Vel'Koz needs a ton of AP to be deadly. The main elements that makes Vel'Koz a fair champ is he lacks mobility and is a glass cannon and high mobility champions are his worst nightmare. Melees can melt him if they get in range and his ulti can be disrupted by cc.\nTo the end of the point, his true damage is part of his identity as a champion since he is literally researching his enemy to find out their weaknesses and once he does, he knows how to hurt them. Research goes to his passive and exposed weakness to his advantage goes to his ulti, that's lore wise as well as gameplay wise.\n\n\"Also I like how you upvote your own posts with an alternate account.\"\nSorry to disappoint you but no. I'm not low to do such a thing to begin with. My best guess is ImTheJuggernauty who is upvoting.\nAnd on the other side, upvotes doesn't mean Jack shit anyway. It's the least of my concern.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
