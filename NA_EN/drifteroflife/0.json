Now I normally don&#039;t post, but the concept&#039;s been gnawing at me for quite some time, so here goes(hope you guys like it)\r\n\r\nSo I&#039;ll keep it really simple. Here&#039;s the concept...or rather the stream of consciousness that lead up to the idea. So we all know about Kassadin and his infamous rift walk right? A couple years back the balancing department at Riot probably had a wild ride trying to bring this guys numbers in line. From what I understood he had far too much mobility for all the damage he packed. His rift walk meant he could engage, silence, melt a squishy and then be out of the fight before anyone had any say. Now tangentially this got me wondering about what I&#039;ll dub &quot;rhythm of movement&quot;. What I mean by that is that someone like Kassadin would move around in a pretty standard way, then when he rift steps he gets a big jump in distance travelled per time. If you were to graph it it&#039;d look something like a heart beat (if you follow my meaning). \r\n\r\nAs another quick example I&#039;ll use Fizz&#039;s Playful trickster, which would go something like *move* *pause* *move*. \r\n\r\nSo I thought to myself &quot;You know Riot has no champions that really mix up the formula for how they move around the map&quot; (and by this I mean the simple Right click move to point mechanic, not something like Rek&#039;sai&#039;s ult or a dash of some sort). So wouldn&#039;t it be cool if there was a champion that really messed with arguably the simplest mechanic (gameplay wise) in the game. His *only* method of movement would be a staccato-like rhythm similar to how Fizz&#039;s E works, or how Kassadin Riftwalks.\r\n\r\nThematically I envisioned it like a Fizz/Wukong/Shaco mix, where you have a playful kinda dude who&#039;s always balancing on the tip of his pole, with a eye locked on the horizon, shielding his eyes from the sun, maybe a red scarf fluttering in the wind.\r\nHe&#039;d move in giant steps with moderate pauses in between, it&#039;d be up to balance if he was untargetable during these steps or not. Walls and boundaries mean nothing to him, but the balances comes in with the fact that he&#039;ll always be stationary for a few moments after his last leap, making him a a sitting duck. Positioning and teamwork would be the name of this guys game.\r\n\r\nSo here&#039;s where you guys come in: What kind of abilities does this guy have? Is he a control mage? Is he a disruptor? Hell, is he a she?\r\nHell, some like him would be a sitting duck, so maybe reward him for eating champion cc with a shield like sivir&#039;s etc...\r\nLemme know in the comments and let&#039;s get this idea some traction.\r\n\r\nPEACE!\r\n\r\n...As a side note, if any Rioter(s) read this, I&#039;d really appreciate any feedback on whether or not this is a workable idea that you guys would incorporate into any champions at a later date.","replies":[{"poster":"hipopotosaur","date":"2016-06-07T12:21:26.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"eh in not sure about the whole movement thing, its an interesting idea but would it be an ability or would his walk cycle just be interupted every few seconds? It seems like he wold have to be played jg bc if he was in lane he would have little to no chance of dodgeing anything. i also seems you would need to cordinate teamfights around him since he couldent move into one fast enough.\none thing i can thnk of is giving him 1 or even 2 dash abilities, although he would get completely shut down by {{champion:78}}  :/","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-07T19:35:24.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he's saying it would work like a dash ability.  It's much faster during the motion but with pauses in between the hops.\n\nI could actually see it working in lane, as you just stand still until they throw a skillshot and then hop to the side.  Since it is faster, you may be able to completely dodge abilities, without having to hope that they aim slightly off.\n\nWouldn't Kalista already be shut down by Poppy (if the dash thing stops it)?  If so, then it clearly isn't a major issue in champion design.","replies":[{"poster":"hipopotosaur","date":"2016-06-08T20:43:25.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i suppose, that could actually work, it would be funny to see him get an aa mechanic like kalistas, like he aa's by hopping into them w his stick and bouncing back down in a direction.","replies":[{"poster":"hipopotosaur","date":"2016-06-08T20:57:49.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also was thinking about some ideas yesterday and i thought maybe he could have part of his passive or it could be one of his active effects. basicly he just doesnt activate traps when he steps on them or \"hops\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
