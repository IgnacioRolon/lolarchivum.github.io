With no mention of Mordekaiser except for a couple bugfixes. To be blunt, I'm disappointed; both in the lack of consistent communication and reliable work. \n\nLets back up to xerath & sona for a moment; in their primes he was an artillery mage wielding lightning, and she as a sonic team buffer; their reworks drastically changed their gameplay, but retained their styles (for the most part anyway). Xerath was changed to be more of a run&gun distance mage with energy blasts, but with less unique utility; loosing his self rooting ability of range increase, for just a copy of viegar's dark matter. Sona still buffs teams with her instrument (drawing a blank what its called), but with the removal of nearly every aura item in the game, she needs to piggy back her teammates to continually provide their boosts. They kept most of their animations (except xerath's ult and sona's E), but still play similar to how they used to despite the overhaul. And are overall improvements, with some tweaking after being under-balanced.  Good (though tense) examples of communication and work.\n\nTo describe Mordekaiser's rework so far, a trainwreck; the riot thread posted for feedback in the pbe was LARGELY ignored, then when it was launched as it was, even more complaints arose! I'll start with graphics, move to gameplay, then design, and sum-up (grabs aspirin).\n\nHe's titled the \"master of metal\". Well he looks the same at least, a knee length cape that flows with dignity when he pridefully strides, and his mace even has a few more spikes. His taunts/jokes have been unchanged aside from this model polish. His ability animations have completely changed except for his ultimate. \nHis passive looks like a dull version of nautilus's shield, though it didn't have any animation beyond the health/resource bar before.\nHis Q now just glows like a sheen's passive, instead of becoming reflective; and with the loss of the jagged splash, a loss of hard worked animation. \nHis W is the most lame by comparison, it just makes a little teal circle on the ground around him before a little translucent shockwave; when it used to be a miniature hurricane of shredded scrap that would orbit around him.\nHis E was another iconic skill, now anyone within this reach smells a ghostly fart cloud; when it was a suckerpunch to them in uncomfortable places with summoned maces.\nThe R just seems more unreliable with the dragon, and melee ghosts repeatedly just standing still. \n\nHow about his playstyle? He used to be a feast or famine magic bruiser. Not particularly unique with rumble and kassadin (after his rework) around; but anyway nearly every STAT got nerfed SIGNIFICANTLY (most notably, health was cut down to 1/4 of it's original value, and speed severely lowered for a melee without cc).\nHis passive shielding now scales by 25% of MAX health, generates at 25% of damage dealt, and decays observably faster than before though to a minimum value of 1/4; his shield used to scale by level, charge by 35% of damage dealth, and drain slowly but entirely.\nHis Q is now an auto attack buff, gaining damage by a factor of two for each consecutive hit, nothing more nothing less, usually less as it has a painfully small window to do so. It's previous function was that it would do double damage if the target was isolated, but in a crowd would damage bystanders for half, like the shiv's passive. \n(sigh) The W now gives him full xp for any creeps he kills, but it's buff can only be cast on allied champions, only gives them movement when running TOWARDS eachother, ONLY damages when they're within MELEE RANGE of eachother, and finally only heals a small fraction of his ability power (~1/5). His W used to be a shield providing him and his ally (minion and champion alike) bonus magic resistance & armor, while having a small dot (damage over time) to anyone within melee range of him or his ally. \nHis E is still a small cone of damage, though it feels smaller since they bugfixed the 'damaged during cast animation' that gave him an advantage against so many hyper-mobile champions (kaslista, fizz, yasou, ext). It just felt like it had more reliable reach before this bugfix, but is functionally the same, aside from having it's damage halved.\nHis R, the other HUMONGOUS power spike packed into his kit with these changes; if he damages dragon before it dies, he gains it as a puppet regardless who killed it, and whether or not the ghost is dragon or an enemy champion he controls it for 75 seconds, however the ghost receives negligible bonuses and has shorter cast range now to compensate. His ultimate used to have higher though different bonuses (ap/ad switching between several patches), and only lasted 30 seconds. \n\nI'm an engineer, not a game designer, so I hope you've had popcorn or pretzels. Alright, now to combine the two previous paragraphs; his rework was labeled to be a meta-shifter. I'm all-for changing the meta! But don't ruin classic champions to do so, that's what new champions are for!\nHe doesn't remotely look like he plays the same anymore, and his gameplay was gimped even more than it was. He never had crowd control nor any mobility to speak of, then this rework makes these problems even more glaring, before throwing him against some of the most mobile & ranged champions in the game (lucian, caitlyn, ext). Mordekaiser had always been a solo-ist style, carrying when his team falls behind by abusing the enemy's corpses when they make a mistake. Not a tin can that forces engages against the most frustrating of opponents without any initiation potential. Plenty have complained he's strong bottom lane with a powerful support such as leona or thresh; but his middle & top lane games are humiliatingly weak. \nHe feels significantly more fragile than before, no wonder why! Being flatout locked from an ability that used to provide defense by charging his shield on minions, loosing splash damage on two of his abilities, and having lower shields & movement while lacking his bonus resistances. ALL of these hindrances make him easy to get stomped by anyone with poke or burst or cc, while never having a chance to build a shield nor getting the chance to  farm. What happens when you fall behind and are prevented from farming? You become even MORE behind, and with the repeated tower nerfs, it's becoming impossible for him to make a comeback. \n\nHe's devolved into a pitiful feast or famine champ that's borderline unplayable without your team building around you; he's not fun to play anymore, he's not reminiscent of his glory days at all either. Try playing him teambuilder now? People either flame you for being a troll, kick you because they think you'll cost them the game. How about hosting a blindpick? Players dodge so fast, its like you stole the newest champion they bought by autolocking. He's weak to fight by himself, but powerful in teamfights only when noone pays attention to him. \nIt's insulting how disgraceful riot has handled this (so far), the guy in charge of the rework refuses to acknowledge any feedback despite ASKING us in the first place. While the other employees that've been notified give similar bureaucratic answers (as the other above quote) to cover their own hide. Neither an I a psychologist, but I speculate this willfully repeated denial & ignorance is what's causing the community to grind it's own gears into such hostility; games are more toxic than ever! Considering their concerns are often asked of, but hardly carried out, it's no wonder they have trust issues even when you guys keep your word. \nRare is it to see a player that actually keeps the summoner's code, and it's disappointing their numbers are dwindling, but not as surprising anymore. They either join the ranks of hatred and feed the system, or abandon the game; or by the off chance they don't give in to either, they make a difference, just hope enough of these small differences can push down this barrier of mutual spite. And we all get to return to league's cooperative (devs & players) enjoyment like it was when it started . . .","replies":[]},{"poster":"DanLikesBacon","date":"2015-08-11T10:43:46.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"aww does that mean Skarner won't come out in 5.16? that's a bummer...","replies":[{"poster":"R110","date":"2015-08-11T11:45:49.020+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think you may have misread something :o\nHe's saying that in 5.17 and 5.18 there may be changes for the reworks but there is nothing about delaying the reworks to 5.17 and 5.18","replies":[{"poster":"DanLikesBacon","date":"2015-08-11T21:29:14.295+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome!

The reason Fiora's rework is going through this stage, in my opinion, is because her skills have shifted it in a direction she's never been in, and so we get a rework that appears weaker than most.\n\nFiora's old kit had inherent bonus AD and the invulnerability period which made Fiora best played as an assassin, akin to Tryndamere, Kayle, and to an extent, Poppy. The new kit, however, lost both of them, and her new ultimate actually encourages Fiora to have the tankiness to pull together a combo which provides a spectacle of utility to the team, but the usefulness drops immensely if she can't survive the burst from the enemy team.\n\nSo, in essence, her playstyle just did a 180. I wouldn't look at her loss rate as a cause for alarm. The only tweaks on Fiora I would propose would be ones to maybe shift her back toward her old role, more than anything. Similar to the Ekko mess when he came out, we don't want a powerful utility kit to suddenly get a hold of a crapton of power because we wanted to implant that power to make it an assassin. If both kits are allowed on the same champion, that champ will need clearcut disadvantages for choosing one over the other. Otherwise, like Ekko, she's just going to tank up and unleash on enemies without any need to consider adding power.","replies":[{"poster":"Taigongwang","date":"2015-08-11T20:31:16.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her playstyle did a 180, which is why people dont like it. They liked the Assassin style of Fiora, now they have another fighter whose entire job in a teamfight is to ult the person who is about to get nuked to death so the team has a massive AoE heal. She went from a high damage assassin/ADC to a high POTENTIAL damage(Damage is only good when you can proc your passive/ult consistently) tanky utility fighter. \n\nThat ult feels unsatisfying, and its where the majority of her damage is. Her passive is wonky because it forces you to play out of position for minor burst damage, and her E doesnt feel good until its max rank with a good bit of AD. She needs another good look over if Riot doesnt want to leave her as another no CC fighter that we will never see again.","replies":[{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2015-08-12T00:03:31.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What they did is followed the *Fencer* theme, and maybe too much to the extreme, but really, the theme fits almost exactly, more than it really ever did. Before, her and Master Yi were basically heat missiles that chased blatantly, and that's not what a fencer does (or really a swordsman). In this regard, I agree with the rework simply because it fits, and because her old identity was a bit of a plague on the game. It was basically Warwick's ultimate without diminished damage on attacks, without CC, but without any way to counter it whatsoever (invulnerability). She became an assassin with no counterplay, and based on the fact that she was not retaining that old status, I think what was done was plenty appropriate.\n\nThat said, I do wish Riot gave a stab at fixing her old issues. If the ultimate duration dropped with fewer, stronger strikes or something, I could see it working, possibly, but then again, it could end up ailing the game sooner rather than later. Hardly anyone even misses the old duration of Kayle's ultimate (aside from supports) because it still had several forms of counterplay, specifically CC and of course, simply running.\n\nShe had problems. I like this new iteration far better. With those in mind, I like where she went. I know plenty of people don't. So, all I can say is that if she were to slide more along the assassin way, I wouldn't mind it. I just want it to keep her theme, which I feel they hit spot-on with the rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Taigongwang","date":"2015-08-12T02:32:38.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, aside from her ult, I find her fun.
