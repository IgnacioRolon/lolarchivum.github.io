Like, Azir&#039;s soldiers I could *maybe* understand, cuz they&#039;re sorta not summoned minions (i mean, they pretty much are, but they&#039;re not targetable) but really even if they&#039;re not &#039;summoned minions&#039; they&#039;re still certainly &#039;multi-hit&#039; and should therefore be 20% on those grounds. Not to mention just for the sake of balance they shouldn&#039;t get the strong slow.\n\nBut Zyra&#039;s? By no means should they have ever gotten a 40% slow. They&#039;re clearly minions, not to mention &#039;multi-hit&#039;, yet for some reason they get to have the single-target slow. Cuz, you know, Zyra isn&#039;t already a giant middle finger to melees without getting a 40% permaslow from her plants.\n\nIdk if there&#039;s any other minions getting preferential treatment, I haven&#039;t bothered to test them all, but I have at least seen that Malzahar&#039;s are treated properly and only get the 20% slow. I haven&#039;t really noticed feeling excessively-slowed by any other minions in my games (unlike with these two, which prompted me to finally test for myself), so I&#039;m assuming these are the only two.\n\n\n\n***Addendum**: tested out with Annie/Tibbers too, 20% slow for them (well, her ult gets 40% for 1 second on the initial cast cuz the upfront burst, but it's 20% from Tibbers himself). \n\nTested out with Heimer too, his turret's regular attacks get 20%, but the beams and everything his ult turret does gets the 40%... kinda questionable as well, but at least it's more conditional for him and not 100% uptime.\n\n\n\nAlso, since a lot of people seem to misunderstand: Multi-hit =/= multi-target/aoe. Multi-hit means the skill can hit a given target multiple times with a single use, kinda like damage over time, though not necessarily with the same periodic nature. \n\nWhether or not Azir's soldiers are really summoned minions, they ARE pretty undeniably able to get multiple hits out of a single ability use, so yeah, they really ought to get the '20% for 1 second\" slow that multi-hit/dot abilities and summoned minions both are supposed to get.","replies":[{"poster":"LegacyDAP","date":"2016-08-06T10:08:44.685+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":2,"body":">  Cuz, you know, Zyra isn't already a giant middle finger to melees without getting a 40% permaslow from her plants.\n\nCorrection.

Overall, she can hit with plants from around 1800 units away, compared to Heimer being able to hit from *maybe* 700ish range.\n\nZyra's plants are generally more durable than Heimer's turrets. Because of the overly-generous health system Zyra's plants use, it doesn't matter how much damage you throw at them, all that matters is the nature of the attack/spell you're throwing their way. In general, this keeps them alive much better than the standard health of Heimer's turrets, which often leaves turrets dying to a single mage's spell or an auto or two from an ADC (often from outside their attack range, no less).\n\n\nAlso, stepping on the seeds is a poor counter at best... for some reason, Zyra's given a generous grace period during which the seeds can be triggered by her, but can't be stepped on by opponents. So she can just place them and trigger them shortly after knowing the opponent can't do a thing about them. She's even able to place them directly under the enemy's feet and trigger them without them being destroyed first.\n\n\n\nAnyway, point is, Zyra's plants are MUCH better pets than Heimer's regular turrets, in damn near every way, both on paper and in practice.
