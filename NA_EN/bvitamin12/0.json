So in my desperation I have come here. \r\n\r\nToday I was playing a game with a friend, everything was going good until someone called my house. Now, I don&#039;t know what causes it to happen but my internet shuts itself off when someone calls and I get disconnected. When I reconnect, I am left in the fountain just standing in the center of the platform. I can watch everything that is happening in real time, see the chat but I cannot send messages in the chat. I also cannot move, cast spells or buy items. It is as though I am spectating even though I am in game. It says I have reconnected but as I said, I can do nothing. \r\n\r\nI also have a problem with the reporting of issues, there is no button to report issues. I know there was at one time because I have used it in the past. I see this as a very large inconvenience. I understand it was probably removed because of grievers and trolls, but it really takes away from the assistance of those who need it. \r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that Riot will see this and take it into consideration. \r\n\r\nWith utmost digression, Bvitamin12","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-27T16:29:40.738+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nFor something like this, I would suggest filling out a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
