Stop censure! I m helping you RIOT! \"\r\n\r\n\" RIOT = Gulty for the worst community i have ever seen! \"\r\n\r\n\" Report RIOT, they smoke a lot for months \"\r\n\r\nIn these posts, i m pointing problems and i have given you arguments!\r\n\r\nPlease just answer!\r\n\r\nIf not, you just look like your community or your community looks like you (as you prefer !). I mean: a lot of your kids are not able to consider or appreciate negative (but helpful) critics !\r\n\r\nSee you, enjoy the game and do not forget to have fun (IT'S A GAME !!!).\r\n\r\nP.S.: Sry for my bad english but i think it is quite understandable.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucky Sandhu","date":"2014-08-21T06:55:12.349+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"LOL Anhil.

I never flame ! Can you give me any example (with the context of course)?\n\nI defend my point of view, yes! and i do with arguments.\nWhen i vote positively or negatively, i explain why !!! that is a responsible behavior of an adult !!! and i think it is helpful for RIOT and/or comunity. \n\ni have written short comments like \"delete X champ\" but i explain why in toher posts, to repeat would be \"spams\"\n\nYou can find in my posts agressivness. Yes, it is true. Why? Its a manner to be at the same level of some comments. I mean, when the comment means \"bullshhit !!!\" in a hidden way, i answer as an asshole !!!\n\nHowever i often provoke, it is a way among others!!! you can dont like it, i respect that but respect me too ! \n\nFor example, in this post, i said \" I **apologize** for provocations but sometimes it s the only way to be heard or read.\" Again i m explaining why and i am sincere !\n\nso don t judge me too fast.\n\ni forgot my signature, dude !\n\nSee you, enjoy the game and don t forget to have fun (IT'S A GAME !).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gypsyleeboy","date":"2014-08-20T16:29:40.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're never going to get answers if you're so impractical.\nPlease don't fill the forum with this nonsense.","replies":[{"poster":"Aquaponeyy","date":"2014-08-20T16:48:33.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Said the guy who posts this crap !!!
