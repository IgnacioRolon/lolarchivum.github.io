Everything looks fine, but then that one guy who didn't get the lane he wanted threatens to feed or afk, then picks {{champion:17}} support with revive smite and says he will feed. No one dodges, so the game starts, and he starts feeding, and the game's over before your team could surrender and you've lost 25 lp. \r\nRiot should put in a new button in champ select in ranked, where if an ally is being extremely toxic or troll, your team can vote to \"kick\" that player out of the match. By that, i mean you would click a \"vote to kick\" button under that summoner's name, then that would start a vote for your team. Then your teammates can either press \"accept\" or \"decline\" to kick that player.\r\nIf the troll receives, lets say 3/4 votes from your team, then the champ select will automatically end, and that player that was kicked would be counted as a dodge. (so it was just as if that troll was forced to dodge due to his teammates) \r\nI believe that this would help keep ranked more organized, since in my last ranked game I lost 20 lp due to a troll. Also i don't think this is necessary for normal play, since players should have some freedom in normals since it doesn't count. But I do strongly believe that this \"vote to kick\" in ranked would benefit many sportsmanlike players. \r\nThis was just a thought i had in mine, comment whether you think riot should implement this.","replies":[{"poster":"Hoi Im Temmo","date":"2014-11-07T21:36:46.750+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have suggested this over in the pbe forums - one problem we found is how do you do you keep people from being kicked for other reasons?\n\nExamples:\n\n1) You look up the players on your team, and find one is on 6 game losing streak. You are on your last game for promos to gold. You would kick him, right?\n\n2) Player picks a champion most of the team feels is weak: (say Teemo in top) - your team kicks them.\n\n3) etc.\n\nIts one thing to kick a troll - and EVERYONE would want the ability to do it....but we need to prevent it from being abused as well.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2014-11-07T21:52:14.769+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plus, this gives duo-queue an insane amount of power in champ select.

There's many problems that would come up with that. \n\nFirst off, if you were to have a kick voting option in the draft type set up that would just pretty much send everyone back into a search queue wouldn't it? These modes aren't set up like the way team builder is, where we have little sections that can drop off/on and find different teams/team mates.\n\nSecond, there's too many ways people might abuse it. Like as an exmaple of what someone said before, but in a different take on the matter, say someone is on a losing streak; what gives us the right to decide whether they should stay in the game or not?  Or what if you don't like someone's name? or something stupid like that... are you gonna try to vote them out? There's many childish and uncalled for reasons people could come up with that would totally abuse the idea.\n\nEssentially, you'd be making \"getting into a game\" much much longer if this were the case.","replies":[{"poster":"BiZeBoY","date":"2014-12-28T09:56:33.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no make it to where the team has to agree to fight a 4v5 bc of it","replies":[]},{"poster":"dab1z","date":"2014-12-24T00:46:03.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that the abuse of the feature would be a valid concern, but i think there could be steps to remedy that. It would have to mature over time like any other abusable feature added to a game. Taking a first crack at this, here is an example of how i imagine it could be implemented...\n\nWhen a player is successfully kicked from a game, they have the option to report whether or not they were wrongfully kicked. A legitamite report would result in the players who voted for the kick being negatively affected and perhaps losing the ability to vote kick, or something more appropriate. Maybe the negative affect would apply after a certain number of contested kicks(Hopefully reviewed). I think that should also mean that the person being kicked would not be banned and counted as a dodge, but after a certain number of uncontested kicks, they may get banned. \n\nThe issue here is that if you join a game with a toxic player, the next 30+ minutes of this game is going to be a bad experience for you and the others in the game and there is no way around that unless you dodge will result in negatively affecting you, but not the offending player.","replies":[{"poster":"BiZeBoY","date":"2014-12-28T09:57:19.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"everyone would cry for getting kicked tho\nso no point","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Salty Striker","date":"2014-11-09T13:56:41.734+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"In addition, I believe that removing the troll BEFORE the game, would be more beneficial than reporting him/her afterwards.  Even if every single person in the game  (both enemy team and ally team, total of 9 people reporting) reported that troll, that would do the losing team no benefit, because they have already lost their lp, and although reporting the troll may get them the troll banned, it did the losing team absolutely no benefit , in terms of lp. Or even if that troll did get banned, he/she could easily make a new account and start trolling all over again. That's why I think the vote to kick option would be so beneficial to all players, because removing a troll BEFORE the game starts would not only save tons of lp, but also make sure that a legitimate, fair, sportsmanlike game is played.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ryvaku","date":"2014-11-07T22:57:20.096+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I disagree with such an option since people are anal about stats and would literally kick any player with poor stats other than just for kicking the trolls. \nNot really good for this kind of game I think.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BiZeBoY","date":"2014-12-28T09:53:08.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is a great idea","replies":[]},{"poster":"Useless Ali gg","date":"2014-11-07T23:42:14.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you lose alot of lp rip your mmr bruh","replies":[]}]}
