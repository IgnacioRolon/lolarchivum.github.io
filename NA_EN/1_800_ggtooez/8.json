Not even Braum wall does that.\n\nI think Yasuo wall should be reworked a bit (for example, making the skills and autoattacks actually break on the wind wall, rather than disappering) or completely replaced with another ability (Maybe a spellshield?

Let me explain, Yasuo can place his wall and then keep maneuvering through it to poke any ranged champ and quickly dash back before the return damage hits him so that it disappears with his wall, essentially making him invulnerable to damage from any ranged champ. If by chance he misses the timing of the retreat, his passive shield will tank the shot. Maybe if the wall would break after one ult or a damage absorb cap, or even last a shorter duration it could be more balanced.
