Take Kleptomancy off of Ezreal or Bankplank's Q and force them to actually auto and suddenly those abuse cases become less extreme. Fine tune the gold supply, especially since as a fixed number that's literally the easiest thing to balance with tuning, and you can lower \"300 gold\" procs. You're using balance as an argument against design. Use design to argue design.\n\nZoe's RNG is exactly what you can plan for. You can see the minion dropping a bubble, you can see Zoe running to the bubble. You could manipulate the wave so that you're shoving against Zoe since her waveclear isn't as aggressive as some other champions, making it harder to advance forward for that bubble or to even use the ability on you. You can poke Zoe down since, like a Draven axe, you know exactly where she's beelining. You know what you can't plan for?

Use design to argue design.\n\nGood point. My bad. But looking at it in that regard I still don't know if I agree with Kleptomancy as a whole.\n\nI started using it on Urgot and Illaoi and I've had games where I get what's essentially nothing from it and others where I got so many elixirs of rouge, wrath and iron that I was basically an item ahead the whole game.\n\nMaybe what I really want is for Klepto to just not be as RNG but still be Klepto yknow?\n\nSomething like this:\n\nEvery x Klepto procs you gain a random potion, ward, elixir/rouge or sack of gold in that order.\n\nThen suddenly I love Klepto and like how balanced it is. Toss in \"adaptive-ish\" elixir gaining so those who want Sorcery/Wrath/Iron (those with scalings or more of the stat, Riven shouldn't get Sorcerys) and I'm sold.\n\n---\n\nAs for Zoe I see what you mean. I honestly shouldn't be talking about Zoe since I've only played against her a ton and as her twice in ARAMs.\n\nI will leave this though. A critical strike that you can plan for means that your opponents won't engage until that critical strike it down. Which is why showing you when you're going to crit isn't a thing. If we're comparing critical strike to the huge dueling power boost Zoe can get from an item active, wouldn't that be to the same possible effect?\n\nEdit: Just noticed the OP replied to you with the same kind of reasoning.\n\nOnce again I don't play Zoe though, so my opinion honestly isn't too validated moreso just speculation atm still (I blame BE values taking me years to finally buy her lol).","replies":[]},{"poster":"InfinitexMortal","date":"2017-12-01T22:41:08.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://www.flickchart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/citizen_kane.gif","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2017-12-02T00:39:12.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is also about what you get from the bubbles.\n\nIt could be 3 Cleanses vs an AD Assassin or 3 times Flash.","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2017-12-02T00:41:25.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is that actually possible?

With this rune, you can get gold, resources, skill-ups or even deleted items, all entirely at random. I imagine the idea was to encourage creative, on-the-fly decisions on how to use these, but the end result is simply that whoever can abuse this rune gets a ton of lane power without their opponent having any real way of figuring out what to do against them. Even beyond its abuse cases, it's simply frustrating to deal with, and baffling even to the player using it.\n* **Zoe's Spell Thief generating random item/summoner spell drops from minions:** just like Kleptomancy, the idea here was likely to encourage creative thinking, but the end result is simply that Zoe can get an absolutely massive power boost completely at random. Whereas Kleptomancy gives only relatively small benefits with every pop, however, if Zoe gets the right effect at the right time, she can get a kill, snowball her lane and thereby generate a huge lead based entirely on chance. If she doesn't, she may very well lose in exactly the same circumstances, effectively causing a lot of her success to rely on a factor other than skill. Her being able to copy summoner spells from her opponents is more or less fine in this respect, what really is the issue here is the drops she gets from minions.\n* **Critical hits:** The oldest instance of RNG in the game, one that has somehow persisted despite years' worth of updates, reworks and overhauls in the name of fairer, skill-based gameplay. As a mechanic that awards bursts of damage entirely at random, crit is neither fair nor skill-based, and has been shown extensively to turn the tide of fights in a manner that is completely arbitrary. Runes Reforged removed crit runes, and thereby removed the 1% crit setup from lanes, but Tryndamere still exists, and is notorious for using his early crit chance to cheese an early kill in lane. Because it is a core mechanic to one of the most prominent classes in the game (i.e. marksmen), it remains a high-profile mechanic that continues to induce frustration, even after Riot made it more consistent by buffing crit chance on items.\n* **Elemental Drakes:** Arguably the \"fairest\" form of RNG in the game, though I don't feel like it's particularly successful. Drakes were an attempt to introduce predictable, strategic variation to the game via random drake bonuses, but while the four effects are approximately balanced now relative to each other, they've also homogenized: in the end, drakes have become important not really because of the specific benefit they offer, but because they just give more power to a team. Similarly, drakes have different stats and effects that were meant to alter combat against them, but in most cases it makes no difference at all. In the end, it might simply be better to just concentrate all of these random bonuses into one, consistent bonus, such as a stacking DoT or even damage to structures.\n\nEffectively, randomness has always been, at best, an unnecessary addition to League that adds little real variation or meaningful gameplay in a PvP environment. At worst, however, it's a source of vast swings in power and momentum that feel completely unjustified when they occur, and that are only exacerbated in today's snowbally environment, where even one early death can cost a team the game. Moreover, whereas Riot once tried to justify RNG as valid only if it were predictable on both sides and tactical, this has not really translated well to their practices, as the random benefits offered by Kleptomancy or Spellthief are both neither particularly predictable nor tactical. As a result, the game feels less fair when those mechanics are involved, which is particularly aggravating when matches also feel like the outcome can be completely decided by a single advantage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JoeMG","date":"2017-12-01T22:25:19.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crit is by far the worst offender.

Team based games always have a large degree of RNG due to players alone.\n\nAs a freelance statistician, I disagree with you and I believe there is a problem with RNG in League of Legends. Riot now tends to the biggest eSport in the world. It is a game that can be played casually with or without RNG, but competitive League is what has allowed this game to grow and what often makes it so captivating to watch as well as play. So what could go wrong with RNG?\n\nConsider the economic principle of marginal analysis, which in this context can mean that the smaller some sort of margin between two teams, the more that little things matter to an outcome between the two teams. Say two pro teams, hypothetically, are equal in skill, or are at least equal by a certain point in the game, and a teamfight will swing the advantage. A close teamfight could be won with a certain random proc, like Zoe picking up a support's Redemption. People will later be able to see that RNG won that fight, and skill did not matter for the losing team in the end. I believe it would cause community disillusionment towards competitive League.\n\nThat's why RNG is bad. It does not even have to do with matchmaking or skill because essentially nobody except the very top 0.001% have decent overall skill. But when you inject RNG in competitive context, what happens to the 99% that are watching? Are they incentivized to increase their skill when they know BS like that can happen? I'm certainly not incentivized to grind in Hearthstone because of all the RNG. I'm implying that there might be a ripple effect down the ladder, no matter how random matchmaking is.\n\nI think that Runes Reforged is actually a good thing that Riot implemented to make the game more accessible (less expensive) to new players, but I think they should remove RNG procs.","replies":[{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2017-12-02T00:33:22.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If Zoe picked up the support's redemption during a fight, nothing RNG happened.
