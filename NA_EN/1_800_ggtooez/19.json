The fact he deals bonus damage on his passive should had been a great sign that more flat damage on his Q (which procs 1 to 2 stacks of his passive) wasn't needed. Or that a 2 second stun, that is game breaking on supports, would be strong on something meant to initiate; or the fact his passive allows for him to deal more % health damage when bellow 40% health. Its not historically game breaking to have a blink (even if it has a dash) but this is one of the few AP damage abilities that deals damage to a turret. And his ultimate (God bless the nerf before it went live so that it cost 100 mana) still deals a lot, even though its one of the safest ultimates I would name on the top of my head. His ultimate stops him from being targetable as soon as its activated, and sends him to a specific location to heal him (no matter what), and deal damage to those nearby by a ton (which also gives more health to him if he does deal damage to others).\n\nNow, is he the most game breaking Assassin?
