That's how you prevent someone from shaping the meta. Someone shapes the meta by slipping through bans and if Yasuo was ever allowed to be in mid lane we wouldn't see half the champs that are in that lane. Yasuo has even forced champs out of top lane (which traditionally has been a lane that counters him really hard).\n\nYasuo has the problem of a contradictory kit. He has a strong early game to help him kick off. But he doesn't really fall off late game compared to most early game champs. He counters ranged champs, but at the same time can out duel melee champs due to his defensive stats and mobility. So he is supposed to counter range champs. Yet he gets free tank shred making him also good at killing everyone else (even better now that armor is getting more abundant). His kit is more overloaded than Lee's and people complain about Lee. \n\nThe reason you can't play any of the people like Sej and stuff isn't Lee. It's the fact that their clears are so slow and weak that invaders can kill them easily. {{champion:19}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:11}} are very common picks for killing other junglers.

There are 140~ champs in the game and single one is being played in 40+% of games consistently through the seasons. Something has to give. It's not even about whether he's overpowered (although he probably is), it's stupid playing against the same champion in the jungle every game just because everyone has to endlessly play fotm champs.
