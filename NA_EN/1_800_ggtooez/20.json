That way there is some degree of give and tank. You want a heavy hitter, wont be as hard to kill. Want a invulnerable wall, won't hit that hard.

And just so we're clear, if a tank has 300 bonus armor, Lord Dominik's Regards will be a 60% increase in damage output against them. It's not remotely \"useless\", and every ADC with any sense will build it _every time_ there is a tank stacking armor. Even at normal tank armor levels, it's ~45% extra damage.

Trolling it is. But just in case you&#x27;re at all serious:\n> \n> The criteria for surviving a caster are much different from those for surviving an autoattacker. An autoattacking ADC will kill a tank before a mage is able to start a second spell rotation, _because their autoattack has a half-second cooldown._ Meanwhile, the mage has to go through three rotations to finish the job.\n> \n> By the way, the high armor items that make it &quot;easy&quot; to get 300 total armor also grant 0 health and are somewhat situationally useful. A tank is likely to have maybe 200-250 armor unless they&#x27;re purposefully stacking it (similarly, they will probably not have more than ~160 MR). And just so we&#x27;re clear, if a tank has 300 bonus armor, Lord Dominik&#x27;s Regards will be a 60% increase in damage output against them. It&#x27;s not remotely &quot;useless&quot;, and every ADC with any sense will build it _every time_ there is a tank stacking armor. Even at normal tank armor levels, it&#x27;s ~45% extra damage. Even at &quot;ADC bought GA&quot; levels, it&#x27;s a ~13% increase. If the enemy builds basically any armor, Last Whisper beats any flat pen. There&#x27;s no reason not to build it, unless you want to do something gimmicky like 100% crit or 50% life steal. Don&#x27;t do something gimmicky. Buy armor pen.\n> \n> Oh, and Blade of the Ruined King is a better tank-buster than any AP item, even after the on-hit nerf.\n\nYeah exactly. We've all seen how well Rumble is performing at the moment, with his complete reliance on Liandries. Hes one of the worst tops st the moment because void staff/Liandries doesnt do shit. Ap champs have bad itemization but even worse itemization against tanks. Problem, were in the \"everyone is a tank meta\" because hybrid offense/defense tank items are too efficient. Need to nerf the shit out of tank items.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
