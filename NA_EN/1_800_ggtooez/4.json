Typically, the only reason body-blocking of any sort exists in strategy games or MOBAs is because it is meant to be a baseline form of crowd control tanks can apply via their larger hitboxes. Dota 2 and HotS capitalize on this by making body-blocking a core component to tanking, while also making pathing around creeps so smooth that they never feel like an encumbrance. By contrast, League doesn't really put any significant emphasis on body-blocking between champions (which could be a much sounder way of giving tanks baseline usefulness than to give them raw damage), but creep block is nonetheless a real problem in top lane, whereas the game's occasional pathing problems sometimes feel like there's still some legacy code that needs to be updated. This I think is also why a lot of champions have been given either mobility or the ability to ghost through units (or both), as maneuvering in lane would otherwise feel bad.\n\nPersonally, I'd be in favor of a reversal of unit block, where champions could block each other much more clearly in proportion to their hitboxes, but where there would be no creep block at all, at least not allied creep block, and not with the game's current pathing. Features are only good to a game insofar as they enable good gameplay, and so far creep block feels like it has done more harm than good. If it is there to balance certain champions, then it would be better to address those champion directly than to have them rely on a dysfunctional mechanic.","replies":[{"poster":"1 800 GGTOOEZ","date":"2018-01-29T17:32:38.217+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would be completely down for the removal of allied creep block.
