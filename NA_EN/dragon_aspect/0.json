After the champion select i continued to receive a bug splat error whenever i tried to connect and reconnect to the game. I was playing with a friend and he told me the game was remade. But when returning to the home screen i received a leaver buster notice. Now i have to wait 20 minutes before i can play a match. I find this to be very unfair because I did not decide the exit the game of my own intent but was caused by a bug from the new client.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-29T23:15:28.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did this happen more than once or just this one game? \n\nThis certainly sucks when it happens, but regardless of intent, a disconnection negatively impacts *everyone* in the match. This is a reason why all disconnections are treated equally and why we cannot modify/remove any Leaverbuster penalties.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions as well.","replies":[]}]}
