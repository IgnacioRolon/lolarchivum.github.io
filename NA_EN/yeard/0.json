It's called the NA server for a reason. I cant tell if you are serious or a troll. Plus, u can just play on the LAN/LAS server for better ping.","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2016-02-29T00:54:21.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"only problem is then you're playing with the people south of the caribbean the most and they are mostly spanish speakers while other than cuba and Dominican republic/Haiti everyone speaks english. Though tbh we don't need a caribbean server we just need NA east to get their exclusive server. After chicargo move that already ensured i got around 75 ping. However recently the ping has been on the rise, was 100, now its back to 120-130 like the server moved back west.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yeard","date":"2016-02-02T02:49:45.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not everyone In the caribbean speaks english, so if there was a small NA server in the caribbean just for us to get around 50 ping it would be great.","replies":[]}]}]}
