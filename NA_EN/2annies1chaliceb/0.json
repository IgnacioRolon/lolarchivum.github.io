So with no more missions, I log off, log on the next day, and instead of getting the rest of the missions, I get those first 3 in that chain again, can select chaos/order icon, etc.\r\n\r\nIt does show my \"win 6 of 7 missions\" as progressing -- haven't won the first in the series now on the third day, but afaik this isn't supposed to work like this, right?  Aren't I supposed to be getting different missions 4-7?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-19T04:17:44.302+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The daily missions for each day vary slightly, but you will start each day by completing either Awakened or One Blade, One Purpose. After doing one of those, you'll move onto the daily quest for the day. For instance: Thursday's Order missions was Get 5 kills with an Order icon equipped, while Friday's mission was Collect 15,000 gold with an Order icon equipped.\n\nI can't give away what the rest of the daily missions are, but there are a few different mission requirements coming up!","replies":[{"poster":"STORMinBris","date":"2017-07-01T03:23:23.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are we getting the daily mission in a fixed timing everyday or it depends on when we completed the last daily mission?","replies":[]},{"poster":"2Annies1ChaliceB","date":"2017-06-19T04:25:03.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, okay.  Thanks.  I [thought I?] just got the same ones two days in a row, but I'd looked up online and it had shown different quests 4-7...  I see.  I did try looking up an explanation, but no answers to it.\nMaybe that should be made more clear in-game?  like so many other things (which won't happen?) Either way, thanks.\nAnd so far today I've lost eight games in a row... so... who knows what I'll get -_-\n\nWish I could just click a button saying \"this issue is solved\" and close the thread.\n","replies":[]}]}]}
