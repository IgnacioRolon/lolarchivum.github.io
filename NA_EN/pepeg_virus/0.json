The steps that *DragoniteDD* mentioned in this thread have been known to resolve the performance issues with these new Macbook pros for some players, so I really recommend giving them a go.

Then complete the following:**\n- Select your 'Applications' folder on your Dock\n- Select 'Open in Finder'\n- Right Click on 'League of Legends'\n- Select 'Show Package Contents'\n- Select 'Contents'\n- Select 'LoL'\n- Delete the folder named 'Config' (Right Click, then select 'Move to trash', then empty your trash)\n\nIn addition to the steps above, you may also want to [**temporarily disable the Hot Corners feature**](http://osxdaily.com/2016/08/10/disable-hot-corners-mac/) in macOS.

We tried  alt-tabing, trying to bring up the task manager, and etc, did not resolve the issue. We were able to fix the issue by restarting our pc's but unfortunately we lost because the enemy team was able gain a huge lead in the time we were not in game. We are split between 2 cites in the same province and we have different ISPs so I really doubt its our internet connection, just wondering if someone from Riot or in this thread could give a reasonable explanation as to why this issue coincidentally happened to all of us at the same time.
