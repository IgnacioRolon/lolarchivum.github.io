As another step, I'd suggest reaching out to us in a ticket with your recent game logs so that we can try to get to the bottom of the issue if you pc is overheating.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Proponent","date":"2017-03-25T08:11:50.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very strange. Are your graphic drivers up to date? I don't think there would be anything particularly wrong with the fact you have Crossfire GPUs but I would do some research to see if anyone else using Crossfire is having this issue. I don't think it's directly involved with League, however. Is your computer restarting without the BSoD? If you have gotten the blue screen, did it specify the error?","replies":[{"poster":"SpitFire2k5","date":"2017-03-25T09:46:39.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it's restarting without the BSoD. When it restarts the fans kick on to max then stop during the restart. The PC always restarts when the loading screen is half complete. The screen only blinks when the loadin bar moves higher. Also, if there is supposed to be text above the loading bar there isn't any. All it shows above the loading bar is two commas.","replies":[]}]}]}
