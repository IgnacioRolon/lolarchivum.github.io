Usually during the initial \"declare champ\" phase. The timer will just go to 0. Nothing happens, then I get something like, \"There was an error setting your masteries\".\r\n\r\nAlso been having an issue that I can never start games because the option is always grayed out. Sometimes I'll never be able to click \"Confirm\", and other times, I'll never be able to click \"Find Match\", and I have to restart.\r\n\r\nThe second case isn't so annoying, but the first is really crappy. Just had to wait 5 minutes because I apparently \"dodged\". I've never seen the client so buggy and while everyone else is reporting constant bugsplats, but I don't have that issue. In any case, hopefully goes away with the next patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-24T20:49:39.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These examples aren't quite bugsplats since the client isn't crashing and you aren't getting any error codes it doesn't sound like. These are most likely issues with your network having a hiccup in its connection to our servers or that the connection just isn't strong enough. For example, changing your masteries and choosing your champion both need a constant connection to send that data to the servers, and without it, you can get booted for afk (since the client isn't connected to our servers any longer).\n\nHit up this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and make sure to go through each step, paying extra attention to port forwarding, DNS, and firewalls. Also double check to see if you're using the Discord overlay, as that has been causing problems for League lately.","replies":[{"poster":"hunnyflash","date":"2017-09-24T21:09:54.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it's my wifi. I guess it's just my luck that it happens regularly when I'm in champ select.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/eL6IW\n\nI forgot to add that I'm never actually changing my masteries, yet I still get that error. \n\nAnyways, thanks for the link.","replies":[]}]}]}
