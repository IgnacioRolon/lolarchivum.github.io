Yet, each time I do. He just Q basics me back. I understand the Q is normal but the basic isn't. Riot pls fix this. I don't get why he can basic me if I full range Q him.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-06-20T05:48:54.923+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Attack ranges are measured from the edge of a champion's model (particularly important on large melee champions so they can attack anything at all) rather than the center.To roughly compare the two you can add about 100 units, on average, to an attack range. In Teemo's case this means that his auto attack, with a listed range of 500, has about the same reach as a 600 range spell (such as Pantheon's Q).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nortwin","date":"2014-06-20T09:03:41.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why you WEQ. Pantheon is one of the best Teemo counters because he has high physical damage spell output, countering Teemo's blind.","replies":[]}]}
