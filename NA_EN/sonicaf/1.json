It doesn't make the situation less stressful or frustrating and people were losing accounts to this shit before. Considering the average time it takes for them to answer the ticked, even if I am all gucci, I will be effectively banned from league for a week - a week off my Worlds 2018 pass.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SonicAF","date":"2018-11-26T16:12:07.325+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Considering that my lock was not exactly grounded, I requested 29 tokens as a compensation on the 20th of november, so I have enough for a \"mic drop\" emote.
