If you went out and started yelling, insulting, and harassing someone just because you didn't like their gait, you're going to be seen as an asshole, and people aren't gonna wanna deal with you.\n\nAnd when it comes to establishments (grocery/convenience stores, restaurants, etc.), even those places have standards for acceptable conduct, much like League does. If you start yelling and wailing at the top of your lungs, having a category 5 manchild meltdown, or start bickering at other people because you don't like the food that they like, etc. - you're going to be asked to stop, and if you keep it up, you'll be made to leave.\n\n> You must overcome your automatic response to being bullied or being accused of something you didn't do.\n\nAgain; if the automatic response is inflammatory, yes, you're going to have to overcome that. It doesn't take much effort to put second thought to deciding whether or not to tell this guy to \"fuck off\" - you can mute them and report them post-game, and suffer no consequences yourself.\n\nFlaming someone who accuses you of doing something you didn't only validates their claims, and makes you liable to be punished.\n\nTo repeat what _should_ be common internet wisdom by now: _Don't feed the troll._\n\n> Current punishment system forces you to put active though into something that is supposed to be automated.\n\nWhat, responding to people, or reporting people? Either way, it's not supposed to be automated. In the former case, you're dealing with other people, and having a modicum of tact is pretty much necessary - and showing a modicum of respect is _expected_ of you.\n\nAnd in the latter case - you're reporting someone. You're making a claim that \"this\" person broke the rules. If there's no basis to your claim, and no effort on your part to prove that they broke them, then guess what? Your report was wasted.\n\n> It is actively unfun to stay fully aware and conscious instead of blissfully grinding games, venting and sharing any negativity, as humans do when they get stressed.\n\nIt is actively unfun to deal with people whose bullshit we don't want to hear when we're trying to play a game. If you need to vent to someone, find someone who's willing to listen. A sibling, a parent, a friend, etc. - but don't dump your vitriol on your teammates.\n\n> As someone not threatened by current punishment system, I _suggest_ scrapping it completely with no replacement.\n\nAnd with that suggestion, flaming, trolling, etc. would become rampant, and the game would be 100x _**less**_ fun.\n\nI would say it's a suggestion that would be taken under advisement, but frankly, it's not a suggestion worth taking at all.\n\n> **Is your honest opinion about that stupid suggestion bannable by IFS?**\n> 1) Yes\n> 2) Yes\n\nAlso, biased poll = bad poll.

My personal experience ~~proves ~~ shows that there is no correlation between one's attitude and rating. For example I know a permabanned Russian streamer who started playing on a smurf right after he got banned. He did not type after permaban. Guess what?
