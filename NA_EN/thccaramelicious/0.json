It takes 5 minutes to spitball good ideas for a champ skin. Riot said it was too hard to come up with a Zac skin. I gave a bunch of ideas out of 2 minutes of thinking. These included bubble gum (one of his eventual chromas) and water (pool party came out 2 years later). Really obvious ideas to be sure but what did riot spend 2+ years coming up with? Exactly the same thing. The reason these champs don't get skins is obvious, it's only presented as being about writer's block because they don't want to come out and say the truth.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shuyin178","date":"2017-07-29T17:55:46.220+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"List of champions **I think** that need new skins : \n{{champion:136}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:427}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:83}}","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2017-07-29T18:40:19.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shuyin178,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=JYwJN2h2,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2017-07-29T17:55:46.220+0000)\n>\n> List of champions **I think** that need new skins : \n> {{champion:136}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:427}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:83}}\n\ntahm just got an april fools skin \nvi just got a warring kingdoms skin\ntrundle just got a world breaker skin \ntaric just got a pool party skin last summer","replies":[{"poster":"Shuyin178","date":"2017-07-29T20:32:28.869+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"And not a single one of them are any good.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-07-29T21:08:22.904+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Those are all AWESOME skins.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Trenitaliyah","date":"2017-09-09T09:57:35.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"your concept of \"just\" is a bit...erm...subjective xD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SSmotzer","date":"2018-01-23T01:33:34.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Skins are really only being released for events nowadays.
