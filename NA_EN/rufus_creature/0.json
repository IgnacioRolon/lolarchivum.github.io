I am currently trying to install with 6.17 live and see if they fixed it. Coming from a guy who has spent alot of money on this game, if this doesn't work I might quit and go to a different MOBA.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wa7oosh","date":"2016-08-17T19:24:43.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same problem , error message \" game crash ...
