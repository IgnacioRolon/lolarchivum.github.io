You stated yourself that u want to make it a good nerf/buff for all skill brackets but then you say sej is to strong in pro play. Sounds about right , also let's remove galios flash W engage so that he turns into a tanky damage assassin that will excel into melee mid laners. Seems all you care about is tft now. Why don't you listen to streamers and content creators and fix solo Q so these challenger players don't have to play with and or against season 8 diamond players. It clearly makes them toxic and they have said it themselves but you continue to not care. It's crazy.\r\n\r\nSo with bugs, in the life of a dev, which in all honesty no one cares about, you don't talk about fixing bugs at all. How long has it been since yasou windwall has been bugged? There are 100s of bugs that you just throw off to the side and not care about. \r\n\r\nYou keep putting in new champions into this already abundant game before you even attempt to balance other champs. You rework morde, let him mess around in solo Q for a while, ussualy see the absurd stats he has been producing but just decide that you want to release qiyana, another assassin, with multiple dashes, a stealth, and a HUGE form of cc. Seems like half the champions riot is releasing have dashes or invisibility, or even an ultimate that let's you press R on anyone in range and put you into a different world. \r\n\r\n\r\nAll I'm saying is that you need to focus on what's wrong with the game before you do new things to it. Have you even war he's any content creators that is in challenger solo Q? It sure seems like you haven't. \r\n\r\nLooking back at this it looks like a little kid wrote this with the grammar but idc, be toxic. I'm just stating my opinion and I am voicing my concerns, after all, isn't that was the boards are for? Also, there was a discussion I saw last night about a moderator disabling voting only because it got like 42-2 votes in 5 minutes. Kinda sounds dumb to me.","replies":[]}
