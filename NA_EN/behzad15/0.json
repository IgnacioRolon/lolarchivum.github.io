and can I play that much of time to master other champions ? for learning how to win Yi vs Rammus or Yi vs Jax or Yi vs Udyr or Yi vs Kha'Zix i put a lot of time , just thinking about this that yi can get reworked makes me uninterested to play game, specially after i saw aatrox changed from an Auto attack champion to an ability user , that just hurts. i never get it what riot means by not having counterplay\n\n#2 : dropping honor made game so exhausting for me\nduring my playing time, i dropped to honor1, after months not only i was still honor1, but i saw all of my friends have many Emotes like 6-7 and they got all of them from chests, while i had just 4 emotes (2 of them about event and level of account !) and I had S but game didnt give me Chests and again i see my friends have super nice skins from chest while im  not getting chests (Keys were actual problem because i had enough chests, i was honor1 game didnt gave me Key), in addition to all, I wasnt able to play with my friends in Clash, tho clash crashed in EUW, but not being able to play with my friends was so frustrating for me even 2 of my friends didnt join clash to support me.\n\n#3 : league is only game that ban you from game for TYPING and ban system isnt fair\nI got banned permanently once this year after being so frustrated in games, not only this system isnt fair at all (if you play one game daily and you are toxic in games you will never face a penalty, if you play a lot and you are toxic in some games you will face a penalty, also riot dont give your teammate a penalty for banning your champ is champ selection, they dont ban people if they are feeding or staying in bush in game, they only ban you for Typing) after playing game for 2 years daily 10hours (and 4 other hours i was watching streams !) i had an account with 20 champ and 0 skins, all of my moments and masteries and champions and skins (and money!) were wasted, i cant actually say losing rank was sad for me because you can easily rank up back, but after playing for 2 years, my account was lower than a newbie player, i could accept all of this punishments if they was in everywhere, even in real life police dont kill you and get your life if you are angry and for example firing a car in middle of street, not even one other single game i played until now (Video Games like Dota2, CS1.6 ,Source, Zero and GO, Fortnite, PUBG ... or Web Games like Tank, Worms, Travian ... or even Android Games like Clash of Clans...) banned me for saying bad words or being \"TOXIC\" in game, they never waste all of what you tried for and your life, actually game was my life for 1-2 years, none of the games ban you from game or ban your account for that, they dont even take your pride, only punishment is getting muted in game \n\n**LoL punishments are like Genghis Khan Yasa(rules), Mongols kill you for something like breaking a glass, this is a joke in modern world until you are playing under Riot Rules, maybe call it Rasa !**\n\nif you agree with my reasons +1 me or if you agree with one of two of them, say your comments about what you disagree.\n\nmy banned account (dropped to gold automatically) : http://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=SKT+REZA\nmy other accounts that i sold, again decide to play but again understand problems are not fixed :\nhttp://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=ali+afri\non this account , if any rioter is reading it i want note that i had 85% winrate on yi with 3KDA and 8cs/min in all way from silver to gold and i didnt jump even on elo that was exhausting that time !\nhttp://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=amirreza2142\nhttp://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=mosqueBreaker\non this one, i want note that name of accounts was picked by my friend, he gave me his account because he quit playing lol and he was sure he will never play it again ,all acounts was by my friends given to me, but i finally quit game\n\nas i said even this account isnt mine , dont say me they ban you because this will not happen, not here but in all other video games u will never get banned for sharing accounts or even buy/sell them, many accounts are being sold on sites online even.","replies":[{"poster":"insignificant","date":"2018-07-17T09:51:39.008+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":3,"body":"i'm sorry but \"I finally learnt Master Yi\" is the funniest thing i've seen today","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-07-17T15:14:11.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SeacretAgent","date":"2018-07-17T11:58:12.989+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"The suspension system is absolutely ridiculous for saying words half as bad as the enemy team.

The punishments league has in place for toxic behavior in game are perfectly appropriate. You have to actively be a negative presence in game to get banned, especially permanently. You not only have to type nasty things to your teammates in chat, but you have to do it repeatedly (and usually after multiple warnings).\n\nI understand some people have trouble controlling themselves, are toxic for the laughs, or otherwise struggle to keep their hands off their keys but anyone who acts like that should 100% be ready for a ban. You know the rules, you know you have other ways to vent frustration (I say things vocally, out of chat, all the time)  and instead you decide to flame in game.

You have to consistently be a massive jerk to get any kind of punishment out of the system. You also get multiple escalating punishments as a warning. Sorry, but if you eat a ban in this system you most likely deserved it. \n\nAs for Yi, he has already been reworked once and probably isn't even in the top 30 champions on Riot's radar to rework again.

I know people it happened to.\n\nBut that aside, here:\n\n1. Reworks happen when a character is unhealthy for the game and cannot be balanced effectively. Aatrox had problems involving how he was a stat-stick. Trades and Laning shouldn't be a stat-check, it should be skill based. Aatrox could just stat-check people in-lane before the rework.\n\n2. Dropping honor sucks, and I do think it should be easier to regain honor. However, that disappointment of seeing friends with it while you don't have it is sort of the point. If you want to have the good stuff, you have to be good too.\nIf you're stuck in honor 1 for multiple months and you play with any frequency then you are likely doing things that are still getting reported and the system _does_ judge to be not okay. If you are validly reported for things you shouldn't be doing and it doesn't warrant a full-on punishment, you will still lose your honor progress towards unlocked / honor 2. Riot should be clearer about this, I think they've even said they wished it had better clarity, but for now this is how it works.\n\n3. It's a game, designed for people to have fun. If you are behaving in a manner that directly ruins other peoples' fun then it goes against the design of the game. Riot is well within their rights to remove anybody who does this. You included. Typing or gameplay, it doesn't matter, because both can ruin peoples' fun.\nInstead of moaning about how it's unfair that you were punished for typing, why don't you try to figure out what you did wrong and learn how to be better? Posting that you quit certainly won't garner any sympathy, not from players who have had to deal with people who behaved horribly in chat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jumpywizboard","date":"2018-07-17T17:57:49.230+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don’t know what you are talking about with not getting banned for account sharing or selling, I’m most games you will get banned","replies":[]},{"poster":"K Ÿ Ø","date":"2018-07-17T22:30:09.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bruh ur the funniest guy in the world.
