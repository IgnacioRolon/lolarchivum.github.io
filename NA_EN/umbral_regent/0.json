I&#039;ve seen the video showcasing his new appearance, and I&#039;m a little off-put, but still heartily optimistic and sure that I&#039;ll acclimate to his new appearance - but even still, I do have some questions for the Rioters who designed his rework. I&#039;m not sure whether or not I&#039;ll receive any responses, but - again, optimistic.\r\n\r\n**1. What inspired the change of Galio&#039;s silhouette?**\r\nFormerly (and currently), Galio strikes a unique pose as being a large-upper-bodied gargoyle who rests on claw and knuckle (or, in some cases, hoof and knuckle) like a gorilla, but noticeable in his new appearance is a stark shift from the hardy, closed-up gorilla-like silhouette to a more mythical body - somewhat like a heavily ornamented and well-built Satyr.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m curious if &quot;mythical creature&quot; was a stronger thematic drawn from Gargoyle than &quot;stone, hooved, and sturdy&quot; when designing him, or if the Demacian Statue thing sort of influenced the new body composition - with gargoyle features (wings, triple-jointed legs) still being built into the appearance?\r\n\r\n**2. What inspired the shift from the blue-gold realistically-defined stone to the marble and gold artistically-designed stone?**\r\nBarring the obvious of the new style of Demacia being the radiant, angular cuts of marble, I&#039;m curious as to what drove the design towards a more stylistic statue over the more anatomically-centered design - although, perhaps that answers the question in of itself - stylistic presents a unique contrast from the overwhelming number of anatomically natural Champions in League - nevertheless, I&#039;m interested to hear about the decision.\r\n\r\n**3. Gatekeeper Galio - what took him from stoic guardian to demonic overlord**\r\nWhile Gatekeeper Galio didn&#039;t look quite so fancy in the first place, the new Gatekeeper skin has an almost jarring shift in appearance (largely in part from the silhouette) - it seems that the new GK Galio seems to draw heavily from powerful demonic &quot;overlord&quot; kinds of entities - massive bodies the likes of Lei Shen from World of Warcraft, and immense magical power to back up the physical.\r\n\r\nEven if it is difficult to settle on the transition, I still absolutely love the skin and I&#039;m curious as to how you guys came to the new look.\r\n\r\n**4. What inspired the new Enchanted Galio, as well?**\r\nFrom what I can see, it looks like the new Enchanted Galio is meant to be some sort of animated golem - I don&#039;t really know anything else that would have inspired it, but I&#039;m nevertheless interested what may have directly or indirectly inspired it. (I also absolutely love his shoulders on that skin, curiosities aside)\r\n\r\n**5. Which skins will use the Base Visual Effects, and which ones will get unique ones?**\r\nI&#039;m willing to bet this was answered before and I just glossed over it, but I&#039;m still willing to ask. From what all I can guess, Gatekeeper, Enchanted, and Hextech would likely be the only candidates for unique VFX, with Commando, and Debonair getting the stock VFX. And, if that is the case - would we expect to see blue arcane spells for Enchanted, and circuit-woven blue, crackling energy for Hextech?\r\n\r\nThanks ahead of time for reading this, and many more thanks for responses - and a massive thank you for the awesome work you guys at ChampUp are doing on these reworks!","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2017-03-06T21:30:28.161+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"My answer for 2 is that Demacia is, on the surface, a very pure place. When looking at colors, White and Gold together make a rather \"pure\" looking combo.

Probably a few misspellings due to the haste in which I would post it.\n\nI really don't like this rework visually, more so than I hate Trundle's, where they took an interesting character with an original design and turned him into another freaking ice champ because we didn't have enough of those.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2017-03-06T20:55:46.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I realized shortly after posting a highly probable reason why they changed his silhouette like they did - _it's so they have more room to work on design and animation._\n\nWith the old gorilla-stance that Galio has, you're not seeing a whole lot of him, and he doesn't exactly have a lot of room for animations - particularly because he spends a lot of his time airborne - but nevertheless, the new upright standing gives them a lot more room to show cool stuff to whoever's playing (since it's an angled, top-down viewpoint, you'll be able to see more of a character standing up), and a lot more room to actually make unique animations (since an upright, bipedal stance gives a wider range of motion)\n\nI figured it'd be good to say this in a response to your comment - I didn't want to edit the post and remove a question over a likely answer being thought of, and I think it may at least help give a new viewpoint to look at it from - and hopefully dislike it less.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-03-07T10:35:52.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been thinking on it too. I think what mostly bugs me is his head sticking so far over his shoulders and how thin he is in the wrist and forearms.
