ANYTHING would be better than a PERMA ban on a game that i play day and night. riot why? i honestly dont thin a perma ban is needed for this, especially when the yasuo, who had originally said that comment, didnt even get a chat restriction or anything.. \n\nyes i have said wrong things, but im not a toxic player. when people say things to me, i get worked up yes and i can admit that, but please remove the perma ban and at least make it a suspension. chat ban me, something other than perma ban. riot i have made mistakes and wish to please have my account back. this isnt fair honestly, nothing even happened to the guy that had said it to me, also, leona had been trying to claim i was a female by saying i complained like one. im not the only one in the wrong yet i was the only one punished.\n\nhere&#039;s my chat log:\n\nBlazed Nami: because we got ganked?\nBlazed Nami: learn to land your e\nBlazed Nami: its sad that you&#039;re not 7\nBlazed Nami: as do i\nBlazed Nami: why so mad bro\nBlazed Nami: not my fault you&#039;re losing\nBlazed Nami: pick a more try hard comp\nBlazed Nami: stay mast 5\nBlazed Nami: says the leo\nBlazed Nami: am i talking to you?\nBlazed Nami: no\nBlazed Nami: im not\nBlazed Nami: comp\nBlazed Nami: mf leo\nBlazed Nami: retard\nBlazed Nami: dumb N*gr?\nBlazed Nami: hf with your ban\nBlazed Nami: im racist?\nBlazed Nami: look what youve said\nBlazed Nami: stupid ass yas\nBlazed Nami: leo stop admiting youre a girl to everyone\nBlazed Nami: no one cares\nBlazed Nami: gj leo\nBlazed Nami: you let your team die\nBlazed Nami: beating your ass\nBlazed Nami: at least i have assists\nBlazed Nami: dumbass support\nBlazed Nami: i am assie?\nBlazed Nami: are you 12?\nBlazed Nami: u mad yas?\nBlazed Nami: isnt it past your bed time kid\nBlazed Nami: keep feeding yas\nBlazed Nami: gg\n\nwhether i have to /mute all everygame and never speak to a single soul in chat, or whether i have to write a 10,000 letter report on why i should get my account back, ill do anything to have it back. league is love league is life, and this is honestly just devastating.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-10-21T19:36:39.579+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":0,"body":"These chat logs are modified.

Most people just try to make that seem plausible by being overly surprised or outraged about their punishment, or maybe tell people an irrelevant sob story.\n\nHonestly, these forums made me extremely cynical, but I have to admit that it has been a while since I've seen a case where somebody was lying and manipulating their chatlog this blatantly. Most people just lie implicitely or by omission in hope that the truth doesn't come out.

Toning down of a punishment is not saying exonerated. \n\nThe only cases i can remember that have been turned around are either hacked stories where there was previous documentation, false positive on 3rd party, or account sharing . And neither of those are behavioral in nature.\n\ngive this i will never believe these cases.
