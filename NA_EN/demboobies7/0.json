Surely, I did check google for solutions and tried most of them (except for IP Helper, because, I don't have IP Helper service and have no idea how to \"instal\" it)\n\nTried setting DNS to every single possible one I found. Fixed connection with random stuff, tried ipconfig thingies etc., but nothing seems to work. Reinstalled League, installed newest IE and so on, and so on...\n\nI'm currently using Win xp on my pc and Win 10 on my laptop, both seem to have the same problem (tho i didnt try to fix it on the laptop) so I'm thinking it could be something to do with my router, but I have no idea what to try. Everything except League works like a charm. I did manage to fix this problem, but it suddenly started to happen again after I restarted my pc (or maybe after the latest patch, I'm 80% sure that's it), and I have no idea how or why.\n\nPlease, help!\n\nEdit: Only getting disconnected while in queue, when in champion pick or game, everything is fine. After the game i get the error message that my client disconnected, when i press ok, i have to wait for 15 seconds until it reconnects when i can start queue again. I only get dc'd from client, chat is always logged in, but when i hover over someone, it doesn't load their picture until pvp reconnects itself.\n\nEdit 2: I checked for packet loss, whatever I ping, i get no packet loss at all. (maybe i didnt ping the right adress tho)\n\nEdit 3: I disabled ipv6 on my Local Area Network settings and in Router. Still nothing\n","replies":[{"poster":"LuxannaVeritas","date":"2016-08-16T02:16:13.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi!\n\nI had the same problem about a week ago, and I was trying the same things you were to no avail. I went on a vacation this weekend (with my laptop), and right now the problem seems to be resolved!\n\nHere's a few things I did over the vacation that might help you!\n\n-Update all of my software\n-Free up some storage on my laptop\n-Restart the computer\n\nI know these seem very simple, and I know that I have a different operating system than you (Mac) but hopefully these things will help you too!","replies":[{"poster":"DemBoobies7","date":"2016-08-16T12:23:30.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\nThanks for answering.\n\nWhat kind of software did you update, I already have updated java, flash, adobe air and similar system stuff. \n\nThis morning League worked perfectly, at 2 PM it started disconnecting again. Could this just be a problem with my ISP? I'm really not sure because everything else checks out, ping is perfect, packet loss is 0%, I even did the Netalyzr and it gave only positive results.\nOnly thing it did return negative was \"uPnP not found\" and \"Direct probing of DNS resolvers, both not responding to requests\"\n\nI guess I'll just have to bare with it.","replies":[{"poster":"LuxannaVeritas","date":"2016-08-16T16:24:39.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The software I updated was El Capitan, which is just for the Mac, but if you could find the Mac's Finder equivalent of Windows, that should be the software to upload. \n\nI personally think that freeing up storage on your computer really helps this problem, but I'm not 100% positive about it.\n\nAnything in Netalyzr doesn't affect Pvp.net; I tried a Netalyzr test when my pvp.net was disconnecting and it was also all positive.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-16T17:48:03.613+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all the troubleshooting done so far!  When you are in queue, the server is attempting to place everyone together into a group.  It sounds like your network is having trouble establishing that connection and leaving you behind.  In addition to what you've already tried, I also suggest going through each step in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.  Hopefully, this will help get you squared away!","replies":[{"poster":"DemBoobies7","date":"2016-08-17T01:19:01.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to change my statement.
