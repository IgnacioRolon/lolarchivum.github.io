The cdr also helps with Lucian's spell slinging, especially when paired with...\nThe Black Cleaver gives 20% cdr, allowing even more spell slinging.  The armor shred passive also pairs well with Lucian's ult, to nearly instantly destroy an enemy's armor.  This also combos well with the flat armor penetration of Ghostblade.  The rage passive also helps a tiny bit with kiting and chasing.\n\nThe two items synergize with his kit extremely well, and give Lucian an incredibly powerful mid-game.  His late game takes a small hit, but he'll still burst down the squishies all game while easily kiting enemy tanks/fighters/juggernauts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2016-08-12T08:35:25.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Black cleaver prolly cause of synergy with his passive, pretty sure it double procs.

Your critbuild is made for late game. Right now, we're playing the League of Snowballs, which is focused on early game dominance. That's why everyone thinks Ghostblade/BC is better.

Recently I've discovered that in like 15 seconds you can recover a good chunk of mana with just ocean drake.
