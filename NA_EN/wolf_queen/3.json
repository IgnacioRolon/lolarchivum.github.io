Yes i get you want to win, but taking it so serious and being so stressed over it you are guaranteed to lose more games. Relax and calm down. Dont play something just cause its in the meta play what you enjoy do different stuff, have fun with the game. Do random stuff just cause its fun and i promise youll win more and the community itself would be better. Lets start having fun with the game again :) and remember why we started playing to begin with. To have fun :D","replies":[{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2015-08-28T03:58:19.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Dont play something just cause its in the meta. Play what you enjoy! do different stuff!\n\nFor that matter, if what you normally play is in the meta, by all means play it!
