When we did that, all ID banned players were then subjected to the same rules. There would be a review period for these players. ID banned players do not get their accounts back.

You obviously don't . He streams and gets tipped hundreds of dollars , meanwhile a broke 16 yo kid like me cannot do that .\n\nThis is irrelevant, you're talking about wanting to get your account unbanned because someone who suffered an ID ban got it overturned, allowing them to create new accounts again. So what if Tyler1 can rebuy everything he had/wants? So what if you can't?\n\nThe only thing that remains the same is that _**Tyler1's case is different from yours.**_\n\n> If you look at my account I've only had negative history in this ONE month .

Just take away my chat privileges WTH...\n\nSo you're going to tell me that over the course of a single month, you got two chat restrictions and a fourteen day ban, and didn't _once_ consider changing what you were doing? It didn't even once occur to you - particularly with the 14-day ban - that you could lose your account if you kept going like you were?\n\nTaking away your chat privileges wouldn't help. Riot's already tried indefinite chat restrictions, and it failed miserably. The vast majority of players under that punishment would just troll, grief, or intentionally feed to spite their teammates where otherwise they would have just flamed.\n\nAnd if you spiralled out of control and lost your account over the course of a month, I doubt you would be any different.\n\nThe point of banning players for toxicity is to tell them that, since they can't reform, since they can't figure out _why_ they're getting punished, or probably don't _care_ to know, they don't belong in the League of Legends community. If you realized only _after_ the fact that your chat was wrong, then that's completely on you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wesker997","date":"2018-01-05T00:06:03.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Useless .
