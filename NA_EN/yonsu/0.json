To do this I will have to stop playing league of legends till then, but i am an addict. I cannot resist not playing it when it lies there on my desktop. I do not want to uninstall the game because reinstalling takes a long time and i am going to come back in a week's time anyway. So to my point, is there a way to deactivate my account till the 16th of December? Do i have to message riot support with some specifics. Thanks for spending your time reading this.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-09T04:58:53.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I admire the honesty in your post and that you're taking proactive measures in order to nail those finals!
