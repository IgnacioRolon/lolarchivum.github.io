I missed the crafting this summer because I had taken a break from league. I'm just asking in case purchasing the summoner icon of the champ gives the border or something. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-28T00:51:10.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As *Zombiemaster* has mentioned, it's too late to pick up the borders. The PROJECT loading screen borders are limited to the release of the skins, so with Lucian and Leona, you would have had to purchase the skins during the first week or their release, and Ashe's border had to be crafted by taking part in the [PROJECT:Disruption event](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/210155266-PROJECT-DISRUPTION-FAQ).\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"DrKav Ekko ","date":"2017-11-05T01:11:58.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hello any idea if riot gonna release an event or somthin this season so we can get project border i need for my project ekko skin a border i have on zed yasuo thx for answer me if y know","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-10-27T23:03:19.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately for you, it is no longer possible to get the project loading screen borders.","replies":[]}]}
