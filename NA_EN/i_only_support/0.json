I&#039;m your average Bronze 1 casual player, so I&#039;m sure many of you have more educated opinions than I. \r\n\r\nIt never really bothered me until tonight, the toxicity that is. I usually mute the players or try to help them calm down and find common ground, but that doesn&#039;t quite seem to work anymore, ESPECIALLY in EUNE (which I believe is _by far _the most toxic region). \r\n\r\nI was involved in a game where, despite having an evenly scored ranked match by mid-game, our Vayne (as the vayne-main-stereotype goes) decided to incite to our Jungler to &quot;kill himself&quot; for not successfully ganking. He didn&#039;t die, mind you. He ganked, he brought their adc down to 50% hp, and as they were safely behind their turret, he left. Fine, no harm done. But this Vayne...\r\n\r\nAnd as you all may of guessed, our Jungler begins insulting Vayne&#039;s mother, after which Vayne begins to promptly feed horrendously, although I&#039;m 99% sure this was not intentional. \r\n\r\n**As everyone knows**, arguing with your teammates and spewing toxic slurs does not help your team win or motivate them to make better plays. In fact it has the complete opposite affect. Everyone knows it, so why? \r\nI need to know what benefit could possibly result from inciting someone to kill themselves? I understand it&#039;s an &quot;E-Sport&quot; and that it&#039;s competitive. But when was the last time you heard a professional Football player say to his opponent, &quot;I hope you die of cancer&quot;?\r\n\r\n**I understand some people had bad days. I hate my job, I&#039;m married, and I have a stressful life full of downs too. That does NOT give me the right to be an indecent human being.**\r\n\r\nI guess my point is this, and I accept any other opinions on the matter:\r\nIf this is you, please think before you begin your keyboard warrior rant. Toxicity will not win you the game, and it won&#039;t make your day or anyone else&#039;s day any better. If you&#039;re having a bad day, drink some tea and have a hot shower before you log in. Read a nice book or lay on your sofa, take a break for awhile. \r\nBronze seems to have the majority of issues. I&#039;m sad I&#039;m stuck there, but hey, I&#039;m not Silver material [yet]. I see no reason why the attitudes of players need to be so horrid. \r\n\r\nThanks for listening to my long rant. Back to listening to &quot;kurwaa&quot; for the next 40 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-05-16T02:51:59.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If people thought rationally before most of their actions then we would be living in a utopia.  Unfortunately we don't so our next best solution is to report and move on.  Trust me man I read the entire thing and I know it sucks. \n\nFor the record, once you get to the higher levels of ranked there are less people who go apeshit at the drop of a hat.  The standard afks and dcs are still there but at least in my experience, people tend to both insult less and have thicker skin at my level, resulting in people grudgingly cooperating.  They ain't friends but at least they are still both doing their best to win the game.\n\nSlog through the shit man and try your best to not let it get to you.\n\nJust my two cents.\n\n\nAlso as a side note,  Professional Football players are stereo-typically known to fake injuries and fouls on field to get free kicks and penalties so I wouldn't be using them as an example of good sportsmanship.\n\nEDIT: Just realized that we are in NA and football means the NFL not FIFA so carry on and don't pay that last comment any attention.","replies":[]}]}
