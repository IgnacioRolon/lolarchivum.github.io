There were no notification or any other program running. I already tried to reinstall league, performed clean boot, and even used HRT apps, but the problem still exist. Important note: only happened in-game and its also only happen in League of Legends (my other games works fine).","replies":[{"poster":"Yang in 2020","date":"2017-05-28T00:50:49.804+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.  I too have encountered this problem except when it does this and pull the game window back up it resets my display scaling on high DPI settings which I have disabled because otherwise the cursor in-game is freaking tiny and affects my ability to play effectively.  It's only been occurring about the last 2 or 3 days. Never had it before.   It happens every single game, regardless of map or mode.  Interestingly enough, at least for me, this issue pops up around the 7-8 minute mark of the game.  If I reconnect to the game when this happens everything will work fine for the rest of the game.  For what ever reason during every game now at about the 7-8 minute mark my League minimizes itself out of the blue.\n\nI have also tried the same as the original poster.  I am currently doing the full repair through the client options.  I'll post back here if that resolves the problem or if it persists.  This isn't necessarily 'game breaking' because when it happens I just close the game window, go back to the client window, hit reconnect, and I'm back in the game with everything normal all in about 30 secs. However, 30 seconds is still enough that my absence could mean my opponent gets a 20 cs lead or the enemy team gets a tower for free because I wasn't there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yang in 2020","date":"2017-05-28T01:34:08.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update:  Full Repair did NOT resolve the problem and it keeps happening.","replies":[]},{"poster":"revengingangel","date":"2017-06-04T15:15:11.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is widely reported to be caused by the latest Windows updates. It affects all full screen apps.\n\nCuriously, I noticed that when not in a full screen game, periodically a windows would appear and vanish almost faster than I could blink. I wondered if this window loading and then vanishing was responsible. \nHaving ruled out malware, I started to log what times it was happening. For me it was always at the same time, once per hour whatever I was playing. I checked the windows \"Task Scheduler\" and found that a task called \"OfficeBackgroundTaskHandlerRegistration\" was supposedly launching at the same time this window was, and all my minimized games was happening.\n\nI disabled it. So far no minimized games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"co2 equal bad","date":"2017-06-01T19:48:02.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same bug. but for me, it happens at least once a game.

There's also always a chance that you might be hitting your windows key on accident which will pull up the start menu. If that's still happening and you know you aren't hitting anything to make it switch windows, I would try running a quick repair through the client options to see if that fixes it.","replies":[{"poster":"Kirifuda","date":"2017-05-28T04:28:52.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It still happen, one thing to note probably is that this problem start exist recently, like 3 months.
