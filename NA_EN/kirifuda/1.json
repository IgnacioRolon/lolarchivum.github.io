I just noticed that there are 2 partition of my 1 tera HDD( 400 gb c and 600 gb d). My windows 10 is installed on local disk c and therefore there are only 300mb-ish of free space in local c. My question is, is it better to install my games(including LOL) on Local Disk D? Will there any performance penalty (such as longer loading screen, lag, etc). Thank you","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2016-09-01T21:11:33.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is one of them a solid-state disk?

The biggest is that League interacts or utilizes files outside of the League folder, and is less likely to run into issues doing so when installed on the root drive of Windows (in this case, it's C:\\)\n\nLet me know if this cleared this up for you.","replies":[]}]}
