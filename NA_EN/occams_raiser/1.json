Please back this","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":53,"down_votes":19,"body":"Would it be nice to be put in a special queue of honorable players that have been positive so long they get lifted up to a level where they can play with like minded people. I would have wanted this more than the free skin I got. Of course I got an Alistar skin so it was like not getting one at all. This is extended positive reinforcement. I have never been banned, if you haven&#039;t perhaps we would enjoy playing on the same team without wondering, \"do you suck or are you trolling?\" You know I am just having a bad game cause I don&#039;t consistently suck enough to be suspected of being a troll. It would be like having good credit. Build it up to 700 and you get into a Honorable Tier. \n\nI can&#039;t see a down side except from someone that thinks a special club for good people that bad people can&#039;t get into is a bad thing. **There aren&#039;t enough trolls to keep you from rising!** Leaves the trolls be. We will rise above it just like we always do.\n\nSpecial ICON that shows in team builder and and champion select for all queues. Not the honorable banners those are nonsense cause you can lose them for unknown reasons that deal with how many games you play. If I have a credit card with a 700 credit score, my score doesn&#039;t drop and my card doesn&#039;t get closed if I only buy one thing a year. Honor shouldn&#039;t fall off based on games played. Your honor rating should rise every time you play a game that doesn&#039;t result in multi reports. It will go up even faster when you are honored. It is not measured by an average of how many games you play. You could get into EXALTED TIER within 30 games. If you are a troll you will drop out just as fast. \n\nInstead of a skin for good behavior give me serenity and a GG.  \"Congratulations summoner! Due to good behavior in an abundance of games you have been promoted to the EXALTED TIER!\"\n\n\nEDIT: \n\n1. States of being: Troll\\toxic, unskilled\\too casual, normal 50\\50,  Honorable, and EXALTED. You are not simply troll or not. \n\n2. It has been suggested that playing with other EXALTED/HONORABLE should be an optional queue in the \"possible\" event that there would be few in the pool resulting in long wait times. \n\n3.

If riot is right roughly 90% of the players are overall happy. Lyte has done some board experiments where people were asked to point out which games in their history were toxic and then lyte pulled the logs into the game. Their were some toxicity but less than 1%. It was mostly people overly stressed in a game and reading more into something and getting their feelings hurt. Lyte went one step forward and found examples of beyond good sportsmanship in 1 of the last 10 games, while most were just neutral. This brought the fact negative stays with people more than the positive. \n\nMaybe things are not as bad as you think they are. You also could be one of those overly sensitive people that remember the bad more than the good. you are aware less than 5% of the player base uses the boards and maybe 5% of that is making complaint threads. Their just to little in your corner to back you up. ","replies":[{"poster":"Occams Raiser","date":"2015-05-12T04:33:14.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I guess in the end.

Bad credit is actually pretty similar as an example to prisoners' island. The problem isn't that you lose points for not playing enough, the issue is that other players who play more EARN more points. If you create an honor que that is a priority/restricted to the nicest people for access, then it has to be a smaller percentage of the player base so that the normal que still has enough people that the majority of normal que will be neutral or positive players (although not as positive as honor que).\n\nTo do this means that you are looking at an X% restriction rather than a score>X restriction. If good credit was considered the top 5% of credit scores for instance it would not stay static at being good if you're over 700. If people as a whole raised their credit scores, then the new cut off might be 750 or 800. Similarly the ribbon system is based on the top 20% (I believe, but don't quote me on that number) of people with those honors. If you play less you have less opportunity to earn honor, and so when people move up and pass you, the ribbon goes away because you no longer meet the minimum qualification even though your score didn't go down.  For an honor que to work, it would have to look like the ribbon system, because if you set an X minimum score instead of an X% minimum score, than eventually a majority of the community could work to build up enough points to meet the minimum X points required. At that point normal que becomes a low priority prisoners' island where the only people left are new players who just joined, and trolls who will make it difficult to build up honor/positive points as a new player and thus new players are locked into a more toxic que until they can work to get out by making more progress than was required of the previous players who left already. The only way to prevent this is to limit honor que to the top X% instead of a static number, which means that even if you don't get punished or do anything negative you could drop out of honor que privileges because someone below you improved their score and out ranks you now. While I get the sentiment that you want to be able to match with positive players, it could not be based off of the qualifications that were required for stuff like the mystery skin (ie not getting reports, generally being positive) because 95% of players (or something stupid like that) received that skin. Allowing everyone who met that standard to jump ship isn't creating a higher tier option in addition to normal que and low priority, it's just making normal que a permanent low priority que.\n\nI'd love to hear your opinions and I hope I'm wrong and that this was a thread about making a positive reward for people, but if I'm reading it correctly you actually are arguing that you would like prisoners island. I hope this is a better explanation than Qetzel's question, and if there's something I'm missing that changes the logic I outlined here I'd love to hear it. As I see it currently though it would be a punishment system rather than a reward, and would be particularly oppressive to new players in terms of damaging their early experience w/ the game by restricting them to playing w/ trolls and toxic players.","replies":[{"poster":"Occams Raiser","date":"2015-05-10T17:09:19.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  For an honor que to work, it would have to look like the ribbon system, because if you set an X minimum score instead of an X% minimum score, than eventually a majority of the community could work to build up enough points to meet the minimum X points required.\n\nYou are telling me that when we win, I don't get to win anymore. When everyone has a score worthy of being there you can take the needle out of your arm cause you are high enough as it is. That is like thinking the credit card agencies are shaking in their boots wondering if there will ever come a day when there is no one who pays late or goes over their max. \n\nBut to the percentage thing. I suppose their would have to be a cap to how many could be in it. I thought there was a cap to challenger. Just as their are skill gradients, so is there of honor. People don't change like some think. Many become better fakers. It is a survival instinct. But in order for that survival instinct to be triggered, there must be pressure. Riot's current system does not provide that stimulus by way of positive or negative reinforcement.\n\nSad for me, the 2 ways my thinking could be flawed is if the majority of the community really is split into basically 2 groups with very little variance. In this case Riots problem is not eliminating the worst. The other way is one I didn't think about til now. If a small percent of the pop is all that is holding the game together, taking them out makes it unplayable. I consider how pervasive the effects of 1% troll is in total numbers. If you take out the five percent that is good, the troll pop would now break the game of the general pop by \"skyrocketing\" to 3-5%.\nJust by removing 3 million people you make the game unplayable for 27 million.

Credit cards don't worry about credit rating bc if low credit is a PI no one really cares. However, the concept of removing the top 5% of positive players and the concept of earning the honor que after earning a certain number of points are two completely separate issues and the first post you made seemed like you were arguing for honor que after a certain number of points.\n\nIf you do it like challenger or something where you have to be top two hundred (or like 500k out of 30 million or something) the. I think this would work pretty well. It would be like the ribbon system though then where you could win or lose it based on how much other people were playing. With challenger you have to win consistently to move up from masters to challenger, and winning is probably harder than being consistently positive. If you are positive every game then win or lose you will almost always earn positive points when you win. Thus if it is like challenger where you have to stay in the top numbers then the honor que would end up being the people who play the most that are consistently positive bc they would rack up points the way a master'player would if they were winning 90% of their games.\n\nIf you did it the way you said in the first post as getting to an honor number requirement then it would be similar to when ribbons first came out. They were a certain honor level rather than % compared to total players and everyone had them, so if you did it like that then ALL the good players would end up in honor que eventually, and if you did it % based it would be awesome, but would be mostly for players who play a lot rather than good players who play occasionally.","replies":[{"poster":"Occams Raiser","date":"2015-05-10T23:29:03.959+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would be ok with the challenger model if it had to based on play time Cause I wouldn't want a spot taken up by an infrequent player.

If 700 is too low at the end of season 5, they would announce that it was moved to 750. I actually think that they could suspend the system if we were so goodie goodie in mass that the alternative side was becoming the minority. But I think that is wishful thinking. I think players are more consistent than that.
