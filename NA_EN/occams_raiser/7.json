To clarify, I don't think an average bronze 5 player will improve his winrate very much simply by warding as much as the average LCS player does. On the contrary, the effectiveness of warding is drastically reduced at those lower tiers. When laning, I have poor map awareness. It is something I need to work on. The last 20 or so times I have been ganked, I have also had a ward in the river bush, the same direction of approach. Nevertheless, I barely see the gank coming before they walk into lane, and many have said they sat in the bush for several minutes, which I take to mean around 20 seconds or so (because I know they weren't there when the ward went down.) This means I an ward my lane all I want, but it will only marginally improve my laning. On the flipside, after my lane objective has been won or lost, I tend to take the bigger picture of the game into account more than most, buying vision and stealth wards to place in key locations, or to save for warding while we take dragon. I also tend to pay more attention to enemy presence throughout the map, and ping extensively to point out enemy locations, even in teamfights. \n\nI have noticed a phenomenon I like to call Vision Loss by Default. I have realized that even if the enemy jungle is warded, and the enemy is visible in several locations, and I ping out the locations, my team mates will occasionally display out right refusal to look at the places of the map they usually don't have vision. I would give examples, but this post is too long already.\n\nThe point is that whether it is you (me while laning) that is the problem, or your team (my team occasionally after laning), warding is only as effective as often as you look at the map, which means the first step to better vision isn't wards, but looking at the map more often.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Declined","date":"2015-03-11T19:08:18.592+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speaking of recommended builds, when you recommend sightstone could you please recommend the sweeper as well?\n\nI've forgotten about it at least a hundred times probably more, because it isn't in the recommended list when trying to shop quickly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FoggyPaws","date":"2015-03-11T18:31:44.756+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tell who ever has the power, to make whatever their trinket is, to show the upgraded version in the \"essential\" items section of the recommended items list.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2015-09-18T22:19:44.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this mean that you're planning to add it in all recomended builds?

That way, if your team is in the enemy jungle and pushing a tower, you can remove some un-needed wards in your jungle/base without having to wait for a cooldown.
