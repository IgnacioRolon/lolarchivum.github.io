His heal/speedup is very good for jhin and as always bard's ult is game changer. \n{{champion:53}} is very good. Unfortunately the only game I played with blitz our jungler decide to troll because I picked jhin.... You set up a trap under blitz, blitz waits on it, pulls someone, you w, person dies. It is pretty funny. \n{{champion:201}} is not as bad as you would expect. Braum himself will generally apply 2 stacks of his passive so you can usually proc the passive. It will be extended fight so if you playing jhin you will need to have some good decision making when playing with braum. Would not recommend playing whith braum unless you have a few games as jhin already. \n{{champion:40}} is ok. I personally don't particularly like janna support. The shield and peel is nice but it just feels lackluster. \n{{champion:89}} is not bad. Provides a good engage for you. However doesn't provide any peel. In an all in situation 2v2, she is pretty good with jhin. However jhin won't be able to proc leona's passive effectively (like most adc's, unless you are corki). \n{{champion:25}} is pretty good. Morgana has an obvious synergy with jhin. Double snare is pretty powerful. And she provides peel when needed. \n{{champion:267}} is very good. I might be a little biased because nami is my favourite support to play but jhin and nami is very strong. She provides everything jhin needs, speed ups, heals, poke, hard engage, and a hard disengage. \n{{champion:111}} is very good. I played one game with him and we reeked. It was so strong I felt bad for the vayne/nami lane we went against. On a side note, you do not want to play jhin vs a naut support. \n{{champion:16}} is a {{champion:16}}. She is going to heal you..... that's pretty much it. Oh and right, there are some nice plays with her silence and your w. She silences them and you root right away.\n{{champion:44}} is actually pretty good. His stun is impossible to miss and he provides you with a heal and surprising amount of damage.\n{{champion:412}} is okay I think. I didn't lane with a good thresh yet, but from the ones I laned with it seems pretty good. I mean he provides lots of cc to chain with your w so he should be pretty good, as long as he lands hooks.\n{{champion:26}} is pretty good. I liked laning with him. The speed up is pretty nice and his ult is still probably the best ult in the game.\n\nTLDR\n{{champion:53}} {{champion:267}} and {{champion:111}} are my favourite supports for him.\n\nSorry for my terrible English.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2016-02-06T07:56:23.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taric have pretty much always dealt a decent amount of damage though he also always have had a hard time dealing that damage because of his short range and lack of mobility\n\nThough for some reason people never seem to expect it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaeblen","date":"2016-02-06T07:11:00.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"I used to main {{champion:40}} .\nIn her current state, I would be afraid to take her to lane at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Fanny Forecast","date":"2016-02-06T08:29:35.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Explain why?
