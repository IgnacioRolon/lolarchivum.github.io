I've invited my own friends to try League and even when I first started back when Diana was released, there was toxicity issues. A good majority of these issues are caused by the fact that it's a FtP game. When any game becomes popular and free, it tends to attract the worst kinds of people, usually ones who don't even speak the proper English.\n\nDuring my own first level up was a huge issue with Latin Americans. Nowadays I usually see people speaking in Asian languages. I've yet to see anyone speaking in English writing versions of Asian languages do anything but bitch just like back in the day, anyone who spoke Spanish at champ select usually ended up cussing the entire game when some one would die, when they would die, when they were losing, or the game simply wasn't going perfect. \n\nHonestly, it won't be the death of a game to have a toxic community until a new game comes into play for people to jump at.

If you don't care about the punishment, are playing a troll account or say you're with a friend or two that can cycle through this. So very easily abused.\n\nAnd not only that, but current the problem is usually just for one team that has to deal with this. This makes it a problem for both sides. Currently an AFK ruins one team. Now their ruin the game for both. Not saying the other team deserves the win. But you're widening the punishment by making the game a waste of 9 players time instead of 4. And who's to say the other side wont have an AFK of their own. \n\nThe best system I can think of is one where someone else takes the champion over. Use the mastery system to find someone who is at a similar skill level(although it's not really an accurate view of that, but can be used none the less). \nThis player will gain 2x IP for a win, 1.5x IP for a loss. Cannot lose LP, but can gain it for a win(if game is ranked). Players that are on Lyte's naughty list will not get picked. \nA team can choose to vote out said player once, but will be stuck with the second player. \n\nWhile this would probably be very hard to implement since they would have to find a way to find players for that champion that will pick a good match. It leaves very little chance of abuse. Trolls are not as common as the forums will have you believe. If you get one, that's what the vote out is for. If you get a 2nd.
