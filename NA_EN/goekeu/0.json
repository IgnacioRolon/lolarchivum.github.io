When I went on the \"Your Shop\", which is the new feature that gives players special discounts, I noticed that the original prices of these skins seemed unusually high. I checked the store and saw that the prices Riot put on the \"Your Shop\" are way higher than the prices that were on the store. For example, it says that Eternum Rek'Sai was **originally 2325 RP** but in reality, it's actually **1350 RP**. The same thing applied to all of the other skins that were on my \"Your Shop\". However, the prices on my main account were all correct. Is this a bug (which I highly doubt), or is Riot purposefully trying to trick new players in thinking that the deals are way better than they actually are?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-19T21:59:05.127+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"These items are bundled with the champion at a discount.  If you already have the champion unlocked or buy it with IP then you'll see the price get even lower.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Goekeu","date":"2017-05-19T22:43:37.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That makes a lot more sense!
