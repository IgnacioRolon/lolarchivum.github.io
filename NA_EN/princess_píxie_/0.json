We haven't released a specific date just yet for when the skins will be released, but it should happen during this patch!  We often don't release specific dates because sometimes some skins require a last minute bit of polish before we release them live. This may cause it to get delayed by a few days and we don't want to ruin any expectations.\n\nFor now, just sit tight! You'll know when they are available from checking the League website or checking back on the store!  Is there any particular skin your hoping to grab in particular?  :)","replies":[{"poster":"PublicToiletCam2","date":"2017-08-26T15:14:12.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm already pretty hyped for _star guardian soraka_ {{champion:16}} :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Princess Píxie ","date":"2017-08-25T00:08:05.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I'm getting all of the new skins, lol I love them all so I'm just trying to keep calm and not use up any RP so that I have enough.
