Nobody is going to stop flaming or trolling just because you told them to stop or retaliated. In fact, I would argue that a large amount of these people only do what they do to get a reaction out of you. Retaliation only gives them what they want, and it opens you up for being punished yourself.\n\nWhen it comes to chat-related punishments, you don't get a chat restriction for calling someone a \"noob\" once. Instead, the system looks at the frequency of negative behavior. Calling someone a noob once is much different from flaming everyone for extended periods over multiple games. If you check some of the threads here, you'll notice a very large majority falls within the latter category. The exceptions are those who resort to hate speech, death threats, etc. Riot has a zero-tolerance policy regarding these, and are as such punished with 14 day suspensions for the first offense.\n\nExtending chat bans to an essentially unreachable amount of games, especially the way you've suggested, won't help anyone. [The past has shown](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/His0LIBm-perma-ban-can-i-get-a-perma-mute-instead?comment=0001) that increasing chat bans, or removing chat for players altogether, only leads to players finding other ways of expressing their frustration. This typically means troll picks, intentional feeding, and AFKs. The additional restrictions you suggest - such as removal of first win of the day and ranked queue - will only cause these players to act out even more, assuming they continue to play on their account. And if they choose to make a new account instead we're essentially back to where we started.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-05-11T19:56:53.529+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">And punishments should never be the same on all actions...when someone says ''noob'' and someone says ''get cancer'' or ''kys'' there is a big difference between those words,yet they are both punished the same.\n\nThey aren't punished the same. Someone who says \"kys\" or \"get cancer\" will be punished much **faster** and with **less frequency** than someone who only says \"noob\" or \"child\" or similar.\n\n**However**, someone who is constantly calling their teammates noobs/children or berating them in other ways *every game* is going to be punished up to a permanent ban, whereas someone who says \"kys\" once and never says anything toxic ever again will never be permanently banned. It is **not just severity, but frequency** of behavior that gets punished.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-05-11T20:39:54.439+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only people who'd agree with you are the players who are toxic, lack empathy, and lack self-control, which are the players who we do not want playing this game. Neither the community nor Riot will ever tolerate these players. The system is fine and the players who are not toxic are the players who remain here the longest without penalties. I've been here since Beta with the SAME account and remain untouched by the system because I don't do anything to ruin my teammate nor enemy's game. It's not that complex not to be toxic and retaliate against toxic players.\n\nSo no, the system is great.\nMove along.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-05-11T19:00:11.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> when someone says ''noob'' and someone says ''get cancer'' or ''kys'' there is a big difference between those words,yet they are both punished the same.\n\nThey're punished the same in different contexts. Getting a 14-day ban from calling someone a \"noob\" doesn't just happen alone and out of the blue - it's not a first-time thing. Getting a 14-day ban for calling someone a \"noob\" means you've had _at least_ two prior punishments, which means you have a history of negative behavior.\n\nTelling someone to kill themselves earns a 14-day ban as the first punishment.\n\n> And i have seen many players who got perma banned in such cases where they replied back to flaming.\n\nOkay...And? Nobody likes flamers, and counterflaming is still flaming. If someone starts flaming you, mute them in the match and report them after, don't flame them back.\n\n> while this doesn't seem really bad but giving someone who said noob a perma ban is really too much of a reaction towards such a word...\n\nAs mentioned earlier, it's not a reaction to the word. It's a reaction to the player's behavior, their belligerent disregard for the rules after _several prior punishments._ If you can't be bothered to play by the rules, Riot can't be bothered to have you playing their game.\n\n> ...and bans him accordingly uncaring about anything else...\n\nWhat else is there to look at? The IFS judges the behavior of the player being reviewed. That means _one person_, and _nobody else_ for that case. If player A is being reviewed, and player B also said stuff that would merit a punishment (or may be considered context for player A's misbehavior), player A still gets punished, because - regardless of what player B said, player A still broke the rules.\n\n> In general if the chat is always what causes troubles..so why not multiply the chat restriction punishments instead of banning accounts...\n\nBecause Riot has tested indefinitely scaling chat restrictions before. It didn't work. The vast majority of players under longer-duration Chat Restrictions would just resort to gameplay trolling instead.\n\nThe punishment system we have now is fine. The chat restrictions serve as light and moderate warnings for players to stop their behavior, the 14-day ban is the hard warning that the behavior needs to stop, and the permanent ban is Riot's way of saying \"okay, you clearly don't give a shit about the rules, you're not playing anymore.\"","replies":[{"poster":"InstaKill yi","date":"2018-05-11T19:06:13.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"The multiplied chat restrictions from before didn't have the current features...there was no loot or honor or missions or capsules on level up which is the only way to get the current game currency(back then it was IP)..so i think multiplied chat restrictions along with banning them from these current features is new...and if as you said..that such players resort to troll playing then they will be warned with the 14-days suspension followed by perma ban","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-05-11T19:33:05.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The multiplied chat restrictions from before didn't have the current features...there was no loot or honor or missions or capsules on level up which is the only way to get the current game currency(back then it was IP)..so i think multiplied chat restrictions along with banning them from these current features is new...\n\n\"New\" doesn't always mean \"good\".\n\nYou're suggesting that players lose access to things that are, at their core, _base level content_. You're trying to suggest having the punishment system overreach and strip the game down to \"if you break the rules, you just play for the game itself\". And, if you're seriously going to just strip down all of the content to the point that it's just \"Champion and game\", why not just ban them outright then?\n\n'Cause, with punishments of _multiplying_ duration, you're asking them to wait a _helluva long-ass time_ before they can even get small, simple things back (like Champion Capsules from levelling up, Champion Mastery rewards, Missions, etc.). With _that_ much stripped away, for _that_ long of time, you're not even giving the players the room to reform. So, again, _why not just ban them outright and be done with it?_\n\nBeyond that, though, you're ignoring the major facets of what it is you're suggesting punishments strip away.\n\n- Hextech Chests from Champion Mastery (and other Champion Mastery-related rewards) are not about player _behavior_, they're about player _skill_. Sure, there is _some_ coupling with the behavior system as Dishonorable players don't get ambient Key Fragments, so they'd be forced to buy Keys or shape up, but at its core, Champion Mastery has _nothing to do with player behavior_.\n- Missions are side content that, again, is primarily relating to the game itself instead of the player behavior systems. The Missions show up for everyone, and everyone should be allowed to complete them. Likewise, events are meant for _everyone_ to enjoy. If you deny people the ability to participate in events, then, what's the point in them playing anyway?\n- Champion Capsules & Level-Up rewards are literally _core experience_ things. You cannot reasonably cut them off to players even if they break the rules, because, again, at that point, they're not even playing the same game as everyone else. What would be the point in them playing if they're not allowed to unlock Champions, get Blue Essence, etc?\n- And the same goes for Ranked and Hextech Loot & Crafting. Ranked has its own prerequisites and personal rules, and people who get continually punished/refuse to reform will essentially play Ranked for nothing, since end of season rewards are locked behind an Honor Level 2 prerequisite. Hextech Loot & Crafting (like Champion Mastery, Level-Up rewards, and Missions) are base-level content and are separate from the Player Behavior systems.\n\n---\n\n> and if as you said..that such players resort to troll playing then they will be warned with the 14-days suspension followed by perma ban\n\nWhy not skip all the fuss of incrementally expanding Chat Restrictions and cut away the worry of someone turning into a troll and _use the current system which gives 14-day bans on the third chat offense (typically) and permabans on the fourth?_ Like I said, the system we have in place works fine.","replies":[{"poster":"InstaKill yi","date":"2018-05-11T21:56:14.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i'd agree with u when i see that the bans are fairly placed...but they are not in like 80% of the cases i have seen in the past week...a very simple word just like a guy just posted gives him a perma ban...just cuz he told someone who is flaming that he is a ''moron if he thinks flaming would help people play better''..and then people would comment saying he wasn't banned for just this he was banned cuz he had 2 weeks suspension before...while i see that this has no relation at all cuz this 2 weeks suspension was a very long while ago and you dont know if he deserved that or not...cuz in  most cases it was someone replying back to flame and then riot would say replying back makes u as toxic as him thats why u get banned....but u dont know this info till u actually get banned....this doesnt seem fair at all to ban someone for this cuz he had a 2 weeks suspension months ago","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dolyna","date":"2018-05-11T23:30:35.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the system is mostly good, but the punishments can be a little too stiff at times.
