Come on Riot.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"So I have just been permanently banned after one bad game where we had an inting/trolling midlaner and a griefing top who flamed our whole team after performing poorly. I bit back at his remarks and ended up with a permanent ban on my account. I was &quot;toxic&quot; in the sense that I actually argued with the player and swore a few times and called one player an idiot (the dude who was clearly trolling, doing emotes and following me around my jungle camps trying to last-hit everything I was attacking for a solid 2 minutes).\r\n\r\nI started playing a few games last week after a 2 month break, so keep in mind this is the only game I got reported against in the past two months minimum.\r\n\r\nDoes the chat log REALLY display behavior that is so toxic it deserves a permanent ban? I feel like this kinda trash talk/banter/toxicity is pretty damn omnipresent throughout the entire league community. Just look at any streamer and he&#039;ll sound almost exactly like this on a bad game. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I&#039;ve never intentionally fed/trolled/griefed players, especially in ranked. I like the game and the community is alright, but we all have had bad games and not everybody handles it in the most effective manner. It really amazes me that Riot will permanently ban the ACCOUNT for a CHAT-related offense when they can easily permanently MUTE the account instead. If a certain player tilts towards toxicity once in a while but otherwise respects the rules of the game, just take away their ability to use the public chat system? This solution has been so damn obvious for years, but that&#039;s just my two cents.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nMarohi Erqi: WHAT\r\nMarohi Erqi: HOW DID YAS NOT COLIDE WITH RAMMUS\r\nMarohi Erqi: he flew right fucknig through him\r\nMarohi Erqi: too late ffs\r\nMarohi Erqi: dude stfu you let fiora roam like mad\r\nMarohi Erqi: fucking troll\r\nMarohi Erqi: enjoy the report\r\nMarohi Erqi: thats straight griefing\r\nMarohi Erqi: torling?\r\nMarohi Erqi: yea\r\nMarohi Erqi: shes garbo\r\nMarohi Erqi: shes the reason im behind\r\nMarohi Erqi: i was sitting at her lane and she was just fucking up everything\r\nMarohi Erqi: LOL\r\nMarohi Erqi: bruh\r\nMarohi Erqi: i was gold 2 last season\r\nMarohi Erqi: and i stopped playing\r\nMarohi Erqi: meanwhile\r\nMarohi Erqi: akali came to red\r\nMarohi Erqi: and tried taking it\r\nMarohi Erqi: while i was there\r\nMarohi Erqi: LOL\r\nMarohi Erqi: man\r\nMarohi Erqi: i shoulda camped bot\r\nMarohi Erqi: at least you guys know what you&#039;re doing\r\nMarohi Erqi: top and mid are just awful\r\nMarohi Erqi: you&#039;re an idiot akali\r\nMarohi Erqi: unreal\r\nMarohi Erqi: such troll\r\nMarohi Erqi: anyway, gg guys\r\nMarohi Erqi: top and mid were straight griefing all game\r\nMarohi Erqi: dude\r\nMarohi Erqi: you&#039;ve literally contributed nothing to the team\r\nMarohi Erqi: and i was trying to maintain a snowballing yasuo\r\nMarohi Erqi: lol\r\nMarohi Erqi: except\r\nMarohi Erqi: hes blaming us\r\nMarohi Erqi: |\r\nMarohi Erqi: and making it seem like we&#039;re blaming him\r\nMarohi Erqi: LOL\r\nMarohi Erqi: yas\r\nMarohi Erqi: shhh\r\nMarohi Erqi: you faced a legit trolling akali\r\nMarohi Erqi: lol\r\nMarohi Erqi: i aint said anything toxic\r\nMarohi Erqi: i straight up calling facts\r\nMarohi Erqi: draius didnt use teleport for anything but farm\r\nMarohi Erqi: i never blamed you for anything\r\nMarohi Erqi: you said &quot;why does all your farm suck?&quot;\r\nMarohi Erqi: while fiora was tping bot constantly","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-01-27T20:44:12.771+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"What is also obvious is that people who cannot control themselves in chat want to lash out at teammates when they're mad.

I didn't need the chat system whatsoever, in fact I played much better without the constant distraction of other players instigating arguments. \n\nAlso, I call bullshit on pretty much anything Riot says, as they're not legally obliged to tell the truth on a lot of what they post. So for that experiment they conducted, they can legitimately just throw any pile of garbage together and call it \"proof\" that chat mutes would lead to worse behavior/alternative means of expressing discontent. The same applies to \"You are among the 0.006% of players that are toxic enough to be permanently banned\", which is such an obviously biased manipulation of statistics. The link I put below eloquently explains just how dumb Riot is for putting a message like that whenever someone gets permabanned.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/6rNe6xZ3-riot-the-numbers-you-give-for-banned-players-just-dont-add-up-math-inside","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2019-01-27T23:59:15.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So circumstantial evidence which is worth VERY little.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-01-27T23:27:20.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"so....you have your 1 data point vs. RIto's experiment on the entire playerbase of millions.\n\nYou cannot know if you wasn't reported unless you did request your data from Rito support.

Helping players reform\n> 2.) Shielding others from the behavior, at a cost.\n> \n> We used to issue chat restrictions that essentially scaled indefinitely. \n> \n> We were able to determine that after a certain point the penalty no longer helped with reform. The 10-game and 25-game counts for chat restrictions are based on data that they were both light enough, and felt strict enough to encourage people to understand their behavior is unacceptable in game and change it.\n> \n> We also saw that the players in this &#x27;large restriction&#x27; category defaulted to gameplay altering means of harassing their team. It caused an increase in feeding and trolling.\n> \n> The sample size of this population and time frame is huge.
