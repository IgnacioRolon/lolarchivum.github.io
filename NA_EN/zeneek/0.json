It did work initially when it was released but for maybe a year or so the filters haven't worked. I am able to use the drop down menus for the filters and select an option, but when i click go nothing happens and therefore isn't filtered. I have tried using the filters on Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, both of which fail to work. Hopefully someone sees this and can help me as I would like to use the filters regularly (as i did previously) to see past builds and champion stats of mine and friends.","replies":[{"poster":"Zeneek","date":"2017-06-09T03:08:54.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can also confirm it does not work on Firefox or Chrome, but it does work on internet explorer though I would rather not use that...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-09T02:48:13.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The first thing I would do is try [**clearing your browser history and cookies**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752694-Clearing-Browser-History-and-Cookies) to make sure the browser isn't trying to default to past searches you've done.

The weird thing is it worked when it first came out and for a while after, and then one day the filters (or maybe it's just the go button?) just stopped working.","replies":[]},{"poster":"what you deserve","date":"2017-06-09T03:02:48.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=1nmxsUoH,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2017-06-09T03:01:54.378+0000)\n>\n> Hmmmmmmm weeeiiiiird.
