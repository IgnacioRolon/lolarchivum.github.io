I purchased an $1,100 gaming laptop called \"Omen\" by HP. The upgraded one. Every game of league I run around 200+ FPS on ultra everything, randomly throughout the game it oddly drops to 30 fps, that's even on low settings.\r\n\r\nThe only way I can fix it, Is unplugging, the laptop and plugging It right back in. Does anyone have any way or suggestion to keep from  random fps drop?\r\n\r\nNo computer viruses, basically brand new, no clue why this is going on.
