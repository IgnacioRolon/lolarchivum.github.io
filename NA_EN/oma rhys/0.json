I can't find anything online, so I thought that I would ask.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-20T20:54:05.440+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow! I don't see questions like this in Help & Support very often!\n\nLuckily, we have some very talented cosplayers in our team, so I was able to get some reliable advice. They agreed that Fiddle looks about 6 and a half to 7 feet tall, so short stilts would be a great idea!\n\nPlease send me pictures of your finished cosplay, we'd love to see it! ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Oma Rhys","date":"2016-09-20T21:22:09.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow thanks for the fast answer! Once I finish it I'll send you a picture. I haven't started yet so it will take me awhile, and it will be my first cosplay so wish me luck!","replies":[]}]}]}
