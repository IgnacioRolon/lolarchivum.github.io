We also have, not one but two in game clubs for all supports around. We are looking mostly for non-thresh supports mainly because we mostly have thresh mains, and the other support mains are feeling left out :( I&#039;ll provide the information below. Hope to see you around!\n\n___\n\nDiscord Server: Ward More\n\n(Club / Tag / Availability)\nThresh Club: Hook Line &amp; Sinker / H00Kt / (50 / 50) _**The last spot was just taken! Sorry guys._\n\nOther Supports Club: Ward More / !WARD / (6 / 50)\n\nIf you guys are interested in joining either of these clubs then we welcome you! Just add us in-game and we will get you taken care of.\n\nIGN:\n\nA Thresh Main\n\nPowerOfTheStars\n\n___\n\nI figure I might as well tell you about the Discord server a little bit too.\n\nWe are a great community with rooms to discuss builds and strategies. We also have a news room where you can catch up on the latest news for League of Legends. The Ward More server also has game rooms for you and your friends, discussion rooms, and coaching rooms where our coaches can help improve your play without having to pay any fees. Its FREE! because we are here to help each other out. If you guys want to see something done to the server that we haven&#039;t done already, then you can suggest it in our suggestion channel. If you ever have a question we do have a group of moderators that can help you out.\n\nI hope you guys will enjoy the fun that we can help provide, and a community where supports from all around are welcome to help each other out and share new ways to be the best around. So come join us! It will be a lot of fun ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Buzhidog","date":"2016-12-27T06:56:44.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"er, you need to have the Discord Instant Invite, not the name.","replies":[{"poster":"A Thresh Main","date":"2016-12-27T07:04:18.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=McDigits,realm=NA,application-id=K6EGEal2,discussion-id=unWUlAlI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-27T06:56:44.058+0000)\n>\n> er, you need to have the Discord Instant Invite, not the name.\n\nI would but then everyone would join.
