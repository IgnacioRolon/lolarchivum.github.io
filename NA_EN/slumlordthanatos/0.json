Some people love them, some hate them and in either case we're getting as much feedback as we can to improve the system here.\n\nIt's not likely that many feature improvements will be made to the forums. They're very expensive (on development time) to improve relative to the impact of the improvements. Something that takes a few hours to do here would take days or weeks over there. There will be times though when improving something here means it's a lot easier to improve something over there, so we'll absolutely do that. Finally replacing the question marks with summoner icons is a great example of that.\n\nIf you have time could you please get more specific about things that you like and don't like here?

I recently went on the LoL reddit because I was bored and wanted to see if something interested me. Basically everything on the 'hot' tab was esports related, which is boring to me, so I clicked on one that said 'don't nerf twitch and lucian, buff other adcs.' What I saw was that everything that agreed with the premise of the thread (adcs are weak and they should be buffed instead of nerfed) was upvoted and easily visible, while everything that disagreed (lucian and twitch are too strong and need to be nerfed/adcs are fine) were downvoted to the bottom. This had nothing to do with the quality of the post, merely content. Hell, someone in the thread even posted 'and the adc circlejerk is in full swing.'\n\nLike, apperantly you're fine with people just agreeing with each other because they already agreed with that point in the first place, but I don't see what the point of a 'discussion' is if the posts that people will see, the ones that are upvoted, are simply things like 'I agree, I got killed by an assassin last game and it sucked!' while things like 'I disagree, the primary problem with ADCs is their itemization, and buffing them without addressing that would lead to another S2, where ADCs ruled surpeme' get downvoted, based entirely upon the points they are trying to make.","replies":[{"poster":"Pendragon","date":"2014-05-16T00:46:11.240+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"We're certainly planning on making ways for you to opt-out of viewing types of content.

So the reply to the -10 could be +100 and the combined tree will be hire than its peers.\n> \n\nThis also works both ways though don't forget.\n\nThe problem I have is that in a heated discussion, where emotions are high you need to be able to visibly see both sides of the conversation even when its just a few people vs many.\n\nWhat often happens is that a Mob Mentality is created around particularly sensitive subjects.  At that point, any post that isn't in agreement with the Mob is downvoted to obscurity leaving only negative posts that encourage each other to be negative.  This only makes the Mob bigger and skews the perspective of everyone reading it.  It also means that everyone in the Mob feels even more justified in their beliefs.\n\nFor examples of this look at the \"Rengar Rework Strikes Back\" thread, where large portions of the thread become aggressive tantrums directed at Scruffy with huge upvotes on all negative posts and massive downvotes on all positive posts or even Scruffy's own posts.\n\n\nYou said above that the position of a post is determined by the tree not the post itself, as though this will combat it somewhat.  But honestly I can only see this making the problem worse once people understand how it works.  What you're saying is, if I don't like someones post, I can deliberately make a ton of replies to that post saying something like \"DOWNVOTE ME HERP DERP!\" and cause the tree to receive a huge number of downvotes from my replies.\n\nIn the same way a downvoted thread \"may\" be resurrected by people upvoting the replies (which is more unlikely), an upvoted thread can be deliberately tanked by creating downvoted replies (far more likely).  It also means that for every reply made, a single person has an additional point of control over that tree's position.\n\nAs long as its possible to control the position of a post, in any way, there will be people, or more likely large groups of people, who will abuse that system in order to dictate the conversation.  The only reason we don't see that happening here at present is that those same people are too attached to GD, or otherwise haven't worked out how to do it yet...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-05-17T00:51:23.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I actually meant on the other forums versus over here, but this is helpful too\n\nAh, than I'd say the Rengar and Yorick rework threads.

Instead, perhaps give posts both base karma (based on posts and votes) and \"novelty karma\" (perhaps based on a newness factor multiplied by posts/votes). Let the novelty karma fall off Reddit-style, but leave base karma alone.

Your customers are being very direct with you\n\nWhy is it so complicated to understand that a lot of the community simply does not like the Reddit upvote or downvote system that leads to having upvoted threads be more visible? Just remove that system altogether and do something different with the up votes themselves. You can have the upvote counter visible which will attract people to the thread but it's visibility depends on how up to date the post is, like in the old forums. You can have a trending section for the community beta which can help people quickly access high upvote threads w/o them having to crowd out newer posts or constructively controversial ones which may have a net amount closer to zero upvotes because of their nature (say a constructive discussion on balance). Along with that you can implement what you said about following certain Community members if one likes their posts.\n\nReddit's upvote system opens the door to superficial discussion and the risk of having a bunch of \"circlejerk\" threads that don't ammount to anything positive and crowd out better threads. If your mods really want to clean out toxic threads (porn, flaming other players, etc.) you can implement this into your mod upgrading for the forums ahead of time I'm sure. \n\nDoing this people can pick and choose what kinds of threads they like but it gives equal visibility to all threads made while quickly rooting out the bad ones with mid presence. \n\nThis is just some ideas I have but I hope you consider it in upgrading the forums.
