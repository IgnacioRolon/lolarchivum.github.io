Sometimes after I lock in my champion, my game goes crazy and the portraits on my team disappear, the options for my runes/masteries/summoner spells go blank empty boxes with no text (until i hover over them then they magically reappear). Sometimes this glitch gets me kicked from games as I cannot choose  a champ, or sometimes I can have my crashed game window open long enough until after champ select is over and then I can restart my game and reload. This is getting really annoying since I have a built in mini-game within League of Legends that can cost me LP and time ): Please help me fix this issue, mucho annoyingo, thanks in advance","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-31T02:25:11.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like this might be an issue where your network is having a hard time keeping you connected to everyone else in the match.
