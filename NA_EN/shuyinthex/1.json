And if I'm approaching this wrong, please let me know.\n\nAssumptions: ignoring the swap of magic pen for increase of 10%. Assuming rylais is built. Assuming mordes ult is the 10 second dot I read on a wiki. And just looking at liandrys damage as if the underlying spell damage didn't exist.\n\nAt full health mordes ult with new liandrys would do 20% max health with liandrys over the 10 seconds. With current liandrys he would do 33.5163% If all the damage was purely from liandrys. I couldn't find a beautiful equation for liandrys damage in terms of time so I had to do 10 calcs. (So I'm going to be lazy and not repeat this process for an under 50% health starting point) \n\nMy main issue with your statements is you say \"Oh Morde and brand are going to get this percent max health damage added on, it's OP\" but for the most part that damage already exists currently. While I will concede that the argument that mordes ult and brands stuff will become alot stronger as an execute ability and that will be scary, it also means his damage to get you into execute range isn't going to be as high. \n\nIn a different response to your post I mentioned plotting y=.02 vs y=.04 (1-x) to compare liandrys passive damage at points of health from 100-0. No body gave feedback on whether I was interpreting that correctly but it's causing me to view liandrys pbe as just a change instead of a nerf or buff.

Your target has to be half dead already to get any meaningful effect. Sure it may get you a kill here and there when its the only damage source left, but getting a tank to half health to begin with is the hard part. And against squishies, who cares?

Teemo now always does 10% of your health with a shroom - he doesn't even have to be present to kill you. Morde's ult now eats its target and is almost guaranteed to kill even without his Q.
