Instantly bought snow day bard for 675 cause it was in my teemoing shop then didnt buy anything else. Logged in today and suddenly I only have 765RP left. Checked my purchase history, just snow day bard, then checked gifting history and it says I purchased gifts for some people called **[NAMES REDACTED]**. Obviously this was a hack, is there anything I can do about this???? I mean, it's the first time i bought RP so i went big and then i get buttfucked.
