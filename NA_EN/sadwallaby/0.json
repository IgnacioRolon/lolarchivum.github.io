That's fine, I deserve it. Not trying to get out of my punishment. However, the queue keeps breaking. I've played four of my five games in LPQ, but the last game keeps resetting the timer while I'm in the queue. \r\n\r\nInitially it will say 20 minutes remaining, and count down, but somewhere in the middle of the countdown it will reset and go back to 20 minutes remaining and count down again. This is incredibly frustrating. I have waited for 40 minutes three different times now and have't actually gotten into a game to play out my punishment. \r\n\r\nCan somebody PLEASE either tell me how to fix this issue or count my 2+ extra hours in queue for this last game as me serving my punishment? I can't play with my friends because even though they are willing to wait 20 minutes for me, I can't even get into a game.\r\n\r\nProof: Not edited at all, this is going on RIGHT NOW. Note how the time at the right shows I've been counting up for 16:50, but the queue time remaining is 13:41. That would be a 30+ minute queue, but it never actually reaches a game. After it bugs out like this, even if I let the timer hit zero, it will never find a game. \r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/jOqYsvL.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-21T03:27:45.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm yea that's pretty heckin' weird. I wanna have you try a couple quick troubleshooting steps to see if this clears up that remaining LPQ, looks pretty obvious to me that you've already waited long enough!\n\nDo me a quick favor, and try updating your DNS settings to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. If you aren't sure how to do that, check out that step in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). After that, hop into a queue and let me know if you're still stuck with that infinite LPQ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Excell02","date":"2018-01-08T17:30:27.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive gone into queue in LPQ and it reset 4 times for me","replies":[]},{"poster":"haelhTy fRuoTzs","date":"2018-01-02T17:10:00.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im also having the same thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Hasagetnmyass","date":"2018-01-07T01:26:15.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same, this has happened to me multiple times.
