For example, ''woof woof'' was just because my team's thresh was calling everyone dogs for different reasons and even some of the enemy team. He spammed woof woof a lot aswell.

Shouldve just reported the thresh, not talk about him the entire time. There are no stipulations that allow you to break the rules.

I was being serious about post match, all ally team left and I was speaking to the enemy team. That thresh flamed like I havent seen someone flame in years, but he probably really had a bad day so I told them to not report him. Guess I suffered because he reported me (because he didnt like my champion pick, thats where  all his, and subsequencially mine,  flame started) and sona was enemy team doing a weird flank and I said that joking to our team\n\nAlso, when I say things like terrible, or the -_-s, are usually directed at me because some enemy ran away 1 hp or something, so I dont think its really that offensing insulting myself, if that makes sense","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-11-05T08:04:12.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Started when you imitated thresh's dog actions and threatened for no ganks.
