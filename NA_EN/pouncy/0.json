I have had issues like that in the past and they helped quite a bit. You sound irritated but why not give it a whack!\n\nRiot Support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nGood luck :) \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-04T22:05:28.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Pouncy, PeachsProperty, Ontic, \n\nI was having an issue with lag spikes and checked out Riots Connection KB.

I have followed ALL of the suggestions, and I am having massive intermittent lag spikes only since 5.21. Prior to 5.21 I had zero lag at all. I even upgraded my OS (I am on a Mac) and it didn't help. I wish RIOT would actually read and respond to these issues. FUCK THEM and their Spaghetti Code. A blind autistic could code better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XlA3ST7jbu","date":"2015-11-04T21:05:07.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have also been having this problem. It usually occurs late at night (EST). I don't play much during the day so not sure if it's around the clock. Had a game that was literally unplayable (for other people in the match as well). Abilities taking 5+ seconds to go off. Shop kept deactivating so I could not buy things (ARAM). It was odd. Glad I did not get a leaverbuster penalty for that one.\n\nCurrently stuck in a loading game.. everyone is at 100% and the game won't load. Same thing happened before when the lag made the game unbearable. This is not a very enjoyable experience.\n\nI will try some troubleshooting but no other game or application or device has any issue so it's just LoL.. also other people in game having the same problems so it's definitely not my connection.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PeachsProperty","date":"2015-11-04T07:41:29.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know the feeling.\n\nand when ti happens you cant just \"not play\" as you get reported for it..\n\nso ur stuck suffering playing with unplayable ping.\n\nbut basedo n boards we arent the only ones having these issues.","replies":[]}]}
