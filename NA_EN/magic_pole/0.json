You are a complete fucking idiotic balancer and you should have no part in balancing League of Legends. This was an unneeded addition and you completely nerfed the fuck out of swain. Why even rework him if ur gonna nerf the fuck out of him with an only instantly castable W.? \r\n\r\nThe whole point to playing Swain was that you would try to land the skillshot W, yet you made it only be able to be instantly castable.\r\n\r\nyou&#039;re a complete fucking dumbass with your balance &quot;decision&quot;; you let down every actual gamer with your shitty decision to make Swain&#039;s W only instantly castable.\r\n\r\nfucking pathetic. Try to go back to social work or something since you obviously have zero idea how to balance a multiplayer PvP game.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-09-08T04:06:17.977+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You do realize it being that way (is it even that way? Sounds like you messed up a local setting to me) wouldn't even be a *balance* decision, right?
