Vladimir's early game is only strong against Poppy and Akali, and that's because they are melee, Poppy lacks sustain and Akali has poor sustain early, and both of them have no way to all-in Vlad.\n\nAlso, Vladimir has some champions who can absolutely dumpster on him in lane.

Literally all Heim has to do is drop his stun on himself when Yas goes in, move away, and redeploy his turrets.\n\nZyra vastly outpokes Yas early. She can deploy her seeds and plants behind Windwall, and it doesn't stop her ult either. She's just better at zoning than he is. She can farm relatively safely, and Yas doesn't dare to attack her when her E is off cd. \nFor Viktor, its a bit more even. He can't hurt Yas much, but Yas can't outpush Vik, and Vik's Q, W, and Ult make it impossible for Yas to all in him.\nFor Kayle, its almost a complete skill matchup, and really comes down to Kayle's build choices and aggressiveness. She HAS to harass him constantly, otherwise she will lose out.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sinlaire","date":"2015-10-27T22:47:22.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My brother was having a super rough lane against a Yasuo once. so I traded lanes with him.\n\nI was playing Darius on the first Juggernaut patch.
