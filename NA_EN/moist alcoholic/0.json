Item sets aren't ready for the updated client yet, but per that article it's going to get worked on.  The sooner we get everyone on the updated client, the sooner our client devs can work on new features.  Hang tight for now, but feel free to offer any feedback on this through the blog or [client discussion boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion).  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
