Or, rather, the lack of it.\n\nHe's almost completely in shadow and there isn't really any color besides the hints of red. Meanwhile, I'm pretty sure every other Blood Moon splash shows the champion clearly enough that you can get a basic idea for what the skin looks like in game.\n\nHis skin could be a bit darker and the rope around his waist could be a bit tighter to better reflect the splash, but honestly, that's my only real complaint. That and his wings look like feather dusters that got mauled by a cat. Those should be a bit fuller and clearly defined as wings instead of some weird blob could just be the angle though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Archlord Aatrox","date":"2019-01-10T19:27:52.931+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"yes cuz ur supposed to speak for everyone who plays aatrox, k","replies":[]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2019-01-10T19:06:07.759+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"he actually went from lvl 100 mafia boss to lvl 1 noob\ncmon riot this is NOT how mafia works!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Camille FerrÃ¸s","date":"2019-01-10T19:12:59.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FOR JUSTICE,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=86iHJ7Qa,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-01-10T19:06:07.759+0000)\n>\n> he actually went from lvl 100 mafia boss to lvl 1 noob\n> cmon riot this is NOT how mafia works!!!\n\nloool","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2019-01-10T19:08:27.668+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"looks like some Legion Emerald nightmare mog.\n\nbut we got the P R E S T I E G E edition tho","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tin Obliterates","date":"2019-01-10T19:09:15.883+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"*But I think it's ok.*","replies":[]},{"poster":"d00mface","date":"2019-01-10T23:22:49.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sure he is to somebody's liking, but those crusty feet? that weird uncanny human face? the hair?
