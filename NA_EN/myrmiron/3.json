However, saying them in game can lead to a punishment. This means if some board user read your post and believed they could say those in game without receiving punishment. Obviously you know if you said thise and were reported, you would most likely be punished. Which means your post was flagged as encourging others to break the rules; even if it wasn't your intention.\n\nCensoring too many words in game can lead to accidental blockings in communication.
