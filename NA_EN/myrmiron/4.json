Pretty sure the system is just throwing out LP for nothing.\nThis feels to me like first few weeks of S9 where D5 players got Master with a 40% winrate.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-07-21T16:15:55.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's +98 because of two things:\n\n1) The rankings are brand new (no historical MMR on ANYONE)\n2) The game count is low (All new accounts have larger than normal LP swings)\n3) The game's LP is designed to allow 3 winners, not 1. In other words, people who consistently rank 1, will exponentially rank faster than rank 3's, while all 5 people below 3 will lose LP. In other words, you have a 5/8 chance to lose LP. Once people are actually skilled at this game, that WILL matter. Getting into the top 3 will become extremely difficult, and in reality you'll get to a point where you have a 45-40% win rate on average.
