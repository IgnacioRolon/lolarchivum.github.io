This right here, is why I feel the moderation team here does an excellent job under difficult circumstances. In addition to doing the dirty work (cleaning up the ad hominem, removing all the shitposts, etc), you reopen threads when they may have been closed prematurely, closed for the wrong reasons, or just closed temporarily for a \"cleanse\".\n\n\n#Go mods!\n---\nSide note, \"hominem\" is marked in Chrome as misspelled, and it's only correction is \"Eminem\"...makes me sad.","replies":[{"poster":"Despìca Bìll","date":"2018-12-01T07:59:35.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL....\"eminem\".....I weep....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2018-11-29T21:09:56.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} This is an \"ad Eminem\" obviously:\n\nhttps://perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/eminem-new-album.gif\n\n\n*also ty for your kind words to the mod team, they really are a great bunch of folks*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Myrmiron","date":"2018-11-28T07:06:23.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KittySuppSquad,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=nEHxEsZU,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-11-28T02:08:19.673+0000)\n>\n> Hello Myrmiron after disscussion I will be unlocking your thread again seeing as the bad comments have been taken care of.
