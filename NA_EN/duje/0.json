But, if a champ is bad for the 1%, then there is perhaps a counterplay to learn instead of whining why some champs are annoying?\n\nI noticed that most people DO NOT USE THE COUNTERPLAY AVAILABLE. They literally play and continue to make the same mistakes and not fix them. An example of this is Ahri. Ahri has one of if not the MOST counterplay in game, and in highelo she is nearly nonexistence. \n\nWhy? That is because she has clear counterplays to her kit that is easily abuseable. However, you have majority of the playerbase crying instead of trying to learn. \n\nAhri WAS nerfed because of the majority. Like you said, the trash majority players.\n\nIs it fair?

That is why he got a nerf, because in higher elo he was dominating. Sol is a hard champion to play, but when you master him you become insanely powerful. It is unfortunate that he becomes even worse in lower elos because you hardly see him anymore, but its for the greater cause.","replies":[{"poster":"duje","date":"2018-11-16T18:11:06.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not 3 hard nurfs deserving, some nurfs, yes.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2018-11-17T06:58:19.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Debatable, I mean Ryze and Sejuani have been nerfed repeatedly and they were never out of line in majority of ELO's.
