But even there you find people who want to win so badly that they would go above and below and i mean DEEP below any measures, and then also tilt you over the chat by calling you bad.\n\nsome people are in normals for a wake up, some have a miserable day and want to chill down from a not-so-serious game, some just wanna learn a new champ. but can&#039;t do that either because somebody Needs to be a dick and rub toxic arrogance into their face because they cannot go to ranked and showoff their &quot;Skill&quot; to where it really matters.\n\nTryharding has, as far as i am concerned, only provided two Things. Toxic arrogance and promotion of flaming attitudes between teams, both in the other fraction respectively and amongs each team&#039;s individual members. I know of not one Person who can say they are proud of doing it (this excludes any bronze Players, obviously), nor do i know any Person who does not feel pissed off at the very thought of going something more laid back and chilled like a {{champion:75}}  toplane to have an easy, calm, frozen lane thats only about farming but Keep being towerdived because the enemy just won&#039;t take the chillpill.\n(sidenote, i know someone will now assume i talk about myself. this wouldn&#039;t be much of a truth if noone did. but no, i talk about an associate who is on temporary break from league entirely thanks to that. incase noone believes me, check matchmaking history. no Nasus games for quite a while)\n\nAs far as me, and everyone of my many friends are concerned, tryharding in any place that is not the ranked games has only been further boosting and promoting toxicity and is the very root of stuff like &quot;git gud&quot; and &quot;noob bronzie&quot; and many other forms of degration for your enemy or for you incase the enemy is the one who is doing this.\n\nshould you really feel bad because you are not being truly 100% serious? Does anybody for that matter really Need to think of themselves as shit because they as a first time (insert champion) are being rekt by a (insert another champion) main that Needs to show off in normals because he keeps losing rankeds?\n\nShould the abusive addiction for win anywhere outside ranked be considered an actual abuse? Sure, winning still is a Thing to do, since league is more or less Build around that very Thing, but does it Need to be at the expense of others selfesteem and confidence aswell as your own pride as a human being? We have already enough toxicity IN ranked as it stands, we really should deserve some place where we can be 10 Players and just be chill and have a break from mental stress. Do you think so too? \n\nIf you agree, be welcome to **downvote** this post. \n\nhave a nice day everyone, and Special thanks to every Person answering {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Fuzzi","date":"2017-05-18T08:56:14.578+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"You heard it here first, folks.\n\nTrying to do well in a game is abusive. Employing effective strategy and critical thinking is abusive.\n\nYou know, we should have all damage be replaced by healing. And instead, everyone is on one team of ten, and they all have to hug each other and heal each other for fifteen minutes. Then a fanfare plays and everybody wins.\n\nNo, you poncebucket. \"Tryharding\"-- that is, trying to win in the terms of anyone but a high schooler-- is just one of many ways to approach the game. And if you can't beat it, join it.\n\nOr, you know, post on Boards about how you got beaten in a game? I guess? If you don't like people competing and doing things like diving and securing a distant kill over a length of time, then you should play in ten-man games where you've 5v5 on the same page.\n\nDon't go into a game and ask people to not properly lane against you. You're not going to get better by playing some weird farming mini-game with your lanemate. That's not how the competitive scene is and that's not what training is. Training is getting better. What you're talking about is a premade match and people do it all the time, I'm sure, in a game as expansive as League.\n\nPlease.\n\nDon't _ever_ call it abusive. Don't _ever_ demean playing well in League of Legends. It's not good. It's not healthy. And moreover, it promotes the kind of League where people freely AFK, harass and feed without repercussion.\n\nOn the other hand, the chat thing is toxicity and you should mute and report and move on.

It's usually just that these discussions tend to amount to, \"Well, I'm looking for X game experience and others are obligated to provide it.\" I could get into how MMO games are kind of a metaphor for life, but...\n\nOn the topic of farming minigames, they're very much part of the process. Letting them happen is not how you want to face that champion and is not a reflection of how the game should go; even if two of them are in lane, it's not a good thing. Nasus and Veigar are about as dangerous as farming minigames get, given they're stacking limitless damage. A Nasus who has been actively denied his stacks, and a Nasus who has freely stacked are playing vastly differently at all levels except that 1-4 gap, maybe; right off the bat, the latter Nasus has an entire extra source of viable damage, while the former might see 200 damage off his Q with a Sheen. Likewise, they're probably going to be relying on their skills in different ways. Former Nasus' spirit fire is going to keep him safe in lane; latter Nasus' spirit fire is going to provide an arena. An especially evil Nasus could grab a Rylai's for it, enjoying a modicum of scaling and a constant 20% slow in it... but that's off-meta shit, we ain't here for that.\n\nOn the topic of tryharding... could you give it to me brief? I'm under the impression it's literally just the behavior associated with winning (albeit thoroughly), just in the wrong context (supposed to be normals, in this case).\n\nI might air you in bots; for instance, a teammate driving all the proper behaviors and riding others' asses for not doing so (say, slamming a Sona player in bots for not buying support, or warding bushes). Bots really are the 'casual' mode of the game where 'anything should go,' as a general rule.","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2017-05-18T09:25:20.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you seem a lot more reasonable and nicer than most people, guess i owe you the respect of answering properly now XD\n\nwell, as far as i have been taught and experienced it, tryharding is described as the unfair methods of winning game. towerdiving in EVERY exchange you can, poking as a champ who lacks any harrass just to win a trade, and so on. Tryharding would, if you needed the most extreme common example, be if you as a really fed champions who can more or less oneshot with a single ability (let's take the example of renekton with thunderlords, full ad Build, 12/0 and has W maxed out) and you Need to burn both flash and ignite, spend your ult and go on a full Skill rotation to kill the 0/10 semi-afk or an inter just so you can write in all chat how good you are.\nThat is, only one examplary case of a specific case. \n\nas for the farming topic, just a quick note to close that topic, i can tell you have a good point, but honestly, that experience not only differs between good and bad champ Players, it also differs from good and bad Players...i have seen Nasus mains farm breaklessly without ever fighting till minute 50 and pulling the very well known meme of \"guys, i have 1000 stacks now, we can win...guys? dont surr. please?\" and so on, and then ive met Nasus Players who would receive 5 ganks in 5 minutes against an Opponent whos even more passive than he is early. namely gp.\n\nback to the Explanation of tryharding. i gave you an example, and that is how i have been experiencing it, how i have been taught by the people who first welcomed me to league and how i see many people describe it aswell. it is basically abusing any Advantage given just for the sake of proclaiming victory and a misplaced sense of superior Skill. like i said, abusing trolls to the full potential, and any other form of unfair Play. while many people will claim that tryharding is also stuff like camping, it really depends on the situation. if it is for the sole reason of abuse and trigger of tilt, it might categorize into tryhard, assuming it does not go into harrassment. \nSame goes for people who are new to the pvp. there are new Players who are first gonna Level up some in bots to get their masteries and runes just a bit filled, but then start trying pvp too. and tryharding in a more commonly defined matter would be abusing the very fact that this Person was very new to the game to not only win, but make them feel bad for themselves over it too. If i see someone is very new to either the game or their champion, i honestly am not gonna be this dick and give them some free space to pick up what they do. it is only fair to do so, and while league of legends is a competitive game and all about winning in the sense, does it really feel satisfying or fun doing it so....dishonorably? \n\nand last but not least, i know there is still bots, but most people only Play them as the tutorial when they first start out in league. while it is true that in bots you almost always can get a more calm and \"casual\" experience as you named it, it really feels more like an tutorial for league itself, and not for the content inside it.\nnow this specific point of view is personal, i do not claim it to be a true fact, but i assume it to be the case because it would be the most reasonable Explanation as to why there is no such Thing as tryharding in botgames","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Fuzzi","date":"2017-05-18T10:02:11.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm going to peel away from 'tryharding' and try to explain my current opinion of the meta, to lend some clarity.\n\n(There's a TL;DR at the bottom...)\n\nA lot of the hard-hitting champions who get a lot of attention (see Fizz, LeBlanc, Zed, Yasuo, Yi, Lee Sin, the list goes on...) are usually comprised of three simple elements.\n\n1) Burst, n' lots of it! No sustain here; your damage is neatly delivered in about 2.5-6.0 second, and it hurts! These champions can usually apply it safely, applying it from a range or with the tools needed to enter and exit combat.\n\n2) Simple, fast-paced patterns. While Zed is about as complex as that list gets (despite what Yasuo and Lee can do on the ceiling), they're still all doing the same thing more or less-- avoiding damage and dealing lots of it. There's little chargeup, things aren't usually terribly protracted, and it all happens relatively quickly and repeatedly.\n\n3) Mobility is at an all-time prime. The current meta unfortunately very much favours moving around as quickly as possible, and this is generally hand-in-hand with your enemies being dead (or you being dead for your enemies); it affords the entire team that much more pressure and potential, and sets back the enemy team that much presence. Moving quickly between kills and laning is how a game is won efficiently and quickly nowadays.\n\nBasically-- and I'm sure I can't be the only one noticing it-- things are favouring champions who deal their damage quickly and can move around, either the fight or the battlefield, with greater ease. This means gameplay is generally turning more into what you described; plays are rushdowns that start and end with your health bar on two totally different colours and it takes, like, three seconds if you're lucky. If you're unlucky, you're CC'd for one or two of those.\n\nIt's where the meta's going as far as gameplay is concerned. These kinds of plays are directly rewarded and generally do feel good to pull off (and crap to have pulled on) and since so many items are more than just stat sticks, things like Luden's and Death's Dance, extra gold quickly becomes new ways to enjoy your champion stomping. And each build can be so critically changing-- phantom, IE and Death's Dance are all high-impact builds and that's half your build right there-- that it's like a rush getting there, achieving not just that added damage but the extra bells and whistles, the little colourful numbers. All of those numbers, flying everywhere. Sweet, sweet numbers...\n\nSo as for your experiences being tower-dived, that's just what the game wants. Unfortunately, there's not much you can do to change it. Fortunately, there are champions designed around doing it... and ones designed around stopping it. In fact, there are entire champions like Rammus and Galio designed to stop one champion from being such a huge threat. If you have troubles with that rushdown style of play that champs like Fiora and Graves are guilty of, consider someone who flourishes greatly in close combat. I personally recommend Darius because he's a goddam balla balla shot calla. But there are also options like Gangplank and Nasus who enjoy pretty comfortable lanes and safety.\n\nYou would have no problem with this if you faced an opponent who, say, lauded your efforts at the end; so much as a \"well fought!\" or \"that got tense, well played!\" or something like \"you had me at a few points, good game!\"-- or at the least it would feel less like you were having the fact rubbed in your face.\n\nAnd that's where we-- that is, 'we,' the ubiquitous reader-- and you simply differ in our explanations.\n\nYou're facing toxicity, no doubt about it. Rushdowns get victories, and victories cover the ass when one starts talking shit to everyone. Because the current meta favours these champions, they're popular; and because they're popular, the winning strategies, builds and patterns are well-known and well-documented. Because of all this, you're like as not to run into shitty attitudes on winning picks/builds, because it's the most conducive way to galvanize their garbage attitude. They're otherwise the one AFKing or running circles around nexus, trolling, because jungle clearly pinged that they were going bot, but it's totally their fault that they didn't gank for top when they went in without pinging. Or some such inane drivel; people get so mad over the game.\n\n(And the TL;DR...)\n\nBut that's my take on it; you're mad at the attitude. The rushdown playstyle is merely a target because it's easy to attach to the attitude, as the meta-supported route of least resistance pick-wise; fact is, if that very same rushdown opponent wasn't being a huge douche canoe about it, I'm not so certain you'd be aggrieved as such. In fact, you'd probably have a fun lane in a norm against someone whose attitude was right about it.\n\nWhat say you?","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2017-05-18T10:41:53.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you have a fair point regarding why the attitude exists, and how people can (and will) justify it. i honestly wont deny i would be far less tilted if the Person would just rekt me without rubbing it in my face, but it is not the wrecking but that they feel the Need to express it with arrogance that grinds my gears and what ruins the experience a lot. i stopped playing ranked alltogether to escape that attitude, but it had to chase me down didnt it? \n\nanyway, you got a fair point regarding the \"why\", but i still have, and many others do too, a major Problem with the \"what\". and with the \"where\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TEA Nietzsche ","date":"2017-05-18T09:49:15.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> well, as far as i have been taught and experienced it, tryharding is described as the unfair methods of winning game. towerdiving in EVERY exchange you can, poking as a champ who lacks any harrass just to win a trade, and so on.

Keeping with your Nasus example, sometimes you have to dive your opponent if you want to avoid being oneshot at 20. You need to keep in mind that some players simply have a higher base lvl of play so if they crush you in lane they may not even be tryharding, they could be totally relaxed. \n\nI kinda dislike tryharding in normals too, but that doesn't refer to how you play but rather how you behave. Recently I've had a Master Yi who told us everyones elo in the enemy team, told me that the Shen I was up against would be inexperienced and that I should crush him (cuz he was only low plat or sth). The only thing I wanted to to is try whether I could still play aggressive against Shen after the changes - turns out I couldn't, so I died. Now, while I came back later and 1v1d the Shen, this Master Yi would still try to micromanage me and tell me how to play Riven.\n\nThis is something that I'd call tryharding: he cared WAY too much about this normal game and focused super hard on winning it rather than just practising something. Micromanaging and the other stuff this Yi did is something I'd consider tryharding.\n\n> just so you can write in all chat how good you are.\n> That is, only one examplary case of a specific case. \n\nThat, on the other hand, is simply toxicity.

Thats one of widely used tactics and is allowed. Stop trying to make up your own rules. As long as you arent verbally abusing anyone its fine. Ingame bullying of your opponent is not just allowed, but encouraged. Some champions are designed for that. My DUO and me quite often camp top laner , not allowing him to get to minions or to farm.
