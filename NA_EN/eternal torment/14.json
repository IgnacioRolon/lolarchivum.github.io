Early duelist junglers have become so meta that your game is an absolute guaranteed loss if you don&#039;t pick either {{champion:11}} {{champion:5}} or {{champion:77}}. 26 games lost in a row, IN A ROW, simply because in every game the enemy had one of those three champions.\n\n3x the killscore? Doesn&#039;t matter.\n\ngot all three enemy inhibs down pre-20 minutes? Doesn&#039;t fucking matter!\n\nScored all objectives, baron and dragon? DOESN&#039;T FUCKING MATTER!!\n\n3 enemies inting and trying to FF? **DOESN&#039;T FUCKING MATTER!!!!**\n\nIt doesn't matter what kind of advantage or how many we have, simply the enemy having one of those and us not is PROMISING them a free win. Why even play a game if i am doomed to lose it if i don't join one circlejerk or the other? what kind of bullshit is this? \n\nHas Riot not learned a single thing from the years this game has been run? A Meta that puts even one of those three, let alone all of them in pick or ban positions is toxic in itself. there is no argument and no justification for it, those champion&#039;s shouldn&#039;t be able to shift the entire course of a game solely by existing! For fucks sake, i can&#039;t believe im joining the circlejerk but fucking undo those scuttle changes. They are the worst thing you&#039;ve done since the rengar rework, and nearly nobody believed that a fuckup of such scale was possible anymore.\n\nThis is a ridiculous disappointment. I&#039;ve reached the point where I am scared to enter any game that isn&#039;t trollfest gathering aka draft pick. Fucking pull your shit together Riot, we can deal with your mistakes but we can&#039;t accept you not fixing them.\n\nEdit; ofc people are gonna disagree in public. can't have a complaint that is against the very thing you so openly abuse. Fuck this, 26 losses and unless i put myself in the extremely uncomfortable position of playing those 3 circlejerk douchebags of a champ i won't get any less. League has lost all it's fun aspects and enforced to be played only for the win. Say and vote what you want, you know theres truth in this crap of a complaint.
