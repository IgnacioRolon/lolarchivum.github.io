Whenever it is a Review, a comment, or a suggestion. I just somehow say something that seems to envoke the deepest negativity in people. Doesn&#039;t Need to be an Insult, neither literally not in meaning. I have also seen myself become increasingly easy to provoke and i daresay admit that i had some very toxic moments, even if i did not directly Insult someone, it has been very clear to me that i have been giving some pretty offensive comments on both the boards and in league of legends ingame, and i really don&#039;t like where i am growing into.\r\n\r\nAnd i got no idea how to better myself at that, honestly. that is why i am opening myself about it to the community.\r\n\r\nI have lately been making a lot of, let&#039;s just say negative attention, and it has been giving me some upsetting thoughts to follow with it. And while it is true i had some good and reasonable and even funny conversations, most lately have just been back-and-forth Insults, him insulting my intelligence, me answering on the same Level, reasonlessly flaming each others on vulgar Levels and so on.\r\n\r\nBut i do not blame it on them, i blame it on myself. I can&#039;t tell what i do wrong, but i do something wrong, when i for example make a comment on possible balance suggestions or make a suggestion myself, no matter how well the idea was well-credited, i find myself drowning in negative replies and votes. \r\n\r\nSure, most people will now tell me to do some of the protocol stuff like &quot;no negativity, don&#039;t appear tilted, no swearing, be respectful&quot; and ingame there would be more or less the same old &quot;mute and report&quot; but even when i do all of that, i lack something else, this one last Little part that would help me appear with more Appeal to the community and playerbase, that would help me be more open and communicative and appreciated aswell as let me return those points to others.\r\n\r\nBUT there is also that Problem of me possibly forcing myself into These correct behaviours that would feel forced and even fake, i want to learn how to be a better Person and not really shape myself into one. I do have some good moments, where i can be myself with 0 traces of negativity, but the longer i Play this game, the more i feel it dissapearing. \r\n\r\nI used to be toxic way back when i joined league and had my 10 game long chat restriction, and i tried to learn from it and for a time it worked, but now that i am being more and more active with league, it is dropping more and more into a lower place again.\r\n\r\nso to make it short: how do i become a better Person in the league of legends boards and community without becoming a fake? What can i do to be more positively appealing? how can i be a better Person?\r\n\r\nadmitting that i am growing toxic wasn&#039;t easy for me, and that i am already bad at socializing makes it no better, but i want to change for the better, and i trust the community with this issue and that i can at least just a Little bit get better.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-21T20:03:48.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If there is no meme, there is no thread.\n\nThe whole point of these boards is to meme, meme more and roast kids that ask why they got banned for excessive homophobia, racism and flaming.

My issue is not much with what Kind of Person i am in General, my issue is with that Kind of Person i am on here, and how it will affect what Person i am as a whole if nothing changes.\n\nit may be that only i can help myself, but even then, i have no idea how. my negative behaviour in These boards and in this game is what i want to work at.","replies":[{"poster":"KORGtuners","date":"2017-05-21T20:13:13.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> it may be that only i can help myself, but even then, i have no idea how. my negative behaviour in These boards and in this game is what i want to work at.\n\nStop participating? You can't be negative in game if you aren't actually in the game. You can't be a negative person because of this game if you don't participate in this game. \n\nPardon the crude analogy, hanging out with drug abusers while they are abusing drugs is going to make it harder for you to not do drugs.","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2017-05-21T20:22:21.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"does Sound Logical, but i really wanna Keep playing this game and stay a part of this community. it has grown to me and i really like this place, that is, again, why i ask for possible hints and advices. i believe that i can be a better, less toxic Person for league without needing to actually quit it","replies":[{"poster":"KORGtuners","date":"2017-05-21T21:00:06.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> but i really wanna Keep playing this game and stay a part of this community.\n\nJust making sure you realize this is addiction.
