Words ending with a short 'e' followed directly by a 't' are somewhat uncommon in the English language, but there are a number that end in a short 'e' followed by 'nt' that are in somewhat regular usage ('current' is a good example).  As a result of this, some people have a strong subconscious tendency to 'fix' words like turret that aren't 'normal', and will pronounce the non-existent 'n' in the ending syllable of the word.  One of the more ironic examples of this is found in the voiceovers for GLaDOS in Portal 2, although she usually does not clearly pronounce 'turret' one way or the other.  Interestingly, the same thing happens with other uncommon cases of a short 'e' followed immediately by a hard consonant, but this particular case is one of the only ones to become commonplace.","replies":[{"poster":"Corrupt Bliss","date":"2017-08-27T04:07:28.186+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for this tid-bit of knowledge!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ego Sum Redemit","date":"2017-08-27T01:26:56.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"KNOWLEDGE IS POWER. \n\n+1 for maximum academic merit\n\nEdit: The word 'turret' does have an almost 'incomplete' feeling off the tongue when you get to the end of it.","replies":[{"poster":"ahferroin7","date":"2017-08-27T02:39:18.269+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same could be said about a lot of words English borrowed from foreign languages TBH ('turret' comes from the Old French 'tourette', which means 'little tower', which I find kind of ironic considering the original discussion).\n\nOverall though, it's a great example of how what languages you know influences your subconscious thought processes.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Aishi","date":"2017-08-27T15:22:52.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"aren't all english words borrowed from foreign languages though? considering english is basically french and saxon fused together XD","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-08-26T21:33:22.534+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":">It IS NOT\nI REPEAT NOT\nTURRENT\n\nBlabbering fool.
