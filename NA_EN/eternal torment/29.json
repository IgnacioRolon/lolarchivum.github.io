Here is why.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":25,"down_votes":8,"body":"Honestly, Most people keep complaining about Zoe&#039;s Q-E Damage and synergy when that isn&#039;t even the biggest problem about her. Sure, her burst is stupidly frustrating AND safe, but if you were to ask me, I think her problem is her W.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nShort version: It literally breaks the game\r\n\r\nLong version: Within League of Legends, there are certain mechanical aspects that could be considered the Fundamental Laws of this game and how it works. They are always simple to understand, such as: If you have 0 HP, you are dead. Simple, and true in all cases.\r\nOne such Fundamental Law is that Each Champion, or in other words Each Player, is restricted to two summoners of their choice, said choice made in the Champion Select.\r\n\r\nSo Someone here explain me who had the idea to smoke so much weed that they thought it was shits and giggles to **BREAK A FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF LOLS GAMING MECHANICS AND INVENT A CHAMPION WITH THE CAPABILITY OF USING THE ENTIRE SUMMONER SPELLS ROSTER, OR 4 TO 10 FLASHES IN A ROW, IN A SINGLE GAME!!**\r\nBecause of Zoe&#039;s W she can straight up **CHEAT** Summoner spells cooldowns by randomly popping them from minions, or use the enemy&#039;s summoners because they were dumb enough to use it. \r\n\r\nSummoner spells were meant to be high cooldown-high impact aces in the hole to empower **YOUR** temporary momentum. Instead, with Zoe, You go full Mark Fuhrman on that fact and use other&#039;s summoner spells against them. The very Idea that you, and very commonly I add, you can proc two ignites in a row for 8 seconds of constant true damage that demolish any healing you have is absurd and I daresay a legalized cheat. Worse if that is possible to do, and as said, highly common in early game.\r\n\r\nZoe&#039;s W Should be reworked on the spot, she is literally the first step to **ACTUALLY BREAKING THIS GAME**. No champion should be **ALLOWED** to cheat the game&#039;s core mechanics which are laws indiscriminatingly in effect for **EVERY. SINGLE. PLAYER. EVER**.\r\n\r\nWhy even script if you can just use zoe? Abuse Summoner spell spam and get away with it completely because guess what? Riot made it, so they allow it. Unconditionally no less.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I am aware that I sound, or in this case write, really fucking salty. It&#039;s because I am slowly but surely getting tired of people complainging about the right champions but over the wrong reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2018-08-03T05:45:19.410+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want Cleanse and Exhaust to be removed from drops she can get.

I've played Zoe, had good games, had bad games. She has terrible early game damage outside of her W, which you can deny at that point because her waveclear sucks, unless she uses minion dematerializer(I was sucking with Zoe until I started using it like everyone else).

Useing a sommoner spell is and always should be trading a big CD for an advantage, and everyone has acces to that. Vs Zoe, you don&#x27;t, becuase if you use you&#x27;re summoner against her, she will throw it back at you and on top of that gain a massive speedboost and solid extra damage, so useing summoners agaonst her puts me into a disasvantage which is the opposit of what should happen.\n> Even worse, it&#x27;s also stealing item actives the same way, so investing gold for that active ends up with you either not useing the active or giving Zoe an advantage over you. She makes you feel bad about getting any item with active just by her raw existance, and i have no idea how riot could ever allow something like that in the game.\n\nI think maybe it's true that item actives shouldn't be part of the formula, but I feel like Riot did a really good thing with Zoe and flash. It makes people think twice about taking flash(even though people still do) vs her, because if you flash, she flashes, assuming she can get in range to pick it up without being pushed off of it. People complained about flash being so dominant, and Zoe offers a means to make it less dominant, but people still choose to take it despite knowing it'll give Zoe more of an advantage. I guess old habits die hard.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Eternal Torment,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ym2XAkHh,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2018-08-03T12:13:53.947+0000)\n>\n> The problem isn&#x27;t even primarily the power up she gets from it. it&#x27;s the fact she can get summ spells beyond her own two to begin with. That is straight up a cheat in the system Riot legalizes and her Earlygame is halfway balanced around just it, the other half being a successful E-Q combo. One skill shouldn&#x27;t be the entire A and O of someone&#x27;s phase. That, if anything, underlines how bad of a balance the skill has.\n> \n> And Zoe doesn&#x27;t have waveclear...up until lvl 5 where her Q starts to actually hit hard on it&#x27;s own and with it&#x27;s AoE she can demolish a minion lineup. Sure, it&#x27;s not ideal by far but she can play around it just fine without needing a damn summoner spells to get her laning phase done. \n> \n> Last but not least. Zoe&#x27;s stats are winrates for games, not winrates for lanes. Zoe is made to win lane, and thats what she does. Whether the game is one is another story, but god fucking DAMNIT is it hard to lose lane when youre a Zoe player simply because of her W.\n\nIs it now?  Aurelion Sol seems to dumpster her pretty hard, as does Wukong(although not a traditional mid laner), Kled(same as before), Malzahar, Annie, Anivia, Lux, Swain, Zilean, Fizz, Pantheon, and several others. She has a positive win rate vs 15 champions, and a negative win rate(going down as far as 40%) vs the other 30 listed for mid laners. Out of those, quite a few stay in the lead for the whole game, or at least surpass her by the 10 minute mark.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=GayFluffyUnicorn,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ym2XAkHh,comment-id=0002000000000001,timestamp=2018-08-03T21:08:20.282+0000)\n>\n> Play safe for 6 cannon waves. \n> Every second wave is a cannon. \n> 12 waves.\n> 6 minutes of me not getting to play league of legends because zoe is a thing. \n> Great design, no problem here.\n\nDid you miss the part of \"Or zone her away from the pickups\"? Zoe can't even come near you in the laning phase until 6 without flash, and if she flashes you can cleanse. If she has ignite you can both cleanse her bubble and her ignite for a 2 for 1 negating a ton of damage. Zoe's weak af early. Maybe she is a problem when she uses electrocute. Most use Aery, so I wouldn't know, but everyone who uses electrocute is a problem because it's a crutch rune designed for assassins to win the laning phase.\n","replies":[{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2018-08-04T23:38:55.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=VoraciousX,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ym2XAkHh,comment-id=00020000000000020000,timestamp=2018-08-04T07:07:56.806+0000)\n\nI think u make good points, i for one just think it could be tweaked a bit, like no active/summoners drops from Minions, just the simple base spell if they must keep the minion drop.\nThey should allow enemy champions to step on the shards for a duration to destroy them (as not every champion is good at effectively zoning an area)\nThey could weaken the effects of the actives/summoners Zoe steals, and let casting her own summoners activate the W as well\nThey could put a unit CD on each champion that uses actives/summoners near Zoe.","replies":[{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2018-08-05T01:10:17.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FlameHalbrdOkido,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ym2XAkHh,comment-id=000200000000000200000000,timestamp=2018-08-04T23:38:55.753+0000)\n>\n> I think u make good points, i for one just think it could be tweaked a bit, like no active/summoners drops from Minions, just the simple base spell if they must keep the minion drop.\n> They should allow enemy champions to step on the shards for a duration to destroy them (as not every champion is good at effectively zoning an area)\n> They could weaken the effects of the actives/summoners Zoe steals, and let casting her own summoners activate the W as well\n> They could put a unit CD on each champion that uses actives/summoners near Zoe.\n\nI think if we were to allow enemies of Zoe to completely deny an ability of another champion, that'd be bad design. Zoe's gonna need her W in fights in most occasions unless she's fed. I suppose there could be a counterplayable solution though such as making people be up close to the summoner, and having them right click it and go into a channel for 1.5 seconds before it's destroyed so they're at least vulnerable. Zoe's waveclear is god awful early game, making it already hard to get minion procs without minion dematerializer. So if you deny her a summoner from minion dematerializer procs, you'd basically be denying her early game, forcing her to starve and making her useless late game. There'd need to be high risk involved with that in my opinion. It's no fun Qing a whole minion wave later in the game and having every single caster minion have a sliver of health left where everyone else is one shotting them.\n\nI think people just need to play her more so they can exploit her weaknesses(and possibly stop being stupid and taking ignite because they're damage whores). I don't find many problems fighting Zoe.","replies":[{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2018-08-05T02:34:19.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=VoraciousX,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ym2XAkHh,comment-id=0002000000000002000000000000,timestamp=2018-08-05T01:10:17.845+0000)\n>\n\nPoppy, Zyra, Rek'Sai and Bard have abilities that rely on objects on the ground that can be stepped on to destroy to name a few.

It'd also need to be buffed considerably because a large part of W is that the more ranks in W, the more often the balloons appear in my experience. They'd also have to give it a mana cost, which would make it need another buff on top of buffing it for the loss of the summoners/item actives. I think if Zoe **needed** some form of considerable nerf(I don't feel like she needs to be nerfed though, as I said she only has a similar amount of counters to other burst mages and her biggest counters actually have a higher win rate vs her than other burst mage counters and they have a less amount of bigger counters), it should maybe be a nerf to the cooldown on her ultimate. You can't nerf a burst mage's damage to where it doesn't burst and her damage has been steadily nerfed time and time again. \n\nHonestly I didn't feel Zoe was that ridiculous before all her consistent nerfs, aside from her E cooldown being too low, and my suggestion to that was to increase her E cooldown to like 20 seconds at rank 1 and lower it to like 16 seconds at max rank, and to increase the cooldown reduction when she hit her E by like 60% so it'd be a little bit less than what it was at the time so she'd be more relegated to requiring to land her E's, and be punished way harder when she missed one, and that would make her risk/reward aspect much easier to exploit. Of course no one listened though and now she feels bad to play early, has terrible waveclear unless she has minion dematerializer and is ahead, and people still complain about her one shotting them. What's worse, some Zoe's are taking Electrocute now apparently, and it has a higher win rate than Aery(albeit with a lower sample size), and that's making people cry that she's busted again, without looking at the fact that Electrocute is being nerfed, as is Celerity, as is sudden impact, all of which she uses in her electrocute rune setup. Keep in mind I don't actually play Zoe very much, but I know enough about her to know she's pretty balanced. She may not feel like it when she's strong, but she is. She's also deceptively immobile which can be used against her, and very telegraphed. You know how you can stand on a Leblanc W so when she goes back to it you can get her? Well Zoe's like that, but she's ALWAYS gonna go back to her original position and you can just walk straight toward her because she can't move away while casting it.","replies":[{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2018-08-05T06:15:55.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=VoraciousX,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ym2XAkHh,comment-id=00020000000000020000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-08-05T04:23:39.815+0000)\n>\n> I feel like if Zoe could activate her W at will it&#x27;d make her land her Es too easily, and remove a high moment from Zoe, and I feel like if she had to kill minions to proc a regular W, it wouldn&#x27;t make any sense as no other champion in the game has to kill a minion to be able to use their abilities, nor should they.

And the power is in their hands. Make Zoe miss the minion. She can only use minion dematerializer 6 times total in a game.

Useing a sommoner spell is and always should be trading a big CD for an advantage, and everyone has acces to that. Vs Zoe, you don't, becuase if you use you're summoner against her, she will throw it back at you and on top of that gain a massive speedboost and solid extra damage, so useing summoners agaonst her puts me into a disasvantage which is the opposit of what should happen.\nEven worse, it's also stealing item actives the same way, so investing gold for that active ends up with you either not useing the active or giving Zoe an advantage over you.

For all the unreliability tied to RNG summoner spells, the fundamental problem is that almost every single summoner spell and item active is designed to be used reliably. Ignite is a prime example of an effect whose high, reliable damage is meant to be counterbalanced by its high cooldown. When a champion is incentivized to use such an effect as soon as possible, with no real cost or cooldown to speak of (Zoe can quickly get another bubble to play with), nothing good comes of it, especially in lane. I feel it might help to switch her W and R around, just so that she can avoid having that kind of unhealthy mechanic in lane for too long.
