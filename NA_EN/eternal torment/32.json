{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2017-09-09T19:22:50.569+0000","title":"As Promised, a List of all the Stuff you can get punished for/All League Ingame Rules Listed","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":55,"down_votes":6,"body":"Hello everyone!\n\nI just wanted to point out that this one post took me over 6 hours to make, since i had to search and Reread the ToS, then my Android internet kept lagging since I wrote such a massive text on a phone, so I would REALLY welcome it if people at least would read to the very end since I literally cramped all 10 fingers for you, the community. \n\n---\n\nFirst to introduce the Idea of this post. \n\nI made a few days ago a request on the boards for someone to maybe create a Post that could possibly be put into a Sticker for the Board section that includes any and all reasons you can be punished for ingame. While the Post got many upvotes and a majority of Agreements, I still see that people are rather holding back on the Idea itself. So, keeping my own word now, I decided to take Things into my own hands and write this List down for the Community.\n\nBut first, I want to put out some **DISCLAIMERS**. \n\n- Disclaimer A: This Post, while researched, is not Garuanteed to be 100% accurately imputted or worded, meaning I am open to corrections or additions to anything I Might have missed. I Myself do not know every single dot and Comma of the ToS either, but I think having read them thoroughly, I can confidently claim I am Aware of the rules, and You should be so too.\n\n- Disclaimer B: This list will be ranked from Weakest to worst in Terms of the Impact it has on People and yourself, the gravity of the raw felony aswell as the possibly Punishments it can Strike you with. I will do my best to List everything you can be Banned for in such order, But as put in Disclaimer A, I Might make a mistake aswell, If such occurs, you are free to comment below any additions to this list. \n**BUT NOTE, SUCH MUST BE FACT AND NOT AN OPINION, MEANING YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE A SOURCE OF PROOF WHEN YOU WANT THIS LIST UPDATED. THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL THREAD ONLY, SO NO BIAST ALLOWED.**\n\n- Disclaimer C: Note that any and all of those rules disregard the comfort of premades. Even if a Buddy or so is OK with what you say, others might not be and surely haven&#039;t been if you got reported for it. Meaning, whatever you read past this point can be (but is not obligatory to unless stated otherwise) seen as a no tolerance policy supported rule.  What you can do and cannot has been firmly defined by Riot and breaking such for your own amusement Or stress-relief is struck with necessary measurements, in disregards to selective people&#039;s concerns.\n\n- Disclaimer D: Note that while all of These points are remarked as reasons for reporting someone, do mind me that those reports only have 1 line to explain what they cover. This Writing exists to fully extend the explanations of what those rules cover to the last Detail.\n\nThank you for reading this far. \n\nNow, to begin with the Listing and an detailed Explanation as to What could said felony look like with some examples both obvious and rather unexpected forms aswell.\n\n\n#spreading negative conducts/General Toxicity\n\nThis is the first, and least offensive Thing (Compared to what follows) you can verbally commit in this specific List. Negative Conduct means, but is not restricted to only:\n\n- Providing Rude comments.\n\nThis one is something many times people underestimate and stereotype about. Making comments on someone of even the slightest negative nature without giving rational constructive support behind it Counts as being negative to your teammates. Stuff like &quot;You suck&quot; &quot;lol so bad&quot; and even &quot;plz dont play X champ again&quot; etc. ALL count as being negative because they do nothing other than make someone feel bad about their playing. You can always word things better so you do not have to be rude while trying to help.\n\nSuch also includes side-comments like pushing the blame on someone when an enemy Mocks you.\n\nOne example:\nEnemy {{champion:11}} : Ez botlane double kill\nYou, the ADC: Yeah, Thresh never gives lantern.\n\nWhile this particular scenario is mostly known as a meme, it does not change that this can, and likely will, be taken with seriosity since you still shamed someone by putting fault onto them.\n\nThis point also covers lesser means of labeling someone as below the average and equal human standart, like calling people a noob and stupid.\n\n- Giving up on a motivated team.\n\nThis is likely the most arguable point in this conversation, but there is a reason why Riot added this to the list of negative attitude&#039;s list.\nGiving up often results in you not being motivated within the game, causing you to throw or commit beginners mistakes you likely shame others for doing. \n\nWhen you give up, you essentially hold the game hostage for other people, because you force them to do what you alone want through sabotage, which on the sidenote can also strike you for Trolling/Griefing. \n\nGiving up in reports is mostly including verbal comments like &quot;ff or im afk&quot; but also actions such as not leaving fountain because you want &quot;the game to end faster.&quot; which really just means you refuse teamplay on purpose.\n\nAside from that being threat/Trolling (Depending on what you do) It is also spreading further negativity because you drag a whole team down into your own personal pity-hole. \n\nHaving said this, moving to the point I addressed a fair lot on just the previous one:\n\n\n#Trolling\n\nTrolling is a very abused rule people always try to take Advantage off in attempts to get people banned because they biasedly dislike them.\n\nHowever, trolling as the rules state are most likely in at least one point different then what you understand on it.\n\nTrolling, or more Originally known as Griefing, describes you purposely sabotaging the game or it&#039;s experience for your own teammates and Allies. Such Includes, in totally listed:\n\n- Not saving them on purpose\n\n- Running down and feeding enemies\n\n- Promoting the loss of a game in other means, such as not interrupting a siege\n\n- giving up and holding the game hostage on your team\n\n- Baiting an Ally&#039;s death. (Tahm Kench W or Anivia wall for examples). And yes, while Riot may not be able to always catch you Throwing your adc into the enemy 5 man team with a Kench W thanks to the automatic system not knowing to differ accident from purpose, do note that an overly excessive amount of reports for trolling can result in Manual Reviews, which in turn can get you permanently banned on first strike, IF the trolling is just that extreme.\n\n\n#Incorrect/Inproper usernames\n\nThe Most controversial Point of discussion is Usernames. While there are some cases where having indicating names is Arguably OK, having stuff like &quot;Cancercuck&quot; as your Name is a definitive No-go. What this Rule covers are Any and all usernames that include Indications to Insults, racism, sexism or other topics described as Black Humor aswell as Impersonations of others. \n\nThe last rule includes you telling people you are some Diamond 1 X champ main and are smurfing, but then take a random Diamond 1 account and say this is you. When you wanna rename yourself, make it worth something appropriate, because when Riot Finds you and strikes you, not only is your Name changed to something basic, boring and unattractive, you get NOTHING refunded if you bought the namechange with IP/RP.\n\n\n#Indirect Insulting\n\nThis is a very unstable point when it Comes to discussing what exactly it covers up, but you are under no circumstances allowed to Insult and slurr against anyone, not even indirectly, through puns per say.\n\nIndirect Insults can include comments that on first note seem like jokes or memes, but are specifically directed to someone you want to feel bad. That can include comments such as: &quot;You&#039;re just like Syndra, always playing with balls.&quot;\nYeah I know, this one sounds awfully humorous to the majority of the Readers here, but if you put more attention to the content and that it is directed to a specific Person you can tell that this one is insulting because it makes a sexual remark addressing someone as sl*tty, and even if it was creatively hidden with Humor, it is an insulting comment regardless that can and will have you striked.\n\nAnother point this topic covers is negatively addressing anyone if you performed better than them. Stuff like &quot;gg ez&quot; for the purpose of a Taunt, or more direct stuff like &quot;get f*cked&quot; all count as indirect means to Insult someone because you shame them as lesser than yourself and also try to provoke them into tilting.\n\nOne Thing people NEVER expect to be on here is Naming. If you had a bad game with someone who did not perform so well, then the next game somehow by luck, or coincidence, get matched with that same Person again, you commit an offense of Naming and Shaming if you badmouth him by either calling out or lying about how &quot;he sucks hard, mute and report.&quot;\n\nThis specific scenario mostly applies in late nights, when the servers are underpopulated and you have like 15 or so people playing ranked, where meeting the same Person again can be more likely possible. Even If the Person is a troll, you are still not allowed to publicly Name them out.\n\nThis one, last but not least, also covers up attempts to shame someone by falsely picturing an Event or moment within the game. \n\nExample:\n*Enemy survives with 2 HP*\nYou: So lucky\nEnemy: Lol no you just suck\n\n\n#Direct insulting/ Vulgar slurring\n\nQuick Note: From here on all following addressed Points count as an absolute No-tolerance Policy. What this means is, that these rules apply always, no matter the situation and no matter how justified they seem. Remember, killing a rapist is still murder, even if you are a hero to your people. And this logic applies to any and all rules after this one.\n\nAs for the rule itself: This is self-explanatory. \n\nRiot Games themselves even made a tooltip about it in the loading Screen, saying word by word. &quot;Just because the Chat filters Vulgar expressions does not mean you can challenge it.&quot;\n\nWhat they mean with this is that just because &quot;You are Shit&quot; gets the &quot;Shit&quot; Censored does not mean you are safe by playing around the Censorship and writing &quot;You are Sh1t&quot;. The Automatic Punishment System can adapt and add words to the collection of Things to scan for when inspecting chat logs of people aswell, so not only do you pathetically attempt to Play Riot, you in turn also make them smarter on how to find your kind of toxic people.\nTalk about backfiring.\n\nAnd to the main point. You are under no circumstances given permission to insult people. Insults are indirectly but also directly covered, telling people &quot;You are shit&quot; &quot;fuck you&quot; and Co. all accounts as insulting your opposite. And even the seemingly harmless choices of words like &quot;Jackass&quot; fall under this category. \n\n\n#Verbal Harrassment\n\nJust as Insulting is not allowed, harrassment is not either. While a lot of people may think insulting and Harrassment may fall under the same term, they do as for the global point of Reporting.\n\nHowever, do note, harrassment is not just overexcessive insulting. It can also mean Promoting reports on someone, Making allies and enemies gang up on you with negativity, Threats of other Kind such as &quot;i will hack you&quot; and the false prescribtion of power, meaning you telling someone stuff like &quot;enjoy last game before your ban&quot;.\n\nHarrassment, in short, also covers abusive expressions and bullying within the game. When you try to express false power to make someone feel bad, do what you want or just want to pretend you are some self-righteous badass-wannabe you make yourself guilty of harrassment because none of These Things can be done without someone else&#039;s expenses.\n\n#Discrimation\n\nThis topic covers all the Big Bads, all the Things you get perma-banned for on first offense.\n\n- Sexist Comments:\n\nStuff like &quot;Shut up Woman.&quot; &quot;Tiny dicked cuck&quot; and stuff all go under Sexist Insults and other insulting ways of sexual remarkings meant to harm one another.\n\nThis point also covers insulting Homosexuality and any Gender-covered Topics. Calling people Gay because of something is highly offensive no matter how humorously taken.\n\n- Racial Slurring:\n\nThis means any and all Thing that Insult another Distinctly different part of the Human Population, either by Nation, Religion or Skin colour. Such Insults mean either direct slurrings such as &quot;Ni**er&quot; aswell as indirect offenses like saying &quot;All french are toxic feeders&quot;. \n\nLatter one seems so common and stereotypical, but it is still a racist remark because you shame an entire nation&#039;s Population. And while yes, French might be a Little more Prominent on toxicity, EVERY PLACE has toxic people. Just because riven Players are more famous for being toxic does not make them the only ones.\n\n- Bigotry:\n\nAny and all forms of degration that serves the purpose of falsely making someone feel like something below humankind.\n\nSuch Includes, but is not restricted to Comments like &quot;Slut, Subhuman Ape, Bastard Child&quot; aswell as the promotion of Degration such as telling people stuff like &quot;Get cancer&quot; &quot;I fucked your dead grandmother&quot; &quot;Worthless Piece of shit&quot; &quot;kys(Kill yourself in short)&quot;. Or in short the kinda Things People most joke about when toxicity becomes a topic.\n\n- Other specific Means of Discrimination:\n\nSince this is LoL, there are cases where people are discriminated solely for what they Play or how they Play. Such means comments like &quot;All yasuos are Cancer&quot; &quot;Only Special retards Play Garen&quot; ETC. Any Kind of means to discriminate that is not listed above.\n\n\n#Account-Sharing/Boosting\n\nOften argued upon because of moral Points of view. Account-sharing means ANY form or means of having your account handled by anyone other than you. Such means stuff like:\n\n- Giving away your Acc\n\n- Selling your acc\n\n- &quot;My brother played on my ACC when i was not home, i had no idea&quot;\n\n- Boosting yourself by sharing it to skilled Players.\n\nSometimes it happens that an account is Compromised due to you clicking on any link given by any friend, losing it through a malware attack can get your account restored, but ONLY then, and even then it can only be saved before it is permanently banned. Once the banhammer strikes you can pick a god and pray.\n\nHaving said that, it goes without saying that you do not click any random link send to you, which, just like anyhow else makes it your own fault.\n\n\n#Scripting/3rd Party Advantages\n\nWhile being the most rarely seen Thing, Scripting does exist, and so do the people guilty of using them. Scripting does not JUST mean having stuff like an Skillshot-aimbot, it can also mean anything that gives you Advantages by overwriting codes or positively influencing your game, examples are Programms that change your cursors looks and sizes. \n\nThis point is often debated on, but Having a different Cursor by outside programming not only is actual overwriting of programm codes/hacking on the side, but also Cheating, since you give yourself an Advantage by changing something that is globally set for EVERYONE with no exceptions.\n\nChanges within the system that are not from Riot themselves is in any and all forms and means prohibited, and depending on what you changed can also be accounted for as hacking which can result in a Lawsuit.\n\n---\n\nI Hope this list will, even if only a Little bit, help people out on what they should not do, and/or serve as a reminder on where punished Players have been wrong and why.\n\nEdit 1: \n\n- I corrected the Rude Comments Point to further match what it Means thanks to a Correction from The Djinn, PB Sub mod (I believe). Thank you for the help :D\n\n- I removed some censored expressions because they screwed up the writing, had randomly italic sentences that started and ended within a word.\n\nPeace Out\n***Eternal Torment***","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-09-09T19:32:02.144+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":3,"body":">Providing Rude comments without Constructive assistance.\n\nNote that providing rude comments WITH constructive criticism can get you punished as well.

The system doesn't punish people who give advice, it punishes people who are rude to others. If somebody said \"Damn, all those stupid traffic rules. I feel like the only way to not get a ticket is to not drive a car at all\", you would not blame the traffic rules. You would consider that person to be a horrible driver who obviously cannot understand how to drive their car without breaking any rules.\n\nThe same applies here: If people actually cared more about giving advice than feeling superior and putting down others, they would learn how to give that advice without being rude. If they don't and they just entirely stop using chat, I dare say nothing of value was lost. Nobody is going to listen to some raging stranger's advice on the internet, anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Green Spade","date":"2017-09-10T19:55:40.897+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is it not on riot? Toxic and negative are undefined so they can apply it to any situation.\n\nIf beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then the person who is observing gets to decide what is beautiful. A common saying is \"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,\" which means beauty doesn't exist on its own but is created by observers.\n\nNegative and toxic are the same subjective things, they require someones opinion of what they are looking at, what is beauty to one may not to be to the other, what is toxic or negative to one, may not be to another.\n\nThis means the playerbase is too scared of riot punishing them to do what they would do in any other game, point out reality of what is happening in the game either player actions, lack of actions or any other part of the game. This is NOT to say flaming is okay, racist or sexist remarks or even personal attacks, these are ALL NOT OKAY. However any speak about the game, a players actions or lack of actions is legitimate team speak.\n\nNow the problem gets in when riot staff looks at it, they can look at it however they want and reality doesn't matter. This means when they get your one sided conversation out of context they don't see things like playful banter or what the other side of the conversation is, they just see you saying whatever your saying to yourself, so playful banter or pointing out a reality in the game is often taken in a negative light due to its one sided out of context nature and staff being a punishment filter squad looking for sometihng to punish instead of a help desk looking for a way to solve the problem so this situation doesn't happen again.... I guess that is preserving their job? Not sure what to say about it honestly.\n\nThese folks skim so hard that I think its impossible for them to legitimately be able to tell what is negative or toxic when again they are looking at a one sided conversation taken out of context, while looking purely for a way to post guilt on the player instead of trying to understand the situation the player was in.\n\nWant an example?\n\nBelow is riot staff being unable to tell the difference between the words \"ME\" and \"another player\" or \"you\" since I was punished for calling for a report on another player while we can easily see that the word I used was \"ME\" and that in no way directs the statement towards any other player but myself. Since calling for reports is punishable cuz its griefing another player, it seems crazy that I am punished not only by having to endure a game with team mates calling for a report on me, but I also get to be punished for jokingly repeating them that I should be reported cuz riot can't tell the difference between ME and a statment directed towards my team.\n\n\n\nTwisted Spade\nJuly 27, 2017 23:00\n \n\nI have had you guys close my previous ticket telling me this has been addressed but that is not true\n\nYou have addressed the issue of \"a player calling for a report on another player\"\n\nBut I am NOT doing that.\n\nI am repeating that another player has called for a report one ~ME~\n\nIs it verse the rules now to mockingly call for a report on yourself after someone else says it to you, about you, in all chat?\n\n\"[6:46] [All] Twisted Spade (Fiddlesticks): yes report me\" \n(01:37:44 AM) Twisted Spade: agent 007 pointed that out as reportable\n\nI was just re reading this... And the previous staff member for my other ticket replied to mas as if they thought I was calling for a report on someone else? \n\nObviously they are confused, I never called for a report on another player, so it seems silly that I should be punished as if I did.\n\nThis is a reply to someone typing in all chat to report ME and I replyed, mocking them, like report me for what? report me for this trolling nid stealing my cs and griefing me? Thats reportable now, to repeat what they said, about reporting ME? Saying to report myself is punishable?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIron Wing\nJuly 28, 2017 15:13\n \n\nHey there,\n\nI'm Iron Wing from Player Support. I see you've spoken to a few other agents, and now you've got another question. I'll try to address that new question, however I won't be able to contest or debate the chat restriction on this account.\n\nIn general, calling for reports for anyone is discouraged, and is usually drawing attention to negativity. Usually when I see this on other accounts, it's pulling focus away from the game, and directly on a disagreement between team members. This is distracting, and fans the flames in chat. Responding to others negativity in any way other than muting, is dangerous.

For example my opinion of what is constructive or polite might differ from yours and both of our opinions might differ from the next persons.\n\nSince both toxic and negativity are undefined, this means they can be applied to any situation that the beholder wishes to apply them to, regardless of the reality of the situation. This situation is made even worse when you look at the fact that riot staff look at your conversation one sided as if your talking to yourself, this means everything your saying is taken out of context and if they choose to look at what your saying as negative or toxic, then since its undefined, it  is then toxic or negative, whatever opinion they have to project upon you.\n\nIf beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then the person who is observing gets to decide what is beautiful. A common saying is \"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,\" which means beauty doesn't exist on its own but is created by observers.\n\nWant an example?\n\nI was jokingly repeating that another player in game had called for a report on me, so I repeated \"yes report me\"\n\nYet I was punished as if I called for a report on another player and staff refused to respond to me with anything other then as if I was calling for a report on another player, since in their opinion that is somehow wrong since calling for a report on a team mate is griefing them.... so calling for a report on myself... is griefing myself.. So they are punishing me for self grief? Again reality doesn't matter here, nor does anything I have to say since they will skim it and then tell you what they think even if they don't properly read or understand what your asking.... And you expect these kinds of people to be able to dictate what is and isn't toxic or negative when they can't even read the difference between \"ME\" and \"You or player x\" to see that I wasn't calling for a report on another player? I mean they closed my help request after this claiming they addressed it and when I opened another one claiming it wasn't addressed? Guess what, they claimed that the previous staff already addressed it so they where not going to, as in they are not willing to look into it cuz someone else already looked at it wrong and replied in a wrong way.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwisted Spade\nJuly 27, 2017 23:00\n \n\nI have had you guys close my previous ticket telling me this has been addressed but that is not true\n\nYou have addressed the issue of \"a player calling for a report on another player\"\n\nBut I am NOT doing that.\n\nI am repeating that another player has called for a report one ~ME~\n\nIs it verse the rules now to mockingly call for a report on yourself after someone else says it to you, about you, in all chat?\n\n\"[6:46] [All] Twisted Spade (Fiddlesticks): yes report me\" \n(01:37:44 AM) Twisted Spade: agent 007 pointed that out as reportable\n\nI was just re reading this... And the previous staff member for my other ticket replied to mas as if they thought I was calling for a report on someone else? \n\nObviously they are confused, I never called for a report on another player, so it seems silly that I should be punished as if I did.\n\nThis is a reply to someone typing in all chat to report ME and I replyed, mocking them, like report me for what? report me for this trolling nid stealing my cs and griefing me? Thats reportable now, to repeat what they said, about reporting ME? Saying to report myself is punishable?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIron Wing\nJuly 28, 2017 15:13\n \n\nHey there,\n\nI'm Iron Wing from Player Support. I see you've spoken to a few other agents, and now you've got another question. I'll try to address that new question, however I won't be able to contest or debate the chat restriction on this account.\n\nIn general, calling for reports for anyone is discouraged, and is usually drawing attention to negativity. Usually when I see this on other accounts, it's pulling focus away from the game, and directly on a disagreement between team members. This is distracting, and fans the flames in chat. Responding to others negativity in any way other than muting, is dangerous. It's far too easy to respond in such a way that can lead you to being punished as well.\n\nIf you have any other questions let me know.\n\nIron Wing\n Riot Games Player Support","replies":[{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2017-09-12T04:39:30.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, knowing that you are not the beholder, you should use your smarts to steer clear of anything borderline that could get your account restricted/banned.

If you ask me, they are both being petty brats.\nAnd naming someone from a previous game, if done untruthfully would be slander, which is completely different from an indirect insult. Do you even realize what an insult is? I'm starting to wonder. And I don't see what would be the point of denying people to talk about their previous game. Yeah, some people may not want to get distracted, and in that sense it could be somewhat disruptive, but as long as they aren't continually flooding the chat box with messages about their experience, I don't see what the problem is. There are other things you typed that seem odd in that section, but I'll leave them alone as they do not stand out as much for being wrong.\n\nWhen it comes to discrimination, it took you until the end of the section to list a relevant form. The previous stuff is rather boring and I don't think particularly common in this game. As a result, you obviously missed out on some other times when players are discriminating against people in their chat. For example, they may think that Lucian shouldn't be played at middle lane, so you make a comment like \"ADC in mid lulz\" when he's died a few times without kills, assists, or any real help from teammates. Or someone complains about you trolling them, and your counter argument is \"you're playing *insert champion name*\" as if that gave you a license to pretend you're on different teams. That's one of the most common acts of discrimination in this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Hemodek","date":"2017-09-10T00:43:46.563+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wrong on so many levels.
