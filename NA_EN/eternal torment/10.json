My phone goes off and the caller ID shows it's my manager. I am not entirely happy about this (see: \"I literally just got home\"). I answer anyway and there is some weird static. I can't get my manager to answer me and I start to worry.\r\n\r\nSo I text her instead.\r\n\r\nHer cat was fucking sitting on her phone and butt-dialed me. The 'Static' I heard was him purring.\r\n\r\nThis is the only kind of cat-call that's acceptable though.","replies":[]}
