I'm playing at the lowest quality and so I'm wondering if there is any fixes to this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-04T20:12:53.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Each server you access online is in a different geolocation and your connection will take different network routes to each. Because of this, it's plausible to have a great connection to one server while having a poor connection to another. Most of these issues are caused by routing issues specifically to the League servers, however, we need to ensure your local network settings are compatible with League before moving on to look at your route.\n\nTo do this, I recommend working through the steps outlined in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). Let me know if those steps produce any change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lancrlot","date":"2016-10-02T07:44:22.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]}]}
