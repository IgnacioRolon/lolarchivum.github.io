See again game length.\n\nWhy is damage creep going out of control. Game length \n\nZeal Items. Ok this one baffles me, increasing it by 100-200 gold is only 1 to 2 minions waves worth of CS, a 30 second delay. unless you say increase it by 50% of the cost (In which case you gut the item) how would that solve the zeal problem? Want to fix it? lower its stats not up its costs.\n\nAlso the balance team would be getting 5 figures, 6 figures is reserved for very high up roles or senior programmers","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2018-03-29T05:45:40.165+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"*glares at you as angrily as a Canadian can*\n\n\nHonestly dude, I can't recall  you ticking me off :P Looking through your chat history you usually bring up really good points. Sorry if you felt that I was ticked off at you, it was likely just a rough day for me, and then someone set me off here on the boards :P My bad dude.

The patches this season have been the BEST so far. I  am actually extremely happy with the balance team this year, coming from a hardstuck D5 6-year player. They are addressing problems (Theyve buffed turrets, people.) while adding items, making the game dynamic and fun. ADC's being the strongest role is the single thing that is being left alone right now, but THERE ARE plans in place to address this. You have to understand that shifting power like that globally takes some SERIOUS tuning to not completely break the game. For now, the more minor things are being tackled head on and I love it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ztoka","date":"2018-03-28T18:38:36.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm all for shorter games.
