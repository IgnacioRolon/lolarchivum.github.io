Some anyway, others are just fun ideas.\n\n{{champion:161}} &quot;Hel&#039;koz&quot; Fiery volcanic themed skin.\n&quot;Spell&#039;koz&quot; Maybe a more... Hextech version, or like {{champion:101}}  themed?\n&quot;Shell&#039;Koz&quot; Underwater theme. Hydro cannon!\n\n{{champion:112}} &quot;Viktorious&quot; Victorious skin.\n\n{{champion:111}} &quot;Definitely Nautilus&quot; Play on words for &quot;definitely NOT&quot; skins.\n\n{{champion:266}} &quot;Bee keeper Aatrox&quot; We already have Aatrox(A) and Sea(C) Hunter Aatrox, so why not a B? xD \n\n{{champion:1}} &quot;Nannie&quot; This could go 2 ways I suppose? Old nanny looking bear or big baby with little old lady. Disturbing? Yes.\n&quot;Candy Annie&quot; Giant gummy bear, fully awesome.\n\n{{champion:22}} &quot;Must Ashe&quot; Like... gentleman version, come on guys women love wearing fake mustaches. {{champion:201}} approved.\n\n{{champion:53}} &quot;Toy Blitzcrank&quot; like a &quot;Rock &#039;em Sock &#039;em Robot&quot;, it would be great.\n\n{{champion:420}} &quot;Dunkmaster&quot; Already has a ball she carries... Figure out what to do with tentacles. Bam! Done. Even just making them inverted nets, with the rim at the bottom. Doesn&#039;t have to be that special.\n\n{{champion:105}} &quot;Show Bizz&quot; Theater/Circus themed. Maybe throws an award that gets gobbled up.\n\n{{champion:150}} &quot;Gnar Gnar Binks&quot; Okay okay, this one is just a joke. Sorry.\n\n{{champion:141}} &quot;Kandy Kayn&quot; Like... we shouldn&#039;t even have to ask for this.\nCosmic Assassin Kayn(Shadow Assassin) and Darkin Star Rhaast(Darkin).\nAny 2 side skin lines work.\n\n{{champion:82}} Literally... just give us a decent skin. Change some effects on the skin. He doesn&#039;t have a lot of reason to use other skins right now. Maybe &quot;Freljordekaiser&quot; Ice theme.\n&quot;Battle Boss Morde&quot; arcade theme.\n &quot;Project M.O.R.D.E.&quot; with matrix looking ghosts.\nAlso a rework is needed. No real gap closer or cc in his kit, he gets kited probably the hardest of any champ. I remember with Rylai&#039;s and Deadman&#039;s I still couldn&#039;t catch people with my ult on them. Just an immobile tank killed with any cc, as his passive needs abilities going off to let him survive. Done ranting.\n\n{{champion:516}} &quot;Thornn&quot; Elderwood theme.\n&quot;Frost Bornn&quot; Ice theme.\n\n{{champion:421}} &quot;Mech&#039;Sai&quot; They have all other void creature mech skins.\n&quot;Ship Wreck&#039;Sai&quot; Water creature theme.\n&quot;Hextech&#039;Sai&quot; Hextech skin.\n\n{{champion:555}} &quot;Motor Pyke&quot; Bike gang looking skin.\n&quot;Airstrike Pyke&quot; Maybe... I just like fun named skins.\n&quot;Bandit Pyke&quot; Western theme.\n\n{{champion:13}} &quot;French Ryze&quot; Fast food theme.\n&quot;Sun Ryze&quot; Fire theme.\n\n{{champion:101}} &quot;Program Xerath&quot; or something, he needs a new skin.\n\n{{champion:106}} &quot;Jollybear&quot; Christmas theme.\n\n{{champion:8}} &quot;Gladimir&quot; Christmas Theme.\n\n{{champion:29}} &quot;Glitch&quot; Program theme.\n\n{{champion:163}} &quot;Pool Party Taliyah&quot; Surfboard, coral reef wall, floor of crabs that snap. Many possibilities.\n\n{{champion:72}} &quot;Deep Sea Terror Skarner&quot; He needs a skin, he needs remembered.\n\n{{champion:68}} &quot;Rumble Bee&quot; Sounds good in theory.\n\n{{champion:90}} &quot;Dark Star Malzahar&quot; Already has space aids.\n\n{{champion:154}} &quot;Balloon Zac&quot; Hard to think of skins for him, but he needs one.\n\n\n\nLet me know if there are any other &quot;hidden gem&quot; skins or fantastic ideas.\nWhat has Riot missed out on cashing out on?\n\n=======Current Champ Skin Count(Not including base)=======\n==={12}===\nEzreal, Miss Fortune\n==={11}===\nAlistar, Annie, Twisted Fate\n==={10}===\nAshe, Blitzcrank, Dr. Mundo, Gragas, Jax, Katarina, Kog'Maw, Ryze, Sivir, Teemo\n==={9}===\nAhri, Akali, Amumu, Caitlyn, Fiddlesticks, Gangplank, Garen, Graves, Janna, Kayle, Lee Sin, Lux, Master Yi, Nidalee, Poppy, Renekton, Singed, Soraka, Tryndamere, Tristana, Twitch, Veigar, Warwick\n==={8}===\nCorki, Jarven IV, Leona, Lulu, Malphite, Morgana, Nasus, Orianna, Pantheon, Rammus, Riven, Sona, Vayne, Vladimir, Xin Zhao\n==={7}===\nAnivia, Cho'Gath, Darius, Draven, Fizz, Hecarim, Karma, Kennen, Malzahar, Maokai, Nunu & Willump, Olaf, Sejuani, Shaco, Shen, Varus, Ziggs\n==={6}===\nBrand, Evelynn, Fiora, Galio, Gnar, Heimerdinger, Irelia, Jinx, Karthus, LeBlanc, Nami, Nocturne, Shyvana, Syndra, Talon, Thresh, Vi, Wukong\n==={5}===\nBraum, Cassiopeia, Diana, Ekko, Elise, Kassadin, Kha'Zix, Lucian, Mordekaiser, Nautilus, Sion, Trundle, Volibear, Yasuo, Zed, Zilean\n==={4}===\nAzir, Jayce, Jhin, Lissandra, Quinn, Rengar, Rumble, Skarner, Swain, Taric, Udyr, Urgot, Viktor, Xerath, Zyra\n==={3}===\nAatrox, Bard, Kalista, Rakan, Vel'Koz, Xayah, Yorick, Zac\n==={2}===\nAurelion, Camille, Illaoi, Kai'Sa, Kayn, Kindred, Kled, Rek'Sai, Tahm Kench, Taliyah, Zoe\n==={1}===\nIvern, Neeko, Ornn, Pyke\n\nIvern, Rek'Sai, Yorick, Taric, and Sion are the oldest champs in their respective 1-5 alternative skins.\nRek'Sai, Morde, Xerath, Skarner, and Zilean are the longest champs since they got a new skin, at least under 6 skins.

Neither does anyone else.\n\nOmega Squad Maokai - Yeah the line is Yordles-only, but come on.  Mechanized mines on treads.\n\nDebonair Mecha Trundle - Pure awesome.  Must retain base Trundle’s dance, while playing something similar to the song from Dunkey’s Trundle video.\n\nHax - Basically Program Jax but red and glitchy.\n\nLittlesticks - This could go one of two ways: a kid Fid, or a dank flaming Fid.\n\nSpooky Lucian - Lucian wearing a sheet.  Wins by making the enemy die laughing.\n\nMad Bomber Zilean - Throws packets of C4, clock is replaced with a giant wrapped package (definitely not a bomb).\n\nK/DA Sona - Glaringly obvious.  Some form of Popstar skin for Sona.  Listen to pop in-game (not my thing, but will sell like turkeys before Thanksgiving hehexd).\n\nDragon Queen Shyvana - This one’s a Legendary from the Dragon skin line world.  Regal VO, shining armor and fancy robes, turns into an actual dragon instead of a wyvern.\n\nSkarnerd - Skarner with glasses and a backpack.  Utterly adorable tbh.\n\nHayle - Unimaginative ice-themed Kayle skin.\n\nAlien Invader Pantheon - Drops from the sky and says “TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADER.”","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Voidling","date":"2018-11-21T17:12:57.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahaha nice! {{sticker:sg-kiko}} \n\nLittlesticks sounds like a total rapper name.

And I'm always a fan of skin lines having at least a champ for every role.\n\nAnd whilst I can't see a K/DA skin for Sona, since it's more of a singing group than an actual band with music players, I definitely think the pop music playing would be a cash grab for Riot.\n\nMaybe Zil could have an actual timer on his bombs that counts down on that skin.\n\nWhat if they had Champion costume skins? Like, Panth dressed as Galio so his R looked like Galio R and vice versa. Thresh/Pyke. Blitz/Naut.
