Umbra cannot basic attack but instead uses Oskom to attack for her. Oskom can be moved by Alt-clicking pressing R or giving an attack order, he moves at a speed of 425+(100% movement speed bonus), can move through units but paths around champions, has an attack range of 150, and a maximum distance from umbra of 375(+10 per level. 545 at 18).\nOskom either stays in the same relative position to Umbra until given an order, or stays in the exact same location until ordered(toggled on/off with a chain icon in the same area as champion icons for Kindred passive).\nActive: Last Strand\nHolding for 0.5 seconds makes Umbra begin tightening the strings, holding for an additional 0.5 seconds makes her pull forward and dash to Oskom's location.

How does this mechanic work?\n1. Marked enemies are revealed like Oracle Lens to allow abilities to hit stealthed enemies while not allowing auto attacks.\n2. AP ratios, while she is intended for ADC, allow for her to go midlane as a possible AP or Hybrid build. Think Ezreal or Lucian.\n3. Oskom gets dragged or even pulled through walls if he exceeds the max distance, for Flash and other reasons.\n4. Champions can walk through Oskom to avoid toxic path blocking against melee matchups, and Oskom paths around champions to stop a potentially overpowered passive.\n5. Strings are moved AFTER E deals damage, so no instant teleport stun.\n6. No click-to-win chases-you-back-to-fountain abilities, all require skill or thought to succeed.\n7. If an assassin comes from behind and your teleport isn't up with Q to stun them, then you're probably toast.\n8. Try combing E with R active for wall jumps in a tight situation.\n9. Passing strings over champions, especially multiple ones, can take time and leave you vulnerable.\n10. Runaans is unavailable, but she can get melee only items.\n11. Moving Oskom from one side to the other takes time when E is on cooldown, as opposed to normal adc attacks.\n12. Hard CC stops Oskom from moving as well.\n13. Effects like Morde ghost and Neeko passive use Umbra as the model with a unique auto attack animation, like whipping with a string.\n14. Using Oskom to attack and cast Q is hardly any more complex than using Morde ghost and W, so she may be difficult to control but definitely not as hard as most people think. Personally I think she'd be easier for me than LeBlanc...\n15. While walking she does stop briefly, every time Oskom attacks or uses an ability, to control him.\n\nPotentially bad match ups\n{{champion:236}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:67}} \nPotentially good match ups\n{{champion:119}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:96}} \nWith {{champion:15}} or {{champion:25}} completely ruining her day.\n\nhttp://orig03.deviantart.net/7f03/f/2009/322/6/5/anima__puppet_master_by_wen_m.jpg\nhttps://www.deviantart.com/wen-m\nBasic Idea for her + Puppet\n\nhttps://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/intermediary/f/8185f166-fd34-4bce-a741-70ba7f32a5e2/d6e3k0e-5a16fea1-03e9-41d7-8793-f3325355bd3c.jpg/v1/fill/w_714,h_1119,q_70,strp/meridian__mercy_cover_1_by_ninjatic_d6e3k0e-pre.jpg\nhttps://www.deviantart.com/ninjatic\nMore of what she actually looks like.\n\nArt is not done by me, check out the amazing artists yourself.\n\n***\nCheck out my other champions here:\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/ymj1MEPc-all-my-champion-concepts","replies":[{"poster":"ZaneShadow","date":"2018-11-27T21:52:04.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So here's my only critique: I'd have the puppets movement tied to a Q,W, or E and make it the only level 1 ability available, same type of thing with Azir soldiers.  That way existing mechanics like tibbers or Morde's ghost could be used.  Then move one of your designed abilities into the Passive slot, allowing it some proc conditions you believe balanced.  This would help limit the mechanical difficulty a bit, which even with this design would be incredibbly intense.\n\nI love pretty much everything else.  The idea of controlling a melee puppet at a relatively close range seems like so much fun, and i love the thematic story behind him too.  I think starting the range closer then letting it scale with levels is also supper clever!  I think that the disarm you include is supper cool too!  You could also add a tiny, tiny pull that draws the hit champion slightly closer to the puppet, thematically very interesting.  \n\nGosh, now im stuck here macking minor tweaks because how much i love your idea!  Something that could be fun would be to have the ability that lets you control the puppet only have one rank available, then three other abilities with six potential ranks, though would be kinda boring not having a strong ultimate like yours with such a thematically amazing champion!  So cool!\n\nWould you mind if i post an simplified example of the tweaks in the comments?  I'd hate to do that without permission though, since it might come across like im not simply blown away at what you made!","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Voidling","date":"2018-11-27T22:24:08.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I am 100% for any feedback or tweaks!\n\nIt is quite an idea to have controlling him be an ability.

Most new champions have at least 2 or 3 hahaha.\n\nMy ideas were actually pretty close to that.  Here’s that version:\n\nPassive: Death Sentence\nEvery 30-15 seconds Umbra empowers Oskom’s next attack, which cleaves all units in a horizontal line in front of Oskom, dealing an additional 70% bonus AD\n\nQ: Dark Arrival (6 Rank Max)\nOskom Teleports a short distance to target location.  Oskom deals 40/80/120/160/200/240+(100% Ability Power) magic damage to enemies around him, while allies near Umbra gain a shield equal to 10/20/30/40/50/60/70+(40% AP).(Teleports anywhere he can move within range of Umbra.)\n\nW:Tangled Threads (6 ranks)\nUmbra shoots out strings that disarm(blind) enemies for for 1.25/1.5/1.75/2/2.25/2.5 seconds and Deals 40/70/100/130/160/190+(130% bonus Attack Damage) physical damage and marks all units it. Shoots after a 0.4 second delay.  If the threads connecting Umbra and Oskom passive over a marked enemy, they are Stunned for the remaining duration.\n\nE: Clad in Darkness (6 Rank Max)\nUmbra tightens the strings, charging a dash towards Oskom.  She gains 45/50/55/60/65/70% damage reduction for 1/2/3/4/5/6 seconds. Oskoms attacks are all empowered with death sentence for the next 4 seconds.  If Umbra fully charges his dash and is pulled into Oskom, enemies  surrounding them take 10/20/30/40/50/60+(100% AP) magic Damage.\n\nR: Puppet Master (Innately learned, like Karma level 1 ult)(Max Rank 1)\nUmbra controls a puppet called Oskom. Umbra cannot basic attack but instead uses Oskom to attack for her. Oskom Will move towards any target given an attack order, he moves at a speed of 400+(100% bonus movement speed), able to move a maximum of 400 (+10 per level) units away from Umbra.  He has an auto-attack range of 125 units.  Umbra's attacks trigger on-hit effects.\n\n\n**Why:**\nSince Oskom is basically a ranged attack whithout any abilities, I figured allowing him to be inately know wouldn't be too big a deal.  Also allowed him to move an additional 7.5 units away per additional level since at level 18, thats 695, less than 30 more units more of range than Tris.  And considering Her auto attack has to actually move to their target, that seems fair.  I also reduced Oskom's auto-attack range since that meant I could increase the range he was able to move around in, which is the big thing for the champion.  Also pushed their range up to 525 at level 1, 575 at level 6, since ad carries are made or broken on their range.  Kalisa moving from 550 to 525 has made her viewed as almost unplayable in the competitive scene.\n\nI took your fear CC and combined it with an old concept Riot tried with Karma, having a line between an ally that you’d try and drag over enemies to stun them. The ability became a passive stun on the W.\n\nI turned the Q into a passive but used the chargeable concept on the E.\n\nI changed the Ultimate to a chargeable ability, letting the person control the distance their pulled towards into Oskom, letting them use it as a positioning tool before warping Oskom farther into a fight.  I added Damage reduction instead of untargetable since i had moved it onto a regular ability.\n\nI saw on a list of negatives all the abilities felt like they were coming from Oskom, so i added a shield for allies to when he warps, centered on Umbra.  Basically Oskom damages, Umbra protects.  I also made it so that when Umbra fully dashed into Oskom a dark energy would errupt and damage nearby enemies, making it feel more like she was involved in activating that power.\n\nI also went a bit overboard and snuck in a sort of second playstyle, where you’d warp Oskom on top of someone on top of someone, then pull yourself fully in to add further damage.  Added a mini shield to that AP style to supplement the damage reduction.  Normally I’d envision players dashing towards Oskom before warping the puppet onto enemies, while in an AP build that would be reversed.\n\n\nNow to finish this, I’d like to add this isn’t necessarily better, as much as it is an alternative. I love your original concept and think mine misses out on some of the coolness of yours.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Voidling","date":"2018-11-28T04:15:18.347+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given how much you changed and the fact that it STILL thematically fits and works as a kit, I would say that the concept is a pretty good idea xD We are basically trying to give an unmade champion some reworks :P I do like including the string between them as part of an ability, to prioritize positioning.

And Oskom is an untargettable being, like Wolf, right?\n\nThe current protection mechanics, also already mentioned above:\n- Trynd - Not dying for some time;\n- Kayle (and others) - Invulnerable for a few seconds; \n- Vlad (and others) - Untargetable for a few seconds;\n- Bard - Statis for a few seconds;\n- Alistar (and others) - Reduced damage;\n- Anivia/Zil - Two forms of Rebirth;\n- Blitz - Giant shield;\n- Braum - Block an ability; \n- Sivir/Noc - Spellshield;\n- Mundo (and others) - Health regen;\n- Maybe others? Let me know if I missed some.\n\nSo I guess it would be best to look for something different than the mechanics above.\n\nSome ideas:\nWhen activated, Umbra becomes **invulnerable **to damage for x/x/x seconds.  Oskom, however, becomes Mortal/Vulnerable and gains health equal to Umbra's current health + a shield xxx(+x.x AP). The shield persists for the entire duration, or until broken. When the shield is broken, the damage dealt to Oskom will also be dealt to Umbra.\n\nWhen activated, Oskom will be able to block abilities. Maybe actively try to move in front of danger to protect Umbra?\n\nWhen activated, Oskom will act as a black hole and consume abilities and auto attacks that would fly through him. After a few seconds Oskom will explode dealing damage in relation to how much was consumed. Oskom will return after x seconds out of combat.\n\n\nI hope this comment is useful and you see any information you like.

However, the attractive woman component could be enough to offset the ugly part and get some attention as far as skins, balance, etc.\n\nSounds like her Q is a bit like Camille's E, and W like a skillshot version of Teemo's Q.
