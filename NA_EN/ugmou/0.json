Just right now i have got this leaver buster telling me i need to sign saying i will not leave any further games even if unintentional. I think this is completely irrational given the fact that i've tried the client fixer, reinstall, scanned my computer multiple times. This crash happens to other people too and its not an ordinary bugsplat. I have written plenty of tickets etc. but no one from riot has gotten back to me... someone help or my account will probably be banned for something out of my control.","replies":[]}
