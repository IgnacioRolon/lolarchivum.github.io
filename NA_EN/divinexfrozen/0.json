That being said there are a number of reasons you may be disconnecting from your games. Some are easily fixed and others wont be. There isn't much to go on from what you have said but if you are wireless you may want to move closer to your router/modem or connecting directly. another reason may be that you are experiencing packet loss (not good), this basically means that you are losing information being sent from your computer to riots servers and vise-versa. if you are experiencing packet loss you can contact your ISP (internet service provider) you may just need to have a new modem installed (a new modem should be installed every 2-3 years to insure reliable internet and connect-ability). you can measure your packet loss through cmd prompt. you can search that up on youtube. another reason may be that you have to many background programs running and your computer is closing apps or programs to prevent damage to your computer, this is most common in older laptops that may have been strong enough to play league but over time has lost that power through wear and tear. but as i said i cant help to much due to lack of information but these are the most common problems people face and i would look into them they may help. I hope i was able to help a little.","replies":[]}]}
