Regular first game of promo, no problems and result was a victory. Promo counter counted it as a loss for some reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Keyru","date":"2017-11-17T21:06:39.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TailSurprise,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=AULEwiRA,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-11-17T21:01:11.000+0000)\n>\n> The same thing happened to me except I didn&#x27;t even DC from the game.

It looks like you dodged a game yesterday which counted as the first lost in your series. After losing a game and then winning a game, your series is at 1 win and 2 losses. Good luck in your series to Gold!","replies":[{"poster":"TailSurprise","date":"2017-11-17T21:44:22.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Keyru,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=AULEwiRA,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2017-11-17T21:06:39.084+0000)\n>\n> Heyo!

My first first promo game was a victory but as soon as i loaded into post-game lobby it was only 1 \"x\" with Victory","replies":[{"poster":"TailSurprise","date":"2017-11-17T22:00:11.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't make sense. The TF game was my first promo game and I hadn't dodged a promo game before that. I'm certain I dodged the champ select before the Teemo Victory because I disconnected from the champ select and remember I didn't mind because I still just needed 1 win to enter promos. After that I go to play my first promo game which was the TF victory and post-game returns as                      \"X - - - - \"","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JoKa0Paiva","date":"2017-11-07T08:56:15.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"IT HAPPENS ME THE SAME LOOK THE FKING ANSWER: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/thN9oPqA-won-last-game-of-promos-appears-as-a-win-but-lost-promos","replies":[]}]}
