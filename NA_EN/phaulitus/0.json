I don&#039;t think I should be punished when I&#039;m being sportmanlike and trying to win and progress up the ladder just because I happen to be sorted with someone who gets their jollies out of making &quot;Bronzers&quot; lose and stay in Bronze. I&#039;ve lost LP; I&#039;ve lost series games; I&#039;ve been demoted - all because someone wants to troll, feed, what have you.\nMost recently, I had the great misfortune of being sorted with a player named &quot;<Removed By Moderation>&quot;. He played Singed top lane, proxied, and went 0/15/1, feeding Camille the entire time. After the game, he boasted about how this was his &quot;drunk/high account&quot;, and that he purposefully plays ranked because &quot;that&#039;s where the fun is&quot;. I reported him, but I have no idea what - if anything - will happen. He, on the other hand, was secure in the knowledge that nothing will happen to him. Considering that he seems to do this quite a bit, he&#039;s probably right.\n\nNow I love this game. I&#039;m addicted to it. I rarely even play my consoles anymore and pretty much exclusively play League. I don&#039;t even want to think about the amount of money I&#039;ve spent on skins. But it feels like I&#039;m not valued as a player/customer when I encounter people like this who are allowed to troll their teammates and get away with it. Isn&#039;t there anything that can be done? Is there a way to track your reports so you can know what, if anything, is done to the player? I don&#039;t even really care if the guy is banned outright, as long as he can&#039;t play ranked and sabotage people who are trying to get better. Because this is **FAR **from the first time this has happened to me, such that I feel like Riot really doesn&#039;t care about people trying to climb. Surely something can be done!","replies":[{"poster":"PresBushDid711","date":"2018-03-20T02:11:17.946+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just an update: Dude just finished another game... currently w/l kda on non troll champs.\n\nZilean 5-0 133:1 kda\nKassadin 4-0 55.5:1 kda\nKha'zix 5-0 32.5:1 kda\n\nAnd his go to troll pick\nSoraka 19-65 1.09-1 kda\n\nMaybe je just doesn't play support?\nSona 5-0 10.63:1 kda\nThresh 3-0 16.25:1 kda","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-19T21:44:33.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Accounts that do that continually tend to get banned pretty fast, actually.

He's actually a really good player, but tanked this account.. he said and I quote, \" because getting to BV is hard\".\n\nThat was two days ago and I see he just finished a game 2 hours ago. I can see ho detecting them might be hard. However, if someone opens a support ticket telling you the game and chat and you still don't research it... I would say you have a bad system.\n\nI mean I would love if at my job someone came to me, offered up all the evidence for an issue and all it required me to do was a minimal amount of research.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PresBushDid711","date":"2018-03-20T02:23:20.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just in case, on an off chance, Riot T is like this guy is wrong I'm going to smite him, the ticket number was 34108786.\nI say was because it has been \"solved\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Final Spark Lux","date":"2018-03-20T01:31:08.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there.

My \"support\" went Xerath with smite and ghost. He proceeded to leave me to lane alone against Graves and Thresh while he laned mid for a bit and then ganked top. It's no surprise that I didn't fair well, so then he starts gaslighting me for being behind when he wasn't doing what **he** was supposed to. \nThere were other issues as well, but we might have been able to deal with them if he hadn't trolled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PresBushDid711","date":"2018-03-19T23:39:00.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of curiosity let me check the grand response I got for my ticket....

By doing so properly, they end up taking alot of time from the enemy Top, Jg and maybe even mid. During those times, you are supposed to apply pressure elsewhere and get objectives. \n\nOne can be feeding 0/15/1 but if you are able to mow down a lane down to inhibs because of the pressure he caused, then it's a win for your team. \n\nYou need to know how to play around a proxy Singed. It's a very different strategy than the standard laning strategy, but it is super frustrating for the enemy team to counter if done properly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Awf Meta","date":"2018-03-19T21:58:31.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Find a premade.","replies":[]}]}
