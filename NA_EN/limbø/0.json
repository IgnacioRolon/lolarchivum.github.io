I thought it was a bug or something but then I found it was stolen.\r\n\r\nSo of course I wrote a ticket and of course they asked for information.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up, they weren't willing to help me and they were once stating that the given information doesn't match, and the other time that it's not enough.\r\nAfter about 10 emails full of information and screenshots they repetitively stated that they can't identify me as the owner without even looking into my issue.\r\n\r\nThe info is very sensitive so of course I can't write it here but it's basically everything even tiny details.\r\n\r\nI'm writing this in hope of some Rioter or specialist seeing it, because claming that this is not enough information is ridiculous to me, also it is backed by screenshot. I had a very poor experience with the support team helping me out so I'm hoping for a better experience, maybe a 1 on 1 chat, conversation.\r\n\r\nIf a Rioter sees this, please comment and I will contact you about my issue, if possible.\r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-03T01:24:13.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't find the ticket you're talking about since this isn't the account you sent it under, so it's kinda hard to really be able to say much about it. \n\nIt sounds like you've been trying to send us screenshots of information to try and prove that you were the creator, but that's not going to help unfortunately. You need to focus on the account recovery questions, as those were specifically picked because of how hard they are for anyone to figure out *unless they themselves created and played on the account*. \n\nFocus on the questions they're asking and answer those. If they don't match our records though, we can't allow access to the account. If you'd like, send me the ticket number so that I'm able to pull it up to see whats going on.","replies":[{"poster":"Limbø","date":"2017-10-03T17:13:28.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course it wasn't only screenshots, there were a looot of emails in information. I didn't answer all recovery questions but I provided a lot of info.\nHere is the ticket number : #31948009\nAnd here is my twitter in case you want to hear the full story which is a lot, because I can't talk about it publicly of course : @HollowHollow123\nThe problem with the support was that they didn't review the case but only if I am the owner which is fine of course but, I provided, in my opinion enough information and they either said it doesn't match, or that it's not enough.\nYou can sense some rudeness in my words at the end I guess but I apologise it was due to frustration.\n\nI really appreciate the reply. I hope I can get my account back soon with some help.\nAlso I'm sorry if my replies are late but I have school studies homework etc. I will be available as soon as I can, If a 1 on 1 conversation is needed or possible, I am available all Friday night and weeked (GMT+2).

I'm still wondering how it's not.. please if you can hook me up with someone for a conversation or chat, I've lost one account for toxicity and I'm not letting this one go when I have reformed and done nothing wrong.. {{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T00:38:52.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was able to pull up that ticket, but like I said in my previous response, you need to focus on the questions being asked. Providing unrelated screenshots won't help the situation whatsoever. If someone has hacked your account, they can see everything in your loot. Your comments in the ticket about loot contents are therefore useless since the hacker would have that as well. This also goes for icons and previous ranks and played matches etc. All of the information you've tried to provide is easily obtainable by a hacker who has your account. \n\nAt the end of the day, both myself and the ticket agents have given you the tools to recover your account. Focus on answering the questions they are asking, that's the only way you'll be able to recover your account.","replies":[{"poster":"Limbø","date":"2017-10-04T08:30:15.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well out of the questions, I kind of answered the account creation date thing, not exactly because I can't remember but so what.\nAlso, the hacker wouldn't know the exact last date when the email and password were changed, I also provided the previous password, doesn't that help ? I answered about the gifting history too.\n\nAnd honestly about the account creation, I don't even remember when I made this account and it's level 11, I don't know how anyone would remember that if not written down somewhere.\n\nLike I don't know what information to provide more, they asked about creation date, I kind of answered, they asked about first RP purchase, I couldn't answer that but that was so far long ago I just can't remember. They asked about gifting history, I provided gifts to others, what the gifts are and to whom, also what gifts I have received and from who.\n\nAlso the screenshots provide proof that the email I had my account with, was attached to that account. The loot thing, sure if it's a friend and he knows when I open and what I open ok. But about the skins, I have manually counted them, and no one who has access to that account could do that right ? There are programs which someone can see how many the skins are like Elophant but it isn't updated for the new client. And of course since the hacker or whatever might have done that by now too I don't know. \n\nI'm surprised that no one is alarmed that someone knows this much information about supposedly 'not his account'.\n\nCan I ask again, is a 1 on 1 conversation possible, or a chat which would be more convienient probably. I know it could be hard but if you hear me out I think I can convince a specialist that the account is my property with information and the story of what happened. I also have my friends list who can I guess confirm things but that would be rather useless I guess.\n\nIf you decline or a 1on1 chat is simply not possible, could you contact the currect guy who has my account, the stolen one. And ask him if he knows all these details. That might prove something in my opinion.\n\nAbout the ranked games this season, sure he can see who I played and how many games&wins I have, but he can't access with who I played them with, and that information I have provided.\n\nAlso you can clearly see that the premades the account is playing with are completely different, like I said I can contact people from my friends list who can confirm they have been playing with me for a long time. \n\nIsn't it fishy when suddenly an account gets moved, it changes the friends, changes all rune pages names, playes entirely different champions and with entirely different people. I did that too but after I took a break from league. This happened in a day, and it has been about 5 days since then.\n\nAgain if a chat instead of emails or replies on forums is possible, since I can tell everything in details, please tell me.\n\nSo thank you for the reply, I will keep pushing to return my account because I'm not letting this one go when it's not my fault that I've lost it.\n\nSorry for the inconvenience but I'm frustrated as well.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nThank you\n{{sticker:galio-happy}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T20:36:39.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Isn't it fishy when suddenly an account gets moved, it changes the friends, changes all rune pages names, playes entirely different champions and with entirely different people.

We need to be 100% sure that the person we give the account to is the rightful original owner. \n\n> Can I ask again, is a 1 on 1 conversation possible, or a chat which would be more convienient probably.

We do also have our Live Chat beta, but those are limited to certain times of the day. You can find it by going to a ticket and looking for the Live Chat button at the bottom. \n\nAlso, there isn't any convincing that can be done. Account security and recovery are done by providing answers to those question. Additional info doesn't help. Again, the only way to accurately show us that you're the original creator and rightful owner is to answer the questions being asked.","replies":[{"poster":"Limbø","date":"2017-10-04T21:06:53.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I'll try the live chat then.. but..\n\nYou know, please tell me, if I can't answer some of the question cause I simply don't remember, I can't prove I'm the owner of the account ? .. It has been so much time I don't know if I can remember, hell I don't even remember on this one as I said ..\n\nAlso I just checked, the guy has played some ranked games on the account.. I hope the rank doesn't fall .. if I even get the account back that is..\n\nI mean, I really don't have anything else to provide except the full story do I, I can't remember 2 or 3 of the questions.\n\nAlso you know, there's proof that I have played on the account, have written support tickets on the account, played with people who can testify, and the account was attached to the email I wrote the recent ticket from, and that should at least prove something, shouldn't it ?..\n\nYou probably saw when was the last email change since I stated it, wouldn't you wonder, why after a year and a half, for one day, everything gets changed. \n\nAlso by my guess since I thorougly checked my email, the person has probably gotten my account with a ticket, and I specified how.\n\nWell, ok. Let's say he said, on the date of the last email change, I was hacked. So why didn't he write a ticket for a year and  a half, I saw and no one has accessed my email or nor Riot has sent a code for a password or email change.\n\nDon't get me wrong I'm not judging your system but I don't agree, surely, the questions are needed, but I think additional info ,which is a lot and some can't be accessed by anyone else than the owner,  should be deemed useful. \n\nSince you agreed that it's fishy that I know so much about 'supposedly not my account'. Could you or one of your colleagues, please contact the person who owns my account now, and ask him about those things.\n\nOf course many of those things he has probably checked in case I write a ticket so he could answer but there are some things that he cannot for sure.\n\nCould you contact me on my twitter for some direct messages to request what you can ask the currect owner of the account that he can't know for sure ?\n\nI'm asking you because you have knowledge about the situation, if it's not possible, could a colleague of yours contact me there for a chat ?\n\nIf not I'll try the live chat as you said.\n\nHere is the twitter : @HollowHollow123\n\nAlso I get that it's not about convincing, but I think, when you hear what I can say, you can connect the dots that something is wrong.\n\nI'll be available for the conversation on Friday night GMT +2. I hope you can hook me up with someone.\n\nThank you, yet again for having the patience. I was just excited for the new updates and this happened..\nAnd I got an F on math to top it off ;-;\n\nGood night or morning whatever it is when you're reading this..\n\nBest Regards ! \n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Limbø","date":"2017-10-05T16:32:52.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the way, if I get no luck with the live chat beta, I can't find it by the way, where did you say that button is placed ?
