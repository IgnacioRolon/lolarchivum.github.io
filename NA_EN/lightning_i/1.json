Using hextech repair tool\n2. Launching the lol.launcher.exe\n3. Deleting the League Client.exe and launching from lol.launcher.exe\n4. Downloading the League Client.exe\n5. Restarting my pc and doing all the above \n6. Leaving it for a while\n\nAll that didn't work and it still keeps relaunching itself\n\nP.S: please don't tell me to check the connection guide, my connection is just fine Thank you :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-15T22:49:12.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a peculiar case so I asked our Tech team about it, and we're speculating that there could be some conflict with your game files.  Try running League with a[ clean boot]( https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974#wq7).  If it boots up properly, start adding a few more apps or programs at a time to see if it might be the cause of the restarts.\n\nShould that fail, a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends)may be necessary in case your game files are corrupt.  This can be the case as well if you downloaded the .exe separately through a third party source.","replies":[{"poster":"Lightning I","date":"2017-12-16T13:05:43.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried a clean boot, didn't work.\n\nI ended up downloading the game all over again and it works now.
