Hope you didn't want to punish him because he has 2 mobility skills and a huge knockback.\nAnd now...\n...Stand behind your tank like a good little squishy? Don't worry! Lee will punish you both because you dared to use proper strategies like building HP on tank and being between your carries and their team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kalarepa","date":"2015-08-20T16:00:56.675+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those Lee Sin buffs right before worlds are final confirmation for me, that while balancing the game, Riot first of all cares about flashy champions with big plays in tournaments.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ihaveapotion","date":"2015-08-20T10:40:58.923+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"how can he be in more games when hes already in every game? ;l","replies":[]},{"poster":"Puppet33r","date":"2015-08-20T07:02:56.933+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't understand how people can hate lee **and** devourer at the same time.

There's a reason the top bans on literally every single patch are junglers.

Why would so many pros have played Lee Sin before cinderhulk if he was so shitty and they couldn't play him?\n\n> i don't even know what these boards wants played. tanks get played in the jungle and everyone is bored outta their minds, carries like elise and lee sin start coming back and people complain. do you want xerath and malzahar jungle or something? shut the hell up and play the game\n\nYeah, those are two different groups of people. That's a pretty dumb dumb statement. It would be like saying, \"omg I don't even know which party the US wants! Democrats get elected and people bitch, republicans get elected and people bitch.\"\n\nIt seemed like there was a much much more positive response to tanks being viable than there is to the devour meta we are getting into, as well as the worst meta ever, aka Zed/LeBlanc/Lee Sin meta.\n\n> people complain about zed, leblanc, and akali mid lane and they all get nerfed to hell. then we have viktor who can blow up someone from 1k units away and everyone is happy. not mention his aoe stun that can single handily win a teamfight\n\nDifference is that the first champs click on you and you're gone. If you can't dodge a max range ray from Viktor, he isn't the problem. And lol, \"not to mention his aoe stun that can single handily win a teamfight if everyone chooses to stand in it.\"","replies":[]}]}]}
