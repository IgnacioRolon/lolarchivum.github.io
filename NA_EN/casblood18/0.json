This is account sided i believe because when i played on a friends account for a couple of games it did not rubber band at all so i really need help and have no clue how to fix this. Simply rubber bands every time i click the move command nothing else, if i click the move button a lot it spas out, my player model. That is the video on top where you can see my player model glitching out, but the black flashing on the screen is just from my shadow play, i have no clue why it does that sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T02:18:58.470+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's two different things that could be going on to cause this kind of issue. If it **ONLY** happens when clicking, there might actually be some damaged game files lying about related to your clicks. The fix that, do a quick config reset with these steps....\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings\n\n\nIf that doesn't help, it might be a bit of a bigger problem with packet loss. In that case, there isn't a lot we can do on our end to fix it since packet loss happens before your connection ever reaches our servers, but we can still check to see what's going on. Grab the network logs from that game, and let our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan them, then post a screenshot here for me to take a look.","replies":[{"poster":"casblood18","date":"2017-10-05T03:19:30.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol sorry for the late post, Thanks for your help but I did some research and also some friend support, all I had to do was cap my framerate since it was so high ;D","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-05T03:21:51.687+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayyyyyy that'll do it too actually xD!
