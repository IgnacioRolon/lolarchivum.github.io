The mage match-ups can tend to get a bit trickier, however Maokai can comfortably rush Spirit Visage and its synergy with his passive ought to make him tough for most mages to poke out of lane. On top of that he has a solid gap closer with his W and deals decent damage, so he can engage on his opponent once he&#039;s built up some resistances to either chunk them or assist with a gank. Thanks to all of his CC he&#039;s tough to successfully gank in toplane, let alone the shorter lane of mid, and he&#039;s easy to gank for.\r\n\r\nThe idea would be to build tank just as you would in toplane, only rushing your MR items first if you&#039;re in an AP match-up. Like I said, I feel like this would work situationally and that it&#039;d only really be viable in scenario&#039;s in which you have an AP threat in toplane, for example a Vlad top. It&#039;s particularly good if you have a carry jungler and an AP or enchanter support as well, that way your providing a frontline tank to your team who&#039;s arguably a lot better at that job than a midlane tank like Galio. In the right situation, it seems like Maokai mid would actually be pretty strong.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2018-01-14T22:55:24.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main problem with it is that you then need to find somewhere else to get a large amount of magic damage be it something like rumble top or diana/fiddle jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaltLord451","date":"2018-01-14T22:39:15.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mao is just a tanky assassin so why not","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oxyrotten","date":"2018-01-14T22:37:16.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean he's un-killable so in theory he should be decent at any role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"z63XnLCMwX","date":"2018-01-14T22:35:12.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a person who plays Mao mid from time to time, he's strong against burst and weak against poke.
