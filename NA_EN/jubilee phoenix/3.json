These guys had incredible, defining performances all throughout their year in the LCK, and we want them to be able to call back to those moments and the champions they played (even if they went out of meta for Worlds).\n\nSKT skins interview from earlier today:\nQuestion: You get skins again, but the skin makers say it’s really hard. What do you want to tell them?\n\nBae “Bang” Jun-sik: I didn’t think about it, but if I had to choose one, I want to have Ezreal get one, a champion that I love, but didn’t necessarily be successful in this worlds.\n\nLee “Wolf” Jae-wan: I would like a karma skin. I’m really happy with Alistar, so I hope the karma skin is of equal quality.\n\nKang “Blank” Sun-gu: I’m still thinking about it, but I’m thinking of Zac as a possibility.\n\nFaker: I didn’t think a lot, but I did say that an Ahri skin would be good in 2013, and I still think that but I’m a little disappointed that I didn’t get to play her.\n\nLee “Duke” Ho-Seong: I didn’t think much about it, but I think Gnar would fit my image well.\n\nBae “Bengi” Seong-Woong: I played 4 champs but two of them already have skins so I’d like to have a Nidalee or Olaf skin.\n\nsource of the interview: https://slingshotesports.com/2016/10/30/highlights-from-sk-telecoms-championship-press-conference-with-korean-speaking-media/\n\nthose are official sources btw, if Rito agrees on making SKT {{champion:103}} for Faker, he will be happy for sure","replies":[]}]}
