That's interesting. The one thing I've noticed with some reports is the vibrating on the train is throwing people off, but I don't see why that would cause an FPS drop - if anything, I would assume it'd be the transformation. Buuut, if your computer's specs are above what's needed, that's a bit less likely to be the issue.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
