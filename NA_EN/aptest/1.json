The relative experience with the champion between the player and the other team is so far off balance, that you may be able to escape when you shouldn't, or get free kill when they underestimate you.\n\nI'm not saying Ivern is bad or good; in fact I haven't played with Ivern enough to make any judgement on him.  I'm simply pointing out that the highest win-rates you see are also likely a bit above where they will be once Ivern sees moderate play.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-10-15T11:26:08.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its probably mostly support ivern. You can cut off attacks with brush, cancel ults with brush, etc all because of how buggy vision interactions are.\n\nAdd in a pretty long snare/gapcloser, a shield, and a big dumb rock you can throw around to eat skillshots with said snare/gapcloser...yeah, he's a pretty decent support.","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2016-10-15T16:37:02.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"--\nI've had my AAs and abilities forced to cancel a lot of times by Vayne and Khazix players popping stealth at the right time. Pretty sure \"force to cancel due to loss of vision\" is an intentional interaction.\n\n--\nAll the iverns I've seen on lolking that have been both really successful and really high elo are playing JUNGLER ivern.\n\n--\n...Or the high elo Ivern players will find even more dirty tricks to play with him, and his win rate will skyrocket once these good players learn all his tricks, see Taliah. Im not saying where things will be in a week - but i think you can't tell either. \n\n\n","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rhody","date":"2016-10-15T11:12:08.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I can have over 65+% winrate in _**low Silver**_ with about 22 games using **_Windspeakers_** + {{item:1410}} {{item:3117}} {{item:3504}} {{item:3174}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3116}} on Ivern\n\nAnyone can if they are willing to practice him","replies":[]}]}
