What I would like to have is a short discussion about not the experience in the game that a mid lane player has, but the experience, opportunities, and general game-play dynamics that happen as a result of a mage or an assassin being in the mid lane, from a top lane, jungler, bot and support perspective. \r\n\r\nI would also like to move away for now, from the discussion about whether a mage or an assassin meta is stifling or oppressive or boring or all that. Simply to explore the affects that this change has on the rest of the game, for the betterment of our understanding. \r\n\r\nHere is an initial list of topics:\r\n\r\n1. INTERACTIVITY IN LANE\r\n\r\nAssassins are by nature short ranged. An assassin VS assassin meta creates a situation in mid lane where there is a lot of trading in lane, and generally the lane experience for both mid laners is &quot;interactive&quot; i.e. both champions are within each other&#039;s skill range, and both are interacting with one another while contesting for farm. \r\n\r\n2. GANKABILITY AND DYNAMICS OF GANKS\r\n\r\nHigh mobility of assassins make them hard to gank. Ganks on mid lane are diminished. Jungler involvement is more reactive as a result of miscalculated or ill-informed all-in from opponent. Gank Roams from bot lane to mid lane diminished. Gank roams from top lane to mid lane diminished. \r\n\r\ntop lane have less ability to be participate with team. therefore more focused on own lane. Bot lane suffers due to diminished ability to be hunter and increased proclivity to be prey. \r\n\r\n3. WAVECLEAR DISADVANTAGE\r\n\r\nPressure roams increase as result of lacking wave clear.  \r\n\r\n4. ROAM ASSIST INFLUENCE OF MID LANE \r\n\r\nroaming is more dangerous for supports. Junglers find more willing allies for roaming. Mid lane substituting jungler as roamer while jungler pushes the lane wave. \r\n\r\nYour thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2018-04-28T10:13:32.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i think it's a little disingenuous to just say 'mage meta.' there's a lot of different metas that cater to a lot of different mages (nuking scalers like veigar vs waveclear/utility vs artillery etc)\n\ne.g waveclear mages tend to also be roaming mages, like Taliyah, Aurelion, and long before them it was Lissandra. artillery can roam, but usually aren't good at it, and usually don't like to go deep into lane enough to be gankable, vs nuke mages who want to all-in you at the first opportunity","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2018-04-28T10:16:49.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> i think it's a little disingenuous\n\nCan you explain why you think that I am being disingenuous  (= purposely misleading), rather than being wrong? \n\nI mean I am going to happily change my position if I am not correct.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2018-04-28T11:32:10.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"cos you're clumping all mages under an umbrella when there are a handful of 'mage metas' we've been through that have all been enormously different from each other","replies":[{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2018-04-28T11:34:59.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, what makes you say I am intentionally miss-representing the situation, as opposed to being incorrect and making an error?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-04-28T10:15:26.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Team tactics change a bit after laning as well.
