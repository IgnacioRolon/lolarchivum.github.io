The \"Lock in\" button was grey and i couldnt click it even when I had 20 seconds. I tried locking in another champ but it had the same result.. When it went to 0 this appeared.","replies":[{"poster":"FQVBSina","date":"2019-06-26T15:26:31.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um, this is not apparent with your screenshot. If you have selected a champion, you will not appear as if you did not select a champion. A more convincing screenshot would be if you had a champion selected but the lock in button was grey. Other than that, we would need a video as evidence for this and it is likely a specific problem that happened with your set up and everything since I have never had this problem before.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Myrmiron","date":"2019-06-26T15:15:03.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just do what it says and try again, duh!\nhttps://www.memecreator.org/static/images/templates/2101305.jpg","replies":[]}]}
