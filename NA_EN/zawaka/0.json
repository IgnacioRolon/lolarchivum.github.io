His mobility needed to be nerfed but his damage was nerfed repeatedly instead.   His ult scales with mana? Why?  His farming is ok but for the most part you will never get to farm since you just die and do no damage back.\r\n\r\nWith a lot of other assassin offering similar mobility and 2x more damage I just do not see kass being use full anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"ADC Bard","date":"2014-10-14T20:56:36.500+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good riddance, now they should olaf fizz and the game is much closer to real balance","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoMonku","date":"2014-10-15T08:32:32.276+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's fine that Kass is in this state now.  As of now he is no longer a perma ban/pick because his power has been hit hard enough that he can't just easily carry any game he is picked in.  To use him now he actually needs someone who knows what they're doing with him and to scale a lot later into the game so he can be useful.  His abilities still allow him to farm really well and he actually has some unique build paths compared to other late game AP carries.  He can actually go tanky-bruiser if he gets icebourne/FH so he has things going for him that other AP mids/top don't.","replies":[{"poster":"FooDang","date":"2014-10-17T02:04:13.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, sucks he is not as strong as he once was...but if i want to pick him i can b/c he's not a permaban...still viable...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nhifu","date":"2014-10-14T20:59:12.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Win ratios does not mean a champion is underpowered.\n\nHis mobility is pretty much the same?\n\nHis farming is great for under the tower, W gives you bonus damage.\n\nKassadin is one of the best mid laners to follow up with a jungler ganking.\n\n\nThe reason he loses alot of games, is just because you want to play a certain champ, doesn't mean your team comp will support him.\n\nWhat does kassadin lack in teamfights?

They have been brought to the point of strong counter picks that need to be used carefully. It is not that kass has been nurfed to hard, It is just people are not used to having to play safer. Most of the time before this people would become majorly over zealous with void mids and be able to make reckless moves and still be rewarded for them. Now they have jumped in terms of skill level and pick order restraints. Kass is still a strong and viable pick again SOME but not ALL.","replies":[]}]}
