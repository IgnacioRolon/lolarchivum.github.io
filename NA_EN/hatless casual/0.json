Does anyone know if they have done that in the past?  If not, then you have your answer as to why there is not a back ani on the arcade skin for Sona.\n\n\nRiot.........would be nice to have a back ani on her though ;D....... yes please!","replies":[{"poster":"Hatless Casual","date":"2015-08-06T23:57:20.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's more about the asking price vs. it's actual value.
