She has not had ANY major changes since 1.x patch and now all of a sudden everyone thinks she is OP. She is not OP, other adc&#039;s are undertuned. Lucian and caitlyn need buffs, vayne DOES NOT need a nerf. Vayne is a duelist. You duel her 1v1 you&#039;re gonna die, don&#039;t cry that she&#039;s OP. Her range makes her VERY easy to vaynespot in teamfights.
