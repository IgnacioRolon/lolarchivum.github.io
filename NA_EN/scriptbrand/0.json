Ever since MF got her AD ratio returned to her R, she's been picked a lot more since it reduced her reliance on the magic damage of her W. Many champions suffer that very same fate though like WW and Yorick. The only champs that really do well that do hybrid damage are Morde and Jax but that's because Jax uses the magic damage early to win the early game while his AS passive, ultra short CD targetted dash, stun that also stops AA's, and a BotRK+Trinity to carry him late game. Poppy doesn't have those tools. Her E is a long CD and doesn't deliver damage-wise, her Q does a lot, but any kind of MR and it's practically nulled plus with the boost in MR to Visage and Veil, two common items bought nowadays, Poppy just can't put her hybrid damage to use.\n\nThere's also the issue of Hybrid being strong early to mid while mid to late it falls off and Poppy's early to mid game is probably the worst in the entire game. It's worse than Jungle Morgana's early with Morgana starting with Black Shield. lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-10-15T07:35:25.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her playstyle is typically boring compared to the current Lol champion generation.\n\nQ- a %HP bonus damage for no reason at all.\nW- A Grave's passive(switching the MR with AD).
