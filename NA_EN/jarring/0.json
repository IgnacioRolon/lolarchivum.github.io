The true culprits that should be banned are the ones that are causing it, that are causing people to get discouraged  not the ones that feel the need to defend themselves as they so rightly deserve to do even though they often use much more &quot;bad words&quot;. The sad truth is that these &quot;bad words&quot; used to defend oneself aren&#039;t even toxic to the players they are used against. More often than not, it&#039;s just laughed at, it&#039;s the desired effect of the toxic, but they are just victims, and most-if not all-of the time they deserve no punishment. \r\n\r\nI think we should be more lenient for the people defending themselves, and have much more severe punishment for people causing the toxicity with discouragement. It might not seem like they are using very bad terms, but to the player, its a different story. \r\n\r\nWords are meaningless compared to the intentions behind them. Discouragement is the core of toxicity and it must be dealt with swiftly. \r\nAnd as of right now, it is dealt with very poorly.","replies":[{"poster":"AraMoOse","date":"2016-09-07T22:37:11.480+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just mute them, nothing is gained from writing a novel on the subject.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2016-09-08T02:09:22.906+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Retaliation is not acceptable.\n\nDefending yourself is fine, \"defending\" yourself is fine.
