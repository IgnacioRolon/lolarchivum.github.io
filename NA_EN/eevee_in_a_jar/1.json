Every other lane or role, you have some flexibility. Barring away from the meta or what&#039;s a strong meta pick, this is regarding the future season. For instance, if I want to take Lee Sin support or Taliyah support, I should be able to. 90% of the games supports get shitted on even if you do everything right. If I pick a good support pick like Thresh, and let&#039;s say I&#039;m playing flawlessly... there will be someone who bitches at me even in gold or plat. Bunch of people take support players for granted when we&#039;re the most limited and restricted players in the game.\n\nI have used Lee Sin support to climb to gold and plat in my brother&#039;s former account. I have also used various other ones to good success; of course Lee doesn&#039;t always work. I usually pick Lee supp only into no-escape ADC or bot lane comps with soft CC. But basically we get choke-holded on this double standard almost no one else has to follow. Maybe I don&#039;t want to pick Thresh into Leona or Alistair. Maybe I want to go Taliyah and I&#039;m confident I can peel for you. **As a teammate, you&#039;re supposed to give me the benefit of the doubt. You can&#039;t just be a moron and say &quot;Well team game, you have to pick what&#039;s good for the team,&quot; then 2 lanes pick something like Nasus or Teemo... so Supports the only role you gotta conform and be forced to pick something you don&#039;t want because you say &quot;Team game brah why aren&#039;t you listening to me&quot; but you aren&#039;t listening to your teammates either showing what an asshole you are.**\n\nSeason 3 WAS going in the right direction when they attempted to make supports more appealing to play. Realistically all they did was make bot lane easier to net kills. You could still carry games as support pre-season 3. People just didn&#039;t want to learn how to. They want to punch a keyboard and get triple. Why do you think META champs are always popular and people who spam toxic meta champs are often assumed to be toxic players? The stereotype is merely a stereotype but there is some basis for the typecasting.\n\n**So right now you got supports being shitted on; literally like poop is being shat on our heads... then you got players who talk about &quot;team game, listen to me you fuckwad&quot; while refusing to cooperate with team. You can&#039;t just say &quot;Listen to what I say because I won&#039;t listen to what you say; team game listen to me noobs.&quot; **\n\nMake the game more appealing for supports. Make us more carry-able. People assume support is an easy role like people in my team who starts raging goes &quot;You play support you trash&quot; and then I 1v1 them and make them look like a moron. Many support players don&#039;t choose support; we pick fill. Supports have been treated like shit for a LONG time and even today they are. I digress but Zed is easy af to play yet when Zed nets a kill that&#039;s commendable but when I 1v2 their bot lane and net a kill it&#039;s like &quot;WTF KS&quot; and you get raged on. Get that shit out of here. Just make support a secondary carry that helps out the ADC. I&#039;m sick and tired of people who think their shit is made of gold telling me what I can or can&#039;t pick on League. I don&#039;t need to listen to 15 year olds who can&#039;t comprehend they are portraying the worst part of relativism and stupid bias.\n\nOne major thing you can do is seriously just change the support role especially laning phase with items. Starting items COULD be the same so they don't have to work so much into it but my God why is it so useless until the final build? I consistently play unorthodox support picks to prove it can work albeit yeah it won't work in worlds or challenger. But that's not what I'm doing. We're not talking about pro league games. Just talking about playing. 99.99% of players in League aren't even challenger or masters or Diamond (in fact when I was plat 1, I was only top 5% in NA). Yet they talk like they are in \"This shouldn't happen I don't want that in my game; in challenger this doesn't work because of this; in worlds they proved this doesn't work.\" Stop talking about those games; while they play LoL those matches are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the game you play.\n\n> **tl;dr So make items both more offensive and defensive; not the crappy welfare check items that it is right now. Make a support-only mastery page that fulfills both offensive or defensive paths. Don't make offensive or defensive better than the other. Offensive supports should be a thing. If I want to play Lee and play aggressive, high-mechanic, support I should be able to. (And FYI the lee isn't some blind stupid Lee support pick, if I play against no-escape ADC with soft CC bot lane comp, Lee Sin can work to great success)**","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-10-24T19:35:43.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dislike seeing non-standard supports because they're usually played by mid or top laners that just queued for support because of the quick queue time. And it's usually less about the champion they play as much as because they have absolutely no idea how to support properly. And they're the most likely to permaroam and go solo as soon as bot tower goes down and just play like a solo laner instead of looking after peeling the adc or warding.","replies":[{"poster":"Eevee In A Jar","date":"2016-10-25T01:37:39.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but what you're describing pertains more to the individual player's bad habit as a player; nothing to do with the champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-10-25T03:38:16.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what I said yeah.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2016-10-24T19:38:43.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or we could accept that support is a niche appeal and you could not make life harder for actual supports by letting retards take their mages bot lane and succeed\n\nReally, support is probably the most versatile role right now.
