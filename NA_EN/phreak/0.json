For me, the biggest pairing is the story of how I ended up giving League a second chance.\n\nI first heard about League before it ever came out. As a broke college student, I was pretty excited about the idea of a free-to-play MOBA, so I was following its development pretty closely. I remember signing up for the closed beta, waiting to get an invite, and when one finally did come, sharing the extra beta codes I got with my friends.\n\nProblem is, League was ugly in early beta. I tried it, it was fun, but man was it an eyesore, so I put it down pretty quickly.\n\n[Eew](http://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1422392555506/lol.jpg)\n\nA few months later, one of my Rioter friends messaged me, asking me to give the game a try, telling me League had been updated, and it looked a lot better now. Boy it sure did. Thankfully, my old Warcraft 3 team’s manager’s college roommate and I met each other at a random gaming convention years ago. He was doing gaming media coverage at the time, recognized me from his roommate’s team, and we became friends.\n\nMan, I was so close to missing out on everything League had to offer. But thanks to stumbling into someone I hadn't even heard of before, I ended up falling in love with League of Legends (hooked over five years now), working for the best gaming company in the world, and landing an absolute dream job. Thanks random chance!\n\n**So what’s your League of Legends origin story? What got you in?

League of Legends.\"\n*\n\nHis off-the-cuff, unexpected sales pitch felt much more authentic than my rehearsed bullet points, so I decided to ask him more about it. Then, for the next three hours, I abandoned my professional duties and listened intently to the journalist's in-depth analysis of everything League. As my MMO character stood unloved and motionless upon his spawn point, the journalist explained every mechanic of League of Legends in meticulous detail: towers, champions, winning conditions, ganks, the existence of a jungle, and the concept of \"Summoners.\"\n\nBefore I knew it, we spent the rest of the night theorycrafting strategies for success. I hadn't even played the game yet, but was already ready to try out my epic idea: *\"I bet we could get lots of kills if we teamed up as an archer and a stealth character!\"*\n\nAnd that's what we did. As soon as the event was over, we connected on Ventrilo and played in the closed beta for about ten hours straight, attempting to perfect our Ashe/Evelyn burst combo on unsuspecting champions attempting to traverse the river.\n\nAfter that, I was hooked!

Having never really been into/been good at RTSs either, League of Legends seemed like a weird choice for me, but I stuck with it... and then gave up at level 12. Nope, this game isn't for me. Uninstalled.\n\n3 months later I'm at uni and have a few hours between classes - I'd left the shortcut on the desktop (I'm not great at clearing out my files) and so I went back to the patcher and gave it another go after watching Guardsman Bob stream for a few hours.

I actually hated video games, I am a recovering Psychology major and I wrote essays on how they made you dumb and wasted your life!  LOL!  I started playing WoW about 10 years ago in my early 30's with hopes of salvaging my marriage to an avid gamer.  If you can't beat 'em, join 'em!  I met some great friends there, and raised me up right.  The marriage failed, but my love for video games did not.  After the divorce, I took a massive hiatus from gaming (6 years to be precise) as I went through that weird \"finding myself\" phase.\n\nMy youngest son started playing this game called League of Legends about 3 years ago, and I hated it.  I hated that he would yell at his sister to get off youtube because she was making his \"game lag\".  I hated that when I wanted to spontaneously get out of the small 1 bedroom apartment that we all piled into, he'd tell me, \"I can't!  I'm in a ranked match!\"  I hated that it reminded me of what it was like being married to his father.\n\nA year ago, as events unfolded as they do, I decided I needed to be home more, and pull back from a lot of life type things, to take a look at myself and my choices and reevaluate what I was doing and where I was going.  Gaming seemed to be a good way to stay home, save money and circumvent the inevitable boredom.  Around the same time, some work friends had picked up League of Legends.  They knew I was once a gamer, and was looking to get back into it.  We all started playing together, and I fell in love.  The lore, the strategy, the gameplay, the challenge.  I even started watching the LCS and have found the very first \"sport\" that I can actually avidly follow!\n\nThe best part of it all, it has completely turned around my relationship with my son.  We play together, we talk about patch notes, argue about who's OP and who's not.  I got him into watching the LCS and we're on a Fantasy League together!  This season, I finally feel comfortable with dipping my toe into ranked games, and he's my adc (I play support).  I finally understand what makes him tick!\n\nMy oldest daughter and my oldest son now play League as well, even my ex-husband picked it up after I entered my son into a tournament at Clutch Gaming Arena that was aired on Twitch!  I've actually played a match with him and my daughter, which means a lot to her, I think.\n\nI still have a long ways to go before I'll consider myself any \"good\" at the game, but that really doesn't matter, it's completely transformed my whole world.  I've now got my eye on pursuing a career in eSports.  I'd love to reach out to women, and encourage them to get more involved with watching, playing and supporting eSports, at any age, at any level.\n\nI should probably thank my ex-husband.  But mostly, I'm so grateful to Riot for bringing this new dimension into my little Fox Den.  :)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Baconhawk","date":"2015-02-02T19:28:47.201+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well my tear is fully stacked {{item:3073}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"V4P3G0D","date":"2015-01-27T21:28:43.768+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I graduated high school (2010), all of my best friends moved to different cities, and that was when we discovered League of Legends.

Actually, the first time I played it, I had a HORRIBLE experience.  I used to play World of Warcraft quite avidly, and was a multi-time Gladiator in Arenas.  Since I was very good at and somewhat obsessed with WoW, I had trouble getting into other games and learning how to play them simply because I didn't want to bother.  I was also a bit of a toxic player, actually I was quite a jerk to friends and random players in the game.  Anyways, my original League of Legends story:\n\nThe first time I played League was in 2011.  The game was really popular, and I had a lot of friends who played it.  One day, on my usual Ventrilo server, my friends asked me to install the game and play it with them.  I was reluctant (as I stated above), but I decided to give it a shot.  I had played the original DoTA once or twice, and was never really that interested or good at it.  So, my MOBA experience was definitely \"beginner\" level.  So, I get the game installed and make an account and am ready to go.  Naturally, you'd go into tutorials or bot games first, right?  Nope, not me.  My friends just invited me, a level 1, into a game full of level 30s with runes and masteries.  They just kept saying \"oh, you'll get it quickly, you're so good at WoW!\" completely ignoring the fact that this is a COMPLETELY different game. \n\nSo, we're in champ select, and I ask them who I should play.  They all made their picks, the only one I remember was Annie mid by one of my friends.  They told me to play Katarina.  So, I decided to just do what they said and picked Kat.  Again, I had no idea of how the game worked or anything.  So we get in the game, and I ask them what to buy.  No one said anything.  They just ignored me and went to their lanes (which at the time I didn't understand at all).  So I just bought what was recommended (IDK, probably Boots + health pots or maybe Doran's Shield) by the game.  \n\nI was constantly asking \"what do I do?\" to my friends, who just kept overlooking me and playing the game.  I was pretty angry, mainly because I was a top-level WoW player but I was like a fish out of water in this game.  I basically jungled without killing camps (I just ran around and tried to gank the whole time) because I didn't know what the heck was going on.  \n\nI finished the game with 1 kill (better than none, right?), 20 something deaths and who knows how many assists.  My friends then laughed at me because I fed.  So, I got angry and didn't touch the game again for about 2 years.  I started playing again in 2013 and eventually passed my friends I originally played with in ELO (they capped out at high Silver and I made it to Gold 1 with Plat 3-ish MMR on NA).  \n\nMy main account is now on LAN due to me living on the east coast and getting a horrible connection to the NA server, but anyways that's my League of Legends story.  The reason I started playing again was because a friend of mine begged me to and gave me the hookup with a starter pack that included a bunch of cheap champions and a couple skins.  I also abandoned my toxic demeanor (mainly cause I grew out of it) but am now just a casual gamer.  However, I love League of Legends (in the words of Imaqtpie and KiWiKid)!\n\nI actually played against Scarra and Nientonsoh in WoW arenas back when they played.  Seeing these guys had moved to League was part of what actually made me want to give it another chance.  Granted, I've made nowhere near the accomplishments they've made, I just really love the game. \n\nTL;DR: My first game was a feed-fest, my friends did not give me any reason to continue playing but eventually I did and now love the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rectifyer","date":"2015-01-27T22:40:48.505+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I was in a slump in Guild Wars, I was searching random sites for a fun free to play MMO.

At the time I was the Editor in Chief of ZAM, and would receive invitations like this quite often. I ended up heading out to San Francisco and spent the first night having drinks with Tryndamere and Pendragon. We bonded over our love for EverQuest, and I was eventually comfortable enough to ask them why I should care about League of Legends. They looked at each other and gave me an answer akin to \"just trust us, you'll see soon enough\".\n\nThe next morning all of the attending journalists met the Rioters in a hotel conference room. We received a quick introduction about the history of the genre, the team that built League of Legends, and of course some foundational information about the game itself. They sat us down to play our first game, and within the first couple of minutes ... I was hooked. RiotJeffJew was my trainer, and he did a great job teaching me how to play Warwick and Nunu. I played so many games, that I lost track of time and missed my return flight home. I remember emailing Tryndamere the day after the event asking him how much he wanted for an invitation to Alpha. For whatever reason they decided to trust me, and I became an active member of the testing community, as well as someone who also wrote about the game.\n\nBefore leaving ZAM we created a few League of Legends videos, [only one of which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AMDlvB2Yv0) I can still find. RiotPwyff was actually one of my writers on staff at the time. He expressed interest in playing the game as well, so I reached out again and got a few more codes for staff. He wrote some killer articles, and made League of Legends one of his main beats. \n\nI feel so fortunate to have had the opportunity to get into League of Legends so early.

Many of my RL friends had moved on, but I was still raiding and having a good time. One of my good friends, who I used to raid with, introduced me to the game. I had previously tried Heroes of Newerth, but was awful at it and didn't think MOBAs were for me. I had, however, enjoyed hero-focused RTS-style games before (which I was exposed to via UMS games in Starcraft), so I figured I'd give it another shot. \n\nMy friend and I played a few games together. She had me start with Annie, and I was awful. I didn't really enjoy the game, as I didn't understand a lot of the basic stuff and it annoyed me that a lot of things were obfuscated (like figuring out if a champion scaled on AD or AP during champion select). One day, I was browsing through the list of champions on the website and I found Sona. I had never played her, but I immediately fell in love with her just from reading her abilities. I loved the concept of a character that used music as a weapon, an ultimate that made people dance, and the fact that she could heal, since I was a long time healer in WoW. \n\nWhen she finally popped up on free champion rotation, I played her and simultaneously discovered the support role. I was completely hooked. It was all downhill from there. LAN parties every weekend to play League with friends. New champions. New roles. Endless lunchtime discussions about optimal strategies and builds.\n\nI don't even consider Sona one of my favorites anymore. But if it weren't for this champion, I probably wouldn't have stuck with the game long enough to fall in love with it. I wouldn't have become obsessed with League.

PSO2 was making me more and more depressed (at the time its grinding was literally endless and I hated the story). I remembered my younger brother had played League of Legends for quite some time. so I searched the game on Google. at the time stuff like clicking to move and top down cameras weren't my style of games but it was a PvP game and it looked really fun. even though I had the thought of playing League of Legends in early 2013. it wouldn't be until late 2013, a week or two before the Yasuo patch that I would start playing league. \n\nWhen I started playing, my first champion played ever was Miss Fortune. I had the thought of unlocking her at first until I started looking at all the champions league had to offer. when I saw Ahri, I immediately knew I was gonna unlock her first because of her kit theme and her character. when I came to Jinx's page, the splash art was kinda misleading(something about the hair) to what the page icon looked like so I ended up just going to the next champion page.\n\nafter grinding the IP to unlock Ahri(I unlocked Ashe when MF went off free week).

My friend begged me over and over again to try the game out and I was very reluctant to try new games out at the time (and now, still). However, I decided to try out the game and see what all the fuss was about and I soon found out. This game is incredibly addicting, even if most games are played on one map. It is not like FPS games where playing the same map over and over will quickly become boring. League just has so many champions to play and so many ways to play as well. The depth of this game is certainly better than FPS games because most FPS games do have a golden gun that simply dominates everyone else. League doesn't and that really appealed to me.\n\nEither way, the first game I played was Thresh. I just picked him because he looked really cool and I like dark monster-themes. Second game I played Nocturne and thought his ultimate was completely useless because I did not know that you need to press the ult a second time to dash to a target :^).\n\nNowadays, I enjoy theorycrafting different builds and items on champions, such as testing how big a nerf is to a champion and whether or not that champion's build path needs to be changed to compensate. Being a huge geek, I read up on all the champions and exactly what they do. While I have never touched ranked yet, I still very much enjoy the game for what it is and I love customizing rune pages and masteries to suit my favourite champions.\n\nLeague is my first MOBA and I am impressed to say the least.\n\nFavourite champions (atm): Zed, Yasuo, Vayne","replies":[]},{"poster":"crazee23","date":"2015-01-30T10:02:28.146+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I first got this game when I was maybe 12? lol I don't remember. but being that young I just didn't get the game and the concept so I deleted it pretty quick.

I started League of Legends to see what is everyone was liking about the game. I went to the tutorial and hopped on a normal game without bots. Realizing today I was one of those people with toasters. I communicated with the team and asked what should i do because i never went bots. My team was supportive and accepted me being noob. Of course the match ended up with me feeding and loosing but I decided to let go of league for a while because I was using a bad computer at the time and can only run so much. Even when my OS was Windows Vista, I tried giving league a shot that day. It is season 3, I finally got my new computer nice and running. It was a HP Pavilon quad core. After getting used to my new computer, my brother and my cousin just started talking about League of Legends. I almost totally forgotten League and started remembering it.  I decided to come back and see how the game is now. However, while back, I didn't want my original and first email so I deleted it and made a fresh new one. So that season I had to make a new one. The reason my name is 2moons is because of the revamped game Dekaron 2moons and my account name is literally that name. I enjoyed Dekaron so much I decided to make it that name because I want to remind myself on origins of my start here on league and how fun it became. People been noticing my name since season 3. Not any more I believe. I have returned when {{champion:267}}  was upon release. I tried getting to know the game better since I felt alienated for years then. Of course I was still feeding and being noob but only because I didn't have much choices since masteries requires lvl 30 for completion and runes costed a price. As a league player, I hoped in becoming a better player. However it wasn't just meant to be. End of season 3, there wasn't much for me. It is now season 4. I tried to be closer in rank but still wasn't meant to be. I am a bronze player. Almost came to silver during bronze 1 placements. It is now season 5 and I feel like I shouldn't beat my self up because i couldn't even reach to silver. However, season 5 is a new and since my arrival on league. I am trying to clean my self up and hopefully get to the point where I have complete champion pool and runes. Although I have been experiancing more lag than usual. Noob or not....I just want to experiance the game.

Our friendships got strong due to the countless hours on the old Twisted Treeline, in fact, we started playing 5v5 only after level 30, and after the old TT was closed. \n\nWe used to go to school early in the morning, watch clips, builds and construct theories and ideas on how to play against this champion, against that champion, on this lane, etc. We got home around 3 PM every day, and without even eating, boot up League of play until 5 in the morning, or at least 6/7 hours a day if we had other work to do.  The League has grown since then, and so have we. We all went on different paths, but we still get together a few times a week and play games, since we're hooked as ever on the game. Now especially since it's better than ever.\n\nWhat an amazing experience, this game. Even if we stop playing it tomorrow, it will forever be a huge part of our lives. \n\nEvery year in November, I organize a little celebration since it's another year on the Summoner's Rift, and we just all come together and play until one of us physically can't see any longer, or someone passes out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kitty Stark","date":"2015-01-28T17:49:06.345+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was introduced to League about 2 years ago by a friend I'd met online playing Minecraft.

My old high school buddy was pressuring me to play the game.  I think he had mentioned it the year before because he used to be a big fan of Warcraft III and the original Dota.\n\nIt wasn't until 2010 we had a math class together and there we met someone who actually had an interest for gaming.  So my high school bud popped the question \"hey, we should all play League together .. all three of us would be a team game\".\n\nI remember my first moments playing the game and how much I hated it.  I thought it was awful and that I couldn't understand what the point of moba games were.  All my friend told me is you have to kill the enemy team mates.  I kept sticking to the objectives on the tutorial .. to say the least I didn't really enjoy it my first time around.  But considering I was playing the game with 2 buds I was inspired to keep up with them.  I'm very competitive when it comes to just about everything so I couldn't resist the temptation.\n\nAfter settling for a year and a half or so I was finally getting a sense of what I was doing the game.  It was then I realized I had some hidden potential that my buddies never seemed to notice.  I would often 'practice' playing normal matches and kept up with the patch notes all the time to improve my skills and over time I didn't notice how much I improved.  I improved so much that I was doing better than my buddies.  I was winning more on solo than I was in pre-mades.  It came to a point where I had to give out the pointers .. strengths and weaknesses on each time before the match.  It was a fun time.\n\nEven if I just solo'd mostly on Season 4 I got to a point where I realized it wasn't the small game I used to play anymore.  I was meeting more people who play league.   League of Legends really pushed the moba genre in the forefront and I definitely have a lot of requests for premades though I don't have time to play league anymore it's always good to keep track of what's new.  I made it to Silver III in Season 4 which was a vast improvement from the last time I did ranked in Season 2 in which I got Bronze (there were no divisions back then, just elo).  I couldn't be happier other than the fact I do regret not doing ranked more often.  I probably would've reached gold.

Now before you throw me aside and just call this a smurfs story, hear me out. Ive been playing league since season 1 as deadlyjojo. but due to multiple friends refusing to play it with me and the feeling of isolation from playing alone for so long, \nI eventually turned away from league for months. ive played games such as  Wow, City of heroes even the free to play games like maplestory to pass the time. \n\nI couldn't play dota because at the time the community was so unforgiving i have grown to hate the game altogether and i was too narrow minded to figure out that there were other mobas to give a shot so i kept playing RPG games and proceeding to not have fun with the games eventually for the same reason as i had with league and move on to the next. i eventually completely forgot Lol existed, that is until i saw a familiar game my brother was playing.\n\nNow let me explain at the time me and my brother used to play City of heroes the most out of all the games we ever played together that involved an Mmo but it had recently had shutdown due to the company not having enough funds to run the game anymore, not because the game was so bad. in fact There was a point that COH eventually rivaled WOW for 1 year, until the new wow expansion came out, but that's beside the point. eventually Coh was running out of money to keep the servers running due to the source engine for the servers being so expensive to keep up, they couldn't come out with any expansions to keep up with the payments and not to mention they recently became a free to play game which was a big jump for the game at the time. \n\nEventually coh closed and me and my brother set out to try new independent games. I guess it was around mid season 2 when my brother started playing league and he was pretty new at it. i so happen to see him and one of our other coh/wow friends trying to teach him the ropes of what he/she knew at the time because she was pretty new to it as well. eventually My brother invited me to play along side him and learn the game together.\n\nI immediately reinstalled the game at the chance and unfortunately ive logged on to notice that my old summoner account was banned due to an inappropriate name. Apparently my account was hacked and changed then immediately banned due to the name. Luckily for me i  didnt spend to much to consider the lost account a big deal, in fact it was a chance to start over with my brother and see all the new changes, but when i created my new account and tried to enter my old summoner name, unfortunately someone has token the name for their own.\n\nI was a bit upset on that fact due to the name being a name i have used ever since i have started gaming online, but i guess i dint care to much and chosen deadlyjoe1 as my new name, ever since I have been climbing the lvls, proceeding to collect every champ and proceed to learn them all as well in order to find my role with the changes of the game as they went along. \n\nNow im here today. i learned every role, how they work, I have and learned every champ that was released so far and i continue being as positive as i can be as i play, and try to work with my team as much as i can. and according to my Honors for teamwork, friendly and honorable opponent id say im doing alright with the occasional bumps i have from now and again. after all, ~~*Im only human.*~~ Im only 1 summoner.\n\n\nTo Riot Games:\nThank you for all that you have done so far to get to where you are today. me and my brother still enjoy this game to the very day (possibly me more then him).

From the 1st shop keeper change to the 2 map changes. the new maps you have added and the one you took down. \n\nKeep up the good work and keep doing your best\n\nI know i will:\n\nYour loyal Summoner:\nDeadlyjoe1\n\n> Off to the next game! {{summoner:12}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"CritterZoid","date":"2015-01-28T20:37:41.233+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm lets see it was two years ago, still fresh blood in high school. I was an avid gamer at the start seeing as I was constantly playing games like TF2, or Starcraft II Heart of the Swarm. Yet one day completely unexpectedly, one of my friends who I never really could talk to that much, told me about league, of course me being a big gamer, and having played a few mobas (Smite, DoTA 2, ect.) I immediately was curious and decided to try it out, of course I was new, it's also where I officially coined my gamer name CritterZoid.\n\nStarting at level 1 being a total noob no matter how much experience i had with different mobas, I still sucked. The first map I played on was on TT and I was playing as Annie, even though I didn't know her that well, I quickly figured out her mechanics. I don't exactly remember my score, but i know it as pretty bad, that game I was introduced to many, many things. The bots were one thing, then I hit level 3.\n\nI was happy when I hit level 3 because going against the bots was getting to be a bit bland. So my friend gets me into my first ever PvP game 5v5 Sumoners rift (this was around season 3, or by the end of it). Immediately I was introduced to the horrid side of gamers known as toxic players. Of course it was to be expexted, my friend was level 23 at the time, and I was 20 levels  behind him, so I was against people who had a lot more then me at the time. We lost that game I think, but I didn't care I was still learning.\n\nWhen season 4 came around I went into ranked, naturally I sucked at it, but I know I won more placement matches then I lost, but I ended up in bronze, and I thought \"okay no problem, I'll fight my way out!\" Only then did I realize my mistake, in that I still fought, and fought hard, but it was all for naught. Yet I kept playing despite all the trolls, feeder, afkers, and just plain toxic people I still played, because I was having fun.\n\n2 years later, i got a job, but I play league as much as I can every day.
