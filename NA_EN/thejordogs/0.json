After a flawless search for the game and champ select, the game freezes in loading screen. Sometimes no images load and it stays black, and sometimes the backdrop and image borders load, but no champ portraits or summoner names do. On tabbing out, I receive a notification telling me that I have been disconnected, and to try connecting again. I have to go back to the client and reconnect, and it all works perfectly. By the time I load in it is generally around 3 minutes and it's a pain in the arse to get back into the game. It's happened 5 times consecutively so I'm trying to see if there's someone here who can help? Cheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Kr1sys","date":"2017-08-22T13:51:07.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having same issue, may or may not be related to the Denver issues in the 'unable to connect to login queue' thread also in this forum.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-22T15:48:36.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP is playing from OCE region, so he might not be impacted by the bad hops.

Although in my case, going back to the client and reconnecting doesn't always do the job, it usually takes several additional attempts. I got into my last ranked game like 10 minutes late. This happens quite frequently, like every other game or so.  I can confirm it is not a firewall/antivirus thing, nor a network problem. Checked both with the guide riot provides.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-22T15:47:49.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This black screen and freezing can happen when your connection is struggling to download assets and reach the game server.
