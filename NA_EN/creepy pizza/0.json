Ping rides around +/-50ms, rarely ever getting up to 100ms. Last night things changed though...\r\n\r\nAfter I finished a match last night, a little \"Give us Feedback\" window popped up in my client, asking me if I'd be willing to participate in a survey from Riot Games concerning my connectivity. I replied that I never had problems with my internet connection, which had been true thus far. \r\n\r\nLiterally the next game I played my ping was at 1500+ ms consistently, making the game unplayable. Ok, I thought, I guess that puts a cap on my gaming for the night.\r\n\r\nI wake up and give my internet a speed test, it's complete garbage. 2000+ ping, .07 Mbps Upload...\r\n \r\nI call the cable company the ask if they see any problems from their end of the situation and they say they aren't seeing any. I bypassed the router and had some success, but I literally can't even stream a song on the internet via WIFI now. I've tried resetting the devices numerous times, but what was previously a rig that was working perfectly for me is now just a fart in the wind.\r\n\r\nI wish I never told Riot how good my internet connection was...\r\n\r\nI SMELL A CONSPIRACY","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-30T17:10:49.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What would a conspiracy do?  Even if your internet is perfectly fine, you can still have issues connecting to specific servers.
