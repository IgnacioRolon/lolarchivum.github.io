You can find the threads by searching this topic in Google..\nIt is nothing Riot hasn't done in the past and there doesn't seem to be any kind of fix for it.  Some have said that it never comes back and riot looses players. So far the only fix i have heard working was changing default browser away from google chrome or disabling game music in settings.  neither of which worked for me..  Profit or performance riot.
