Bots are broken as well. The bots are spamming their summoner spells and their regular skills faster than normal since we had Doom Bots. I hope me and my friends aren't the only ones having this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-11T04:16:40.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It sounds like you're experiencing an unstable connection to the servers somewhere between your PC and our servers.

The bots are broken. I am getting ulted more than once from the same bots mid/late game in a 3 second period of time. Investigate and fix your bots. I have Uninstalled since then due to frustration at the state the game is in. I won't reinstall until the issue has been addressed. Also fix your fps issues in this game. It is causing major issues in games and it got to the point where I refused to play matchmaking/normals.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-20T21:59:58.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll need to see a [recorded highlight](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/client/client-features/road-pre-season-replays-horizon) (using the beta client) to confirm what you're seeing with the Bot's behavior. Regarding FPS issues, I haven't seen any mass influxes of reports for this, therefore this is likely caused by something local on your computer. I'd strongly recommend checking out the steps in our [FPS Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) which commonly resolve these types of issues.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Declined","date":"2016-11-20T22:08:13.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget that the AI bots have very rudimentary behavior, so if multiple bots are present, if one of them targets something, the rest usually follow suit almost immediately if possible.\n\nThis predictable behavior makes them easier to counter, but also means that if caught you're screwed because they can coordinate so well with each other, or at the very least incredible at converging on exposed prey.\n\nThe issue at hand here is the FPS problems, but we'll have to wait and see how it goes after he's tried your solutions.\n\nAnyway, sorry for jumping in like this, but would it be possible for you to poke your NOC technician 'Riot SuperFoxMan' and tell him that the guys and gals he met on his trip, hope he had a safe trip back to NA and if he got the.... thing!\nHe's not active on Twitter, Facebook, boards or social media :(","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
