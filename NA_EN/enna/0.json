The client goes wonky when the timer hits 0 and I get a message \"you have left.\" How do I tell if I lost LP for it. I was able to queue up right away afterwards. Did it not penalize me if I didn't get a cooldown?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-29T17:30:13.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you [left during champion select ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging)then you would have lost 3 LP and received a short wait timer before queuing as a first offense.  Is this happening regularly?  If you have a poor connection, then you have a risk of losing sync and getting left behind, and another offense can result in more LP loss.  Let me know!","replies":[]}]}
