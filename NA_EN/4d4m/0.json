My life has been extreme chaos over the past few years, and I am unsure where to turn. I live in a small town where its extremely hard to find a job, and having no car its near impossible. I am most likely going to be homeless in January and honestly don't know where to turn. I stream, mostly League of Legends, and sometimes Hearthstone. I'm not the best streamer, but I try to respond to everyone. This will probably be my last month and I was wondering if you guys would like to hang out with me and my small community of friends. I've been streaming for two years or so now, and only recently this year put up a donation page. All donations help and are greatly appreciated and go to improving my families life. A portion of donations go towards giveaways as promised when I started. Promises are made to be kept. Every stream, nearly all day I play with you guys and attempt to help. I do not cam/mic though, as I am a bit shy, which would definitely deter some people. I honestly don't know where to turn and I want to try everything. I don't post here regularly but what the hell.. Its worth a try. I may not get many viewers, may not get any from this, but tomorrow (later today, around mid day) I plan to stream and I am doing some giveaways. They're not much but its what I hope you guys enjoy it. I will probably stream for something like 10+ hours so stop by any time, if not I hope you guys have a Merry Christmas.\nLinks: \n[Twitch Link](http://Twitch.tv/xMissyMeganx)\n[Life Story (More about myself and what I've been going through)](http://xmissymeganx.tumblr.com/lifestory)\nGiveaways: December 23rd -\nTeemo Hats and Teemo Plushies","replies":[]}
