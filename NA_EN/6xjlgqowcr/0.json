I'm not going to even try to argue her case at all.\n\nVi and Naut can be reasoned with that their ults are point and click for the most part, but honestly I'd chock that up to power budget. Vi has two casts on her E and a dueling passive that shreds armor and increases her attack speed on her W, so part of her needs to be underwhelming during the early game. Naut has a shit ton of cc in his entire kit, including his autos, so I wouldn't consider his ultimate to be too underwhelming with its cooldown considering you don't need it half the time unless the target flashes away or you want to be even more of a cc monster during a teamfight.\n\nHec, Amumu, and Malphite are a bit harder to narrow down. I want to say power budget, but I can only argue that for Amumu and possibly Hec. Amumu's ultimate locks you down and deals damage, just like Sejuani's ultimate, and deals the same exact amount of damage. You could argue that Sejuani's ultimate gets a lower cooldown because it's a skillshot and I believe it has a slightly smaller radius and it has a lesser stun time (1.25 -> 1.5 -> 1.75 seconds at each rank) than Amumu's (2 seconds at all ranks). I won't argue about Malphite, because I plainly just don't know much about the champion to fairly judge his power budget.\n\nNot going to even bring up Gragas. His ult appears to be a skillshot similar to Annie's, but... eh. Don't really know much about him, but I'm just trying to help the discussion to the best of my ability.","replies":[{"poster":"KingKong2350","date":"2015-04-22T20:27:11.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Eve is not a mess at all","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-22T20:39:56.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of her kit is fine, but her ult just doesn't make sense to me and it seems like they can't decide what to do with her W so she has sticking power to follow up with her ult.\n\nLike I said, just my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"KingKong2350","date":"2015-04-23T02:16:03.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You use the W to open up.
