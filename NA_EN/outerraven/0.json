I don't post here often, but I'm a frequent poster in Reign of Gaming. Anyway, let's get to the point.\n\nI remember reading some time back that according to Riot Meddler, {{champion:266}}  was in a good spot and wasn't in need of any changes at the moment. This concerns me quite a bit, considering that while he may seem good on paper, his base stats are quite low for a melee champion which sets him back quite a bit compared to other champions. The base damage on his abilities are quite low as well.\n\nOf course, with his current kit he cannot be buffed, it simply has too much (mobility, CC, free sustain, damage, wave clear, poke, 2 steroids, revive passive). Which is why I tried to do my own rework, with the aim of removing what's toxic (free sustain) and what's out of place (poke, ranged wave clear) while trying to give him an identity that fits his lore: a teamfight-centric bruiser (think of J4).\n\nI got good feedback on RoG and some people insisted that I posted it here where Riot could potentially see. I don't want this to get too big so I'm just gonna paste the essential here and if you're curious for the explanations of why I changed what, you can follow the RoG link and check it out yourself. As always feedback is appreciated (NUMBERS ARE PLACEHOLDER AND EASILY CHANGED):\n\n\nBase stats: Increased to match standard bruiser levels.\n\n\nPassive: Bloodwell - no changes.\n\nQ: Dark Flight - Slight increase on the circle and epicenter size.\n\nBase damage increased to 90/135/190/225/270 from 70/115/160/205/250.\n\nCooldown reduced at all ranks by 2 (14/13/12/11/10 from 16/15/14/13/12).\n\n\nW: Blood Thirst/Blood Price - complete rework\n\nPassive: Blood Price: Aatrox's blood powers his basic attacks, dealing 10/15/20/25/30 (+0.1 Bonus AD) bonus physical damage. Additionally, basic attacks and spells now apply a stack of Cursed Blood for 4 seconds (refreshed every time a new stack is applied to the same target. Maximum 3/4/5/6/7 stacks per target). Every 3rd basic attack, the bonus physical damage is doubled and Aatrox loses 15 / 23.75 / 32.5 / 41.25 / 50 (+0.2 Bonus AD) health.\n\nActive: Blood Thirst: Aatrox calls all of his own blood in the nearby vicinity back to him, consuming all nearby Cursed Blood stacks, dealing 60/90/120/150/180 (+0.2 AP) (+15% bonus damage per stack) magic damage to all affected targets and slowing them by 20% (+10% per stack) for 1.25/1.5/1.75/2/2.25 seconds. Additionally, Aatrox heals for 10/20/30/40/50 (+15% bonus health per stack) (+1% per Aatrox's missing health) health per target. Healing from minions is reduced by 50%.\n\n \n\nCooldown: 14/13/12/11/10\n\n\nE: Blades of Torment - Removed\n\nNew: Impalement: Aatrox's next basic attack pierces through the enemy, dealing 20/40/60/80/100% of his total AD in bonus physical damage to the target enemy and all enemies behind it in a line. Additionally it shreds their armor by 5%/10%/15%/20%/25% for 3 seconds.\n\nCost: 5% of current health.\n\nCooldown: 10/9/8/7/6.\n\nRange: 500\n\n\nR: Massacre - Partial rework\n\nAatrox draws in the blood of his foes, dealing 100/200/300 magic damage to all nearby enemies and pulling them closer to him. Additionally, Aatrox gains 175 attack range and his basic attacks deal 50% damage to all surrounding enemies except for the main target, for 12 seconds.\n\n\n\nRed bait: @Riot Meddler @RiotPhreak @RiotClassick @Classick","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-01-21T08:40:47.626+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I would personally like to see {{champion:266}} taken in a different direction (he could be the bloodlust-inspiring avatar of war from his lore, and become a team-empowering frontliner), these look like mostly excellent changes to him. While Aatrox is balanced in his current state, he is also one of the blandest champions in the game, and his intended core playstyle (autoattack-based drain tank) is implemented in such a way that it cannot be properly brought out without creating serious gameplay issues, namely his free infini-sustain. The new W you gave him gives him a significant gameplay choice between hitting crowds of enemies and focusing on single targets for CC, and I think you could even make this go further by making the healing dependent on Cursed Blood stacks: that way, you could give Aatrox fairly harshly gated healing early on, where it's most problematic, and then have it massively expand to the late game, where he's meant to be a drain tank. I would still keep the converging projectile on E (it's really cool and does have a lot of good gameplay behind it for Aatrox and his opponent), and turn the slow into the armor shred you proposed, but in either case it's a great idea to have Aatrox contribute utility for his whole team along with himself.\n\nGiving Massacre a focus on AoE power and damage is good, but I don't think Aatrox really needs a self-centered group pull, particularly since it just becomes redundant with his range steroid (it lets him reach targets more easily). While this is also true for Aatrox's current ult, there's a lot going on here, and it would be better to take a look at what the ability's main goal is and work from there (does he really need the initial AoE magic damage, for example?).","replies":[{"poster":"OuterRaven","date":"2015-01-21T12:13:56.184+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Auto-attack based drain tanks simply are not healthy for this game.

It gave him too much safety in lane and more utility that doesn't fit his theme (ranged poke and wave clear). You can't really justify buffing his base stats while he still has his old W and his old E.\n\nI already answered this before, but while the AA range increase may seem redundant, it is necessary for when the enemy retreats after your pull. They're not gonna stand there, they're gonna try to run away from Aatrox. With the AA range increase, he can land a few more AAs before they're out of his range so he can provide his team a stronger AoE slow with his W and a stronger heal for himself.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-01-21T19:05:13.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OuterRaven,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XE3Bkayr,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2015-01-21T12:13:56.184+0000)\n>\n> Auto-attack based drain tanks simply are not healthy for this game.

However, if you were to decouple the healing from your champion's damage, such as by having it scale with your health (ZenonTheStoic was working on a version of that on his {{champion:19}} kit), you could avoid that kind of situation by having your drain tank still function without being required to deal too much damage.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=OuterRaven,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XE3Bkayr,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2015-01-21T12:13:56.184+0000)\n> \n> The W active is reliant on cursed blood stacks, as in you cannot activate without at least one stack being near his vicinity (think of Twitch's E).\n\nYes, but what I'm saying is that you can go a step further and parcel the healing based on each stack your opponents have (like {{champion:29}} 's E but in reverse), so if you had a total of 10 stacks lying around on 2 enemy champions, for example, it would heal for more than 3 stacks on 3 enemy champions. As a side note, while I'm guessing this is already the case, you might have to specify if the AoE damage on your new ult applies Cursed Blood stacks.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=OuterRaven,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XE3Bkayr,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2015-01-21T12:13:56.184+0000)\n> \n> Sorry, but the old E had to go.

You can't really justify buffing his base stats while he still has his old W and his old E.\n\nI think you're targeting the wrong ability here. His current E only grants him safety because he can heal for massive amounts while poking down his enemy, which is admittedly not a healthy gameplay pattern. It's his W that's the problem, not his E, and even if his E were a problem you'd still be mostly treading over them with the new ability you gave him. You're still giving him ranged poke and waveclear (plus more utility than before, with the new armor shred and the slow being moved to W), except you're making it even more dependent on laning, because you'd need a minion to damage your opponent behind it. I think his old ability's thematically fine ({{champion:14}}, a durable and disruptive close-range initiator, has ranged poke and waveclear with his E, why can't Aatrox have his blade poke?) and carries good gameplay (it's more difficult for him to poke targets at farther ranges, due to the shape of his projectiles), so I still don't really see the reason to change it.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=OuterRaven,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XE3Bkayr,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2015-01-21T12:13:56.184+0000)\n> \n> I already answered this before, but while the AA range increase may seem redundant, it is necessary for when the enemy retreats after your pull.

With the AA range increase, he can land a few more AAs before they're out of his range so he can provide his team a stronger AoE slow with his W and a stronger heal for himself.\n\nBut isn't the slow after his pull strong enough? You're already giving him a self-centered {{champion:61}} ult and the power to hamstring multiple enemies at the press of a button, on top of his existing knockup; does Aatrox really need all of those bonuses and effects to help him stick to his targets? I'm not saying you need to get rid of the range increase, specifically, but there's a lot going on with your ult, and I think it would be better if you trimmed it down to the essentials and made those effects strong. Current Aatrox suffers from a big case of diluted power, mainly via the split autoattack steroids on his passive and ult, and I think one of the best things that could happen to him would be to concentrate his power as much as you can (which you've done really well overall).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Manwad","date":"2015-01-21T02:12:12.084+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Done turned him into a burst Voluc.\n\nThis looks awesome.

In the jungle his whole goal is pretty much to get early ganks and snowball a lanes but if he doesn't do that then he will be in trouble because his mid game is pretty awkward as jungler. (At least for me anyway because if i build a tank item i do no damage, but if I build another damage item then I just get bursted down.)\n\nAs a top laner he is full of counter play his sustain does not become a problem until he gets an item and it only works when he is under 50 percent HP and even then if the Aatrox player is only using the heal then they will never win any trades. His Q is god awful. He can die during it, it is interruptible, he can get cc'd which will again cancel his jump, it is slow, if you don't land them in the middle then you failed, and it cost 10 percent of your HP.  His E is pretty good over all the slow could be either more potent or longer to prevent him from getting kited, and his Ult looks cooler than what it actually does lol\n\nBut over all he is a decent champion that doesn't really need an overhaul all he needs is either a slight increase on his q or change his ult to physical damage that scales with AD and he would be fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gromble","date":"2015-01-21T20:46:12.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's strong because he has great jungle clear, sustain, and lvl 3+ consisstant ganks. he has a great initiate,escape, and CC in team fights with his Q and passive.  Devourer fits him like a glove and with Botrk  He becomes a absolute beast. His E snares multiple people in group fights and catches runners allowing you or your team to catch them. The longer the game goes the stronger you get.\nHis sustain isn't toxic because it really doesn't help in team fights at all. counterplay is that he melts like ice in the microwave when focused. Toxic is some flashy obnoxious skill like a blitz pull or kat ult ect ect.A small bit of sustain on the third hit doesn't even come close to that. If every 3rd hit chunked the enemy for like 30% of their lifebar and healed you it would be toxic.\n\nWith the right ruins, items, masteries, and strategies he is pretty awesome.

However, unlike other bruisers, Aatrox's abilities cost health. And not meaningless health costs like Vlad's abilities or Mundo's abilities, they're health costs that actually hurt if you're not careful.\n\nAdd to that the fact that with these proposed changes he is forced to trade with his lane opponent in order to gain access to his sustain and the fact that he's severely weakened after he is revived due to Bloodwell being empty, I think that with proper number tweaking this rework will leave Aatrox in a healthy, balanced state.\n\nThis way he has clear strengths, weaknesses and a proper identity, instead of the live Aatrox where his base stats are incredibly low, has access to free 0 counterplay sustain and is overall not very fun to play as (due to how weak he feels) or against (due to how incredibly hard it is to deal with his sustain if he gets ahead).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Phoneixflare","date":"2015-01-21T01:30:22.526+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like this idea a lot!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DaedricTerror13","date":"2015-09-06T03:23:13.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love his W the way it is and its my favourite part of his kite, but even with all this I still think he'd suck but sure I'll support you.\n\nBut not your W idea, the sustain tank thing is the funnest part about him, even if it kinda sucks unless ur fully fed or kiteable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDevice","date":"2015-03-19T19:53:09.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can kinda dig everything except the radius changes to his Q and the rework of his E.

I really hope Rito looks at this.  It makes me think of a less mobile-more tanky melee {{champion:429}}.\n\nI do think his passive should be tweaked a little though.  I would add some kind of aoe to the end when Aatrox is up.  His primary weakness is burst damage, so a minor amount of counterplay is involved when deciding to all-in an Aatrox.  My 2 cents.  Good stuff man!","replies":[{"poster":"OuterRaven","date":"2015-01-21T17:33:40.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback! I used to play Aatrox quite a bit and in my opinion his passive is perfectly balanced. It leaves him in a vulnerable state after getting revived due to low health and empty Bloodwell, but it is necessary in order for a bruiser with a revive passive to be healthy.\n\nWith this rework he already has a lot of utility, I think an AoE effect after his revive would be too much.","replies":[{"poster":"Daaaaang","date":"2015-01-21T17:45:54.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea.. I agree to a point.  I think his passive is GREAT early.  I dive for first bloods ALL the time.  But as soon as you get to midgame, where fights are generally not 1v1, his passive is almost useless unless he's huge.  You get rekt as soon as you get back up, because you have no attack speed and half your health (if you were able to fill up your blood well completely).  I think with the rest of his kit being underwhelming (again mid-late stages) he needs some kind of boost to stay relevant in team fights.\n\nI wouldn't make it a good chunk of damage.. but enough to make someone at less than 25% hp think twice before all-inning.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
