Almost every champion with an execute has some sort of marker that tells enemy players what is going to happen and a chance to do something about it (heal, zhonyas, etc). \r\n\r\n{{champion:238}} - Ult marker changes when it will kill you\r\n{{champion:31}} - A red, toothy, ring will appear at your feet when his ult will kill you\r\n{{champion:86}} - Giant glowing icon to let you know that you are the villain and his attacks will do true damage\r\n{{champion:122}} - Drops of blood and sound effects lets you know when his passive has reached max stacks\r\n\r\nConsidering that Pyke's ult ignores resistances and shields I think it is important for players to know when they can be killed by it to give them a chance to play a little more safe. \r\n\r\nAlso take into account that the execution marker for Pyke can vary greatly game to game and player to player. For me? I build resistances on Pyke, so my ult executes targets at around 10% health..which is very readable. Full AD Pyke builds on the other hand will be able to execute at a much higher health state, and I think enemy players should be able to see this without having to check his build by tabbing or clicking on him.","replies":[{"poster":"ReshiKillim","date":"2018-06-14T17:12:23.284+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":9,"body":"That'd be a major nerf to Pyke, tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"Hay5eed","date":"2018-06-14T21:40:17.805+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, cause letting enemy players know when you can delete them hurts your strength. \n\nI'm sorry about that, but if the majority of Pyke's strength comes from players not knowing his strength then I think that is a flaw in his design.
