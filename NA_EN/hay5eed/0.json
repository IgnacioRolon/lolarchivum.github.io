He has considerable mastery over sand and miscellaneous magic, and sand is just tiny rocks, so he must have some valuable information that can assist her, and if not, he is a gosh darn god-emperor; he can get her the training she needs.\n\nAzir discovers someone who wants to protect Shurima as much as he does, and Taliyah learns the evil overlord out to enslave her people just wants to give them a better standard of living, though he is a little out of touch with the times. Bam. Through mutual interests a friendship is formed across hundreds of generations. Taliyah becomes the poster child of Shuriman patriotism and Azir is the emperor he always wanted to be, beloved by the people.
