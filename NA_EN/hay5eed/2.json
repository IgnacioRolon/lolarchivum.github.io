I know a Blitzcrank can grab it, but can it be knocked up? Furthermore, can a knocked up soul be ulted by Yasou? If an AOE effect goes off (lets say, a Ziggs ult) and both the soul and the soul&#039;s owner are caught in the blast, will the owner take extra damage because his body was damaged AND his soul was damaged? Can souls be ignited or smited? Can Vayne&#039;s silver tipped bolts proc on souls? Do on hit effects apply to the souls owner (for example, MR reduction on hit with wit&#039;s end and AR shred with Black Cleaver)? Can Darius bleed souls?\r\n\r\nI have so many questions, please help me","replies":[{"poster":"Aeolian Melodies","date":"2015-12-01T03:55:25.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oddly it's considered a minion for the purpose of {{item:3302}} 's line of items but it's somehow also considered a champion for the purpose of {{item:3303}} 's line of items.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-12-01T06:05:26.433+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, we're a bit inconsistent at present when it comes to champion clones, ghosts, copies etc, with both some champion only and some minion only effects affecting them.
