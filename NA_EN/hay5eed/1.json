Rek-sai&#039;s E ability when burrowed (i.e. her Tunnel) apparently has its own separate CD then her E when unburrowed (her Furious Bite). This mean that if I Burrow, Tunnel, AA to Unburrow, then want to escape, I&#039;ll glance down and notice that my E is off CD, hit W to Burrow, but now that  I&#039;m burrowed my E is not Furious Bite anymore, but Tunnel...which is still on CD....which means I can&#039;t use it.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t think that other champs that have changing abilities (Nidalee, Jayce, Shyvana) have this problem (but I haven&#039;t been able to test this out), as far as I know they are considered the same spells so if Jayce uses his E in hammer stance and then instantly goes to ranged stance his E will still be on CD am I wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-08-19T06:13:42.619+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jayce, Elise, Nidalee and Rek'Sai have separate cooldowns for each form.
