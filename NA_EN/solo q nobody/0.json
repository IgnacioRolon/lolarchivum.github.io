Somewhere along the match I would get the \"attempting to reconnect\" thing and it legit lasted for more than 10 minutes. If the match was already over, I would be sent to the end of match screen and I would see that teammates said to report me, I was ok with that.\r\n\r\nI checked to see if was my wifi but there was nothing wrong with it. I could access other websites but I couldn't reconnect to the league client. Restarting the computer and league didn't help either. The firewall gave access to League so I'm really not sure why I have this problem. I checked to see if it would happen again on a different account and it did. \r\n\r\nIt stopped happening so I thought I was in the clear and I played pvp games and it stayed that way for the next 2 days. It happened again while I was in a game of Nexus siege and by the time I came back, the match was over and I got the notification that I would be placed in low priority queue. Its only 5 matches so I'm not that salty about it. Either way, hopefully I can find the problem soon so that I stop disconnecting from the client.\r\n\r\nThe AFK itself is report worthy but even still, the cause behind the AFK isn't intentional. I understand that telling the difference between an actual AFKer and someone who has technical problems is difficult at times.\r\n\r\nI wish Riot would make it so that players have to put an explanation of how things actually happened in order to report someone for AFK that way Riot has somewhat of an idea if the player is a straight out troll or if they have technical problems. pl0x show mercy, I fan...","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-28T16:21:11.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like your connection is unstable to the server. If the client goes to connect to the server but only get a faint connection and is unable to establish a full connection, it will often disconnect entirely. This is the digital equivalent of going to high-five someone and they leave you hanging, you'd basically crash IRL. \n\nThe [Leaverbuster system](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) treats all disconnection equally because regardless of intention, disconnections negatively impact everyone in the match. \n\nThe guide *Rineyy* linked is a great starting point in troubleshooting the root cause of this problem and I'd recommend testing any changes in a custom match to prevent future leaver penalties. If you still have these issues after completing that guide, please let me know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-28T01:34:23.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anytime you're experiencing issues, contact us and we'll be here to assist!\n\nYour issue sounds like it's due to a poor connection specifically to the LoL servers.\n\n[Troubleshoot your connectivity issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj","replies":[]}]}
