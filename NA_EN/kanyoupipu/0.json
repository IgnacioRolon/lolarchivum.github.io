Best of all?\n\nYou could finally have an individual skill metric that didn't require players to waste countless hours in games where their performance didnt matter.\n\nI know what critics will say \"its a team game\". \nBut if its a \"team game\" why does solo queue feel like it is us VS our own team?\nIf its a \"team game\" why is 99% of all flaming amongst \"teammates\"?\nIt isn't a team game. Teammates are supposed to be assets. In a flawed matchmaking system, they are liabilities. That is the cause of most frustration, toxicity, etc.\n\n1v1 would not only give players an outlet free of this solo queue torture, it could also help give Riot a clue as to how good players are. I'm not saying 1v1 rank should supersede solo queue, but I'm saying if someone is hardstuck iron 1v1, they shouldnt place Silver after a few lucky placements on summoners rift. If a player is Master in 1v1, they shouldn't place gold on summoners rift.\n\nThe potential for 2v2 on howling abyss is also there.... and I know. Twisted Treeline isn't played much... but thats because it suffers from the SAME PROBLEMS as summoners rift. You still have ganks and other lanes that can throw when you want the game to be determined by YOUR PERFORMANCE.","replies":[{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2019-06-07T00:52:17.151+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":">1v1 would not only give players an outlet free of this solo queue torture, it could also help give Riot a clue as to how good players are.

There is some overlap and some skills that carry over, but it's far from being equivalent. Being good/bad in one mode only implies that someone is good/bad in another. For instance, even if someone is an Iron 1v1 player, they could legitimately be a Silver SR player. Likewise for a Master 1v1 player being Gold SR.\n\nPlus, there's the fact that there's currently no permanent 1v1 queue. Jumping straight to adding a ranked 1v1 queue would be an unusual step. If anything, ARAM would be more suitable for a ranked addition, given its proven playerbase.","replies":[{"poster":"Kanyoupipu","date":"2019-06-07T06:06:15.952+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Minarde,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Y8rA5EwH,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-06-07T00:52:17.151+0000)\n>\n> A major problem with this reasoning is that it *doesn't* \"give Riot a clue as  to how good players are.\" 1v1 is a different game mode from SR and, accordingly, emphasizes a different skillset than SR.

I play more ARAM than SR now because atleast in ARAM i can get out after 8 minutes if Riot assigns an auto-loss\n\nYou dont have to start with ranked, you could have unranked blind pick... people already play in customs","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-06T22:43:30.790+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot doesn't even try to balance the game around anything but standard 5v5 SR.
