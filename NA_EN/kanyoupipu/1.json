So over time anyone not conforming to their G-rated boards get banned/censored and move to reddit, where the process repeats. You are welcome to disagree, **the problem is other people aren't because they will get censored because I am right**.\r\n\r\nI would also argue that given this state, the only people bothering to post are either so sensitive they like the censorship, or the typical aspiring mods posting the usual boring, corporate, lawyer speak and linking the summoners code in every post. (yawn)\r\n\r\nSo its 2019 and anyone wasting time on the boards is likely in those categories.\r\n\r\nI was recently suspended for referring to the Chinese Communist Party as \"Chi-Com\" for short. A moderator said that was a racial slur and I was guilty of \"racial hatred\". I'm not sure if the mods are that clueless, or if they are SJWs drooling for a chance to claim someone is a victim, but this is just stupid. \r\n\r\nCan we please get some accountability on the forum censorship. I'm sure this thread will be downvoted by the overly-sensitive low-T posters that remain here, but if I haven't made it clear enough...
