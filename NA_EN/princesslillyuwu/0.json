But stasis has always been something that has made me so frustrated. i understand that at the time stasis was created was during a very volatile balancing period where a lot of champs could do whatever the fuck they wanted what with kassadin just raping every one and you needed zhonyas to prevent someone from jumping on you and one-shotting you or getting one-shot from a long range. League has changed a lot and riot has laid out some clear cut metas and ways that the game is meant to be played. Mages are squishy AF and have a lot of damage, a lot of crowd control, and very low cooldowns. it's very difficult to approach a mage unless you're yasuo, but that's yasuos gimmick to just be able to approach mages and champs. but for any other champ ranged or not getting in close on a mage is a huge fucking undertaking. it's even more frustrating when mages really can just sit under tower and not miss cs with their incredibly long ranged abilities. but then they get stop watch and they just become unkillable. they become way too safe of a role. once they have zhonyas if you manage to actually get close enough to do some damage they can just ignite you, blow their entire load, and then zhonyas and win the fight because they do way more up front damage than you ever could.\r\n\r\nive flashed in on tons of mages only to accidentally kill their teammates instead of them because zhonyas saved them. I've won so many game winning team fights that i really shouldnt have because our lux support zhonyased when the team rightfully focused her, because she went a head and did half the entire team's health bar when she survived with 200 hp.\r\n\r\n i know that's a very specific scenario. but it's honestly every other fucking game this is happening where im winning and losing team fights only because any mage like lux, diana , and syndra keep doing that.\r\n\r\ni get im supposed not fight them when they have it up. so how are you supposed to play around it when the person you need to focus in team fights wont die if you focus them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what is your take on this item. is this really just me? i dont play mid lane every game but even then its a problem to me when my enemy laner isnt building it.","replies":[{"poster":"DalekZec","date":"2019-08-31T08:29:30.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HAH!\nI've seen idiots who say that Zhonya is a toxic item and a cheap oopsie failsafe of escaping, and not all who think that are even zed mains who are usually far up their own ass.\n\nThe hypocrisy is they all smack on Zhonya yet don't say anything about QSS, GA and Edge of Knight.\n\nEither AD champion mains are delusional or people are just annoyed they forgot about an item that outplayed them in the press of a button which in reality, they outplayed themselves.\n\nI mean, the god damn item isn't even all that great for a defensive build.

Yi also does not have the upfront burst damage that mages have and he isnt invincible for 2.5 seconds during Q. That's some pretty malicious misrepresentation.\n\nMages just sit way behind the backline. In xeraths case out of vision range firing non stop spells that chunk for 30% hp each.

As for shield thing 300+15%AP look impressive but isnt for dedicated item when riven has stronger version on much lower cd embed into kit. Whole point of statis is attempt to make attacker disengage shield dont provide same nieche. Honestly i dont like zhonyas and i am even for removal from game but not until it defensive purpose is compensated. Also assasins and bruiser dont have hard times and this types of nerfs/indirect buffs are at this time over the top and dont forget incomming buff round is around champions that makes mages cry.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-08-31T05:21:26.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wtf does your team being bad at dodging have to do with hourglass?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Failmageddon","date":"2019-09-25T04:29:04.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By this logic, then let's also get rid of QSS, Maw, Banshee's Veil, GA, Wit's End, those all have lots of defenses and powerful abilities and stats tied to those defenses.
