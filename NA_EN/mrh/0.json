I do not want to use the record button as that only records what the camera is panning. Is there any way to SAVE an entire match? Things I've tried:\r\n1. Located rofl. files but they are only 12mb or so big so that is not it. The actual video would be 1 gig maybe..\r\n2. I did not have LOLreplay2 installed when the game started so I can't use that. I did download it but I cant see recent games. Or am i mistaken?\r\n3. Tried looking everywhere for an entire saved match button or something.. \r\n\r\nAnyways any help will be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-11T19:44:41.391+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The entire match should be saved through our servers, and available through the client itself.  You can find it through the match history page.  If it's something you want to share, then the only current way would be to create a highlight per the [replays](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/234965248-Replays-FAQ-Pro-Tips) guide.  Creating a highlight will store it locally to your documents folder.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"MorningEspeon","date":"2017-03-14T21:58:54.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think what the OP is asking is if there is a way to download the entire replay to your harddrive without using the highlight tool, which limits what is shown to directly where the camera is, so you can instead share the raw replay file so someone, like a coach perhaps, can view the whole game and pick and choose what to focus on. \n\nPersonally, I want to know if there is a way to change the .rofl to some other format so it still plays and the spectator controls work, but you can view it after the patch changes. If not through the direct filepath, then by having a way to download previous patch versions to run on their own so you can still watch the replay.","replies":[]}]}]}
