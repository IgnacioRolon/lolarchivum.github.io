After I qued for jungle and recieved that the autofilled support who was apart of the trio demanded i switched. After only saying &quot;nah&quot; we get in game where the support took smite and follows me around the map the entire game taking my blue and red buffs. When he got in lane, he was stealing all of our adcs cs who was also not part of the trio causing him to quit laning bot and go to top lane. I then asked the other team to report the veigar support who was trolling then got roasted by the other two in his party. They were being super vulgar, started inting, and trolling me even harder. After a few minutes past by they would not ff as I was doing good, but they were not.  As time went on I said GG report the viegar who took smite and was following me in jungle all game, then the trio started saying that I said the n word, was super toxic, was purposely trying to make them lose which none of the above was true. The other team sided with them becasue they had three people lying to make up for the viegar. We eventually won the game and I joined a new lobby where I was instantly perma banned. Not knowing what just happened, i began to contact riot support where I was not helped at all. The ban did not even say what i was banned for, it just said 4 people in the last game found you to being tilted. I then contacted riot where they said the ban would remain. I challenged this over and over asking them how I was toxic and what I got banned for. They came to the conclusion that calling for reports is unsportsmanlike and will result in the final ban. After grinding on this account for over a year, and spending over $500 my account got banned for &quot;asking to report a support who got autofilled and took smite follwoing me around the map all game stealing my camps&quot;. Riot support seemed to think that asking to report is unsportsmanlike and continued to finalize the perma ban on an account that I have grinded and spent alot of money on while these trolls who ruined the game for me and my adc are still out there. I am astonished that I got banned, and riot did NOTHING about this besides tell me that I am responsible for my actions when all i did was ask to report the support.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-11-13T03:32:41.279+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, harassing the troll is what got you punished.
