It was weird but when i restarted it it was fine. I think it just somehow didn't connect at all even though i definitely had internet connection and the news and stuff and friends list and stuff loaded fine.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"See The Devil","date":"2016-06-14T18:50:47.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have this too","replies":[]}]}
