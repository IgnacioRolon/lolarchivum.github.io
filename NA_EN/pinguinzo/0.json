Overbuffed his weaknesses too much to compensate for his weak state in comparison with the other junglers made him have no more weaknesses at all. He literally needs maximal 2 kills to be set up for the rest of the game and since he just needs early and mid game kills to win games and League gets shorter and shorter games where the fastest stump wins, Kha Zix is yet again a &quot;Ban or lose&quot; pick. Well dont Riot balance team\n\nEDIT: Yes. Wards. Wards sure help getting E`d and taken down faster than u can press flash .","replies":[{"poster":"Apocalypsic","date":"2016-04-12T21:19:11.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The key to winning against kha is grouping early.

He avoids fights and just ganks non stop to nuke down 3/4 of the lane health. Even if u manage to survive u are still going to lose 90% of your health cause of the mixed damage he does since literally every single spell of his except his ulti deal damage.
