SO why is it giving me an error message and refuses to let me play and basically letting the other 4 players down!?\r\n\r\nSorry for the caps lock and probably rude attitude, but seriously, what is it now!? I have already tried to youtube to fix this problem! To which obviously their solutions did not work- or I wouldn't be here.\r\n\r\nAnyone else with this issue? please up vote, I don't understand why this is happening to me","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-24T05:31:58.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"DirectX errors with League will happen if your PC is missing DirectX 9 packages that League needs in order to run properly or if the packages in your directory are corrupt.
