What I'm wondering is first off how do you get the border, I assume I need to buy Star Guardian Ezreal - First Star Edition? Also is this like Elementalist Lux where if you buy it now you get to keep the border forever, or is the border only during the event for I assume the mastery emote?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-09T21:38:21.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The border is tied to the summoner icon included in the bundle.  Once the bundle is no longer available, neither will the icon.  Without the icon, the border won't be available.  The border will be permanent once obtained.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Fuhrer Swain","date":"2017-09-09T21:53:40.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the icon is what produces the border, and must be equipped in order to see it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-09T22:00:22.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope!  As long as you have the icon unlocked you'll have the border, you won't need to have it equipped.","replies":[{"poster":"Fuhrer Swain","date":"2017-09-09T22:16:35.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome thanks!
