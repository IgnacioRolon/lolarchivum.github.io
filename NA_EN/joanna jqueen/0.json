You can \"afford\" it easily.\nB) The chimes spawn near you, but on pre determined spots. This mean that if the closer spots are occupied, they fill bounce on harder to reach location. Eventually lost in the enemy jungle. This is a huge reason to collect your chimes often.\nC) The huge game changing power spike for bard are at 5 (slow) 25 (AOE) and 65 (bigger AOE). IMHO, bard is under par and already losing his lane by default before the 5th chime.\nD) Bard just can't stay in lane with his mana issues.

Lower cooldown on Magical Journey becomes very good in the midgame and outside of lane you mostly use your shrines as a movespeed boost.

You mostly want to use it to catch out enemy champions or freeze turrets to tower dive early on.

Best times are on your way back to lane, when one or both enemy laner(s) go back to base, and while placing wards.  The most important thing to learn on Bard is how to minimize your time needed to collect your chimes.  Make use of your E as much as possible to make your trips shorter.  Plan your path as you walk to the first chime.  Once you get really good at it, it becomes entirely possible to start getting experience leads on the enemy laners just through efficient trips.\n\nMostly importantly though, like most have said, just have fun man.

Use its instant cast for a clutch heal and MS boost, good for running away or saving people.\n\nE is mobility. use it to run away and stun anyone who follows through it, use it for chasing or unusual gank patterns. very flexible spell, but it can put you in serious trouble if an enemy slips past at a bad time\n\nR is probably the hardest part of his kit for people to grasp because there's unlimited ways you can use it. it's not amazing for engage unless you  NEED the stasis to set up a wombo, but it's great at giving everyone time to reposition, which lets you make saves, set up a stun for kills, chase down runaways. It's great for force-resetting the big objectives like Dragon and Baron, since they'll recover HP while frozen. If enemies are trying to take it earlier on, this can be what forces them to back or if your team is close enough, lets you collapse on them. if you use it to defend a tower, don't ult the tower (most of the time) ult the minion wave so that it aggros the champion, or ult the champion so that you can jump on him (the former is more likely, since minions are predictable). ulting only the tower won't really do anything; it keeps it up a few seconds longer, but the minion wave is still there and the enemy will probably stick around and take it anyway.\n\nmax Q always, W and E is mostly situational. I like to max W because I build more AP on him than others, but maxing E second gives you a better MS boost for allies and a lower cooldown, where W just improves the base heal iirc.\n\nplay him like an asshole; don't ever commit too hard to fights unless you're setting up a collapse, just skirt around and throw out Qs and meeps and fish for stuns.

Bard has monstrous synergy with AP items like {{item:3285}} and {{item:3100}}, and {{item:3157}} is great in conjunction with your ultimate to annoy people who are chasing you. Really, all you need is a Lich Bane and some magic penetration (Sorcery Shoes) and you can pretty handily nuke squishy targets.\n\nget chimes whenever it's safe; leaving your ADC, while sometimes tempting depending on their personality, is not generally a good idea unless they're a safe ADC like Caitlyn or Ezreal, someone who can disengage or self-peel while you come back. I wouldn't extend too far past river if you're in lane unless your carry is backing, is returning to lane, or you're going to make your journey more worth their 2v1 with a gank or at least warding further up river. If you absolutely need to refill on mana, it's always a good idea to ping or type it out in chat before you leave, so that they know to play it safe for a few seconds. you should aim to get multiple chimes if you leave for them; it speeds up your return and it lets you keep going, but if you can only get one or two I wouldn't go for it.\n\nGo 18 into cunning always and take Thunderlord's for the additional burst.
