The punishments for leaving are low priority queues which gives you a 5-20 minute timer before you can enter the queue to find a game. After continuing to leave games you will eventually be banned.\n\nI guarantee you when he has to wait 20 minutes before he can start to look for a game he will either shape up or quit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2016-11-03T06:50:28.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I know people who leave/troll/intentionally feed do not follow the normal tiers of punishment. Since chat restriction isn't really a punishment for them they go straight to a 14 day ban, I'm sure for rank though it's a much more serious punishment and if leavin intentionally would result in a permaban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"haha retard","date":"2016-11-03T05:44:01.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\nSecond Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\nThird Offense: Two Week Suspension\nFourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\"\n\nThey word is as \"PUNISHMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW A BASIC ESCALATION PATH:\" so they can fuck you over hardcore, and permanently ban you first offence if they wanted to.
