I mained support and always felt like i done pretty well in majority of games, however could never climb.\r\n\r\nSo i thought ok ill take matters into my own hands, recently in the last few days i picked up the ADC role. Rough to begin with first few games i didn't win, now however ill for instance win 4-5 games then lose one, then win 4-5 again and lose again (not 100% accurate of winrate but i hope you get my understanding) \r\n\r\nI play Jhin and Varus as ADC, some games i will carry, some games i will not carry in the slightest, for instance say i go 2-4-22 and we still win by a complete country mile. \r\n\r\ni land ult after ult on Varus (not hard i know) but whats the deal? is it just luck that the ADC is not carrying however the team still win?. Could i be  supplementing the team in another way?. Completely unsure if this winning streak is pure luck or not. \r\n\r\nHoping a high elo player can shine some light on this. \r\n\r\nThanks all","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-15T01:23:26.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like it a lot of the times, but the ADC definitely won't always make or break a game. The best plays happen when both teams are evenly matched so you can have those long drawn out trades between teams. All of those pokes makes for building tension until someone gets caught out and the teamfight starts. I'd try to focus more on the overall gameplay instead of whether or not someone can carry you to winning.\n\nIf you're looking for advice from the general public you would probably get way more responses if you repost this over in Gameplay fyi! Didn't want to delete for \"incorrect board\" if you were actually wanting our advice ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Pineapple Puddin","date":"2018-01-15T01:36:11.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh i see sorry lol wasn't too sure what board to post it on.
