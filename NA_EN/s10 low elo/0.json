Coached a Challenger Series team &quot;Team Wicked&quot; which got DQ for three of our players having PRs and not VISA&#039;s.\r\n3. Coached individual play for many D3+ players for NA and LAN\r\n\r\nWhat I would be focusing on for this team;\r\nI generally would like to find a solid 7 man team with &quot;5 starters and 2 subs&quot; for competitions and helping you progress \r\ntowards Diamond/Master, I am a stategic coach, so I work with macro / micro play more than anything.. I don&#039;t care enough to look at\r\n&quot;Who warded the most&quot;.. I am completely honest with my feedback on each game, and I expect players to be competitive and work with me throughout\r\nthis summer to become the best you can with your abilities. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve coached Plat players/teams before and ended with 2 of them high diamond and others mid diamond.
