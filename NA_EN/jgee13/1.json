After the game though it showed up in my chat logs on the friend's list and that's when I realized it was fake. Not a nice thing to do to others, I was wondering what I did that would lead to a 2 week suspension for the rest of the game I was in when I got the message. Thought it was especially strange because I just got Honor 3 before I entered the match and then 3 minutes in I got a message saying I was suspended lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
