With ignite i just try to pull their  jungler to camp me, and that usually gives free drags automatically (barring feeding bots/mids).\r\n\r\nNow i usually wait for a favorable time to get herald (mid and jungle are unoccupied), but i feel like i don&#039;t prioritize herald early enough. \r\n\r\nQ1. What is the average time that you and jungler can get herald level and item wise as a ballpark?\r\n\r\nQ2. Splitpushing is confusing if i&#039;m running ignite. I usually ask my team to group mid or bot and push as 4, and if i see 2 or more come to counter my split we get some free towers where they are, but they rarely listen. How do i know when to group and when to split? I read somewhere if i&#039;m carrying score wise i shouldn&#039;t split because our teamfight is possibly stronger; but if i&#039;m way positive and my team is going even, or slightly feeding wouldn&#039;t it make sense to split since the enemy needs 2 to stop my push?\r\n\r\nQ3. sieging with baron or splitting with baron? Probably too situational?","replies":[{"poster":"Bruised Ego","date":"2016-11-01T00:10:05.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Split pushing is good, but from my experience in lower elo, your team won't know how to play around a split pusher. \n\nThey might just fight 4v5 in the mid lane before you even have pressure.\n\nIn higher elo though, people will play around your split push. I.E. You pressure top side so that your team can comfortably take an objective on the other side of the map like dragon.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-11-01T00:18:56.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also in lower elos people dont know how to counter a split push either","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-11-01T00:09:59.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:114}} isnt great in team fights... you best trying to single out and fight 1 vs 1 being a duelist \n\nif that means split pushing to make someone come deal with you ( if you are fed ) then so be it...\n\nand take {{summoner:12}} if split pushing so you can join team or tp to other lanes if they come to focus you ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2016-10-31T23:35:50.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q1: Really depends although Herald is good on Fiora it's definitely not a priority than let's say dragon. Usually herald can be done starting at 15 minutes you just need to be willing to trade off tanking it.\n\nQ2: You're playing Fiora whose one of the best duelist (hence her title) and one of the best split pushers. You should constantly be split pushing with her. There's also very few instances where you should be running ignite with a Fiora.\n\nQ3: Very situational question. Depends on your comp and the enemy's. Usually with Fiora split pushing is still preferable when you can do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Carbon","date":"2016-10-31T23:35:18.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your vote made me laugh, kudos lol.\n\nFrom a High Plat prospective... I'm not faker...\n\nSplit pushing as Fiora or any other AD bruiser can be highly rewarding if done properly, but doing it in solo queue is always a risky endeavor because communicating with your team never goes well. (So there's that)\n\nHowever, if you want to split push in diamond or under, communicate your intentions... then mute everybody... because they will flame you if they start losing.\n\nYou will need teleport to do it properly, the entire Idea of split pushing is to draw pressure, but if your team doesn't have the ability to win a 4v4 or if you don't rotate properly you are left with a dead, flaming team while you push one tower in exchange for 3 of your own and a slain baron.\n\nIf you get a lead in your lane early, look to roam into other lanes and try to snowball your team members before resorting to a split push tactic.\n\nWarding is possibly the most important part of split pushing, if you die while you are splitting. You lose the most important threat of the split, the pressure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2016-10-31T23:30:20.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A1: Unless your jungler has massive sustain, they probably won't get you Herald any time.\n\nA2: Don't place heavy reliance on your team to do anything for you. Choose spells, runes, and masteries accordingly. You know who your enemies are before game start. If the enemy has a chance to catch up and you are ahead, use your lead to shut down any threats to your chances of winning even if it means abandoning lane to join in a fight.\n\nA3: Allies force fights far too often with baron and lose the buff. Make your own judgment on how to use it so long as it is not wasted.","replies":[]}]}
