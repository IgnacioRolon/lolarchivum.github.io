So that's out of the question\n\nI've played the game both on my SSD and SSHD. The only difference is that on the SSD the lag only lasts about 4 seconds, whereas on my SSHD the lag lasts over 10 seconds.\n\nEvery single time champ select finishes and the LeagueofLegends.exe program boots up, my CPU completely caps out. Discord lags out, Youtube videos in the background lag out, all audio in general (including my own outgoing) is narrowed down into almost Dial-up speed from today's standards quite literally. Not to mention, I can't even control my cursor properly because my actual desktop has less than 1FPS.\n\nI have tried reinstalling the game multiple times and scowering forum posts to help fix this issue, but there seems to be nothing to help me. This has been an ongoing issue for months and I've been putting it off for a while, since it wasn't really a big deal. But after a while it's gotten to me, and I'd like to hear from your guys' experiences.\n\nI genuinely have no clue what's going on. The only other game that did something like this was DOOM 2016 on release, and Bethesda corrected that issue a few weeks after launch. Nothing is wrong with my PC's hardware, it's definitely some conflicting settings, or just something horribly wrong with the actual game.\n\nMy specs are as listed below:\n\nComputer\nCPU: Intel 4790K\nMotherboard: MSI Z97 Gaming 5\nRAM: 32GB Corsair Vengeance Pro 1600MHz\nGPU: MSI R9 390X 8GB Stock Speed\nCase: Corsair 760T Red/Black\nStorage: Seagate 2TB SSHD, HyperX Fury 240GB\nPSU: Corsair AX860i\nMonitors: 3 x Dell U2414H\nMonitor Stand: Ergotech 100-D16-B03\nCooling: Corsair H110i GTX\nOperating System: Windows 10\n\nThe most notable thing is that I'm running a triple monitor setup.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-19T22:31:56.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yikes it really sounds like your pc is having a really hard time running League for some weird reason.

Those steps cover a lot of the basics and can help most random issues, and if those don't help hit up our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They can look over your game logs and specs to get a bigger picture of what's happening during that lag.","replies":[{"poster":"Pizza on a Bun","date":"2017-12-20T06:19:03.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I did everything on that guide that I could.\n\nThe very _first_ bootup of a game lagged out extremely bad.\n\nThen after i closed out, and booted up another game, and even different game modes. They all loaded up with zero spikes or any previous problems I mentioned before. Which puts me at square one. Since the problem happened once, and now I can't re-create it :\\\n\nIt's probably too small of an issue to actually bring up to the team. It might just have something to do with my setup and how windows is storing/retrieving recent files. I can't re-create it on my spare PC either, so it's just this system specifically from the looks of it.\n\nThanks for your time and the reply.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-20T21:28:16.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm it could be related to those drives possibly and how they're transmitting data?
