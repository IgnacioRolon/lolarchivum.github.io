Also, for me tank ekko is manageable, yes he is sticky yes he deals respectable damage early game but half of his dmg is telegraphed as all hell. He also falls of quite hard in the damage department come mid-late game. This whole thing is a huge circlejerk created by the placebo buffs he got.","replies":[{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2016-04-19T19:27:29.672+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Tank ekko circlejerk\n\nTank Ekko isn't complained about because of some buffs.\nTank Ekko is complained about because he's an Ekko that's extremely tanky.\n\nI feel you're tunneling on this buff argument a little to hard to make your point.","replies":[{"poster":"Hi Im Ur Kitty","date":"2016-04-19T19:32:49.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am sorry if i come off that way. I am tunneling about the buff argument because a lot of people complain about them being the cause when we all know that grasp + hp items makes his stickyness pay off if he builds tanky. As i said tank ekko is still ekko, his ult is extremely predictable as well as his w. The problem comes when ekko is being played as a tank rather than an ap assassin, this just goes to prove how riot fucked up his design.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WinBoat","date":"2016-04-19T20:29:17.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree sorta. I've always went tank on Ekko, way before the buffs, ever since I started jungling with him.\n\nAlso, tank Ekko won't ever die, they increasing his AP ratiots which means, he can build hybrid items like {{item:3001}} {{item:3157}}  {{item:3027}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3025}} and be tanky Enough to do what he has to do. This is my general build anyways, the compensation is going to amplify this build.\n\nAlso, another reason why you'll still build tank is because they only nerfing the base damages for Ekko, they are not taking away any armor, and MR. Basically, he will still be tanky as fuck if he wants to go full tank, his utility he brings is top notch, especially if you aren't lcs, so you can look forward to getting some stuns off, and trust me.... He will still do good damage against  a squishy and that's the main thing. \n\nSo tank Ekko isn't dead after the nerfs. He will probably build more hybrid and we can look forward to cry babies bitching about AP Ekko in mid lane....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hi Im Ur Kitty","date":"2016-04-19T19:50:27.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"guess some people just downvote and go on :/ i spesifically said that it was a discussion and in no way am i being toxic :/{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2016-04-19T20:01:39.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People downvotes, and discussed.\n\nYou had three downvotes when I posted here, and three people who gave their opinion.\n\nStop whining.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shac Norris","date":"2016-04-19T19:51:14.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's too hard to kill for the utility and damage he provides to his team.","replies":[{"poster":"Hi Im Ur Kitty","date":"2016-04-19T19:58:19.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wouldnt call a situational stun too much utility tho haha and as for the iceborn slow every single bruiser/tank can get one, but i get your point he is deceptively sticky","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dr W","date":"2016-04-19T19:18:56.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its more of the current itemization he has available, not so much Ekko himself. Tank items being incredibly good right now, it's a no brainer for ekko to play as a bruiser as it lets him get he most out of his kit. With that said, AD carrys and other squishy targets are essentially useless in teamfights when he dashes onto them his Iceborn/movesped buff/tankines thanks to his build. Focusing him is extremely problematic when he can just ult with his massive resistances. Not defending Ekko, just don't think the champion himself is really to blame here.\n\nEDIT: I just saw the patch notes for Ekko and I think Riot got it right for once. He needs incentive to build AP and thats what they did.","replies":[{"poster":"Hi Im Ur Kitty","date":"2016-04-19T19:29:37.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i too think the patch goes in the right direction. I know that ekko is strong because of the tank itemization(mainly grasp). Its just that i keep seeing countless threads and posts about people saying stuff like riot overbuffed him and that they shouldnt have buffed his base values when nothing of the sort actually happened. I do, however agree that tank ekko is obnoxious, as i said he is extremely sticky but come late game he wont be dealing much damage so even if he goes on the adc the support/tank could just peel him off and focus more important targets since tank ekko on his own would take quite some time to actually kill someone.","replies":[]}]}]}
