Currently, every time you get a key fragment drop, there's a chance that it will be upgraded to a capsule. For extremely high engagers (if you don’t sleep and only play ^^ ) there's a chance to earn up to 4 keys (12 fragments) in a 4 week period. Even then, you could end up with a short dry spell at the end of the month.","replies":[]}]}
