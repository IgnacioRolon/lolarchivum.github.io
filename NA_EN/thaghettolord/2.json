Those [**Honor Capsules**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/honor) have a *chance* of dropping anytime you would get a key fragment once you're Honor Rank 3. They aren't guaranteed drops, but you should be on the lookout for them after matches and when you log in to the client.","replies":[{"poster":"ThaGhettoLord","date":"2017-08-07T13:16:58.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okey thank you for the info, much appriciated.","replies":[]}]}]}
