The theory behind this is that while doing commentary I am forced to analyze my own mistakes which allows myself any others to learn from them. \r\n\r\nFeel free to stop by whether you're bronze or even challenger, as always I appreciate any tips and will answer questions to the best of my ability. If you'd like to see a particular champion played I will do so if possible, just let me know via chat. \r\n\r\nOther info can be found at my twitch, follow for automatic updates as I don't always post on the forums prior to streaming.","replies":[]}
