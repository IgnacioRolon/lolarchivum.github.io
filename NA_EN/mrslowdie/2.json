It just seemed a little condescending to me. \n\nYes. if I've got decent mana regen, you best believe I'm spamming heal during teamfights. They said that W is supposed to be for \"clutch heals\", but if you hold onto W during team-fights like it's Sorakas ult, you'll probably lose a couple of teammates in the process. \n\nThe thing is, for \"clutch saves\" W needs to be pretty strong, pretty long cd, and high mana cost. But it's not. It's just low healing values, high mana cost, and medium cd. \n\nSo the values are only useful over drawn out fights, yet the mana cost and cd are still indicative of a strong clutch ability. \n\nSo fine, W was nerfed. But that's okay, because at least she still has her poke right? Except now we see incoming nerfs to her Q and Q's powerchord damage. Just imagine how this is going to effect Sona's laning.\n\nAt best, she's going to have average poke, outclassed sustain, 0 hard cc outside of her ult, mana problems, and be one of the squishiest champs in the game. \n\n**I feel like people are letting Sona's aram winrate effect their perception of her strength as a support on Summoners rift.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2014-12-21T09:21:46.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Have you actually played Sona outside of an ARAM?","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-12-21T10:39:14.335+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thats the entire point.
