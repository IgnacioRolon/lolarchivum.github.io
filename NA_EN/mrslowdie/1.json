Because increasing the number of bans have been talked lately\r\n2. P/B phase in competitive plays is boring!! how many times I said \"oh it's ali again, zil again, thresh again, lee again, lucian again\" when watching s4 world?\r\n3. it will reduce the blame thing in Ban phase. Well \"gg not ban cait when pick graves\" or alike will be inevitable, but at least it's better than \"gg not ban [insert FotM champ here]\"\r\n4. diversity !!\r\n5. Why the hell the ban given to the captain? If I want to learn how to trust my team captain, I'll play doto instead, my captain can even pick me a hero.\r\n6. The P/B phase will be more interactive\r\n7.

Riot's stated reason for not increasing the number of bans is that it would be too easy to ban out a particular summoner's mains.  By alternating picks and bans, you can't be sure of banning someone out entirely because they get a chance to pick before all of the bans come through.  It also gives the ability to ban reactively based on the enemy teamcomp so far instead of just \"ban Lee Sin he's OP and they pick first.\"","replies":[]}]}
