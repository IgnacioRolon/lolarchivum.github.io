You also state that you are giving up to the enemy team. Additionally, you call for reports against Fizz. Calling for reports can be considered harassment at times, especially if Fizz didn't say %%%%, so please be careful with calling for reports. This overall doesn't seem too toxic towards Fizz or Vayne and might not be punishable. This leads me to believe that 1) there are logs missing from your in-game report card or 2) you have edited chat from this game.\n\nRegardless, you should submit a player support [ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you feel your ban is unjust.\n\n----------------------------------------------\nAs a reminder, the MSI icon is on sale for 1 IP!

As for the surrender we were losing really bad and the enemy team wasn't winning on purpose so they could keep killing us, as you can imagine that isn't much fun and I didn't want to abandon the game. we tried to vote to surrender twice and both times lost 3/2 until I finally asked them if they'd stop spawn killing and just end the game so we could find a new lobby instead of just dying over and over. besides that I did nothing wrong and it's kind of BS that I get banned for 2 weeks for no reason. \n\nThanks though for the help!! just thought I'd elaborate more on what happened and why I said those things.","replies":[{"poster":"Hillside Vibes","date":"2017-04-27T03:31:32.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also that isn't the whole chat log, it's the chat log Riot gave me when they sent me my ban notice. the rest of the chat is literally just callouts or me talking to vayne.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-04-26T14:12:09.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"certainly a bad idea to repeat those slurs.\n\nIt's not like you need to rally for reports, 1 report is good enough to flag the system to check for toxicity, anymore is just redundant.\n\nBesides, asking for reports can sometimes become a harassment tool and thus will end up getting you punished over lots of games.\n\neitherway, hit up riot's support and see if they can help you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jarfy","date":"2019-02-07T10:09:30.326+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I lost all my honour for this chat log, would appreciate different views on how i handled the troll kayle jg / abusive alister.
