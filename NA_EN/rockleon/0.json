I got reported for going top lane, got reported cause i stayed top lane when they specifically said to stay top lane, and ended up feeding the enemy cause  of them. If someone can answer these questions that'd be great,cause for the guys that reported me are in for a rude awakening. i did what i could,didn't get no points all day. I even got kicked out of all my groups cause of that,and got no loot. Only achievements finished.{{champion:17}} {{summoner:7}} {{item:2033}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T02:57:36.886+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some of our players have developed *quite* the hatred for our lovable little yordle. Some people might auto report you just because they saw the little devil, but being reported simply for playing our favorite scout won't get you in trouble.","replies":[{"poster":"Rockleon","date":"2017-09-29T22:52:56.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you! i swear,someone keeps on trying to be so toxic. It's like they want to make someone's day bad when you play the little yordle,and gank people cause i can't get riot points for new champs.","replies":[]}]}]}
