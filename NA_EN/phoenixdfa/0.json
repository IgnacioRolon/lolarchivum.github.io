Want to be clear that this isn't a salt thread, but a serious question/report on the functionality of Leaverbuster, because I've seen this happen a few times over the past month. This time, I just decided to bring more attention to it than an AFK report.\r\n\r\nThe Lee Sin in my last game was AFK from **over 10 total disconnects for AT LEAST 20 total minutes of this 44 minute game**, but his name was not written in red text at the end of the game - I have no pictures of this because of rules against naming and shaming, but I assure you, it happened.\r\n\r\nLee claimed lag issues throughout the entire game and would **consistently** DC for 2-3 minutes, come back for 45 seconds, do something, and then DC again for 2-3 minutes. This pattern started at the very beginning of the game, and again I assure you, I am not exaggerating.  It started at 3mins and didn't stop the rest of the game. Again, no screenshots because of naming and shaming rules, but perhaps Riot can find the game I speak of (and I'm honestly not mad at this guy, but just worried about a potential troll-able bug in Leaverbuster).\r\n\r\nThis wasn't simply a bad Lee Sin. In fact, for the 45-second windows that he was around, he didn't seem bad at all. The issue was that he sat in fountain for more than 20 minutes total, so he did 33% less damage than me on Thresh (10k damage against my 15k) and had only 107cs in a 44min game. Somehow, he didn't get red text in the post-game lobby, so people insisted they would not report him.\r\n\r\nGiven the consistent pattern of his disconnects, this looked like a well-hidden trolling scheme.\r\n\r\nMy question is essentially this - does Leaverbuster only report direct, intentional \"exit game\" rage quits? Does it ignore internet connection-related DCs? If so, why? This Lee was inconsiderate or incompetent enough to not fix any sort of connection issue he had for 44 minutes, so he should get some sort of warning or penalty - at least a red-text name at the end game. Or perhaps am I misinformed about what creates a red-text name in the post-game lobby?\r\n\r\nI don't want this guy to be permabanned immediately or anything ridiculous like that, but I do think strikes should be added onto his account every time this happens. In fact, I thought Leaverbuster already did that, and used red text names post-game to identify when it was working. Playing league with a toaster powered by a potato battery is simply inconsiderate to teammates, and arguably inconsiderate to the other team due to the lack of competitiveness of this match, even in a normal game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-11T21:04:31.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Constantly reconnecting won't grant immunity from leaverbuster.  They're still gone for a period of time when the game is down a player, and causes others a negative experience.  The system also treats everyone equally regardless of it being intentional or not, because all leaves cause negative experiences.  There's no way to bug or try to trick the system, and players who constantly leave intentionally may have their account banned instead of a lower priority queue.  i hope that helps give some relief!","replies":[{"poster":"PhoenixDFA","date":"2016-08-11T21:48:52.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So to be clear, leaverbuster is still working, even if their name has no red text identification in post game? That's an entirely separate system?\n\nIf so, that's a bit strange, but I really appreciate the clarification.","replies":[]}]}]}
