Or logins screen and pre-release stuff that...are basically just backstory that could get equally by reading their backstory? And Jinx's music video is not lore, it's 3 minutes of 'JINX IS CRAZY!' And I liked the music video, it was really cool, but it's not lore. Nothing happened in the video. It didn't even detail anything about Jinx that you wouldn't know by playing her or reading her quotes. \n\nI get that nothing is going to happen of this, and that is the exact same answer that we've been getting for years now, but please have SOMETHING happen. Like, I get that you can't really have Yi kill Singed because Singed still needs to be playable, but nothing is happening to Runeterra. The only story we get outside of champion releases are retcons and the occasional event. Just have your characters interact; in game probably isn't a good place to have this, but can't you have monthly comic strips or stories just having the champions sit around and talk about things? I'd love that. Like maybe you can say 'oh well no one reads those' but I do! I love that sort of shit! \n\nI think my main complaint is that every time we complain about the lack of lore we get A) 'oh but we have tons of lore, like Jinx's music video!' which I don't count as lore, just extensions of a champion release or B) 'we're setting up for future lore releases, so stay tuned!' and then they never come. Like, apparently Trundle's old story was finished so you had to change him so you can do stories with him? Okay, where are they? It's been how long now?\n\nI don't really expect anything to change, but seriously now, you keep adding hints and changes that never amount of anything. Like, apperantly Cass has a relationship to the Shurima Desert somehow? And you retconned Anivia being from another place, so presumably Nasus and Renekton are from Shurima now. And so is Sivir. So...where's the story in all that? Why does Sivir have a rivalry with Cass? What are Nasus' and Renekton's current status? Is this ever going to get resolved? And if it's 'later', when is later?

It would have been a dynamically altering map based on turrets & inhibs going down, and as such happens aspects of the void/\"ancient divine\" Shurima push out in each lane.   Full endgame where a large chunk of the structures have been KOed it would be heavily corrupted for each side.  Imagine when you took out the mid lane tower on the \"old\" side the nearby large rock would fall into a tear in the world into the void, ect.\n\nDuring the event, the map would automatically replace the \"vanilla\" SR map, and after the event it would be a map skin you can use.  Furthermore, based on the entire event (which team won more often) certain skins would be released like Void Xerath if the Void won, or Ascendant Nasus if Shurima won, for example.  You could even do lore growths of characters like Sivir (based on whichever side she won most on she would have her lore updated to reflect, as well as a skin related to the side) where \"her\" choice on what side she backed (Did she do it for the money and/or power for the Void?

Imo the things you listed are neat but not deep lore items, the Freljord event was ok but how much lore did we really learn?

It's actually something that I've been wondering for a bit... I've only been playing this game since late season three, and all I ever knew was the PvP in it with slight backstories to the characters and the JoJ which disappeared before I could finish reading it. However, I recently stumbled upon a few threads of the past while looking into things like the shopkeeper in ARAM and I'm astonished to see just how much lore and work was put into the game. The evolution vs the resistance seemed so fun and skins even had much more meaning-- once I learned that and saw how involved the community used to be I was completely taken aback. I thought this game was basically pvp and story was a sideshow. \nBut as I read more about rivals and character interactions... I just got sad. I feel like I missed out on something truly amazing; like it all just disappeared. I really hope I get the opportunity to see progress in the story behind the League of Legends and get to choose a side like i did with the Frejlord event. I noticed some champion lore doesn't even mention why the champion even joined the league(ie: Jinx)so I hope it isn't really fading away. If it is, I'm seriously disappointed in myself for not giving this game a chance sooner.I know you guys are really busy and have alot to handle, but with the deletion of the JoJ I'm just wondering... is the lore from LoL really fading away? Or do you have your own plans to bring it back? Is there going to be an attempt to bring it back in a way newer players can understand?\nI think alot of people would be lured to your game if they knew the story behind it, and I think that the reason alot of older players left is because the lore did.

When it came out, I thought \"so, these 3 are going to be stuck fighting forever?\"\n\nI've been playing this game since early Season 2 and I've read every single champion bio and those who had their own Judgements. Nowadays, I feel like we've been severely lacking in the lore department. Look at the bios of the champs since pre-season 3. We, the Summoners, the ones who are also part of the world, have been dropped. There's no more mention of the League of Legends, no more mention of the Institute of War, and no mention of us. The reworked champs (Sejuani is the first to come to mind) had their lines rewritten not to mention the Summoners. So...the champs don't interact with us anymore? I loved that the players were made part of the lore, that made the game all the more immersive.\n\nAnother thing I'd like to point out is that a lot of the champs are not given a reason to join the League. It had always intrigued me as to why a champ would land himself in the League. Why is Syndra in the League? Did the Summoners capture her and coerce her to participate to prevent her from screwing up Ionia? Why is Jinx in the League? Did they catch her too or did she join because she felt like it? \n\nI would like to see what's going on in Runeterra. How is Swain ruling Noxus? Is Demacia going to kick their asses soon? Does Morgana still have her bakery? Will any of the Three Sisters win and finally rule Freljord? Will Diana and Leona work out their differences? I want to see charcter development and not just stop with champs interacting with one another? Because seriously, are they going to keep doing that forever?   \n\nCome on, Riot, you gave us the Ionia vs. Noxus match. You've proven that you can write and give us the most interesting lore so why, why, why are you stifling yourselves? What's wrong with reading news about Runeterra? What's wrong with doing what you're doing now but giving us something to read on the side? We are still part of this world that you've created, right? Unless you've retconned us, the Summoners, out of Runeterra. Doesn't it make sense that we Summoners get daily updates on the goings-on in the city states? What is happening to Runeterra right now? It's been a stand-still for 2 years except for the events that have not been resolved. \n\nI believe you can still wow us with excellent lore, Riot. Let us in the lives of the Champions again, let us live in Runeterra again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lillyannth","date":"2014-05-09T00:51:57.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hears a lore a reason y lores r importen to game play: VI, jinx, and cait have a passive called \"catch me if u can\" Jinx gets bonse gold if she kills or assits on cait or vi and vi and cait the same for jinx","replies":[]},{"poster":"herduleikmudkipz","date":"2014-05-08T23:51:06.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**{{champion:119}} **","replies":[]},{"poster":"kokopelli2","date":"2014-05-07T15:13:14.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"12 people are stupid","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurePer4mance","date":"2014-05-07T04:54:24.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to corrrect (intentional mispelling) the person who wrote that the writers for the lore behind the characters and fantasy  world were well written.
