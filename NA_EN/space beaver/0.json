So I was loading up to a ranked match and I had gotten bugsplat in loading screen and couldn't reconnect resulting in LP loss. So I closed client hoping to fix it. Nope. So I went to repair files and I've been trying to patch for 3 hours now. I restarted my laptop and it's been stuck at 54% for an hour. The MB and KBps changes, just not the percent. I'm afraid to close and restart my laptop _again_ if I don't know if it'll fix it or not. Please help if you have any ideas, I'm clueless. I've looked at some posts regarding having trouble patching and did stuff like deleting the filearchives folder but it seems to not have helped. Thank you in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-07T00:27:31.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Deleting files typically *won't* resolve patching issues like this. This issue is happening after 32%, which means it's when the patcher is pulling files off of our patching servers. I'd recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), that way you can confirm that your local network settings are 100% compatible with League.\n\nLet me know if you continue to run into this issue after working through those steps.","replies":[]}]}
