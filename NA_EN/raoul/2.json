This is just one of the many obvious dangers of non-meta build that have no solution. Like when AP {{champion:31}}  can ult you for 1K true damage. Best thing that could happen is put a short CD on the item, which just make more issues for more meta AP juggler's which still run OOM really easily in the jungle. To make matters worst {{item:3285}} is still a item that very much exist which has the same affect. To remedy this issue all AP scaling Mages would need to have a second look at which is a nightmare. Point is balancing Meta and non-meta builds is a nightmare.","replies":[]}]}
