I am more curious **(genuinely)** about the specific trade-offs that Yasuo \"pays\" for being manaless, therefore justifying him lacking a mana bar.","replies":[{"poster":"WhatAGeinius","date":"2017-10-03T04:02:57.004+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":36,"body":"I know that hating Yasuo is big meme big boyz but he's genuinely probably the best resourceless design in the entire game. His abilities aren't tied to a resource, but they're all gated in other ways (aside from windwall and it at least has a really long cooldown.)\n\nAnd the big trade-off Yasuo makes is sacrificing control. He can't decide when to use his shield, and it's easy to force him to waste it by just poking him with an autoattack. To use his tornado, he has to land two Qs and he has to use it almost immediately because his Q stacks don't last very long especially since they got nerfed. Furthermore, to stack his Q in lane he has to push the wave. His E gives him a lot of mobility, but only situationally and only ever in the direction of the enemy, and it also forces him to push the wave which he really doesn't want to do because if the enemy's minions are under tower, he has nothing to use his E on. His ultimate has the _huge_ limitation that it can only be used on an airborne enemy, which means that a significant amount of the time he basically just has 3 abilities.\n\nCompare this to someone like Riven who is a really, really shit design for a resourceless character. All of her abilities are on-demand. They have no restrictions other than cooldowns (and her cooldowns barely even matter these days considering that virtually every item in the entire fucking game gives CDR now). She doesn't concede any control to her opponent like Yasuo does and she doesn't have any real windows of opportunity like he does because all she has to care about are her (not very long) cooldowns and her abilites have no conditional power.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2017-10-03T04:22:10.128+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"**I'm asking about the intended trade-offs for him being manaless** and I'd like to keep the conversation in that direction.\n\nHe can activate his ult **with all displacements,** not just knock-ups. Because **he also has a reliable way to knock people up by himself** (E+Q combo), the condition to activate it is not tied to him being manaless in my opinion. Most champions require certain criteria for their ults to be effective (Veigar has to land his combo to kill a target, Olaf needs to be fighting against CC for the ult to be effective, Tahm needs someone to go inside him to get the most value out of his ult, Jhin needs the targets to be low health). Yes, Yasuo's Ult is tied to a condition, but that condition is not a \"cost\" for him being manaless. \n\nThe same goes for the rest of his kit btw, Rakan, Jax, Braum, Xin Zao, Fizz and Vi have conditional mobility but they use mana. Most champions that have AoE on their kits push wave when trading but they use mana. **Tristana pushes wave for CSing even if she doesn't want to and she uses mana**. Therefore pushing wave for trading and CSing is not a manaless scpefiic \"cost\" for being manaless.\n\nLastly, you say his empowered Q --where a chunk of his damage you propose -- comes from is tied to the condition of proking Q twice beforehand. Well Azir needs to use first W to use his abilities, Le Blanc needs to land a spell for the next one to be empowered,** Annie needs to use FOUR spells to get the most value out of them**, Veigar needs to land his E in order to land his W. Therefore, this type of constrain is not a cost that is paid specifically just by manaless champions\n\n**EDIT:** Sorry forgot the shield proking when you don't want it to: Malzahar, Rakan, Sejuani, Galio, Malphite, Anivia and Volibear all use mana","replies":[{"poster":"WhatAGeinius","date":"2017-10-03T04:46:16.639+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":13,"body":"Okay? I never said anything about all of those conditions being specific to Yasuo. It doesn't matter that not every champion that shares one of those conditions is also manaless.\n\nThere doesn't have to be any one specific trade-off that comes exclusively from being manaless. Not requiring mana is just part of a champions power budget. Yasuo has drawbacks for being resourceless. Just because other champions that aren't resourceless have one or more similar drawbacks as a part of their power budget doesn't mean that he isn't still paying for that as a part of his\n\nAlso, just to address the points about Yasuo's kit, I'm aware that his ult activates off of any displacement. That's why I said \"airborne\" (which is what the ability itself calls it) and not \"knock-up.\" You say he has a reliable way to get a knockup by himself, but he doesn't, because he still has to get his Q stacks before he can do his E-Q (and his E-Q actually isn't guaranteed to land, his dash goes a fixed distance that is longer than the radius of E-Q and he also has to wait for his dashing animation, so it is absolutely possible for it to whiff.)\n\nAlso there are other champions that require certain criteria for their ults to be used to their greatest effectiveness, but few that require them to be used _at all_, even sub-optimally.\n\nYou say that this isn't a cost for him being manaless, but as I previously stated, it absolutely is. Just because other champions make the same trade-off for different benefits does not mean that it isn't still a trade-off.\n\nYou go on to point out how other champs share one of his drawbacks, looking at each one in a vacuum instead of seeing how all of Yasuo's drawbacks cumulatively affect him. Yes, other champs have conditional mobility, other champs are forced to push the wave when they don't want to, other champs use stacking mechanics, etc. But the combination of these things on Yasuo (rather than just looking at each one individually and how \"oh X champ also has this one drawback\") forces him to concede a lot of control to his opponent if he wants to be able to use all of his abilities, and it leaves him with meaningful windows of opportunity despite not having to worry about mana attrition.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2017-10-03T05:02:27.766+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"did you really need the wall of text?\n\nGalio, Shen and Kalista need allies to activate their ults and they all use a resources bar.\n\nI'm not debating the E+Q combo as a tool to use ult, it is very reliable. you and I both know it (reliable =/= 100% accuracy)\n\nYou talk about Yasuo having meaningful window of opportunity to be traded with (that being his cost for power budget). as well as him ceding control to his opponent.

You have to be able to get in dashing range of someone to be able to use it and the animation of his dash as well as the very lengthy animation of his spin leaves him pretty vulnerable to getting CC'd by a teammate, which prevents him from ulting (anyone who has played Yasuo for any extended period of time will have had this happen to them _very often_.) And again, you also still have to have gotten your 2 stacks to begin with and they can't have expired, which dramatically reduces it's reliability.\n\n> You talk about Yasuo having meaningful window of opportunity to be traded with (that being his cost for power budget). as well as him ceding control to his opponent.

They just play like they were fighting another mage, expecting to be able to casually harass him at their leisure and fish for a kill combo all day long. People don't exploit any of his downtime because they don't change their playstyle to combat him, and mages don't have the numbers to just flex him to death regardless like many toplaners do.\n\nAlso you'll notice that Yasuo doesn't do very well at higher levels of play. This is precisely because he isn't very reliable and his kit is easy to exploit if you actually understand how to manipulate the wave and pay attention to when he's weak (I.E. no Q stacks, minions near your tower, recently popped shield etc.) which again, the vast majority of people who play the game just don't.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2017-10-03T05:41:47.392+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"I knew you would eventually deviate the conversations away from mana costs.... anyhow:\n\n1.- I understood you perfectly, but still think is a fair point to make regardless.

But I do analyze things further before I make statements, so let me prove that to you by responding to your next statement:\n\n> Garen needs massive buffs if anything\n\nhttps://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/garen\nhttps://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/darius\n\nDarius has a lower win rate than Garen (given, it is slightly lower, but still numerically lower) at all elos at the moment. These stats are for all regions, are current, and from a reliable source. \n\nSo, you saying that Garen needs massive buffs is like saying Darius also needs massive buffs. Which, I doubt you will advocate because Darius has a disgustingly unhealthy presence when he's strong in the meta.\n\nPeople on the Boards may not be complaining about Garen and getting attention, but that does not mean he needs buffs. He already brings twice as much team utility as Darius, nearly as enough damage (if you consider how reliable Garen's kit is), and being much beefier and harder to kill, and technically almost impossible to kill in fights if you don't have a DPS carry (if your ADC locks in Jhin, for example).\n\nBut I won't blame you for not knowing how annoying a Garen can be. If your stats aren't lying to me, you play mostly mid lane and don't really deal with Garen a whole lot, while I main top and have had many matchups involving Garen, most of them winning. But his kit is uninteractive as hell and basically tells you that if you don't have DPS and healing, as well as good survivability, you lose fights against a Garen. And if he loses a trade? Silence and run away deja-vu style, and heal it all back up while he gets immense damage reduction and tenacity if you try to all-in him (That W is the most powerful defensive steroid in the game, by the way, and it's not even on a damn tank). Also, you probably haven't had to deal with difficult Garens often. Especially since in higher elos (unlike down here) people rarely pick Jhin into a beefy team comp, and instead do the smart thing and pick a DPS carry.\n\nGaren may not be an issue for you mid laners in Diamond, but he sure is an issue when your ADC decides to lock in something that can't build BoRK, and thus he's basically unkillable after 2 and a half items.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
