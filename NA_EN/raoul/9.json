What's much, much more important are all the reasons why he should have it taken away. Even as a steadfast proponent of the \"stop the ward hopping, stop the madness,\" movement,  I can think of good reasons why Lee should have this.\n\n1. He's currently balanced around it. You may hate it, but he isn't crazy OP. \n2. It's a great point of mastery for the champion. He has to manage his wards well to be able to use this ability when it counts, and there IS some mechanical skill involved in pulling a good ward hop move off.\n3. Lee Sin's mobility is a hallmark of the champ. He can hop to enemies and allies even without this, so it fits with his current style and vibe.\n\nThere are more arguments, many of which are spin-offs of this one, but you get the idea. It doesn't help to ask questions like this, imo. The ward hop is frustrating to play against, and I think it's worth the cost involved to remove it. That's the most important thing to keep saying.","replies":[{"poster":"NiceTryVi","date":"2017-04-21T17:18:25.497+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":5,"body":"Even is he isn't crazy op, he is definitely too strong right now. He has a 50% winrate, which seems fine, until you realize he has a 41.6% playrate. The main reason people want him nerfed is because of this. He defines the meta, and when he is in nearly half the games, he still pulls an even winrate, somehow. Imagine if a champ that was *actually* mechanically difficult, like Vayne, or as much as I hate to say it, Yasuo, was played that much? They would have winrates in the 30s. Lee has too much damage, has the wardhop as a free reposition, and can build warrior BC and then tank to become a huge meatsheild that can still ruin any squishies day in a blink of the eye lategame. When riot \"nerfed\" him, they should have reduced his ratio from 200% BAD to 150%, and that would have been fine.

It's erroneous to compare to a champ like Yasuo; people have had a MUCH longer time to master Lee Sin, and it's completely POSSIBLE that all those people playing him have a TON of games on him. That's why people try to compare to play rate; it has to do with how much mastery they have on the champion.\n\nIn Lee Sin's case, though, he can have a high playrate without having a bunch of noobs playing him. Don't be deceived by the armchair statisticians; it's more complicated than they would have you believe.\n\nI'm not saying I KNOW they are wrong, but I AM saying they don't have all the info.

Let's compare it to Alistar's Headbutt, an ability with similar functionality.  I am going to ignore the Pulverize-Headbutt combo for now since Lee doesn't have a comparable move involving his ult and it allows us to compare the abilities more effectively in the terms of how it relates to their mobility and CC.  I will also ignore flash tricks for this since those aren't intrinsic to the kits and both have access to them equally.\n\nAlistar can almost only use Headbutt defensively since it doesn't actually close the gap between him and his target.  The exceptions to defensive use are hitting them into a wall or using a flanking maneuver to get around behind the enemy team (I don't count kicking a tank into the enemy team since that is primarily a peel thing).  While Lee Sin could do both of these things without his ward hop, it is substantially harder for him to do so than it is for Alistar.\n\nFor the first case it is about the short term _relative_ mobility, as in the relation of mobility between the aggressor and the victim.  For both Alistar and Lee the only way they could control which side of an opponent they are on is by walking around them.  While Lee is faster than Alistar, Alistar has an AoE hard CC that makes it impossible for the enemy to counter-maneuver.  All Lee has is a decaying slow, which makes him unable to handle other mobile champions and makes it difficult to position around the enemy in a short time frame since they are still moving, albeit slowly.\n\nThe second case is more complicated because the mechanics are a little more messy.  Lee Sin has longer range and a greater reward for pulling this off, but Alistar is more reliable.  Lee has to hit a Q on the correct target and then go in and ult (assuming the enemy wouldn't let him walk up to their back line), but while doing this there is substantially more time to react than when Alistar does it.  As soon as the Q hits the enemy should be aware of what Lee is trying to do, and if they are on top of things, they should then have a decent chance to stop him from doing it.  Even if he pulls off the move, he is sacrificing himself for this and is likely dead almost immediately.  Lee might build tank, but he usually needs a damage item or two to snowball his early game and even tanks can get shredded if they jump into an enemy team by themselves with no hard CC.  Lee won't be able to dash to an ally to get out because the range on that just isn't that high, unless an ally is going in at the same time Lee is pulling his stunt.  Alistar can survive doing this because he is ridiculously tanky and will then continue to contribute to the fight.\n\nYou might think, so what?  What if Lee can't use his ult for offense?  The thing is, Lee is an offensive champion.  His only defensive tools he currently has in his kit are his ult, his W and Cripple.  If you got rid of his offensive uses of his ult he is relegated to sit next to his carries to peel with his ult and provide a shield to them.  He couldn't be an effective offense champion in the late game without the ward hop.\n\nI don't like removing entire play styles from the game and Lee's current pattern of late game play is unique.  While I am not a fan of Lee Sin in any stage of the game, I think that such a change would significantly change him to the point that he is not really the same champion anymore.  As someone who played AD Sion, Mordekaiser and jungle Malzahar, I do not believe that effectively removing a champion/play style is a desirable outcome in all but the most offensive of cases.\n\n**TL;DR/Summary:**   Without his ward hop, Lee Sin's ult becomes very difficult to use as an offensive tool.  This relegates Lee Sin to being a defensive champion later in the game, which changes the identity of the champion to the point of removal of the previous play style.  Removing a play style is generally bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Rouwhorst","date":"2017-04-22T08:46:26.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point, but I'd like to point out that the picture you create of alistar's combo is a bit on the bright side.\n\n> Alistar has an AoE hard CC that makes it impossible for the enemy to counter-maneuver.\n\n> Lee Sin has longer range and a greater reward for pulling this off, but Alistar is more reliable. Lee has to hit a Q on the correct target and then go in and ult (assuming the enemy wouldn't let him walk up to their back line), but while doing this there is substantially more time to react than when Alistar does it.\n\nYou picture it as if his combo is as clean as Lee's, even with more reliability. \nYou make the fair assumption the enemy wouldn't let you walk into the backline, yet that (or burning flash) is the only way Alistar can pull off a similar combo as Lee's. Initially you do point out that Alistar can almost only use headbutt defensively, but it is as if you ignore this later in your post.\n\n> As soon as the Q hits the enemy should be aware of what Lee is trying to do, and if they are on top of things, they should then have a decent chance to stop him from doing it.\n\nAlistar suffers even more so of this problem, because his gapcloser (without flash) is even more telegraphed, which is just walking up to the target.\nAnd even though he is tanky, he generally does not want to face tank for that long to come into range of the enemy backline, which by the way probably moves quicker than he does.\n\nLee sin's ult indeed becomes a lot harder to use offensively, but it will surely still be used offensively in conjunction with Q and flash. \nBut this makes him rely on flash which solidifies flash again, but this was already this case so... yeh\n___\nPutting his combo on a 3-minute cooldown might actually relieve some of people's frustration, because he legitimately burns something major.\nYou picture solely a team fight situation, but I think most of people's problems come from situations where they are in a lane situation and they get ganked. in such situations lee sin can cover quite a large distance with his W, position behind you and kick you into the enemy laner, which of course ends fatal. But again in such situations Lee sin already uses flash so it is actually no too useful to restrict his offensive use of his ult to flash.\n\nMy proposition would be to lower the knock-up duration, so he will not be able to free hit his Q after his ult.\nAnother thing to adjust could be the range on the knock-back, let it scale with something that allows him to do the same late game, but be less oppressive early game, scaling per ultimate level for example.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MorgManBasher","date":"2017-04-21T13:43:34.100+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Personally am fine with it, what I am not fine with is him being so disgustingly overpowered early game with his insta kills while also having insane utility on top of that.\n\nHe really just needs his numbers toned down and given more sustain damage in replace for his 100 to 0 burst so I don't want to shoot myself the first 20-30 minutes of the game.\n\nI feel like ward hopping is a neat mechanic though, personally.

Just because YOU think something is bullshit doesn't mean everyone else thinks it is. Why should I be inclined to listen to you over someone  lose when you give no reasons as to why it is bullshit other then hyperbolic statements and comparisons?\n\n3: I very much do think it's an escape, in almost every case unless your balls deep diving from the back of your lane and waste the two dashes in just minions. And yes Elise's IS an escape , you jump dodge a lot of potential damage from tower and then run, you may get hit by 1 tower shot BUT SO WOULD LEE, except he doesn't have the option to dodge any of them. \n\n\nLet's also not forget that Lees entire kit is balanced around him ward hopping and removing it would effectively force Riot to buff the SHIT out of him in damage and other areas. I would much rather have an interesting ability to make plays then too just get more bullshit damage that are just numbers on screen.","replies":[{"poster":"WinTheWarOnPants","date":"2017-04-22T18:45:18.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is pointless if you're just gonna ignore all the points i make, and argue with a straw man...","replies":[{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2017-04-22T19:57:36.414+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because your points are just biased hyperbolic statements. \n\n\"No its broken\", why is it broken?

I'm of the opinion that it promotes, fun and interesting gameplay, allows for cools plays on Lee Sins part, is fairly manageable by the enemy team, since you can see the where he places the ward and him jumping to it (So its quite telegraphed), it also has an incredibly long CD for an escape ability if you don't use it on champions (Double).\n\nLee Sin's kit is also balanced around ward hopping, which takes a huge chunk of his power budget, (without it , he couldn't do shit late game, as the rest of his abilites fall off besides E). Removing it would require a ton of work on Lee, which doesn't seem really worth the benefit, since the ability doesn't really cause any problems with his kit (People just find it annoying is about it)","replies":[{"poster":"WinTheWarOnPants","date":"2017-04-22T20:02:56.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"at least you're consistent lol I never said anything was broken...\n\n> If you can come up with some valid points and reasoning as to why, its broken, other then \"Cause bullshit\", i'll be inclined to listen.\n\nThis conversation proves otherwise.
