They could easily lose out on their favorite game mode when it shows up on the weekend they have a trip planned, or someone who works a weekend schedule and then misses out on all featured game modes. I would say if even .1% of the games played on a game mode happen during the weekdays, that's still a lot of actual people out there who just didn't have a chance to play the mode otherwise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GhastlyGhoulMan","date":"2016-03-08T20:57:27.265+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Stephiroth,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=PJUEaEmX,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-03-08T18:57:29.285+0000)\n>\n> Hey Raoul!\n> \n> Good questions :)\n> \n> There's a few reasons we have chosen this kind of time frame.

Yes, usage of a game mode may go down as time goes on (although no queue can separate me from my one true love URF), but then why not have it on the whole week, then rotate on weekends? Then you're getting not \"most\" players schedules, but rather practically *all* players schedules.\n\nIf queue activity goes down after 72 hrs, let it go down! There'll be another gamemode to bring it back to \"peak activity\" in just a few short days. \n\nIt just seems that there really is nothing gained from having it on for only the weekends instead of the whole week, except to say you're making a \"data driven\" decision. Please correct me if I'm wrong though.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stephiroth","date":"2016-03-08T21:44:12.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey GhastlyGhoulMan!
