Besides How many evelyns did you see in the last 2-3 years? compare that to the amount of twitch (even before he became a strong meta pick).\n\nTwitch is played more, thus more popular and people will think of him before eve for that reason.\n\nAnother reason like jack said is that it's just thematically more fitting to put a rat in there than a lady.\n\nBesides before Camouflage became a thing both just had invisibility, eve with an added restriction. Now that restriction is called camouflage, so they kinda got it on the same day.","replies":[{"poster":"GenoXx","date":"2017-10-11T18:01:26.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> No, i think of twitch i prefer him over evelyn.
