This thread represents my honest opinion about problems with the game, that hold it back in ways of balancing and overall creative freedom and design choises. \nSo if your opinion is different from mine, you are welcome to tell me, but prepare for a discussion. \n**_\n\n\nAnd these are Crit and Cooldown reduction. \n\nBoth of them are broken in their own way. \n\nCrit as it is in this game should have never existed in the first place. Just like dodge was before, its a really unhealthy stat that offers little to none counterplay and makes the characters that can abuse it (ADCs) damn broken. \nHow RIOT handels it is also very poorly done, since the stat is litterally and extra, you can build a normal full dmg ADC build and still end up with 70-80% crit chance, changing your Autoattach damage to like 500 per hit. And you didnt even sacrifice anything for that. \nCritical strike is badly designed. It should not exist in that form. To Counter tanks we have armor penetration or damage based on HP, which can be supported with more new items so that ADCs are still an effective tank counter, without becoming assassin burst shooters that just twohit anyone whos not a tank. \n\nCooldown reduction is yet another stat that is broken, but in a different way. Again it is a stat that RIOT just throws around like candy, but it has become a bandaid stat to make unwanted items more desireable. On top of that most champions skills are already designed so that the amount of CDR their build will bring them is already calculated. \nFor Supports for example trying to get 45% CDR is not optional, its mandatory, highly limiting the options they have in their build path (ok, and that there are literalls 4 support Items you have to get every game, but that is another story).\n\nBoth of these stats are poor design choises and hurt the game more than they help it. \nBoth of these stats should just go away.","replies":[{"poster":"WrÃ¡thful","date":"2017-09-05T09:19:30.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"wasted too much time with a troll post lol. ppl must think before posting how something must be gone that will disbalance the game riot barely keep some kind of balance and  u want them to rework 70% of the game mechanics cuz 45% cdr lb just beated u in solo q or u lost a 40 min game cuz enemy adc trashed u all in the last teamfight.","replies":[{"poster":"Raoul","date":"2017-09-05T09:23:10.147+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I really silike it when people just assume their own opinion so much better than anyone elses, that they will just discredit any other opinion as trolling. \n\nI mean, what is the point of your post?

Protect the adc comps require supports, Junglers who can help secure objectives and gank, mid laners that control the flow of the game, and tanks that protect and start engages.

Are you talking about Lucian mid? Its not even for the crit is because hes a strong early game duelist and can easily punish control mages with skillshots due to his e. That all sounds great on paper but would it be fair that every adc insta-loses to squishes because they only deal %hp damage. League isnt built around counter picks. Riot once stated that they dont want counter picks like what dota has. Other roles do have a place in the game theyre just not as appreciated. Theres a reason why there isnt 5 adc's a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Raoul","date":"2017-09-05T09:38:46.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I already wrote in the previous answer, the exact one you quoted, ADCs would still be able to fight non tanks. \nHow much HP does a normal mage have? below 2k unless he build extra HP, scarificing raw power. \nNow, how much damage does an ADC deal before we take critical strike into account?
