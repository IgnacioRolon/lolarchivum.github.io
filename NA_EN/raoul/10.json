Wanting people to treat each other decently is toxic? This is news to me.\n\nI don't think it is toxic to beat an opponent, be it 4-man ganks or using OP picks. I think it is toxic to harass them. Relying on OP picks is metasheeping, but that's a separate issue.\n\nDCs I usually don't report unless they've been toxic already and express a desire to leave. I don't report players for feeding unless they run it down mid or specifically announce their intentions to feed.\n\nMostly I report hate speech, harassment, and unsportsmanlike behavior.

Words are the medium of ideas and emotion by which they are transferred from person to person. I don't report minor things, but harassment isn't minor.\n\n> Did a bit of a ad hominem there.

To explain why recall your comment on the taunting system:\n\n>Personally I don't think taunts should exist. Unsportsmanlike behavior detracts from the fun of the game. And I agree it is very tilting for some people. It's not fair to those people to allow others to taunt them or harass them after a mistake with emotes.\n\n\nThis is an ideal of yours that I am strongly opposed to. Taunts have been in games for ever whether it be player made or coded in by developers. You believe that taunts are toxic. I just think it adds a new dynamic to a game in a way. A way to show off. People actually _do_ like taunts as surprising as it may seem. \n\nAn example is Smash. Every character has a taunt when you pull off a sick kill then persons will normally taunt. This is the same for if they are bodying you. No one really finds taunts toxic 'unless relentlessy spammed' but even then they do suck it up to an extent. They don't ban that person. That person just gets punished every time they do taunt at a bad time and taunted back at when _they_ get taunted. There is also the fact that as smash evolved characters got _more_ taunts.\n\nThe reason why I'm defending people who say GGEZ (I mean from punishments. People will have their own opinions about them) is because I can't agree with punishing for this when people can taunt in other ways.\n\nYou can say that it's the intent or meaning behind it that you are opposing but in reality it's the same intent/meaning that is behind many _many_ Ctrl 1/2/3/4/6s. So banning for GGEZ is the same as banning for /dance, /taunt etc in my eyes.\n\nSo I'm guessing we'll just have to agree that we disagree.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-06-20T00:02:29.569+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't matter, whether or not it actually pisses them off.

Since they do it quite often they are getting punished so feel free to flame all you want, we wont miss you if you get banned.\n\nSo if you support insulting the enemy with gg easy after winning I assume you are that trash who dont deserve to play against other humans :)","replies":[{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2017-06-19T07:45:52.211+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrBreaktime,realm=EUNE,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=ecqjE9e3,comment-id=0013,timestamp=2017-06-18T23:40:49.373+0000)\n>\n> The amount of messages I receive from Riot tripled in the past 2 months.

Michelle Carter (the young girl who sent texts to her boyfriend telling him to kill himself when he was severely depressed) was just text messages made up of letters on a screen. Now that's an extreme example, of course, but regardless, words have weight to some people. Regardless of whether it is the truth or not that the game was easy - there is the idea of being decent human being. \"GG easy,\" is rarely said in the simple, honest way in which you describe it as simply telling the truth. It is usually said with venom behind it and is said to put people down. \"GG easy,\" is never something that needs to be said and  typically only upsets people (So why do it?). The only reason behind saying it that I can see is to purposely upset people and/or in some messed up way in which the offender is trying to build themself up by tearing another down.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
