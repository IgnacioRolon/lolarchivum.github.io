Marksmen aren't required for a team to function, you can substitute them with a mage but you have to know how to play with no AD DPS (unless you have an AD assassin mid). \n\nThere are a lot of champions that are viable but outside of the meta and what annoys me is when people come here and complain how Riot should artificially make the meta spotlight wider to accommodate more champions. But when Riot did that with Mordekaiser (he was an experiment to see if more roles can fit into a duo lane), people thought that it was Riot's goal to make Morde a melee Marksman... And now we're seeing a mage bot pop up naturally.\n\nI find it funny how when Riot wants to make a change, everyone is against it but when it happens on it's own, then it's \"unique\" and Riot shouldn't touch it.","replies":[{"poster":"AmonTheFallen","date":"2017-01-23T19:48:47.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"? The last one is bad. Morde was in absolute broken state. Also a lot of people want mages out of bot lane and say to Riot to not just touch it but to straight up buff ADCs.\n\nImo some indirect buffs to ADCs are needed. The tower protection down bot lane needs to get out. Supports needs to have less gold so the Brand and Zyra supports cant have the same items or higher as mid laner (spellthief is broken). Some item prices change. Tank items<<<APC items<<ADC items.\n\nNerf champs and items and masteries that are issue.

You're getting nowhere near \"the same items as a mid laner or higher\" as you claim. I manage to get around 1000-1500 gold with this FCQ, if i'm actively trying to expend it's charges and depending on how long the game lasts.\nUp to that point in the game, that's a free Needlessly Large Rod, Boots and a Health Potion. And that comes way later into the game, where champions with a steady gold income are way more decked out than a support with a FCQ and its extra gold.\n\nThe notion of cutting down on support's passive gold income is ridiculous as your way of toning down Brand andd Zyra (because of their great synergy with Raylai's and Liandry's that have gotten massively cheaper since Rylai's has gotten nerfed) is to cut down the gold for the class entirely. If there are issues with Brand and Zyra, it's definitely those two items and how cheap they've gotten. Not to mention that the way they deal damage makes the application of Liandry's and Rylai's easier.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2017-01-08T06:43:02.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happens in every game where you can switch up strategies, to be fair.
