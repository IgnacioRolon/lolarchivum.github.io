Resetting your E (empowered by passive) and cleaning up stragglers is her strongsuit. Flanking and wiping out the enemy from unexpected vectors, and annoying them. It's sometimes better to NOT go in and make the enemy botlane scared than to go in at all. Popping my W on Soraka makes her run away from her frontline who was being engaged upon, and with her went the Vayne. Now, it's a 3v4, with them lacking their healer and ADC, their group starts trying to retreat, Soraka and Vayne run up to cover, I open up on the Soraka and they're both retreating too, doing almost no damage, and their entire group is wiped in the blink of an eye. \n\nEvelyn's greatest advantage is her invisibility post-6, the enemy has to respect your potential presence, you can literally walk into a lane, W someone, walk out and head off to a different lane, farm, get objectives, etc. and that laner plays paranoid for a bit. Do it a second time, but this time skirt them, get behind them, wait out your W, and then pop it on them again, this time going for the gank.\n\nNow they don't know what to think, where you will be, or your strategy. She is good at counter-jungling as she can avoid all wards that are placed, and sees red wards that are down (so that she can remove those too). If the enemy jungler or laners want to protect their monsters, they are going to struggle to do so. Regular wards will at best only let them know when you reveal yourself, and unless they are visually watching the area, they won't notice the W on the monster before you uncamo. It's extremely efficient. She lacks a lot of upfront and staying power, she's still an assassin after all. You have to play to mess with their minds if you intend to play her correctly.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-10-12T23:20:14.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make it sound so fun!

I felt like an actual assassin as I watched my prey and waited for the right moment (often for my laner to engage) before I struck. Killing low health targets seems like a no brainer for an assassin, you want to kill them at their weakest, when you have the advantage. \n\nIt helps that her W range is simply **massive**. Seriously you can probably set up some good paranoia by using it at the farthest you can and then creep up to them. Like if they’re at your tower and you use it, they are forced to run but there’s few ways that can avoid you.  And using an ability to proc lust dust is just so bursty. \n\nI also really like her ult. The escape mechanic allows you to make a decision for how you want to use it (kinda like Ekko) but you can also get a kill and escape death with it. I killed a veigar in his own cage and dodged the W that would have killed me with it. \n\nArguably I think the indicator for her ult feels misleading because you’d think that would mean it’s basically an execution. But it’s not. \n\nI actually ended up getting a penta with her in my first game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2017-10-12T16:16:31.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Use E on someone to pull yourself in.

She doesnt have enough damage to be effective at all on her own, She has ZERO 1v1 playability with an ult that basically is used more for an escape then a finisher because most of the time It doesnt finish off the enemy champ. If she gets counter jungled or caught out on her pathing shes useless, He clear is probably the worst clear ive seen especiall eg and by the time you are able to clear camps and Become effective, everyone is already 3 levels ahead. She is Gank reliant yet has VERY BAD ganking until 6 by which point you are useless anyways because everyone else is already at least 2-3 levels ahead of you. The only reason people ban her is because she either HAS to ks kills in order to snowball, Or she ends up So behind that Her team has to carry her. \n\nNot to mention, Every pro streamer/player that says shes super op are those that are using the new rune/mastery system on the Pbe which she was basically tailored around when she was reworked. I'm sure that in a month when that system comes out live she will be op as fuck and everyone will be whining about how she needs a nerf, But from My experience in playing her and against her, Shes nothing but cannon fodder.","replies":[{"poster":"Zetto","date":"2017-10-12T23:08:59.830+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Only her E does almost no damage \n\nI stopped reading after this","replies":[{"poster":"B45590M","date":"2017-10-13T00:17:53.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Okay but compare her kit to other assassins, Lets use two with stealth, Akali and shaco, Akali has WAY more kill potential then eve and she doesn't even NEED her stealth and her damage is 3x eves currently.
