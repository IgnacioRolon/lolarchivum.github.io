I ban him EVERY game unless someone else on my team does.  And I'll continue to do it until Riot removes his dumbass \"cancel a marksman's entire kit\" Windwall.  At MINIMUM (absolute, rock-bottom MINIMUM) that piece of shit should dissipate if Yasuo goes through it.  But if I can't negate things like Zed ult with Scimitar, then Yasuo can eat a dick with his Windwall.","replies":[{"poster":"And A Real Hiero","date":"2017-06-14T18:34:55.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, yes let the hate flow through you!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kagepaladin","date":"2017-06-14T16:16:43.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"ah well he got through my last game he told us to basically slit out wrists, actual words were to cut out veins but its basically the same thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hèntaî ","date":"2017-06-14T23:48:06.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont see him banned often tbh lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"WitchQueen Annie","date":"2017-06-14T18:46:18.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's still being spammed in Normals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Subject 5","date":"2017-06-14T18:32:56.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen Yasuo like 3 times.\n\nAll of them are with Yasuo going lik 0/6 and then getting a double - then suddenly ending something like 9/9 or 9/6","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rusty Justy 7","date":"2017-06-14T17:52:55.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be nice to be able to play my main again.\n\nPretty sad when your main gets an awesome new skin and your dreading it because it's going to make playing them even harder...\n\nThe rework wont help.

It's a shame it took this long for riot to realize how unhealthy he is. All the forums talking about him wasn't enough riot needed to see it for themselves I guess.","replies":[]}]}]}
