I think it's funny you want to say SR is more one sided even though I rarely have SR games that end before surrender time is possible, meanwhile more than half my Dominion matches from 1 single day were heavily one sided due to the fact that my team completely out skilled the opposing team to the point I could have just been afk and my team would still win anyways, in fact most of the games where I played Lee I just played it as if it was TDM since my team never needed me for any of my wins. I'm sure it's a nice experience sitting in que for 5+ minutes for a match that lasted just as long or one where you felt you were completely unneeded.
