Because thats what bruisers are tanky dmg dealer who either go for the 1v1 to pressure the map (or even 1v2 like jax is infamous for) or are divers like camille who go for the backline (adcs, mages) to take them out of the fight. \nLeague was (what a lot of people and rito seem to forget) built around powercurves. This apparently doesn't exist anymore looking at ADCs. \nFirst of all let us talk about marksmen and not ADCs because thats a lose term which can be used for any AD carry champ. \nMarksmen have benefits like range, objective taking power and consistent reliable dmg but they need time to scale. Tanks also are pretty useless without a dmg source on the team which the mage alone can not provide most likely so there has been the bruisers who for the most part have sustained dmg/high dps to CARRY the adc to the point where he is relevant and are tanky enough to not get instantly blown up by an assassin or mage. Sometimes it was enough to end the game in the midgame sometimes not where then the adc would kick in. \n\nSo no league was not \"built to everyone bowing down to the adc\". This is not league of adcs atleast not just yet.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-11-28T17:35:24.001+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GayFluffyUnicorn,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4Aqi4aUi,comment-id=00040001,timestamp=2017-11-28T15:53:15.568+0000)\n>\n> &quot;Bruisers and fighters peel for the carry&quot; \n> WHAT !?\n> I dont even have words for this. \n> Your whole comment makes me so irrationally angry irl i&#x27;m close to smashing my keyboard. \n> FYI: There are more carry champs than adcs. Camille is a carry, fiora and riven are carries and basically every fighter/juggernaut.

A Skirmisher is a high damage high mobility character with one defenseive steroid. They are meant to force a 1v1 prior to a teamfight to efficiently take down the enemy. While a skirmisher _can_ carry, they need to be very fed, even then a well-timed Hard Crowd Control will shut them down on the spot. Yes, anyone \"can\" carry. But the point of the game is to assist the Marksman of bottom lane, whether it be picking, peel, tank, or buffs.","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2017-11-28T17:11:33.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've carried many useless ADC to victory.

However, you even said it yourself: “...playing *for* the ADC and not *with*”. All characters play with and around each other. Working *with* the carry is exactly the same as assisting the carry. Did I ignore melee carries? Well, almost. I did name the subclasses of *fighter* and *bruiser* but completely forgot to mention skirmishers and such. Not so much ignoring as forgetting. You appear to have the mentality “oh your precious ADC main will be bad soon” as if all I do is sit on my ass playing carry. I actually jungle a lot as well as the occasional toplane, and enjoy them as well.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
