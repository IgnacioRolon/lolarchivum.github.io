What does a sharpshooter want to hit? A headshot. They want precision. Caitlyn's sniper fantasy is there from the start with her high base range. If you switched passives, suddenly she would need a really low base range in order to compensate. And tristana would need an increase in base range because at 550 range, with her kit, there wouldnt be much reason to pick her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jelite50","date":"2017-10-06T13:13:49.219+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"heeelll no HHEEELLLLLL NOOOOOOOOO HHHHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEELLLLL NOOOOOOOOOOO as an adc main I FUCING DISAGREE WITH THIS SHIT WTFFFFFFF caitlyn is cancer enough in lane ( well used to be now he's kinda bad) but what I mean is if she had scaling range with the fucing 650 she already has there would be no laning against her, like literally she'd be able to poke from so far with no minion harass and even be able to kite an adc ( kiting in the sense of being able to auto an adc without the adc getting in range) like holy shit delete this thread riot might be dumb enough to read this shit and agree","replies":[{"poster":"GrievousFetus","date":"2017-10-06T13:33:47.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or y'know giving her range per level justifies giving her lower starting range, because currently her \"sniper\" aesthetic demands she have outrageous range at all levels.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Illâoi Evê Siôn","date":"2017-10-06T13:33:09.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realize swapping passive would mean you have to adjust both champions to their new passives, right?","replies":[]}]}]}
