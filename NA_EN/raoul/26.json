When you clicked on a Champion but couldnt lock before, that is is most cases because you actually tried to communicate with your team and switched Champion last second, or because you couldnt decide in time because that crappy system doesnt allow you to watch your champions and think about a counterpick for the enemy champs or a supporting pick for your team until your timer runs, again,. because RIOT is sooooooo proud to show you the splas arts instead of letting you do something productive during your teammates picks.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-01-20T05:58:12.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is allowed to disagree with you, you know.\n\nHell, they're not even disagreeing with one of your points; they're adding in solo queue back.
