Now, i understand that me going afk ruins the experience for others, but i mean, i cant help it except by not playing the game. And yes, i do feel horrible when i end up losing power and we lose a game because of it, but i simply cant help it. btw, i have never bean banned from the game for afk, that is not what i ment. I mean like does the 20 min wait time count against it? Thx for reading this post, cya.","replies":[{"poster":"DuckCurry","date":"2017-07-06T18:03:46.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leaving and AFK'ing in game will prevent honor level and honor reward progression in those games. So in your case you may not always be getting credit depending on the severity of your outages. If you're interested, you might want to look into an uninterruptible power supply to hook up to your gaming rig, router, and internet modem, so you can stay online during those outages. I also tend to lose power in the summer at my apartment complex, and a beefy UPS has helped a ton.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2017-07-07T18:35:16.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To clarify what DuckCurry said, you will not gain any progress *in those games where you have power outages.* But those games will not count *against* you, either, and you will still be able to earn honor normally in the games you're able to complete.
