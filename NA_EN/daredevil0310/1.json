If you're getting fed, but struggling to end the game, it sounds like you need to change the way you go about things after that point. \n\nBe more of a shot caller and try to get your team doing things together.

Top lane has always been kind of an island, where as mid is right in the middle of the map and roams more effectively than a top for the most part. Do you have a larger champion pool you'd be willing to play?
