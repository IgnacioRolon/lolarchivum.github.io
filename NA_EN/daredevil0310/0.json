I half half a mil kat points. Go to https://www.reddit.com/r/KatarinaMains/ if you want some real tips. Kat's laning phase is the strongest in the game due to her powerful level three and level 2 all in. She is a high risk high reward assassin with a high skill cap. Laning phase is general hard for kat because she is extremely squishy and melee. In hard lanes farm with your q and buy long sword to last hit under tower. Pre level 6 kat scales better with ad. Level 2-5 you should start to q farm the minions and position your dagger to fall infront of the enemy laner, zoning him away from the minions so you can farm, if he walks up to the dagger e onto the dagger and auto TWICE. Your e takes around 2.5 secs to reset while you are below level 6 and around 1 sec to reset before level 11. your e is also an auto attack reset so immediately after you get your second auto of you should immediately e then w. You can control what side of the target you e to and you should e toward their side facing their turret so they cant run from your w dagger. repeat the two auto attacks and e reset.","replies":[{"poster":"DareDevil0310","date":"2017-12-15T22:33:28.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh ok thx, ive beed using the e-w-q-e-(r) combo so far, ill try that one out","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2017-12-12T00:13:27.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to combo them. Don't expect to instaburst your opponent right off, though. It takes time.\n\nAt first, work on slowly poking them down with your Q, to zone them off creeps. It does a lot of damage. More than you'd think, at least. At level 2, you want to start jumping in with your Q>E>AA(>E out). Level 3, you want them to be at or below 60% max health. Then just jump in and combo the fuck outta them. Keep killing them until you get to 6 or so, then roam bot.\n\nIf you have problems in lane, play safe, wear them down with Qs, and look for an opportunity to roam to bot.","replies":[{"poster":"DareDevil0310","date":"2017-12-12T03:35:25.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the tips, i always try to aim my q through the minions to position daggers and forget to hit them with the actual q.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vargrjalmer","date":"2018-07-11T01:41:41.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play her top lane and nowhere else, she has to pick up daggers to deal damage, if youre ranged, there is no reason for you to be near her dagger, if you throw a dag at them, or even at the minion in front of them, you wont get that pickup damage, you just wont, if katarina throws a dagger, run to the side, or even better, TOWARDS HER, and then, being unable to pick up either dagger, she is incapable of all inning you, at this point, you destroy her with impunity.\nwhats she gonna do? throw another dagger in 8 seconds?\nif you want an ap melee assassin, go diana, or kassadin, or full ap leona.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2017-12-12T01:08:01.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The optimal combo post level 3 is E->W*->AA. Once the enemy commits to moving in a certain direction throw your Q. Once your W dagger procs, your E CD will reset, allowing you to jump to your Q dagger. AA immediately after blinking to your Q. Your Q dagger proc will reset your shunpo again allowing you to blink a third and final time. \n\n*this is the most dangerous part of your combo, were you are the most vulnerable, and where you will either succeed or fail the majority of the time. The second you shunpo onto someone they're going to panic and throw any peel abilities they have at you, thus you must be ready to dodge. For players who are not mechanically excellent, this is probably the hardest part of laning, because they do not have the reflexes or the understanding of their enemies kits to dodge the CC or high burst ability at this Junction.\n\nAll in all, it should look something like E, W, DODGE THEIR SKILL-SHOT, AA, Q, E, AA, E, AA. Pre-6 that combo will kill 99% of champions in the game if they don't burn summs.","replies":[{"poster":"DareDevil0310","date":"2017-12-12T03:36:37.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol im not that good at mechanics but ill keep that in mind","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brutalitops01","date":"2017-12-12T01:47:51.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Katarina's lane phase is all about positioning herself properly so that her Q dagger is in the right spot. When you think about it, level 2 she actually has 4 abilities. Q, E, dagger, and E reset. Start Long Sword + 3 potions and run Electrocute, Sudden Impact, Eyeball Collector, Ravenous Hunter, Triumph, and Coup de Grace for your runes. As you get closer to level 2, position yourself forward so you can immediately Q your lane opponent, E to behind them (picking up the dagger and resetting your E), and then E again. Auto them down with the bonus AD from Long Sword and ignite to finish them off.\n\nFor lane phase after that, you have a lead, so as long as you can position the daggers properly around the field, you should be able to win any fight. Remember, positioning the daggers is key, and Shunpo is an instant blink, so use it to dodge abilities that would cause your death. As an example, you have a dagger behind Yasuo, he throws his Q knockup at you, you Shunpo over the q to the dagger and proceed to burst him. Meanwhile, he just missed his main damage and won't have it up again for a few seconds. Getting a kill resets your cooldowns and you have a lot of AoE, so you should be able to 2v1 with enough of a lead, should you get ganked.\n\nIf you have enough of a lead to kill your lane opponent and still be pretty healthy, use that around the map to kill your lane opponent, push in the wave, and roam, not only solidifying your lead, but also giving your teammates a lead.\n\nAs the game goes later, keep in mind your team's engage and where you can place daggers for the maximum effect. Say you have an Ornn ulting over the entire enemy team, as soon as that knockup hits, you can q e w r combo them to blow them all up really easily.","replies":[{"poster":"DareDevil0310","date":"2017-12-12T03:35:52.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the tips, very usefull","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GraćSięNieDa","date":"2017-12-12T01:01:01.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to practice, add me - same name, EUNE though.
