When I go on a winning streak I decide to go into ranked.I go into ranked and get my ass kicked. I have been playing for over a year now.Everybody in ranked flames me. I cant understand what i do wrong. look at my op.gg. Its not the best right now. There was a time when i had 100% win rate on {{champion:91}}  in normals and an average KDA of 7.5 . So i decided to go ranked. I faced a {{champion:99}} which is considered to be one of the easiest matchup and i fed miserably. Same thing with {{champion:5}} . I just dont know what to do. Nobody helps me. They just flame me. Should i continue playing ranked? Please help me.

In Ranked, when everyone is try harding, a few kills can mean an unstoppable snowball for an enemy.\n\nYour CS definitely needs to increase. You should aim for 100 by 15 mins.\n\nMaybe try taking less risks, like...\n\n- Don't push at all if you don't have vision of your flanks\n- Save Flash for escapes unless you can execute a low HP enemy and definitely get out alive\n- Buy Sightstone/Sweeper as Support!! Very important!\n- Learn to realise when a trade is lost and back off before you lose too much\n\n\nI think if you can just shave off a couple of deaths here and there, CS more as carries and control vision as Support you'll have no more problems :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DemainaNyx","date":"2017-03-27T08:38:46.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a video game.  If you aren't having fun, maybe don't play.  \n\nPeople take ranked way too seriously.  However, I've had people flame me in URF or ARAM or One For All for not knowing how to play a champion that I didn't pick.  You're probably always going to have these people, you just need to figure out whether you want to deal with it or not.  Personally, I like ranked to a degree simply because it's unlikely that I'm going to get a challenger in my silver games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Basic Island","date":"2017-03-27T06:31:42.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ranked is absolute aids and i haven't played it since S2 or something like that where i got to gold\n\ni know im at WORST gold, and i don't need a ranked badge to prove to others that i am\n\n\nyou can have just as meaningful/competitive games in normals than you can ranked","replies":[{"poster":"gameryou","date":"2017-03-27T06:34:11.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Basic Island,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4KArGFFV,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-27T06:31:42.872+0000)\n>\n> ranked is absolute aids and i haven&#x27;t played it since S2 or something like that where i got to gold\n> \n> i know im at WORST gold, and i don&#x27;t need a ranked badge to prove to others that i am\n> \n> \n> you can have just as meaningful/competitive games in normals than you can ranked\n\nso i should leave playing ranked?\nBut League is all about ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Taliyah Rocks","date":"2017-03-27T07:00:27.004+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=gameryou,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4KArGFFV,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-03-27T06:34:11.423+0000)\n>\n> so i should leave playing ranked?\n> But League is all about ranked.\n\nReally it's not. Quite frankly the reason i'd even want to rank up is to be elligible for the gold skin rewarded every years. (I'm sad i missed out on the Maokai skin last year :(  he used to be one of my main)\n\nThe higher your rank, the stronger your opponents will be, the more stressful your games will be.\n\nI used to play with a few gold/plat and i got destroyed at first, but since they were my friends i kept on playing with them. Eventually i was able to pull my weight and even carry a few times.\n\nI've only ever reached Silver, but last year i had around a 70% winrate. I'm sure i could have gotten gold quite easily, but i barely did any ranked and i stopped playing League around the end of the season.\n\nWhen i play norms, i'm usualy teaming up with and against silver players, and i almost always do fine/get fed. At least i never feed.\n\nThe point is, playing at lower elo makes games easier, which in turn can make the game more fun and less stressful. Although that doesn't stop teammates from ruining your game (what is it with botlanes lately... sigh) but i've heard that anything below Diamond is still filled with trolls and feeders so you can't really avoid it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2017-03-27T14:21:50.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is suggest playing ranked and going for gold only unless you can easily get higher. I just play for the skin and usually try getting a second account to gold once I've hit it. You just have to realize map pressure is totally different in ranked because people are trying to win more. I watched a YouTube video of someone saying to just play like a bitch in order to get gold and while it's not fun, it works. Just don't die and focus on farming and objectives. That's pretty mush all you have to do to end up hitting gold. I did it playing support\nWith this mentality you can go in any lane and play decently","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Basic Island","date":"2017-03-27T06:37:23.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's up to you.\n\nI personally don't play it because tensions are so much higher, everyone is on edge, etc etc.  People in general are just more stressed/upset than they are in normals, for something that is COMPLETELY meaningless.  99.999999% of us aren't challenger players looking to make a team, so there's literally nothing to gain out of rank other than ego/pride/the skins.\n\n\nat the end of the day, to the vast majority of us, it's just a game","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Maddmazz","date":"2017-03-27T15:11:49.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try a very conservative approach.

That is a deeply personal decision... you must understand why you continue play League (for funsies? to be \"better at the game\"? To feel good by killing enemies over and over?), and choose the queue that best helps you fulfill your goals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-03-27T07:35:26.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look up some material about a range of topics including, csing, good ward placement, how to zone, what zones of control mean, how to rotate, roughly what you should be doing in the mid/late game, read up some guides for your champions.\n\nAlso a good way to improve is to focus on one thing every game.  Say one game you focus on remembering to ping the enemies summoner spells after they use them so you know when they are down, the next game you focus on getting every single cs, the next you focus on proactively using your ulti every time its up (ulti is about to be up in 15 sec, start roaming bot for a gank etc).  Focus on something every game and eventually you are just going to start doing them without thinking about it.  \n\nIn ranked if you are expecting to be flamed then just /mute all as soon as you get in game and keep all chat off (this helps quite a bit and you won't even notice its off).\n\nEdit: also remember to ping everything, ping when people leave lane, ping when you have cds on important abilities or ulti, pinging is free information you give to your team and the more information you have the better and less risky decisions you can make.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-03-27T07:26:40.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of other people are trying out.champs in normals too but when you hop into rank you should be playing a role/champ you have down that might factor into alittle.
