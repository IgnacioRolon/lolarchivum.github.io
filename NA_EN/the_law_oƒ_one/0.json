I was trying to improve and not insult others after the 14 day ban but I see how complaining so much is negative and how light trash talk isn't accepted either. I can stop doing these but I would've liked to have known that this was enough to get me full on permabanned beforehand. Do I agree with it? No, but I understand the level of tolerance now and dont want to permanently lose my account.\n\nI'd like to request that this ban is reviewed and I'm considered for being unbanned. I realize now that riot doesn't tolerate much negativity in general so if I'm unbanned I'll know how easily I can get banned and make some changes. I know I need to mute all and not take the game so seriously. I know I can do this because some games I would be totally fine and or could laugh things off, just need to keep cool and to myself in those games where I'm in a bad mood and this ban is motivation for that.

Doing so can encourage players who are already negative to continue their behavior. Whether they know they are being reported or not has no bearing to whether the system will act on them. But most importantly, repeatedly threatening or arguing with a negative player can end up derailing the game for everyone else and then open yourself up to reports and possible disciplinary action as well. Avoid negative thoughts and useless chatting with poor performing teammates! Focus on victory by muting the offending player and then reporting them at the end of the game.\n> \n> Do not ask other players in the match to report the offending player. It only takes one report for our systems to review a game. Additional reports will not do anything for the offending player; however as mentioned above, it could open yourself up to a report of your own; especially if you are derailing the match by constantly demanding reports of other players.\n\nI'm sorry you've seen worse and/or I'm happy to hear that your behavior has improved, but the system wants your behavior to be _acceptable_, not just _less unacceptable_ than what you have seen in others and/or demonstrated in the past.\n\nThis one transgression by itself wouldn't be enough to bring a clean account to an instant permaban, but the IFS works on an escalating punishment system. Breaking a minor rule, like engaging the team in useless arguments, has a minor punishment: a chat restriction. Breaking that same rule over and over again, however, doesn't prompt an endless series of chat restrictions. The severity of the punishment ramps up over time, because the goal is to eliminate the punished player's willingness to break the game's rules. If two chat restrictions don't stop the useless arguments, the system will increase the punishment to a 14-day suspension and deliver a very clear message that the continued rule-breaking is becoming a serious issue and any further instances will result in a permaban. Again, the point is to put a stop to this misbehavior. If a player is more interested in repeatedly breaking the rules than in maintaining access to their account, they'll lose access to their account.","replies":[{"poster":"The Law oƒ One","date":"2019-07-25T23:55:39.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-26T00:24:32.314+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Law oƒ One,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=men1c0c4,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2019-07-25T23:55:39.162+0000)\n>\n> Bla bla bla bla bla, you ever stop for a second and think for yourself about whether the stuff youre regurgitating is reasonable and fair?

This was after my ADC refused to communicate and simply say farming under tower and refused to follow up on my pokes/CC. Leaving lane both allowed me to poke and get gold (spellthiefs) as well as get other lanes kills, while my ADC didn't lose anything, and actually leveled up faster because I wasn't permanently leeching exp.\n\nMy point is that there are valid reasons to leave lane early as a support. You being unhappy with it doesn't make it instantly griefing. If they thought they had a valid reason to do so, even if it's weird or not what you would do, it's not griefing.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
