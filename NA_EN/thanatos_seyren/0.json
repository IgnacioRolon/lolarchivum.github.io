Wanted to upgrade the graphics card, so I bought a simple Geforce 610. Installed it, everything works great. Except the sound.\r\nThere's no sound. Plugged in my iphone earbuds, no sound. Plugged in my hyper x headset, no sound. What I DO get is a sort of static sound that will randomly jump in how loud and choppy the sound is. I have tried all of the following proposed solutions.\r\n\r\n-Uninstalling the graphics card audio drivers and restarting.\r\n-Uninstalling and reinstalling Realtek audio drivers and restarting.\r\n-Ensuring volume controls are on, enabled, volume is on, etc. \r\n-Going into BIOS and ensuring volume controller is enabled.\r\n-Ensuring realtek is the default playback option for audio in device manager.\r\n-Disabling / Enabling realtek.\r\n\r\nAdditional information:\r\n-Sound was working perfectly fine before installing new graphics card.\r\n-When I reboot and say have my headset plugged in, the static sound is gone UNTIL I go to anything where sound would normally play (youtube video, game, etc)\r\n-The issue is NOT that my headset or whatever other audio device does not show up in control panel / device manager. From the outset of this problem whenever I have gone into device manager the default sound device is there, with a green checkmark.\r\n-Audio icon in bottom right corner of desktop toolbar does not have a red x.\r\n-If I attempt to troubleshoot realtek audio, it tells me the device is working properly. \r\n-EVEN IF I take out the new graphics card from my new computer (leaving only the build in graphics) the problem persists.\r\n\r\nSeriously, what gives?\r\nAlso, is there a shortcut fix to this? Can I like buy a sound card for my PC to solve this issue? Willing to do that at this point.","replies":[]}
