Even though Ezreal and Vi had gotten skins not to long ago they get more skins! \n\nYet still no new skin for Kha'zix or Zac or the numerous other champs that have not gotten one in years. IMO Debonair Vi looks ok. The Ezreal skin looks pretty cheap and crappy. I know, I know they were just put on the PBE and they might change. The fantasy in these skins does not exist. They look like restaurant waiters. Debonair Jayce skin was pretty nice. These are not. Zac would have been a much better choice for a Debonair skin. \n\nOnce again, no news on the new champ or Ultimate skin, or the new tantrum resource bar, something that the majority of players are excited about and actually want to know about.","replies":[{"poster":"Silverclaw","date":"2014-07-17T23:36:03.535+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have to agree - these skins need a lot of tweaking.

I, for one, don't like the Neon Strike or Officer skins; they don't really look like Vi imo. (I don't play her, though.)

Both of these champs JUST got skins.  There are SO many other champs that haven't gotten skins in FOREVER.  There are so many other champions who deserve skins before these two, especially when they both just look awful.  \n\nEvelynn and Trundle have both had no new skins since 2010 (I'll give you Trundle VU, but point stands)\n\nAkali, Karma, Karthus, Kassadin, Kennen, Leblanc, Mordekaiser, Malzahar, Miss Fortune, Sion, Skarner, Taric, Twitch, Warwick, Yorick, and Zilean have not received skins since 2011.  \n\nAmumu, Brand, Cho'Gath, Cass, Fiddle, Fiora,  Galio, Irelia, Katarina, Kha'Zix, Kog'Maw, Master Yi, Nautilus, Nocturne, Olaf, Poppy, Rammus, Ryze, Sona, Swain, Talon, Teemo, Tristana, Urgot, Veigar, Wukong, and Xerath have not received skins since 2012.\n\n\nKarma, Kha'Zix, Yorick, and Zac have never received any skins after their debut.

I also agree that they need to update a lot of the older content, but I get way more excited about new champs/lore then anything else.
