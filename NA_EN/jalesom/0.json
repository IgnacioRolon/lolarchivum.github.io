{"poster":"Jalesom","date":"2014-10-14T04:09:41.855+0000","title":"Maintaining Sivir's Unique Niche","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sivir is unique due to her incredible waveclear, movement speed, split pushing/pushing power, and her spell shield. \r\n\r\n**How items prevent her niche role.**\r\nHer waveclear as an ADC is primarily achieved by building Cooldown Reduction (CDR) with her skills scaling off of raw damage. However, the only items that provide lots of raw Atttack Damage with Cooldown Reduction are {{item:3508}} , {{item:3071}}, {{item:3142}} , {{item:3209}}, {{item:3172}} . The essence reaver synergizes well with Sivir's kit, but is not efficient enough to rush as a first item and does not provide enough mana per hit in the early game to compensate for her overwhelming mana needs. The Black Cleaver, although it synergizes extremely well with her kit, does not do enough damage to tanks compared to the Last Whisperer. This forces an entire team comp to be built around Sivir to compensate with lots of Attack Damage from other champions to take full advantage of Black Cleaver. This often does not work well because unless you are in a 5 man team, in solo Q you have no control over what others pick. Youmoo's Ghostblade works well with her kit like black cleaver because it allows her to run down opponents being she has no crowd control abilities, but it simply isn't efficient enough to get to kill one squishy when there are two tanks (last whisper needed). The Spirit of the Elder Lizard is a jungling item and simply isn't enough damage and utility for an ADC. The Zephyr is a great item on Sivir that Gives her most everything she needs except large raw damage. Also, the Zephyr is typically only bought end game when you have tons of gold and feel like replacing Berserker's Greaves. \r\n\r\nOther items that provide CDR that work well with her kit are {{item:3025}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3110}} , but these all are defensive items. Iceborn Gauntlet gives AP instead of AD. Spirit Visage synergizes best with life steal and is a viable item but Guardian Angel and Banshies Veil are often better choices due to their utility in teamfights.\r\n\r\nThis forces her to opt for the standard adc build mention in other posts that do not synergize with her kit. So the question is does one revamp the items which affect 100 other characters, OR change her kit to bring out the usefulness of the items mentioned above.\r\n\r\n*The obvious answer is change her kit because then you are working with her kit as really the only variable. *\r\n\r\n**The emphasis of Sivir's kit.**\r\nCurrently her kit is built around movement speed, waveclear, and split pushing. The passive gives you extra mov't speed after dealing damage to a champion, and her ult is a whole team and/or minions mov't speed steroid. Mov't speed is extremely important for her because she has no crowd controls, low attack range, and no dodge ability. I say no dodge because her spell shield does not re-position her, it simply blocks ONE incoming ability. That is why her boomerang blade has long range and her rickochet damages from a distance.\r\n\r\n**The faults of her kit.**\r\nShe requires raw AD items but is most effective with CDR forcing players to either play her like almost every other ADC or sacrifice the ADC role of being the main source of attack damage output for her team for CDR. Her Spell Shield has an extremely long cooldown at low levels forcing her to waste rickochet on minions to damage champs at a safe distance ( which is half damage on bounces) or use a lot of mana to possibly land a boomerang blade (which has been improved in terms of its hitbox recently). When her spell sheild is down she is forced to flash or ult to escape abilities unlike other adc's who have a Q, W, E, crowd control, or slow to kite especially at low levels. If she falls behind just a little she has very little chance to catch back up in terms of outplaying an opponent simply with her kit. Also as a side note, one oddity is that her ults passive gives ricochets active % attack speed. Shouldn't it simply be that ricochets active grants % attack speed and causes autoattacks to bounce for 3 auto attacks??\r\n\r\n**Interesting ways to improve her kit without altering items!!**\r\nHer ults passive could be to give CDR based on current movement speed value (with ricochet retaining the 80% attack speed but as an active of ricochet itself). This would encourage actually building {{item:3172}}  giving 10% CDR AND Tenacity which is important to counter incoming crowd control being she doesn't have some crowd control of her own. Also, depending on the amount of CDR given by the passive, the {{item:3078}}  becomes more viable to rush because it would also synergize with Sivir's passive. By using her Ult, with the right %CDR scaling, she could easily reach 40% CDR later in the game allowing her to really have damage output in teamfights. The downfall of this is that it does not synergize well with her waveclear/split push niche but instead turns her more to teamfighting. On the other hand this might allow her to make incredible moves to dodge and duel an opponent(s) that comes to stop her while split pushing. It really depends on how great an effect is has on her.\r\n\r\nPerhaps alter her spell shield.  In all honesty what separates the quick and the dead Sivir's is her spell shield so I have quite a few ideas around it. \r\n\r\nSuccessfully blocking an ability with spell shield could grant CDR in some way temporarily or permanently. This would encourage Sivir's to engage after already blocking a lot of incoming damage by increasing her damage output. \r\n\r\nAnother spell shield idea is that successfully blocking and ability grants the next ability cast to stun the opponent. This would give her crowd control and really allow her to have a chance in a duel by really punishing the opponent for engaging. This works well with the zoning ability of her boomerang blade.\r\n\r\nYet another spell shield idea is to have it synergize with her passive by granting her rewards for different numbers of successful blocks. For instance, with arbitrary numbers for ease, the first five blocks grant additional movement speed for each block much like her passive is now based on level from my understanding. Blocks 6-15 could grant %CDR. Reaching 30 blocks adds another bounce to richochet or perhaps adds on hit effects to both the first and second targets hit (prioritizing Champions). Reaching 50 blocks grants her the ability to recast spellsheild while on cooldown after a successful block but with the recast not as a spell shield but rather to add a stun to her next ability that lands. If Rengar gets trophies that grant him abilities, why cant spell shield ownage grant Sivir new abilities.  Another option for 50 blocks is to increase the range or damage of her boomerang blade. Keep in mind that these are arbitrary numbers that may or may not be realistic in a game and could be scaled to be realistic. \r\n\r\n*Now I must admit I tried to incorporate a lot of ideas into one, but the main purpose is the individual ideas. *\r\n\r\nThe one I like the most is granting CDR based on Movement Speed as a passive for her ult (keeping % attack speed with ricochet still but as an active on ricochet). This would greatly improve her role to split push/waveclear. I find this a very interesting idea and is the one I like the most because it is simple and doesn't really involve lots of theoretical complications from item sets. Ironically if Azir's attack speed can scale with his CDR, why can't Sivir's CDR scale with her movement speed? After all, they are synergistic and of the same blood line aren't they!!!\r\n\r\nI would like to hear any constructive thoughts of yours on the post and really hope that Riot considers changing her just a little more to allow us to play her the exciting way they intended us to!","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-10-14T04:48:39.941+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nice discussion.

Better yet, if you made an item that was AD/AS/CDR/Mana in place of items like SShiv or PD you could easily help out ADC caster's. Maybe give a small item that gives AD/mana as a \"first back\" pickup for ADC caster's to use in lane before transitioning it into a much more AS focused item (sorta like zephyr but get the AD/mana item instead of pickaxe).\n\nOf course all the design in the world isn't going to help until the IE rush issue is resolved and it becomes viable to go straight AD over crit like it was pre-IE change.

This would allow interplay between the two items and fit well with caster AD with the mana regeneration.

Basically, don't write off a new item just because it isn't what people thought it would be when it came out. I am very excited to see how they tweak it and if they can keep it specific to AD casters to prevent the already top tier ADC's from abusing its power. Also, keep in mind that essence reaver could synergize with other items as well, and muramana is just a cool example.\n\nWith this in mind, giving essence reaver +mana may help encourage this theoretical build, but once again it has to be balanced across the champion pool. That is why I pointed out weaknesses of items that would help Sivir but focused on changing Sivir and not the items. Changing one item just a little can tip the scale for tons of other champions.

She's a champion that relies on incredibly precise positioning, but has some of the highest rewards of any ADC if you can use her to her fullest potential, or support a teammate in their efforts to protect you. So, rather than see her (relatively boring) 1v1 and 2v2 laning buffed, I would prefer to see her supportive and teamfight oriented abilities heightened. The most recent buff to On The Hunt is the sort of thing I'm thinking of.\n\nEven moreso than her waveclear, I think that her ability to take advantage of clumped enemies is a key part of her kit and playstyle. So, while I agree that her Ult is her most defining feature, I think that Sivir should be the ADC that you're most frightened of clumping up with your teammates against. You should be scattering and forming a line of scrimmage against her, because if she runs towards you and you all run away together, you'll be cut down by her Q and W. But, if you do stand in a staggered line and move as a unit against her, she shouldn't be as effective as another ADC.\n\nOne of the ideas that I mentioned in that thread was the possibility of allowing her W to apply on-hit effects or crit. Not only would that open up interesting build paths for her, it'd also make her damage output more conditional on playing well and taking advantage of clumped up enemies. This would presumably be shipped alongside nerfs to her effectiveness in situations where the enemy team is playing around her well and she can only hit one target, but I think it'd go a long way towards defining what she uniquely wants to do as a champion and how you can play against it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DemiluniS","date":"2014-10-14T06:51:23.031+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I do agree that her ult is why you bring her to the team, but it makes me kinda sad that you can basically replace her by an item.\nIMO her split pushing is another defining part of her and need to be buffed abit to bring her back in to the meta, after all she got all the tools to split push effectively, strong wave clear, ability to escape a stick situation... it's just something not enough there to compete with the other marksmen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"103percent","date":"2014-10-16T22:44:44.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Nice discussion. Been having some similar talks about a number of champions recently internally. \n> \n> My personal take on Sivir is that her ult's the key source of niche definition for her. It changes how her entire team plays and how the enemy has to play against her by offering something other ADCs aren't able to (short of buying a Talisman perhaps, but that's not a practical choice). Her waveclear/pushing and safety via spellshield against enemies fishing for a catch are then clear secondary points of definition, not as unique, but certainly strong reasons to think about picking her with distinct impact on how the game plays out.\n\nThe thing is, entire teams don't have to play any differently against her than they do anybody else. The key part of her \"kit\" is the team-aura (MS) on her ult, which has been significantly nerfed to the point it doesn't change the enemy team's playstyle. Back when it DID require changes she had an \"OP\" winrate in soloQ (and was picked in korea on occasion competitively) because she could so easily catch out people being \"greedy\" for farm mid/top w/o having their team backing them up. It also allowed the fighters/assassins (who were also meta back then) to quickly close the gap on the enemy teams AD/AP carries (and having mega tank top laners wasn't the meta so they had less \"peel\"). This was the sole point of power in her kit that was leading to a bloated winrate; and the last skill riot got around to nerfing (after nerfing every single other skill of hers with no change in winrate).\n\nI would also argue that buying talisman is only \"not a practical choice\" because of how UP as a support item it is (the other 2 give much better gold returns). Furthermore, while I 100% agree her waveclear and her spell shield are clear points of definition or \"uniqueness\"; I would not call her a \"pushing\" ADC at all. Pushing implies split-pushing, which as we all knows implies being able to duel and win against someone of the other team who would come to stop you. In this regard she is a terrible split-pusher as she will never win duels against other ADCs/APCs (and even some tank top laners and AP supports) because she does not have a kit for dueling. She has a kit for teamfighting and poke; and she has zero damage or offensive ability on her ult.\n\nShe has no strong reasons for picking her as an ADC; she isn't a lane bully like Lucian, she doesn't spike in power mid-game like corki, she doesn't hyper scale like trist/vayne, she doesn't teamfight/AOE better than twitch, she doesn't tower push like cait, and she isn't as safe as ez.

However when ALL of your opponents damage is in their abilities (most midlaners) blocking one is much more impactful, especially if you block their one CC ability that their kits combo is dependent on.\n\nAdded to the previous point, in bot lane Sivir is probably going to be targeted by 6 abilities, 3 from the enemy adc 3 from the enemy support.  E only allows you to block 16.67% of the abilities coming at you.  Compare to mid lane where outside of jungle ganks, Sivir is going to be targeted by  3 abilities, allowing her to block 33.33% of them.\n\nAs for changing Sivir, I'm not really sure.  I have had a quite a bit of success taking her mid so I'm not really sure she needs buffs.  Though I must admit making her spell shield activate her passive on a successful block would be awesome.  Also fixing the bug with hexdrinker/maw shield activating on a blocked ability would be nice.","replies":[{"poster":"G1aD0S","date":"2014-10-15T07:43:46.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to think that too until I realized that Assassins with super burst and low CD skills were natrual counters to adcs with no escapes like Sivir.

Right now there are 4 types of carries but only 3 itemization lines, and only 2 of those lines are competitive. The carry types are Ratio Based (Varus, Graves, MF), Spell Weaving (Ezreal, Corki), Assassin (Twitch, Vayne), and Hypercarries (Tristana, Jinx). They are generally defined by the first item they buy, the old version of Bloodthirster for the ratio carries, trinity force for the spell weavers, BOTRK for the assassins, and Infinity Edge for the Hypercarries. Since the Bloodthirster rework there have been no options available for early raw AD spikes leaving ratio based carries unable to compete with the other groups. Furthermore, the itemization for spell weavers is relatively weak beyond trinity force (essence reaver, BC, and zephyr are pretty weak as you noted, I haven't tried Muramana on a spell weaver since the days of blue ezreal so i'm not sure about it's power level right now) so spell weavers that can't use trinity force to its fullest without other items are also left in a tough spot and none of the spell weavers scale particularly well into the late game. This is all very bad for Sivir, who is a mix of a ratio based and spell weaving ADC.\n\nTo improve Sivir (and a whole class of underplayed ADC's with her) I would suggest adding a new item to help ratio based ADC's with old Bloodthirster's impressive AD but no lifesteal, crit, or attack speed (so it won't be nearly as good on hypercarries). My first instinct is to have it built out of Double BF Swords, but that seems too hard to manage and therefore very snowbally (get it early and win or don't get it at all and lose hard). Other places I would look would be adding Armor Penetration and CDR and having it build out of BF Sword and Brutalizer which also allows ratio based carries to retain the early game power spike of the Brutalizer.\n\nFurthermore there are nearly always unique active or passive abilities on items that cost this much. While a simple AD deathcap passive could work (+10-20% AD depending on balance) I think we could do something more interesting.  Something like \"dealing damage to any target increases damage dealt by abilities by X% (1% is my base idea but this can be tuned) for Y seconds (5 sec in my starting point here, easy to keep going during a fight/lane situation but hard to keep between waves or while roaming or other times while not fighting), stacking up to Z times (10 is my starting point here, but again this is very tuneable)\". This not only accomplishes the goal of improving high AD ratio based carries, but also is much weaker on assassins (who will have a hard time both stacking it up and engaging stealthily) and does very little for hypercarries (who won't be using their skills after autoattacking). Furthermore, it synergizes well with the area of effect abilities that many of the ratio based carries have (sivir, graves, MF, Lucian) and does not copy or outclass any existing items.\n\nFinal item:\nFrenzied Butcher\n100 AD\n10% CDR\n20 Armor Penetration\nUnique Passive- Berzerk: Dealing damage to any target increases physical damage dealt by abilities by 1% for 5 seconds, stacking up to a maximum of 10 times.\nCost 3800 (BF 1550 + Brutalizer 1337 + 913 Combine Cost)\n\nThough it costs the same as Infinity Edge, it is a much higher single item power spike and has an easier build path.\n\nAlternately, Spell Weaver carries could be buffed in a way that is not as reliant on trinity force. Buffs to Muramna and Essence Reaver would help lift up some of the spell weaver carries without just making it a question of who builds triforce best and would also help out a host of mana gated champions who aren't marksmen.\n\nTLDR: Let's try to make itemization better so Sivir and other carries who are in a bad spot right now can be better.

Triforce works for those champions because they make use of the Sheen proc.
