Without delving into all the whatnot (I'm sure you know what I'm talking about), receiving one X and one Y chromosome means you're male, and receiving two X chromosomes means you're female. There's other stuff that can happen in regards to genetic defects that can alter these results, but the fact of the matter is that OP basically said \"You must be a girl, because you take [expletive] too personally.\" This could easily be construed as misogynistic hate speech. Riot has 0 tolerance for hate speech.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-10-27T00:44:59.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">superior overwatch\n\nhttp://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/773/314/2ec.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2017-10-26T17:47:59.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You may be interested to know that Dunkey quit playing league after getting a single 2 week ban.\n\nFrankly, I'm surprised it took that long.

You're generally being a jerk, typing all in caps, threatening to AFK, insulting either your teammates, opponents or both with F-bombs. My guess is that there are either more games like this one or that you've been punished before. \n\nIn the future, if you get a bad game, chock it up to being just that: a bad game. Get out, go for a walk if you need to calm down, get off the computer, look at cat pictures. Do something to chill out. For your sake I'm hoping you only got a chat restriction and you can learn to ease up on telling your teammates to F-off. If they're not doing something you like, point it out once, don't belabor, try to encourage where you can.
