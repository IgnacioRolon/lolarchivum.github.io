Sometimes the only way to get through to someone being an idiot is to flat out be slightly uncivil to them.

The statement \"Be mindful of how you present your point of view\" is very hard for some users. I, for one, am generally unaware of how my tone comes across, *especially* over text. While the text can say \"I think you should practice a bit more\" and I can mean it in the nicest possible way, if the reader sees it and is in a bad mood, they might take it as \"You're bad and you should feel bad.\" This is an extreme example of course, but I feel like that kind of thing can potentially go wrong, especially when most of the posts are as passionate as they are on the boards.\n\nI feel like it could work if this is kept in mind. Maybe enforce it as \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" kind of situation where it's blatantly obvious they're not trying to have a discussion or they're just trying to be mean.\n\n___\n\n\nThe Overwatch forums did this kind of thing. It was extremely annoying as their policy banned/suspended users for minor things (like cursing or being to aggressive with your word choice). I, for one, got banned from that forum for using acronyms and saying that someone shouldn't be a dick as well as posting my thoughts about the Mercy skin that was $15. It was not a good place to have any discussion with passion and that's something we should try to avoid here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jorencice","date":"2018-12-22T02:32:35.638+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"I want old Wild west GD where everything goes.
