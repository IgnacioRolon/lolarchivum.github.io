We were able to follow up with some of the requests, but not nearly all of them. \n\nWe're coming back to ask the same question, but we'll do our best to go more in-depth with each of your ideas and fully explore these suggestions. We'll, of course, take a look back at our [previous thread](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/B58BENiR-lets-discuss-the-boards), but feel free to re-post any of your ideas in this thread. \n\nWith that being said, our highest priorities going into the next year are to re-vamp the structure of the Boards, in terms of what sub-boards we have, and what the guidelines for the sub-boards will be. We want to make sure topics have a clear place to go, such that you can expect to find certain threads in certain sub-boards; we also want to ensure that higher quality threads are hitting the Boards front-page, while also giving a space for individuals who just want to fire off a quick rant. \n\nWe're hoping to fire off a lot of changes in a short period of time, so thank you in advance for your time, feedback, and helping to improve the Boards.\n\n{{sticker:sg-kiko}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2018-12-14T21:24:57.587+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Be able to directly post images through Boards instead of linking it!","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2018-12-14T21:30:45.074+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well originally it was removed due to security issues.

But there is clear moderation bias in that board.\n\nModeration favors the side with \"popular\" view points and opinions. While it opposes the side with \"unpopular\" view points and opinions. \n\nThe \"popular\" view points/opinions is that toxicity is bad and should be punished etc. Basically if you have the opposite of that opinion, the mods have a more chance of moderating you and removing your post.\n\nBias is also shown of what kind of post they allow. There are *constant* post that belittle, insult, and just outright bully someone that has made a thread about their punishment. This clearly breaks the \"don't be a jerk\" rule mind you, but mods just allow those post to stay because they have the \"your toxic you deserve it\" view point.\n\nThere are also post that outright spam that never get removed. I'm talking about people that post this: {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} /{{champion:33}}  and *nothing* else. This clearly breaks the \"spamming and trolling\" universal rule mind you, but mods never remove it.\n\nLook, all im asking is for mods to have the same standards of moderation for someone regardless of their opinion or view points. I've talked to TheDjinn about most of these issues a few months ago. I just hope something can be done.\n\nBtw if you want examples of the kind of post im referring to, just ask and ill copy and paste post that i believe broke the rules.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cetri","date":"2018-12-14T21:15:08.391+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Can you guys maybe treat r****d like you do so many other words?
