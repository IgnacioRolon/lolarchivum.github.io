The system is rigged and broke, specially the last month.\nAnd if you would check the games before  had a winning streak of 8 games , perhaps the fucked programming adds up and punches you then back so u stay at a 51 % win rate. fuck this OLD MMR System which is a lame copy of all the old shit what makes  mmog just stupid.\n\n10 years later and RITO  still builds on top of their programming patching shit instead of fixing it with a massive overhaul, exactly the same shit microsoft does since they exist. \n\ni win 8to9 out 10 games for placements and end up in bronze 2 while i was s1 WTF\n\ni guess you both commenters don't know anything about the way the MMR system works, instead of flaming and assuming do your homework and see how rigged it is. The same trick as the Traffic lights to get you into paying a ticket while simple reducing the ticker for the yellow light. keep the cannon fodder around 51% and the stars can play without getting bothered.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazyBear1987","date":"2016-09-30T09:02:39.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you give an reference to you anger? what happened?","replies":[{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2016-09-30T09:27:16.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrazyBear1987,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=ofQntFOk,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-30T09:02:39.950+0000)\n>\n> Can you give an reference to you anger? what happened?\n\nLook at his matc history, he is feeding his ass off every game with illaoi.
