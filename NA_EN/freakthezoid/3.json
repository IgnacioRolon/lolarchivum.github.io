It is a decidedly average score.  Remember, S ranks are far above the average (I am decently sure average is A) but S is like top 90% performance on the champion.  You were literally below every metric except deaths, and had 1 more CS.  You had less deaths, but since it is ARAM, that particular metric doesn't count for as much.\n\n\nIf you can't show me your score is great, there is no reason for you to be grumpy, and waste the message board space just to get a lame comment out...\n\nEDIT: Just in case you can't find it yourself which seems likely.\n\nAverage Ziggs Game Stats\nPhysical Damage: 979 (3.01%)\nMagic Damage: 31242 (95.90%)\nTrue Damage: 356 (1.10%) \nTotal Damage Dealt: 32579\n  \nTotal Damage Taken: 16312\nHealing: 2201\n\nKills: 10.47\nDeaths: 6.54\nAssists: 21.89\nLargest Kill Spree: 3.72\nGold: 12,592\nCS: 59.41\nJungle CS: 0.00\nEnemy Jungle: 0.00\nAnalyzed: 291,859","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"fReAkThEzOiD","date":"2018-06-06T19:58:53.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"....if i understand correct then this is totally stupid. \n\nSince the stats don't include the if case of the 9 other individual champs.\nBeing described by an average of champ usage with no context to time played and stats acquired in this particular game, is close to discrimination.\nIf this is league game then my stats should mirror my experience progress with means of overall personal player stats.\n\nNo wonder the MMR is trash and everyone screams about elo hell in ranked....same nonsense metric observation philosophy thru out the whole system.\ngetting boxed in with \"other\" peoples progress, reminds me of the maraud school system thru out the world....sick\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"KZ Engel","date":"2018-06-05T21:04:58.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"grading is based on _average_ performance OF THAT ***SPECIFIC*** CHAMPION at similar MMR (in the same role, in SR). performance and grading of _other_ champions has nothing to do with it.\n\n8 is a very low number for aram ziggs ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2018-04-01T20:54:54.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its ziggs in aram, the average is probably just as high, so beeing over average is like stupid high levels.","replies":[]}]}
