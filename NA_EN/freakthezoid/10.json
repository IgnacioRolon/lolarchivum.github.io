They exist in many forms and forums and are blessed and cursed with infinite youth of naive childhood.\r\n\r\nWe thank you, for listening, guidance and forgiveness. Judgement is the voice only mother nature speaks, with \r\npassion, with patience, caring love and embracing warmness.\r\n\r\nMother, you understand the sprouting, the pain of growth; hug us until we fall asleep, my bothers and sisters are tortured by themselves with chains of depression, unmotivated, not dealed with, left alone and in disbelieve.\r\n\r\nOur tears are not of pain then of joy; mother entered my room which I so dearly missed while walking on the field of Justice on my own.\r\n\r\nGuide us to self healing, to learn how to forgive, each other and myself, to grow as family as one, in your Kingdome..","replies":[]}
