If you guys dont understand to solve this issues - then you have to live with the custom skin tools which i have to promote since your customer service is respectless und unpolite !\n\nFYI i accidentaly bought a rune page with rp and asked for refund so i can buy a skin (what would i BUY ELSE WITH RP ?) but the customer support insist that i used my 3 tokes and will not get a refund - the tokens were used in season 2 when i was under lv 30, there was no faq so far on this topic until i started asking for help.. i spend over 300 $ on this game -  to not take care of this is outrages - SOLVE IT.\n\nuntil then here a nice video of a custom skin program \n\nyoutube.com/embed/mwBt0QmQlfc","replies":[]}
