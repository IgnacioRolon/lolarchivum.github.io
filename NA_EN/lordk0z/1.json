Cho's lvl 1-5 is just plain weak with mana costs WAY TOO HIGH and too long of cd's on abilities to be viable in many toplane matchups which is where they seem to be pushing him with the changes to ult. The payoff of his better ult hardly changes that. Sion just really suffers from not being tanky enough without items and tons of stacks from his w shield for killing minions and stuff.

Sion to be tankier early on (maybe better base shield strength but less %hp scaling on shield? to make him tankier early on); cho to be able to cast more than 3 abilities in 15 sec without going oom.
