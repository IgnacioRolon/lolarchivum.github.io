I didn't point the word \"like\" for no reason, this means that i am not wishing somebody something bad to happen, i'm also not encouraging them to suicide or being disrespectful. It's just a the same as telling your crush or agirl you like that you would LIKE to have sex with her, which doesnt mean that you wish her to get raped or that you're calling her a filthy slut :).","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-12-30T21:15:55.877+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you should think about just playing a video game, and not trying to find stupid loopholes for the code of conduct.","replies":[{"poster":"JustNeeo","date":"2019-12-30T21:17:49.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GatekeeperTDS,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jAM3KPrV,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-12-30T21:15:55.877+0000)\n>\n> Maybe you should think about just playing a video game, and not trying to find stupid loopholes for the code of conduct.\n\nBut why if that's the funniest part of this game?","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-12-30T21:19:34.081+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are plenty of ways to be funny without trying to (and failing to) be clever.","replies":[{"poster":"JustNeeo","date":"2019-12-30T21:20:21.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GatekeeperTDS,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jAM3KPrV,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2019-12-30T21:19:34.081+0000)\n>\n> There are plenty of ways to be funny without trying to be clever.\n\nThere are none for me, and how is that \"trying to be clever\"?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cind3rkick","date":"2019-12-30T20:46:58.730+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"thats still a death threat I believe...\n\nbest play it safe","replies":[{"poster":"JustNeeo","date":"2019-12-30T20:51:18.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cind3rkick,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jAM3KPrV,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-12-30T20:46:58.730+0000)\n>\n> thats still a death threat I believe...\n> \n> best play it safe\n\n\nSo would telling somebody that you'd like to have sex with them be a rape threat?","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-12-30T21:01:57.434+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"There is a difference between.\n\n\"I would like to have sex with you.\"\n\nAnd\n\n\"I would like to rape you.\"\n\nBoth can be considered sexual harassment and one if more threatening.","replies":[{"poster":"JustNeeo","date":"2019-12-30T21:07:31.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Imperial Pandaa,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jAM3KPrV,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-12-30T21:01:57.434+0000)\n>\n> There is a difference between.\n> \n> \"I would like to have sex with you.\"\n> \n> And\n> \n> \"I would like to rape you.\"\n> \n> Both can be considered sexual harassment and one if more threatening.\n\nFirst \"I would like to have sex with you.\" can't be considered as a sexual harassment?\n\nBut also, what the fuck are you actually talking about?

Just wondering, I have no idea how old you are, but I could very easily get fired for sexual harassment if I told the females I worked with that I would like to have sex with them. You may be surprised to learn that real life is much different from internet culture where you get to decide what is what. When you get a job, everyone else decides for you what is considered sexual harassment. So i wouldnt be so loose with what you think \"cant\" be considered sexual harassment. Youll see.
