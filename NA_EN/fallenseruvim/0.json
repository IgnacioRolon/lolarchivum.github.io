What say you now? The champion has no good build path, low dmg, can&#039;t reach max AS, Can&#039;t exceed 50% crit without giving entirely up on defensive items entirely, and cannot reach high AD ratios, and cannot build any pen whatsoever.  Kog is in a terrible state without any compensation after the revert.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-09-28T05:40:04.135+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"People are a) also relearning how to play him, and b) Riot mentioned they were going to keep close tabs on him for a while.","replies":[{"poster":"FallenSeruvim","date":"2016-09-28T08:32:08.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"No one is learning how to play him. Everyone knows how to play him and understands the ONLY build path available for him.  The game has changed too much for the old Kog to work.  All of his items have been nerfed since the days of the \"reverted\" Kog doing well.  The meta has changed, Adc's received compensation for the changing meta to allow them to function better.  Revert Caitlyn and see how well she performs in this meta?  Revert MF and see how well she performs in this meta, revert Trist and see how well she performs in this meta.  See where I'm going with this?  Revert any changed ADC and see how well they do in this meta.  Kog got no compensation for the revert.  Only left with is useless ult along with the loss of crit on TrinForce to make it even a harder early game for Kog.  \n\nI'm not qqing, I am bringing light to this because I see absolutely no workings in the PBE for Kog.  It is blatantly obvious how grossly under performing he is and feels. \n\nI was waiting for a little bump for Yorik because he is lacking a few blatant things as well, yet nothing in the works on the PBE.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2016-09-28T13:34:43.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's back to being a late game oriented champion, if you bothered, you'd see his winrate increases with game length.

They threw old Kog back into a heavily snowbally meta with people stacking tons of flat armor pen which means Kog is free kills early and mid. He's too risky of a pick to justify taking him for a late game that almost never is going to happen. His build path has been nerfed and for some reason they didnt change his W mana cost back to 0. So its not really even a revert because he still has a nerfed Ult and a nerfed W.","replies":[{"poster":"Cipse","date":"2016-09-28T07:23:28.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone remembers that W costed no mana\n\nNo-one remembers that:\nQ costed 60 mana, instead of 40\nQ had a shorter range\nQ gave 5% less attack speed at all levels\nQ gave 8% less armor and MR shred at all levels","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-09-28T08:45:56.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Q was also targeted.","replies":[{"poster":"Cipse","date":"2016-09-28T12:57:47.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm talking about how Kog was back at 5.22 in comparison to now, since the revert is of the 5.22 W mechanic changes.
