Another kind summoner has inspired me to make a post and give my opinion on what&#039;s going on. I&#039;m no one important in the community, just another player who&#039;s been here for a bit. I&#039;ve seen some crazy stuff happen on the Rift and up to this point it&#039;s been one heck of a ride so far.\n\nAs someone who started S2 and has played consistently since S3, and loved every minute of S3-S5, in my honest opinion League had gotten stale shortly after that. Almost to the point of unplayable. I think a lot of the long time veterans are experiencing some game fatigue. We came from a time when league was just in it&#039;s toddler stages. It was like the wild west. The game was all over the place. Anyone who started before that remember dodge runes? Or unique item passive stacking?  \n\n  I see people talking about how great S3-S5 was and while I completely agree, it wasn&#039;t the Utopia some  people make it out to be. Deathfire grasp, feral flares, no answer for a split pushing Udyr that spiraled out of control just from farming, or a Kha&#039;zix that goes in 1v5 and manages to escape seemingly untouched.  Vaynes and Lucians beating people into the ground without mercy. Lee Sins so evasive they could be considered paranormal and stickier than sidewalk gum on blacktop in mid August. Okay Lee is still like that. Those are very isolated incidents sure. But I and many others have played this game religiously since then, and as dedicated players many of us seemed to find issues with every change since that time. \n\n  Now instead of single champs and items causing bedlam, we have whole roles added to the mix. Remember just a short while ago adcs couldn&#039;t do anything because assassin&#039;s ruled the rift. And when tanks and juggernauts were wreaking havoc no one could answer them. Now adcs have gone off the rails shooting anything with a health bar and it&#039;s utter chaos again. \n\n   Yes, I sympathize that this isn&#039;t the game we started on. But every year and every patch we&#039;ve overcome and adapted. The new runes and BE is very new and very foreign to us, but fresh and exciting none the less. While things don&#039;t look quite as bright; preseason has always been a time to test these things, voice our concerns and give them a chance to start the next season off on the right foot. Although, sometimes, not always in the right direction. \n\n  No one enjoys a constant stomping or constantly being stomped. 15-20 minute games that are won by minutes 5-10 aren&#039;t fun either. Right now, that&#039;s what league is. And I understand why some grizzled vets and those going through a mid league crisis want to leave, and that&#039;s okay. But some of us are going to stay and that&#039;s okay too. \n\n  Say what you will about either party, but I&#039;m nothing if not hopeful. Hopeful that maybe sooner rather than later: game averages go up a smidge, that a mid/late game comeback can be a thing again, that towers are a legitimate threat when making the decision to dive, and/or the &quot;meta&quot; isn&#039;t ruled by one role, because one champ metas we can handle. I&#039;m not just hopeful that maybe one day I&#039;ll get to experience league like I had back when I was a young summoner but I&#039;m excited to see where S8 goes. I&#039;m excited that there are changes so large and new that they can frustrate and even scare me a bit. For me personally, it&#039;s like logging in for the first time all over again. \n  \n  I realize this puts me in the minority and I&#039;m just one guy, who at one point really loved this game, even if I&#039;m not very good. And I find it refreshing that once again I kind look forward to League after a long day. For me this is the closest it&#039;s felt to the first time in a long long time. \n\nI don&#039;t spend a whole lot of time on the boards and honestly not sure how I got here today, but if you can remain civil, I&#039;d like to hear what what other summoners think.","replies":[]}
