It&#039;s like I can&#039;t play more than 2 games at a time for some reason.  Even when I win, after the game I just feel like next game I&#039;m going to lose because of the assortment of champions that are excruciatingly painful to play against.  In champ select I have to beg for shyvana skarner and vayne to be banned, and that still leaves a lot of champs I wish could be banned but I can&#039;t ban, and when the enemy picks them I instantly feel dread in my stomach and feel like I should dodge.  I want to play but am so worried that if I hop into champ select the enemy will pick vayne and then the game is ruined, so i just start flipping through boards or youtube or watch another episode of Rizzoli and Isles.  I don&#039;t know why, I&#039;ve never felt this way about League in the year I&#039;ve been playing up until now.  I just wanted to know if anyone else felt the same.","replies":[]}
