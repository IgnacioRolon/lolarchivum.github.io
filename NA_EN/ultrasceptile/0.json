Zed, FIzz, Akali, Lee Sin, Talon, Master Yi.  But I&#039;ve never had a problem playing against these champs that much.  When I get dived to my inhib turret by a Master Yi three shotting me, I don&#039;t mind an awful much.  I get a little pissed, but I don&#039;t want to quit league or anything.   \r\n\r\nWhat I do hate are mages, like Anivia, Orianna, Ziggs, Syndra, Veigar.  The first three play passive as fuck during laning.  They just sit like right in front of their tower waveclearing everything, and even if by slight chance they push the wave and you gank them, and get your laner ahead, it&#039;s still hard as fuck to win because whenever you try to siege they&#039;re just gonna clear the wave in three seconds while if THEY get ahead in teamfights they&#039;re gonna shred your entire team with the aoe.  Syndra is not as much of a bitch after DFG was removed so I won&#039;t talk about her, but I swear to god I never understood why people think Veigar&#039;s bad.  You literally just sit in lane farming with Q, if someone ganks you just throw your E and run back.  By the time you get 3 items you should be doing 80%+ of an adc&#039;s health with just your ult.  I also never understood why Veigar was called an antimage when he literally just oneshots everything that&#039;s not a tank with just one ability, and I especially never thought why something like that was weak.  &quot;oh well hurrdurr they&#039;re so much more immobile!  They get focused easily!  Well?  So does Zed, he has mobility but it&#039;s not like you cannot CC lock him down.  Watch where he runs and watch his shadows.  Sure he can run away better, but you know, at least he&#039;s not spamming shit every 2 seconds to do 70% of someone&#039;s health with just Q W, cough ori cough.\r\n\r\ntl;dr  In my opinion, mages are much more cancerous than assassins ever were.\r\n\r\nIF you think my opinion on balance is completely wrong because I&#039;m silver, well, this isn&#039;t an opinion on balance.  I just find it so much more painful to play against mages over assassins, who in my opinion offer more playmaking ability, but also much more counterplay.","replies":[]}
