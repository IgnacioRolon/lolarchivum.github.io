After 8 minutes have passed, The Chariot is delivered to both corners of Morde's fountain, which he can pick up after Channeling  for a second. Doing so grants him one cast of The Ride Majestic within the next minute, as well as 40% bonus movement speed out of combat prior to the ability being cast, after which The Chariot goes on cooldown before being delivered again.\r\n\r\nQ:\r\nLight 'Em Up\r\nMordekaiser swings his mace to launch a blast of energy at the target area, dealing magic damage to enemies hit. The blast reveals the area as it travels and for 6 seconds afterwards, as well as all affected enemies. ((TARGET RANGE: 825, EFFECT RADIUS: 250, COST: 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 Health, COOLDOWN: 8; Magic Damage: 75 / 120 / 165 / 210 / 255 (+ 50% bonus AD) (+ 50% AP) ))\r\n\r\nW:\r\nMarch for Revenge: Mordekaiser dashes to the target location, destroying the ground and leaving up to 3 desolated patches along his path, depending on the distance traveled, lasting for 2 seconds. Any enemies that remain in the area are dealt magic damage every 0.25 seconds. ((Magic Damage Per Tick:  15 / 22.5 / 30 / 37.5 / 45 (+ 10% AP) TARGET RANGE: 600, COLLISION RADIUS: 100, SPEED: 650, COST: 100 HP, COOLDOWN: 20 / 19 / 18 / 17 / 16 ))\r\n\r\nThe Ride Majestic: Morde rides his chariot to the target location with extreme speed,  unstoppable and knocking aside all enemies hit 500 units and leaving behind a burning trail for 5 seconds. Any enemies that remain in the area are slowed by 90% and dealt 7.5 − 25 (based on level) (+ 37.5% bonus AD) (+ 5% AP) magic damage every 0.25 seconds, for a maximum of 150 − 500 (based on level) (+ 750% bonus AD) (+ 100% AP) magic damage. Casting The Ride Majestic instantly resets March for Revenge's cooldown. ((TARGET RANGE: 1800, COLLISION RADIUS: 100, SPEED: 1500 ))\r\n\r\nE:\r\nMachine Gun: Morde removes his helmet and and unleashes his terrifying gaze in a cone in front of him for 4 seconds, dealing equal parts physical and magic damage every quarter-second and reducing his targets' armor and magic resistance each tick, stacking up to 8 times, lingering for 2 seconds after last being damage. ((Mixed Damage Per Quarter Second: 7.5 / 10.63 / 13.75 / 16.88 / 20 (+ 10% bonus AD) Resistance Reduction Per Tick: 1 / 1.38 / 1.75 / 2.13 / 2.5; EFFECT RADIUS: 600, ANGLE: 35°, COST: 50 HP, COOLDOWN: 16 ))\r\n\r\nMachine Gun does not hinder Mordekaiser's actions and its cone remains in front of him as he moves.\r\n\r\nR:\r\nBlitzkrieg: Passive: Mordekaiser stores a charge of Blitzkrieg periodically, up to a maximum of 7 at once, and starts with 7 missiles every time he respawns.\r\n\r\nActive: Mordekaiser swings his mace and sends a trapped soul in the target direction that explodes if it hits an enemy, dealing magic damage in an area. ((Magic Damage: 90 / 115 / 140 (+ 15 / 45 / 75% AD) (+ 20% AP); TARGET RANGE: 1225, EFFECT RADIUS: 75 / 150, SPEED: 1950, COST: 20 HP + 1 Missile, STATIC COOLDOWN: 2, RECHARGE: 12 / 11 / 10 ))\r\n\r\nVengeful One: Every third trapped soul Mordekaiser flings is a Vengeful One, dealing 100% increased damage and increasing its explosion radius.\r\n\r\nBe sure to let me know what you guys think! :3","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2019-04-19T23:46:48.279+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was painful to read  especially considering im pretty sure thats  just Corki's kit","replies":[]},{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-04-20T01:12:47.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When Riot already did the job for you but you didn't get the memo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FyreWall","date":"2019-04-20T01:10:59.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-04-19T23:31:36.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just by the way, but Morde's official rework is almost done (to be released sometime this year, I think).","replies":[]}]}
