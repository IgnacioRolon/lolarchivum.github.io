You guys seems to have a good grasp on what is weak and what is strong in TFT. However you guys seem to not understand why something is weak or strong, because of this many or your nerfs and buffs miss the mark.\r\n\r\nLet's take some changes from the last patch and i'll explain why the changes aren't what is needed.\r\n\r\n>Miss Fortune\r\n    Ability Damage: 800/1250/1700 ⇒ 900/1300/1700\r\n\r\nThis Unit doesn't need more damage. In fact her damage and overall stats are already on the strong side. The problem with this unit is her AI and until her AI is fixed it doesn't really matter how strong or weak she is. If you want to make MF a unit people want you need to make the following change\r\n\r\nMiss Fortune\r\nNo Longer targets her Ulti off the closet unit. Instead she now copies {{champion:136}} 's AI and target the furthest unit away from her.\r\nMiss Fortune cancels her Unti if it hasn't done damage in the last .5 seconds. \r\n\r\n>Brawler\r\n>Bonus Health: 300/600/1000 ⇒ 250/500/900\r\n\r\nThe Bonus health isn't what is causing brawlers too be OP. Brawler buff is often worse then the Knight buff, yet the amount of people playing Knights is significantly less. The reason for this is the Brawler buff isn't what causes Brawlers to be OP. It's the fact 3 Brawlers {{champion:53}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:254}} have nutty damage for being tanky champs with CC. If you want Brawlers to be balanced you need to lower the spell damage of these champions or you need to make a more Meta change to how Spell damage scaling if you want brawlers to keep their high base damages.  As long as {{champion:254}} does similar damage to {{champion:136}} while being Tanky and having CC brawlers will continue to be OP.","replies":[{"poster":"TreeHugger Simon","date":"2019-08-22T14:54:07.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda sad tho that the whole balancing team is now behind tft rather than summoner's rift...
