Completely removes the flanking tactics on many of the champions I liked to play.\n\nIf the enemy team rolls a better teamcomp, you 100% lose immediately, and there's no map objectives or splitpushing or any other way to play around them except run straight into their face and die.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Charmy Bird","date":"2020-01-08T21:01:18.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me too tbh.
