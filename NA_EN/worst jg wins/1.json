Honestly speaking Yuumi is a _buff_ and not a champion; her goal isnt to support really. Its to empower someone already doing well to do _better_.  Thats kind of why she has such a low win rate... Shes the embodiment of the ardent meta. \n\nHer Q needs to be changed. With that, i think she'l fall into a good place. Turning it into a mark would help her tremendously i feel ; drop the base damage on it (give it 1 damage so it procs spell effects though...), and turn it into a mark that grants her carry attack speed AND procs other mark effects. \nWith that, \"yuumi counterplay\" becomes \"dodge the skillshot\". Plus, her E wouldnt be overloaded to heck and back.\nI also feel it could be interesting to make it so Yuumi can \"miss\" and mark terrain for a long duration. If she passes her projectile through the terrain it would refresh the duration of the projectile (and possibly turn it into an empowered version that slows again?). This could add even more counterplay by making the ability more complex, allowing you to predict and position accordingly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
