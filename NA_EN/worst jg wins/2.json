Right now the only recent removals I can find were either a sarcasm thread which was better suited to General Discussion and an actual spam thread that consisted only of \"lol\" in title and body.\n\nDo you have any links to these thread so that I can better evaluate them?\n\nIn general, we do remove low effort posts that do not provide any aspects for discussion (i.e. please nerf) as well as rants which merely express frustration about a subject (i.e. Yasuo is OP wtf Rito?  His kit is complete bullshit!  Remove the crits from him now and gut his windwall).  When we make decisions on moving content to Rant or removing for low effort, we generally consider how readers are intended to respond to the content.  If a thread has really only \"yeah he OP\" or \"nah he's not\" as responses, it's probably low effort.  Gameplay isn't really the sub-board for complaining, but rather discussion and suggestions for how to change things for the better as well as receive advice from the community.\n\nHope that helps clarify a bit","replies":[]},{"poster":"Syrile","date":"2019-11-10T00:13:00.262+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":6,"body":"It is happening with a lot of different things.\nI posted a thread about the Rules and how they are vague and give incentive to abuse them and it was instantly downvoted of course.\nBut the thing is.. there is pretty clear misuse of power (I was targeted specifically after I disagreed with a mod that posted incorrect information).\nAnd since then, I have had a thread deleted and a post deleted.\nDespite both actually being more valid than over 70% of what is on the forums right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Elderly Woman","date":"2019-11-10T17:17:24.165+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot directly asked me to post in Player Behavior.

While I can see that you were trying to discuss what to do when players play poorly in your game and were suggesting there be an option to report bad matchmaking to Riot, there is a bit of confusion with the whole \"wet cardboard rank\" part.\n\nPlayer Behavior is for discussing in game violations, bans, the rules of League, the Terms of Use, and the IFS.  In general, matchmaking discussion goes more into General Discussion.  I will be bringing it up to the team if there is a disconnect between us and Riot Support.","replies":[{"poster":"Elderly Woman","date":"2019-11-19T01:52:39.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It originated in Player Behavior, and turned into a GREAT discussion, that was subsequently ruined by Riot.
