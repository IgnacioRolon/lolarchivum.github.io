{"poster":"NewBie22719","date":"2017-03-08T17:48:13.669+0000","title":"I got permanently suspended(Deserved?!?!?!?)","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello! \r\nSo as I was looking back at my old account,  I saw this support request that I had sent.\r\nI was just wondering if you guys think this is a deserved permaban.\r\n\r\nI was being a bit negative, till 14th day suspend, but when the suspend ended, I was not being toxic for 1 month. It only took 1 game(Literally 1 game) to get me permanently suspended. I was not even being toxic in that game, just having a bad game. \r\n\r\nThe Perma ban was 11 months ago, and there is the same request  I had sent also with chat proof.\r\n\r\n&#039;&#039;So today I got permanently suspended. I was playing a game, where I ended 2/12/0. Pretty bad I know, I was playing my champion which I am usually doing fine(average 3 deaths). I got reported by all of my team. When I asked what for they never said a reason. I felt really bad about lol community, team was calling me &#039;&#039;tard&#039;&#039;,&#039;&#039;kid&#039;&#039; and etc. I never sweared, I never flamed anyone. Even I said &#039;&#039; shaco can you help us at bot&#039;&#039; And he answered &#039;&#039;stfu lucian&#039;&#039;. This is not my first ban. I used to be negative, by just giving up when we still could win, of course people did not like that, so they reported me. I agree, It was understandable that I got punished, I was tilting sometime, but I never sweared, I never did hate speech. I got 10 chat restricts, then 25 chat restricts, then 14 days ban. I knew I have to be really positive. I was really changing my self. Being a better person. I was doing my best, not getting bans, getting up in the ladder and doing really fine. But I have to admit there was some bad games I made, doing bad scores and etc. Of course My team manages to report me, for having a bad game. Also I agree that it&#039; s best just to shut up and mute these people, but It&#039; s really hard for me to not answer. I just do not want to be a person, who get&#039; s offended, because of having a bad score. This game I got reported, I was trying to sustain positive environment, but my team was still flaming me, still spamming this &#039;&#039;surrender button&#039;&#039;. \r\nLeague is my life. I have been playing this game for 4 years. I really do not know what to do now. I never had any bans on this account, never really had punishments on this account. Just last 3 months I don&#039;t know why I got reported and then punished. \r\nIs there really anything I can do, to get my account back? I got a lot of skins, a lot of time invested in that account, I just do not want to get it lost. \r\nI really feel sad now, and I just want to know If there&#039; s anything that can be done. I would do anything to have this account back.\r\n\r\nThis is the only game proof, they gave me. \r\nIt&#039; s strange, that there is text&#039;&#039;Because a player-triggered review found your in-game comms extremely inflammatory and offensive, your account&#039; s been permanently suspended.&#039;&#039; Because I do not believe, I was toxic.&#039;&#039;\r\n\r\nGame 1 \r\nNewBie22719: shaco u do early ganks?
