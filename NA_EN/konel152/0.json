So you will often get unranked players in your bronze 1 to silver 4 promos.\n\nSilver is between 1100-1500 elo\n\nIt's just one of the many things that makes it harder for players climbing the ranks the first time. The same thing will happen at the top of gold to get into plat, you will get players who are sitting at around 2000+ Elo that got dropped down to 1500 for not playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2015-10-16T18:00:35.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because unraked is considered average, and average is silver.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2016-01-13T14:27:56.732+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"... because unranked elo = silver elo.\n\nLet that sink in.
