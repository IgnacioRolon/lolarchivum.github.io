Now that I have you here, thanks for coming though...\r\n\r\nTLDR; asking people to ward or not contest a baron/drag 3v5 when behind is not toxic. Telling people they are idiots when they ignore 3+ times your simple request to play more safely vs fed enemies or WARD when they push is not toxic. People who are &quot;rude&quot; or &quot;toxic&quot; and &quot;reported&quot; for doing telling their teammates these things are not toxic -- you people who report someone as &quot;toxic&quot; for speaking logic are toxic and NEED TO STOP. Whether something was said nicely or rudely doesn&#039;t justify you ignoring solid advice/logic.\r\n\r\nDear ranked community,\r\nIf you are not bronze 3 or below, you should know what a ward is. You should know how to do simple things like using your trinkets - especially if you are going to shove the enemy in and force fights by their tower or in the middle of the lane. You should know it isn&#039;t worth trying to 5v5 at dragon or 3v5 contest when you fed 3 of the enemies; rotate to another lane and kill a tower or sneak a baron instead of fighting at drag, losing 3 people to maybe kill 1 person and giving the enemy a free baron or inhib tower push cuz you have 3 people dead. Again, your teammates shouldn&#039;t have to tell you this based on your apparent rank. If they do tell you this, you should LISTEN. They don&#039;t have to tell you nicely - you should already know - telling you nicely or asking nicely is a BONUS. If you go crash a car into someone, does the other person say, &quot;hey can you please drive more carefully?&quot; or do they say something more like &quot;why did you run into me you idiot?&quot;? Same thing for league - you make a stupid play after teammates specifically tell you not to do something (like 3v5 contest drag when behind) or ask you to do something (like use wards if you are going to push) and your teammates have no reason to have to be nice about reminding you after you ignore them the first time. And people being RUDE about something gives you no right to ignore them AGAIN if the advice is solid. Ignoring solid advice because it was said rudely is as dumb as jumping off the edge of the Grand Canyon and dying because someone rudely told you to stay away from the edge. Wow, that sounds really stupid -- jumping off a canyon doesn&#039;t it? So why do people essentially do this in game and think it is ok? Cuz after ignoring solid advice you should ALREADY HAVE KNOWN in the first place for 3 times and finally getting told rudely, you use this as an excuse to keep making dumb decisions and think it is justified because your FEELINGS are hurt by them telling you RUDELY?\r\nYou know what? You ignoring the other persons&#039; advice 3 times when they asked nicely hurt THEIR FEELINGS. You throwing away any chance to come back and win hurt THEIR FEELINGS. And then people on your team who were doing OK take your side as you continue to int the game away instead of backing up the person who offered solid advice that COULD have given your team a comeback. And your teammate(s) who were just doing Ok join you in harassing the player who is giving the solid shotcalls and advice that is your one hope of making a comeback. You all spam &quot;reported&quot;, you ask the enemy team to report him/her/them in post-game when YOU LOSE (cuz u didn&#039;t listen) to report them for toxicity. Telling people to ward is not toxic. Telling people they are idiots for dying 7 times in laning alone because they refuse to ward and keep shoving and fighting people they already fed 6 kills to is not toxic. The people shoving and not warding and feeding an impossible to overcome lead to the enemy team because they won&#039;t take solid advice IS TOXIC. Refusing to join a team in a 3v5 contest of dragon or a 1v5 attempt to stall baron vs a fed enemy team is NOT TOXIC. Refusing to rotate and take an alternate objective for free and spamming &quot;toxic&quot; &quot;reported&quot; to a teammate who has outplayed a 2v1 camp of his/her lane ALL GAME, asked nicely (and then rudely after ignored 3 times) for his feeding teammates to play more safely is toxic; he did nothing wrong and you are being very rude to him/her. You are not the only person with feelings in the game - get over your selfish pride and listen to sound logic. Get over your selfish pride and do what is best for the team. \r\n\r\nIf I&#039;m a 3/1/0 bruiser who outplays a 2v1 camp of his lane, I will gladly group and DIE EVERY FIGHT if it gives our team an advantage. I don&#039;t care if you are 10/2/1 or 0/3/0, I will die for you IF you have proven you are not an idiot. If you gave up 6+ kills in laning, kept playing agro and dying to ganks because you didn&#039;t listen to my simple request to ward; I will NOT group and die for you in teamfights. I will get on your case for refusing to group 4 and hold a tower while I try to carry your feeding ass as I splitpush 1v2. Because when you finally &quot;listen&quot; and play safe ff under tier 2 in a 2v1 or 1v0 lane and apply 0 pressure, I end up with 2 fed enemies and the 2 people I was outplaying all shoving in and tower diving me with no warning from all angles. And then you act like I&#039;m bad because I cannot 1v4 people who you fed? Lol. If I am trash because I cannot 1v4, then what does that make you if you couldn&#039;t avoid feeding them when they weren&#039;t ahead and you had a 2v2 or 1v1? Just stop and think about that. So next time a teammate asks you to play safer or at least ward your flanks if you are going to push, LISTEN instead of spamming &quot;toxic&quot; &quot;reported&quot; and ignoring. You will find yourself with fewer deaths, maybe more kills, more gold, higher level in game, and a teammate who is willing to die for you rather than one who will gladly watch you crash and burn for the 11th time.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-02T21:08:59.771+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":">Telling people they are idiots when they ignore 3+ times your simple request to play more safely vs fed enemies or WARD when they push is not toxic\n\nI've stopped reading after this. This is just stupid, insulting people that are doing badly is only gonna make them perform worst, even if only to spite you. If they didn't follow your lead when you are nice, they sure won't do it after you've insulted them. You'll accomplish nothing but make yourself feel better.\n\nPlus, newsflash, nobody is as good as they think they are, specially not in the heat of the moment. 9/10 times those simple and obvious requests are actually incredibly stupid on their own right. \n\nYou're placed with people of your own level. If your game knowledge really were that superior from your teammates that warrants you being the self appointed guru of the match, you wouldn't be placed in a game with them in the first place. \n\ntl;dr: get over yourself and learn some self control.","replies":[{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2017-03-02T22:03:21.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"newsflash: if they didn't listen the first 3 times, they ain't gonna listen and they already threw the game; they have already shown they are inting and don't care - telling them \"don't be idiots and force a 2v4 vs fed enemies\" vs \"pls ward if you are going to push\" - is the first one toxic? If you say that after 1 death or 2, maybe. If you say that because they die 6 times after you \"pls ward if you are going to push\", then obviously saying it nicely isn't helping. There is the 1% chance that people get it through their fat skull and actually listen to \"don't be idiots and force 2v4\".\n\nIn no sense is ASKING team or TELLING team to not 2v4 or 2v5 or whatever a BAD call or \"stupid on their own right\". That is the point. And yes, I am a macro guru post-laning phase at my level. Tell me, what diamond/master/challenger player WINS even 50% of games where they have 3+ teammates go 0/5/0, 1/6/3, 2/8/1 IN LANING PHASE ALONE? Answer: none. They lose just like you or me buddy. So when your placement games have 6/10 games with this and you should be going 50/50 if properly placed to begin with, then you get put way lower elo than you should be. As I said, I am gold tier player - pretty sure if I can WIN most lanes while being camped by enemy jungle, then I have a better clue what to do in SILVER or BRONZE than the teammate who FED 0/5/0 in a 1v1 or 2v2 or 3v2. Get over yourself and learn some humility and teamwork.\n\nWarding is free.\nI could be the worst bronze 5 player in the whole world and it makes no difference; if I say we shouldn't fight 3v5 at dragon when the enemy team is snowballed (and could win the fight even if it were 4v5) we should not fight - rank makes no difference on if a call makes sense. If it is logical, listen to it instead of acting like you know everything; if you were feeding in an even matchup by making dumb decisions, you do not know what is best for your team to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-02T23:45:25.304+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">newsflash: if they didn't listen the first 3 times, they ain't gonna listen\n\nWhich is exactly why saying anything at all in the first place is stupid. You're not going to accomplish anything with it, but you're risking making them play even worse. Not to mention the other people in the team might decide to jump in start typing instead of playing. \n\n>tell me, what diamond/master/challenger player WINS even 50% of games where they have 3+ teammates go 0/5/0, 1/6/3, 2/8/1 IN LANING PHASE ALONE?

Sometimes you lose because of them, sometimes you win because of them. Bad teammates don't affect your climb in anyway because statistically over several games in which you are the only constant  all that matters is your individual contribution. If you've played more than 50 games then you are at your own level. Stop thinking you're above your teammates, you're not. That's just being deluded.","replies":[{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2017-03-03T20:10:59.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"False. You can make statements which generally hold true all you like, but cannot know what it is like for each individual without viewing them specifically. I watch vods and twitch and see what diamond/master/challenger tops have to deal with. I pay attention to what my teammates have to deal with and THEIR kda's. When diamond/master/challenger players whine about getting camped, excuse their feeding on being camped, and play safe/passive because of being camped, I look at that and think... wow I face that level of camping or WORSE in over 50% of my games. And I still manage to pick up kills, feed less than them, and play more agro. So... you are wrong. I do more with less help than these streamers of much higher rank and think nothing of being camped in most games. As for my teammates... if I died as much as they REGULARLY do in 1v1 or 2v2 scenarios and died to ganks the way they do, I would literally go 0/10/2 in laning phase in 85% of my games. So if I am having a positive kda while being camped, explain to me how my teammates logically end up feeding when they have a 2v2 or 1v1 and get jungle help. Last time I checked with your \"balanced\" and \"you are in the propper elo\" philosophy, my teammates should be winning their lanes or at LEAST going even based on this scenario. But they are feeding harder than I can 1v2 snowball myself with 0 help. So... there are 2 issues. I shouldn't be winning a 1v2 - either I'm a smurf or my opponents are boosted. Secondly, my teammates who are getting jungle help and never getting ganked shouldn't be feeding 6+ kills in laning phase. Add to that the disgusting gap in general knowledge: micro, macro, rotations, etc. between opponents, myself, my teammates on a REGULAR basis and you are entirely wrong. If it were an odd game here and there, I would agree with you. But when it is well over 50% of games, stats don't lie.\n\nSee the video below -- watch the FULL THING. Now if you replace the warwick with a feeding selfish afk idiot and have my team be salty at me and never work together, this would be a typical game for me. Instead, my team actually LISTENS to LOGIC and doesn't cry \"toxic\" when I ask for simple stuff like not overextending or warding up jungle and flanks (when we push) as a TEAM. 95% of time, players would still try to do everything alone and would flame me for asking for something as illogical and \"toxic\" as defending and warding. So watch this, consider how differently the game would go given what I said, and tell me I should be able to singlehandedly carry if I didn't have good teammates this game who do the basic simple correct stuff even after feeding. Tell me how I should get this type of game regularly but with selfish idiots who report me for toxicity because I ask them to ward or not start 3v5's. Tell me how it is logical and everyone is at the correct rank if I can pull off a kda like that in laning phase when camped while getting 0 help and my bot and mid both go 0/4/1 or 0/4/0 (both adc and sup). Because that is not a balanced match. One side is very clearly having some boosted players or inting players.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAkW8wdIowM&feature=youtu.be","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mizuki Zahra","date":"2017-03-02T21:20:41.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya gotta live the people harassing you out of nowhere to take the attention off themselves its the worse and as a support/jungle main I get harassed for everything... yas goes 1v5 and dies its my fault wtf","replies":[{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2017-03-02T22:08:54.434+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I can live with some harassment, but I tilt when people who I put ahead take the side of the inting feeder and say they are going to report me for \"toxicity\".
