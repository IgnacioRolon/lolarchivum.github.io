I swear... how can you let this champ have such high winrate whenever his team wins the game? It&#039;s obvious to everyone he&#039;s too op. Like the only time he has a lower winrate is when you look at his overall winrate or winrate for games where his team loses. But doing that last one would be biased and underestimate him.","replies":[{"poster":"Gentleman Gems","date":"2018-09-12T00:09:52.025+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"_looking at first 2 comments_\n\nhttps://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/173/576/Wat8.jpg?1315930535","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-09-12T17:43:33.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gentleman Gems,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=zXVA7Vit,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-09-12T00:09:52.025+0000)\n>\n> _looking at first 2 comments_\n> \n> https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/173/576/Wat8.jpg?1315930535\n\nRight over their heads apparently haha.","replies":[{"poster":"Gentleman Gems","date":"2018-09-12T18:13:34.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But this is Memes and Games, the place where you go to make jokes.\nHow could a joke go over their heads when the place is meant for jokes?","replies":[{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2018-09-19T20:06:48.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:45}} is that a short joke?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-09-12T21:07:33.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because someone is talking about Yasuo and I would bet these people are Yasuo mains or something  of that nature.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-09-12T17:44:42.417+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There must be some conspiracy at Riot, and after this post I looked into it and Akali has a 100% WR when her team wins as well... we may have uncovered something big. 60% of the time it works every time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EmperorSacrael","date":"2018-09-11T17:54:52.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://champion.gg/champion/Yasuo/Middle\n\nHis winrate is in quite balance, but the reason for it is because how often you play yasuo vs yasuo","replies":[{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2018-09-19T20:05:23.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right...
