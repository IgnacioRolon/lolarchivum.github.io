I don&#039;t know I won&#039;t win until I try.\r\n\r\nOr another game - I was playing quinn top and saw a low hp enemy bard, so I flashed into a 2v5 with my jungler... and got deleted by their malz ult into mf ult and idk, some random damage from the other two members while bard ran away. Like, I was just trying to grab a kill on the bard who was 1 hit from dead - you can&#039;t fault me for diving in 2v5.\r\n\r\nOr... my third game. I died 1v1 to darius when he level 2 all-in killed me by popping ghost and flash and chasing me down the lane. I tried to flash away, but I still died. So I went back to lane, tried to kill him as level 2 irelia vs lvl 4 darius. I died. So then I tried to 1v1 him a third time lvl 4 irelia vs lvl 6 darius and I was even close to winning cuz he&#039;d stayed after killing me lvl 4, but 10 sec after my team started spam pinging me, his jg showed up and killed me with darius. So I immediately tp&#039;d back to the lane hit level 5 and tried to 1v1 cleaver, ninja tabi level 7 darius vs my level 5 boots of swiftness, doran blade, corrupting potion irelia... and he killed me again. I then spent 20 min farming top 1v0 while darius ran around killing my whole team and our mid inhib. I died every time the enemy 0/4/0 zed came top to duel me and farm the wave. I didn&#039;t get any towers. And I didn&#039;t come to teamfight even when we COULD have won a 5v5 off the back of my fed midlaner if only I&#039;d helped... because I needed farm. I even caught up in cs to the darius by the time they were destroying our nexus. So really I did a great job and it was my stupid team&#039;s fault for not camping darius all game and holding towers 5v4 vs a darius 3 levels and 2 items ahead of everyone else - they&#039;re why we lost. And did I mention how rude they were?\r\n\r\nBut most of all, I wasn&#039;t feeding or inting in any of those games because... I said I wasn&#039;t and the ~~intentional feeders~~ unlucky players on the boards like me making HONEST mistakes upvoted me. Pls upvote this and help me get all those toxic players crying &quot;inting&quot; banned - cuz they&#039;re mean and and and... they have no right to assume that I&#039;m inting just because I&#039;m 0/30/2. I have TWO assists - so I&#039;m CLEARLY trying and playing for the team. And just because I was only ganked ONE time and had counterpicked my lane opponent and gotten 20 ganks from my team doesn&#039;t mean I should win lane or not die ya know. I was just unlucky all those times. Just honest mistakes that somehow get me a bunch of toxic hate from my team... like telling me to &quot;group the fuck up&quot; or &quot;ward pls&quot; or &quot;hug tower and just farm please&quot;. Like I can realistically be expected to do those things. And like not doing them is going to cost us the game lol. What a bunch of toxic noobs.{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-21T02:50:32.548+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trash will trash.
