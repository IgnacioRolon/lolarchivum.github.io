I don&#039;t post regularly because like most of you I have a real job/school/not full-time streamer or anything. But I&#039;ve got 2 season&#039;s worth of content which should give you a decent amount of material for now. Renekton, cho&#039;gath, darius, kayle, leona, morgana, lulu, etc. Come see how to win with STRATEGY and MACRO. Learn new ideas for outplaying opponents and WINNING even if the enemy jungler pitches a tent in your lane some games.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t always bring out new and original stuff but here&#039;s a short list of a few things I&#039;ve innovated BEFORE Korea and BEFORE the pro&#039;s/streamers:\r\nmorgana support - yes LemonNation stole it from ME\r\n\r\nnautilus support - when Lemon was introducing the world to how op morg support was, I was already finding the next op support (back in the day)\r\n\r\ngrasp overheal cho&#039;gath top - first displayed in a pro match earlier this year in Korea (aside from me of course)... taken because the extra healing from cho gave him a shield to out-trade other tanks in laning phase and actually bully people in formerly even &quot;wet noodle&quot; fights\r\n\r\ntank/bruiser mordekaiser - the kind that 1v3&#039;s a fed zed and udyr... along with the malphite you smash all game and leaves them all flashing away for their lives (sadly this was before I started recording and the build is no longer possible... but I&#039;m not making this up)\r\n\r\ngrasp darius - destroy meta pick urgot... at least as high as gold elo; bonus, you can be mediocre at darius and still pull this off; the build isn&#039;t anything like you&#039;ve seen\r\n\r\nanti-teemo/shroom renekton - get rid of pesky shrooms... and nuke teemo at the same time\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t just build odd stuff for no reason. I build it because it works and... I know WHY it works. Having a meta build or new innovative build is nice and all. But if you don&#039;t know why it&#039;s good or bad and weaknesses it has, then you won&#039;t get the best use out of it or best adapt the build order as needed for your particular match.\r\n\r\nBeing able to press an advantage when your team is winning is nice. But what about those games where 4 teammates want to ff@15 even though you are fed or slowly winning out despite being 2v1 camped all laning phase? Knowing how to macro... when to force, when to concede, and how to trade up (come out ahead when both teams get SOMETHING) can turn &quot;unwinnable&quot; or &quot;lost&quot; matches with defeatist teammates into victories with teammates actually trying their best.\r\n\r\nCome check me out and learn how. Leave me comments or questions on YouTube or the boards and I&#039;ll be happy to get back to you in time. *I mostly play top, sup, and jungle so if you have adc or mid specific questions... I&#039;m not the best guy to ask. \r\n\r\n*second disclaimer - I don&#039;t win every game (wow really?). I don&#039;t carry every game. I&#039;m not actually a smurf. But even when you&#039;re losing on occasion... playing in the smartest way possible to ENABLE your team to help and carry you back to relevance is a huge advantage for your team vs someone who gives up and doesn&#039;t try their hardest or stops making smart plays. Most people in low elo don&#039;t know or recognize the difference between these and tend towards the latter - taking unnecessary risks while failing to exploit temporary advantages via macro or they simply give up and fall irreparably behind when their teammates might have had a chance to carry the game. I can help you better understand how to avoid this and make the most of your opportunities while minimizing unnecessary risks. Why take a 50/50 if you can take a 70/30 in your team&#039;s favor just as easily?","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-09-20T20:33:52.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jayce Counters Renekton?","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2018-09-20T21:57:13.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LeftyRaydy,realm=NA,application-id=EBBIvmVK,discussion-id=i69AOhZB,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-09-20T20:33:52.119+0000)\n>\n> Jayce Counters Renekton?\n\nHe does pretty hard.\n\nHe can actually just knockback renektons dash before it hits him, causes renekton to just sit there with no mobility, taking all of jayceâ€™s damage.\n\nBasically jayce has 100% of the initiative in that lane, and unless enemy jungler ganks or jayce does something stupid, he decides when fights will happen at all.\n\nOf course, this all depends on jayce holding his E","replies":[]},{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2018-09-20T22:41:31.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A jayce and renekton of equal skill beyond bronze favors the jayce. This can be further enhanced and made so it's nigh impossible for renekton to win the 1v1 at any point if the jayce builds bork; however, bork is not required and generally skipped as it only really helps jayce in the dueling and splitpushing.\n\nWhy does jayce win?\n1. Renekton is weaker vs ranged champs than vs melee's early game.\n2. Jayce has a strong early game too.\n3. Renekton e's cd is matched by that of jayce's knockback. This allows a good jayce to full melee combo the renekton when renekton dashes in... preventing renekton from getting off his full combo and forcing him to rely on e+q trades (no chance of landing w on jayce).\n4. Combo this with jayce's superior and STRONG poke early game and renekton loses every trade pre-6.\n5. Renekton is further forced into building more defensively rather than going tiamat or cleaver rush like he can vs most melee's... weakening his offensive trading power while jayce does not have to build defensively early on.\n\nHow does renekton look to win?\nYou can actually see these techniques if you watch some of my plays closely. \n\nFirst off, if the jayce is slow in doing his transformations when you dash in, you CAN land a full combo (e+w+aa+q+e away). \n\nRun jayce out of mana. If he's not a the best at jayce, he'll burn through his mana while you have no mana to worry about. Use your innate sustain and outlast him. Build up fury and use e+q trades to sustain and take small chunks off of him. \n\nAt 6 you can catch him off guard because you have a bigger power spike. Get him to around half hp and you can look to all-in 1v1 so long as you are also half hp or higher and have ult+flash. *don't do this otherwise or do it by his tower or he will likely kill you for it.\nThe idea is to quickly use double dash (or if he's slow at using his knockback, you can e+w+e) and get behind him. You follow this up with w+aa+q combo and of course your ult. Now jayce is trapped between YOUR turret+minions and YOU. He cannot infinitely kite back to safety and must get past you to get to safety. But to do so safely, he has to wait for cd's... which leaves you with your cd's up too. Because you don't have to e at him, he can't safely disengage you and avoid your w (stun)... leaving him basically dead since your ult gives you the hp advantage. You simply walk at him forcing him to kite further from the safety of his tower and kill him with autos and/or abilities if they come back off cd. I nearly pull this off around 5:10, but I mess up the \"orb walking\" and let him get behind me again. If I'd kept walking back towards his tower  to stay behind him after I stun, I would have forced out flash or gotten a kill easily.\n\nBait out his knockback and then use your full combo because he can no longer disengage you.\n\nThe ability to stick to jayce and the ability to out-last his burst (so you can get on him and start trading back with your superior health and equal burst) are your key tools to beating him. Hence why phage and ninja tabi are so good. If you try ghostblade or duskblade rush instead, you won't have the hp to deal with his harass and will get poked out of lane repeatedly or just killed and then you won't be on-par with him by level 6, so you won't be able to start looking for kills even though you're building more damage oriented. That's not the case with every matchup, but it is with this one... barring jungle intervention in your favor or extreme skill differences in your favor.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-09-20T22:51:19.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was just asking I went to Lol counters just too see he is not even top 10 counter. Renekton is so strong early so I cant imagine a good Renekton losing to a jayce. Just thinking to myself. Worst I see is maybe going even in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2018-09-20T23:08:58.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, there are better counters for sure. Anything with range and the ability to kite while not getting one-shot off his dash combo is good vs renekton in lane. Urgot, teemo, vlad, etc. But the thing about jayce that some others lack is that he can negate renekton's ability to do a full combo. Which means the renekton is playing on the DEFENSE unless his jungler comes top several times to snowball one side ahead. It's mostly a farm lane where renekton will generally be building a bit more defensive/tanky early on than you normally see from him.\n\nBut just 2 or so good jungle ganks can make it really one sided in EITHER guy's favor. If you've played against gnar... that match plays out in a very similar manner except you sub in gnar's hop for jayce's knockback. And of course the gnar will be tankier but have much less bursty poke.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
