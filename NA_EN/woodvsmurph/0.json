I can play 2...3 games in a row with no lag and about 60 ping. Then randomly get a game with 300+ ping. It's not some situation where I or someone else jumps on the internet and starts streaming 100 videos during that game. And when I check internet for lag, almost every single time I have no problem with internet itself... just with league. Can someone explain how this happens and how to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-18T23:07:02.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could be that there's an issue with the way that your network is connecting to League's servers.   Since it seems to be something that's only happening intermittently, the first step I'd recommend is to use our[ Log Reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) to analyze the network logs of games that you've had ping issues in.\n\nIt should be able to help identify the problem and give some common solutions.
