I play league since preseason 1 on this account and I always had to use third party programs to do item builds but since you guys implemented it I was so happy and I used it every day for all my theorycrafting and builds! Please help me out Porocles- go to scrum and talk about guys like me who can't imagine to play again with mods to client or other third party applications and spreadsheets for all custom fun builds. :/ I really need it!!!!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Odd8all","date":"2016-11-26T23:32:35.438+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I clicked on some beta thing and next next next so am I running what everyone has now or am I running some test thing because I to cannot locate the item sets and from the looks of it they are no longer available which basically breaks the game if so because you will have a few people that know all klling it while everyone else uses recommended build.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YoksaBoy","date":"2016-11-21T13:33:40.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pls set fast Item sets i needddddddd this feature for my gameplay :///","replies":[]},{"poster":"Runewit","date":"2017-01-20T08:03:39.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Riot,\nPlease put the Item Sets feature into the new client,  I rely heavily on them for remembering my preferred builds for champions that I enjoy, but don't play often.  It is quite inconvenient going back to old client to change sets, and I assume that the old client will be outdated at some point, so at least before then!\nThanks for hearing from us, the players,\n-Runewit","replies":[]},{"poster":"Denamek","date":"2016-12-03T07:31:38.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely need item sets back in the client.
