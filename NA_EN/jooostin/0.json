When I use my W, a few particles are missing that come out of my weapon. I don&#039;t know if something is missing from my E and R because I didn&#039;t notice anything strange occur, but there could be a couple particles missing that I just can&#039;t see very well. Please help. I want to enjoy the skin I purchased.","replies":[{"poster":"Jooostin","date":"2015-07-05T23:47:58.224+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, Riot KateyKhaos!","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-05T22:51:47.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Jooostin,\n\nThanks for the report!
