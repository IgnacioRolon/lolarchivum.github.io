(like project Yi isn&#039;t really Yi. [Though I might be wrong :/]) Is it him at a certain point in time/outside the league? Cause with that skin he says multiple things to certain champs When he kills them with ult that he doesn&#039;t say with his default skin. \n\nTwo, I already know that there are some important lore between Jhin, Shen and Zed coming out soon but what are his relations with Garen, Sona and Vi?\nWhy&#039;d he &quot;Kill&quot; Them? \n\nThat&#039;s all I have to ask.\nHope a rioter replies .3.\n\nEDIT: For those of you don't know those special quotes, here they are:\n\nWhen killing an enemy Teemo with ult as High Noon Jhin\n\"I like the way you die, boy.\"\n\nWhen killing an enemy Noxian with Ult as High Noon Jhin\n\"Kill Noxians and get paid for it? What's not to like?\"\n\nWhen killing an enemy Yasuo with Ult as High Noon Jhin\n\"It's fun to kill a man. To take all that he had, and could ever have.\"","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2016-01-20T23:53:21.814+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The high noon quotes are all referencing famous westerns.

Is their relationship that well-known or are those champs all psychics? and if so then why everyone knows about it but garen and kat aren't official... haven't read their lores but i'm sure they haven't even come to terms with how they feel about each other.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArcticSirius","date":"2016-01-21T03:38:00.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is understandable but would you mind explaining why Battlecast Vel'Koz has more champ-specific lines than his base?

I mean, they could be 3 legendary ninjas that occasionally work together but it's not really THE rule... Either way I love Kennen and I'd love to see what direction you're gonna be taking him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-01-19T22:30:51.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think those quotes are references to a western movie(was it djangho?I dunno),its not impossible for some skins to have some unique taunts/jokes(mecha kha'zix has them and bc-vel'koz too,though those of Bc-vel'koz look to me like they were originally planned for regular vel'koz...)\n\nFor the second one:\nJhin knows of the existence of these 4 and thats merely how he'd imagine their deaths,he hasn't killed them and currently might not even want to kill them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lordllo","date":"2016-01-21T05:36:39.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im saving for jhin.
