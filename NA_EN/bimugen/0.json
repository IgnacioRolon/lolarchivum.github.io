Yeah. Those're words.\nMaybe to replace the shadows, and to reduce the skin by a little bit (because right now it looks kinda awkward with just the shells there) there could be similar effects to her shadows, but with water? Just an idea pitch.\nI love the shell nails, as well as the way you used the shell on her heel to create a high-heel-shoe look.\nThe fact that her passive turns her into an angler fish theme is wonderful, and fits her character amazingly well.\nOn the list of things I want in the game, this is on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Necrozard","date":"2017-10-09T22:18:21.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was memeing about a deep sea Evelynn some time ago (Ursula from the little Mermaid), but i still think that a water-themed eve would be a neat idea","replies":[]},{"poster":"Åšpiridon","date":"2017-10-08T15:21:18.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who loves anything to do with Mythology, I NEED it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AetherArising","date":"2017-10-08T05:12:56.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps color her skin away from the tan that all her skins have now\n\nI'd love to see a blue or purple tinged eve as a skin, and this one looks amazing!\nGJ man.","replies":[]}]}
