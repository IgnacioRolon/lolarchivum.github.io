That was my favorite lux skin, and i am a lux main. I realized this when i was playing with a friend on One for All when all of a sudden he said that he now owns star guardian lux even though he has never purchased the skin, and at that moment i looked and it showed that i don&#039;t own the skin. I am very upset over this, please give my skin back!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-26T16:49:44.511+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Morning! \n\nThere are a couple reasons this gifted content may have been removed from your account. Typically, this content is removed due to gifts being sent as a result of fraudulent activity. There are two main ways this occurs:\n\n1) If a player participates in Refer-A-Friend fraud to acquire IP or RP, then any champions/skins gifted with this IP or RP are removed.\n\n2) If a player purchases RP and gifts content with it, and subsequently issues a chargeback for the money spent on that RP, we will remove that content.\n\nIf you believe that content you have received wasn't due to these issues, please [submit a ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) and we'll take a look at your account and see what the issue may be.","replies":[]}]}
