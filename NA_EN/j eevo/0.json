Sure, the ping's not great (90-110), and it sometimes spikes up to 200 for a split second before going back down, though that's rare enough that it doesn't bother me as much. However the 10% of cases the game will DC for maybe a second or less, and I cannot play that match any further because the game refuses to sync up again.\r\n\r\nI am on teamspeak so I KNOW the gap in connection wasn't longer than a second, and after it passes, we continue talking, however with LOL if it does DC, then I'm pretty much fucked for the rest of that match, as player characters will teleport around the map, minions will show and dissapear at random, projectiles will fly through the air through half the map, and in general it looks like a god damn clown fiesta.\r\n\r\nI don't have that problem in ANY other game, Dota2 syncs right up and works just fine, Warframe lags for maybe a second and doesn't even break a sweat, starcraft 2 is seamless and doesn't even show it.\r\n\r\nIs there ANY way to force a resync in league, or some way to avoid those clown fiesta moments when the game client doesn't know what the fuck it's doing?\r\n\r\nHere's some screenshots I found amusing while the game goes apeshit\r\nhttp://imgur.com/CECXBDS\r\nhttp://imgur.com/79fqz6n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/VDgU4o9","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-04T22:18:21.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're having input delays or 'sync' issues then you could be having a network problem that can't keep a strong connection to the game server specifically, even if your net is fine elsewhere.
