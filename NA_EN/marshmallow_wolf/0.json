That means she was an item ahead.\n* Vayne was 7/6 before this point, and in that fight she then got a triple. It was a teamfight, and others participated in killing you.\n* You lived over 8 seconds. Is that bad? Seems decent. Note that you mitigated a huge portion of her physical autos with a large pool of EH, which played a big part in letting you live more than a couple seconds. That's what tank items are for.\n* How long do you think a tank should live in the front line of a teamfight? 10 seconds? 15? 30? Forever? Preventing that is the whole point of Silver Bolts.\n* Counterbuilding isn't the same as counterplaying. How do you counterbuild Trist's Q? How do you counterbuild Lucian's passive? Silver Bolts serves as Vayne's steroid, without which she probably wouldn't be a marksman. Your health and armor were effective against the AD and crit that Vayne bought, and partially effective against the AS she bought (which lets her deal more physical damage and get more W applications).\n* You are not as squishy as your carries. Your carries hear Zed laugh, and then he pops up in their face just long enough to press QW, and then he's gone again. The carry dies either immediately or in a couple seconds when the ult pops. Of course, if Zed had to linger a while to kill e.g. MF, she would press Q and delete him, which is why his damage has to be so high: everyone's is. N.B.: the Zed in this match was having a tough time, and the MF wasn't going for a one-shot build, but they're basically balanced around doing so.\n* Your team won.\n\nTL;DR: Your tank stats allowed you to survive for a pretty long time, and your team won.\n\nP.S.: Delete Phantom Hit.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshmallow Wolf","date":"2019-04-05T07:20:10.169+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair, I only lasted 8 seconds because of good flash and e away, or it would have been two seconds.

She's like Yi, she's nearly impossible to deal with in the late game. That is what a hyper carry is. When she's building crit with the same attack speed is when she is a problem, because she power spikes earlier and Vayne has one of the highest base attack speeds in the game.
