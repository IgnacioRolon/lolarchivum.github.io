Its two core items are Trinity Force and Frozen Mallet, which along with Fervor of Battle and high attack speed runes, let Yasuo go on to build tanky while still dealing reasonable damage. Mostly, it raises your survivability and exploits the current state of bruiser items to deal more damage than riot is comfortable with, given his hardiness.","replies":[{"poster":"Memeguel420","date":"2016-08-24T04:30:32.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the explanation, are there any ways to counter it?

Just understand that he will almost always take at least one of your allies with him when he builds tanky.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bob4131","date":"2016-08-24T04:34:11.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:150}} can be nice due to his kite if you match {{champion:157}}'s {{item:3022}}, as well as his hyper.

Yasuo very easily negates all of mini Gnar's damage and can also jump on him without the slightest bit of effort. As Mega Gnar, you have much more significant burst, but Yasuo's almost too slippery to try and fight in that state.\n\nA better counter would be Jax or Irelia, maybe renekton or a juggernaut. Yasuo loses 1v1 melee matchups pretty easily.","replies":[{"poster":"Asudurga","date":"2016-08-24T05:11:37.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:238}} is also a viable option, Yasuo players tend to have very split-second reactions and a good Zed player can end up confusing them and shredding them with armour pen using his buildpath. \n\nTo help replace mid lane to compensate for Zed coming top {{champion:3}} is a greta option for a tanky AP mage.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-08-24T05:25:47.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo v.

Since Yasuo is running too rampant with ease.\n\nJust like with the scummie 'twitch jungle plays', Yasuo gets to have just as scummy plays that will put you in a near impossible to react window before you get blasted for high amounts of damage and utterly make it difficult for you have any chance of having a fair trade fight in the lane since he can easily run with fair ease and easily wrek you with fair ease'ness, basically like going against a Zed except he has no resource bar to work off of and more defense measures to ruin your chances of being able to keep the lane even and not you constantly be stuck under turret.\n\nHell they should really make Yasuo's Q Tornado get a longer wind up time or maybe move slow at first and pick up speed gradually while traveling to allow better chance of being able to dodge and further push Yasuo to what he should be: \"A champion who requires a high amount of skill to actually play, not some easy free mauling champion.\"\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-08-24T07:24:58.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are several issues to address here.

The laning phase will *still* be a skill matchup regardless and the OP asked for a counter.
