So it almost always depends on which team has the best comp which feels extremely fair when you aren&#039;t the ones making the comp. It&#039;d be nice if maybe it gave you 3 random champions to pick from instead of giving you a choice that definitely will result in a loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Titanium70","date":"2017-04-08T01:56:24.107+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then don't play it.\n\nI'm sure Riot is looking at total games played for each mode, the games played early and late, avarage games per player.. you know.\n\nIf noone plays it, the mode will never come back. It's easy as that. \n\nFor the time being it's just an optional, bonus game, and I won't complain about such things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-08T01:44:07.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you know how fun it is to fight for positions in blind pick?
