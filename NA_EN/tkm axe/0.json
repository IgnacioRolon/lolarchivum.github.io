He can play either lane, has great push, his escape isn't great but taking objectives is where he shines. Get rift at 18 mins, go bot.

His farming is phenomenal and can't be denied, he takes down turrets faster than just about anyone else, and his long-range ult and AoE cc is amazing for teamfights.\n\nFor top, I'd recommend Garen or Jayce. Garen has amazing farm ability, an empowered auto that works on turrets, and becomes really hard to push out of lane after level 13, as his regen just brings him back in seconds (Warmog's makes this utterly ridiculous). Jayce is the better choice if you want a safer ranged option to farm. He also has great wave clear, and becomes really dangerous even to lane bullies after an item or two. His empowered autos work on turrets, as well, and his cannon-form W makes taking down turrets pretty easy. His teamfighting is good, with his long range poke from an E-empowered cannon-form Q, and then his AoE W in hammer form.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2018-06-19T14:30:13.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now I might suck at math...but that's more than 3 to me.","replies":[{"poster":"heroikc","date":"2018-06-19T18:33:24.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Selegun,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=U2FA60Yh,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-06-19T14:30:13.527+0000)\n>\n> Now I might suck at math...but that&#x27;s more than 3 to me.\n\nHe said \"atleast\", so there needs to be a minimum of three.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TKM Axe","date":"2018-06-19T14:32:41.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Selegun,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=U2FA60Yh,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-06-19T14:30:13.527+0000)\n>\n> Now I might suck at math...but that&#x27;s more than 3 to me.\n\nsorry for bad english. it dosent need to have all of those requirements but atleast 3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-06-19T14:36:23.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:266}} pretty much everything listed\n\n {{champion:85}} \nAOE dmg, affect whole teamfight, escape from ganks, decent roaming\n\n{{champion:420}} everything listed except splitpush\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"TKM Axe","date":"2018-06-19T14:37:31.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Snapp2Kill,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=U2FA60Yh,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-06-19T14:36:23.154+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:266}} pretty much everything listed\n> \n>  {{champion:85}} \n> AOE dmg, affect whole teamfight, escape from ganks\n\nmy friend also recommend me kennen, guess his pretty good huh? could maybe grind on normal and buy him just to test it","replies":[{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-06-19T14:38:56.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he is, but remember hes not so great in most 1v1's. he usually just pokes the crap out of you in most cases. to fully use his kit you want to be grouped with your team as often as you can","replies":[{"poster":"TKM Axe","date":"2018-06-19T14:42:36.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Snapp2Kill,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=U2FA60Yh,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2018-06-19T14:38:56.429+0000)\n>\n> he is, but remember hes not so great in most 1v1&#x27;s. he usually just pokes the crap out of you in most cases. to fully use his kit you want to be grouped with your team as often as you can\n\nshould i play him top or mid?","replies":[{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-06-19T14:45:16.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"depends on your playstyle tbh, midlane gives you roam potential, but toplane pretty much garuntees a favorable matchup.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-06-19T14:31:45.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe new Aatrox?","replies":[]}]}
