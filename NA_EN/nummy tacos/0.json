I changed all my password/account info in case but I'm not sure what happened still. Anybody have any idea?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-31T04:04:37.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't quite jump straight to a drop-hack, as that would mean the game was still running. Since you were able to re-queue, it sounds like what actually happened was the game crashed entirely on the server. With that being the case, everyone else would have been kicked out as well, nobody will get hit with any penalties, and you will all be able to re-queue just as usual!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nummy Tacos","date":"2017-07-31T02:03:44.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also looked at other player profiles in the same game and it's not even showing on OP.GG anymore. I believe it must've been a drophack...","replies":[]}]}
