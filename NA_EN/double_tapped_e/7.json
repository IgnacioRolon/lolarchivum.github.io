The losing team with the AFK loses LP like normal, the AFK player gets some mark on their leaver record or something.\n\nIn this situation, the winning team is happy because they get their LP, and the losing team is sad because they lose LP and feel like they didn't deserve to. Who cares what the AFK player feels honestly.\n\n2) The winning team gains LP, even though the match was unbalanced. The losing team with the AFK loses 0 LP and loses 0 MMR, and the AFK player loses LP like normal and gets a mark on their leaver record or something.\n\nIn this situation, the winning team is happy because they get their LP, and the losing team is happy because they weren't punished for a loss that was not their fault.\n\nMany rules in this game have been justified by the reasoning \"It doesn't matter how YOU feel if you are ruining the game for 9 other people.\" So what that means to me is \"The most important thing in a game of League is to make as many of the players in that game happy as possible.\"\n\nWell, in situation 1, 5 players are happy, and 4-5 players are sad. In situation 2, 9 players are happy, and 1 player is sad.\n\nSituation 2 seems like it fits better with the philosophy that governs a majority of the rules in this game, so why does Riot opt for situation 1?\n\n(Also a weird note about numbered lists on the boards, if you have an explanation between two points, it resets to 1. unless you use parentheses 1), 2), etc.)","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-04T02:19:44.259+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That is not abuse of the system.\n\nAbuse would be someone queuing with a throwaway that disconnects every losing game for loss prevention.","replies":[{"poster":"DOUBLE TAPPED E","date":"2019-09-04T02:24:38.734+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Easy fix: The system stops working at a certain ELO, to prevent abuse in high ELO matches where the stakes are higher and it's easier to guarantee hitting the right match with a dummy account.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-04T02:30:31.988+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"People will abuse that shit all the way to Iron IV","replies":[{"poster":"DOUBLE TAPPED E","date":"2019-09-04T02:40:18.196+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"There's no way you won't get banned going AFK in every single losing match, c'mon now...\n\n\"Other accounts.\"\n\nPeople aren't made of money, and leveling new accounts takes time.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-04T02:58:10.530+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"A throwaway account costs a couple dollars, same people who already abuse smurfs would abuse it, except far worse.","replies":[{"poster":"DOUBLE TAPPED E","date":"2019-09-04T03:04:59.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah they use their knowledge of how games are won and lost to \"soft int\" to lose rank / entertain their friends / streams, but everyone already knows that doesn't get people banned so it's not really abuse, and they don't have to constantly replace those accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-04T03:17:19.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on the individual. 4$ a day between a few people to get on-demand loss prevention?
