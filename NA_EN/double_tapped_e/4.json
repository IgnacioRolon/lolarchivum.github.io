Period. We are playing a much different game than we were when Tenacity was designed, the amount of CC that is unaffected by Tenacity is staggering, and it&#039;s time to at the very least TEST adding knockups to the list of CC effects reduced by Tenacity on PBE and see how it pans out.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-11T08:25:55.816+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Knockups exist _because_ they aren't affected by Tenacity, not in spite of that. Most CC has to be balanced around use against champions with as well as without Tenacity, similar to how heals might be used on champions with or without Grievous Wounds.

They interrupt channels, and are essentially a stun, which allows other champions to easily hit their (more powerful because they are affected by tenacity) CC, and chain them together until a target is dead, without them being able to do anything at all, even flash or Zhonya's.

That will completley break maoki (for the worse) and he will require compensation buffs.\n\nDraven's E, Taliyah's knock back, Syndra's scatter, vel'koz E - and many other similar spells were balanced without tenacity in mind, they are balanced around themselves no matter the opposition, so if any knockup is strong, it should be looked at individually.","replies":[{"poster":"DOUBLE TAPPED E","date":"2019-02-12T00:34:59.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, the issue is not the power level of any individual displacement effect, but the number of them overall.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ContDeCaterinca1","date":"2019-02-11T09:40:58.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's the average duration of a displacement compared on a stun?\n\nAshe even has a 3.5s stun, the longest knock-up has to be like 1.5s.\n\nDisplacements are balanced around having no counter, but having short duration, suppressions are balanced around the user not being able to move or act in any way while their target is suppressed.","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2019-02-11T15:54:34.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats not very short considering  the current time to kill is 2 seconds.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2019-02-11T09:42:37.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think like surpression, it has more to do with the users design rather than the knock up concept.\n\nFor instance, tenacity doesn't affect malzahar or skarner because the CC is based on their spells themselves rather then how much you cancel them.\n\nTwo examples that come to mind for knockups/displacements are thresh and blitz, which wouldn't  pull properly if the duration wasn't exact.
