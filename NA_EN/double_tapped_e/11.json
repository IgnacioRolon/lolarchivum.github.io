The enemy team is mia and collapsing on you, that is why we pinged danger and stayed in lane instead of  leaving to follow or help, however you ignored all the warnings failed to realize all your lanes are losing because the enemy jungler is ganking non stop so we left you to your fate.\n\nI think I got it right for you :P","replies":[]}]}
