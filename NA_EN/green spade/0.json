\r\n(12:13:50 AM) Twisted Spade: I had hoped you would seeing how I&#039;m your customer and have been playing since season one \r\n(12:14:06 AM) Twisted Spade: Sure I got some questions but questions get me into trouble \r\n(12:14:10 AM) Twisted Spade: staff dislike questions I find lol \r\n(12:14:12 AM) Twisted Spade: But I&#039;ll try one \r\n(12:14:51 AM) Twisted Spade: Is it legitimate for a staff member to refuse to address direct questions and then ban a players account from accessing help desk chat due to being unwilling to address their questions or talk to them when they have legitimate concerns and questions? \r\n(12:15:27 AM) Rocco: i feel that&#039;s a very pointed and circumstantial question \r\n(12:15:55 AM) Rocco: but, if the player&#039;s concern and issue has been addressed, even if it&#039;s the answer they do not like, and the player continues to bring it up, yes i would say so \r\n(12:16:31 AM) Twisted Spade: That&#039;s not the situation however. \r\n(12:16:48 AM) Twisted Spade: I could paste it to you \r\n(12:16:53 AM) Twisted Spade: but you prob would think its too long \r\n(12:17:02 AM) Rocco: yeah it&#039;s best to keep them direct \r\n(12:17:04 AM) Twisted Spade: all staff do \r\n(12:17:09 AM) Twisted Spade: direct messages?

\r\n(12:22:37 AM) Twisted Spade: He didn&#039;t even try \r\n(12:22:52 AM) Rocco: also i will only really be able to help you if you have questions for me about the game, etc. :/ because as much as i would like to listen, i do have to help other players as well \r\n(12:22:59 AM) Twisted Spade: And what does this even solve? I mean im talking to you right now am I not? \r\n(12:23:09 AM) Twisted Spade: What good is banning me from help desk if I can just make a new account? \r\n(12:23:54 AM) Twisted Spade: .... I want to know what I can do about this staff member unreasonably punishing me for requesting help and clarity they refused to give me \r\n(12:24:03 AM) Twisted Spade: How can I be a reformed player if you guys refuse to talk to me about what else I can do ? \r\n(12:24:58 AM) Rocco: if you are banned from the livechat, you can always write in through tickets \r\n(12:25:00 AM) Twisted Spade: closing my requests and telling me to go play doesn&#039;t change anything \r\n(12:25:09 AM) Twisted Spade: Tickets are trash, they get auto closed \r\n(12:25:22 AM) Rocco: again that&#039;s your opinion but that is the what else you can do \r\n(12:25:37 AM) Twisted Spade: Its not a opinion, its fact, my tickets get closed regardless of what I have to say automatically \r\n(12:26:12 AM) Twisted Spade: How do you turn me into a reformed player if your company refuses to address anything? \r\n(12:26:28 AM) Twisted Spade: IF my help requests for understanding is denied, how do I reform? \r\n(12:27:16 AM) Rocco: you can reform by not being toxic in the future and playing to win the game \r\n(12:27:19 AM) Twisted Spade: If my requests are closed and I&#039;m treated as if I&#039;m doing something for simply asking, how does that change my point of view for the better? \r\n(12:27:24 AM) Twisted Spade: Can you define toxic? \r\n(12:27:41 AM) Twisted Spade: As far as I&#039;m aware its undefined so you can use it as a blanket term to use on anything you want \r\n(12:27:56 AM) Twisted Spade: If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then the person who is observing gets to decide what is beautiful. This means you guys can say anything is toxic. \r\n(12:28:24 AM) Twisted Spade: Me asking a question you guys refuse to address is toxic right? \r\n(12:28:32 AM) Twisted Spade: I mean your company punished me for it \r\n(12:28:35 AM) Rocco: being negative, complaining, giving up, hate speech, berating, fighting back, etc. \r\n(12:28:44 AM) Rocco: you were only punished because of your behavior \r\n(12:28:46 AM) Twisted Spade: I&#039;m complaining maybe but legitimately. \r\n(12:29:15 AM) Rocco: and i&#039;m sorry that you do not agree with that, but solely your actions were the reason why your account received a punishment \r\n(12:29:19 AM) Twisted Spade: alright man ill humor you \r\n(12:29:23 AM) Twisted Spade: can you point out what I said or did wrong? \r\n(12:29:24 AM) Twisted Spade: #31690227 \r\n(12:29:58 AM) Twisted Spade: cuz I&#039;m punished for something I&#039;m clueless as to what I did legitimately wrong, I asked a question and gave context and information on that subject, nothing more \r\n(12:30:24 AM) Twisted Spade: I mean if you want to punish me at least let me know why \r\n(12:31:08 AM) Twisted Spade: Cuz from my point of view I have a unaddressed question asking what else I could do in that situation and then describing how the other options will either see me punished or offer zero success rate. \r\n(12:31:29 AM) Twisted Spade: If you guys want me to do something else, please, elaborate on what it is you would wish for me to do instead of closing my help requests repeatedly and leaving me ignorant. \r\n(12:32:17 AM) Rocco: what is your question \r\n(12:32:28 AM) Twisted Spade: My question is what did I do wrong in help request ticket #31690227 \r\n(12:33:03 AM) Twisted Spade: What did I do to warrant being punished for asking for questions to help me go back into the game as a reformed player by having you elaborate on what else I could do in those situations \r\n(12:34:45 AM) Rocco: because you do not have questions, you just do not like how our system works and we cannot change that solely for you. and you continue to give us feedback, which is great, but we ask you to go to the boards and instead of giving questions, you are being rude and attacking us. \r\n(12:35:01 AM) Twisted Spade: ?? Do you have a search function? Search for the question mark if you cant find it... \r\n(12:35:11 AM) Rocco: if you do not have any new questions, i will have to close out this chat and ban you from it as well. \r\n(12:35:26 AM) Twisted Spade: &quot; \r\nMy question is what did I do wrong in help request ticket #31690227?&quot; \r\n(12:35:40 AM) Twisted Spade: &quot;What did I do to warrant being punished for asking for questions?&quot; \r\n(12:36:26 AM) Rocco: i already answered your question in my previous response. because you did not have any new questions for me, i will be banning you from chat now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwisted Spade\r\nToday at 17:39\r\n \r\n\r\nIs this some kind of a joke? \r\n\r\nCan I talk to someone else then I feel as if your making a point to refuse to look into this situation or address my concerns.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-10T00:47:18.745+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"It looks like you continue to abuse the support system continually for submitting feedback/requests to the team.

I reopened it and rocco closed it then banned me from reopening new requests, so not only am I banned from text chat now I am also banned from opening help requests.... All over me asking them to address a complex question they refused to do? This isn't right, I have done nothing wrong, I am not under punishment for any in game actions, so I should not be punished for asking questions requesting clarity and context on riots stance so I don't brake anymore rules.\n\nTicket #31690227 is the orginal ticket between me and gunny, it was obvious gunny had zero intentions of even reading what I had to say let alone help or try to understand what I was asking so he could respond to me.\n\nI feel like there are two types of staff, staff who skim and don't care about the game or the players who are there for a pay check like rocco, gunny and agent007, while there are others like Cammy White who have a high level reading comprehension who are able to follow a conversation and respond on point cuz they care about doing their job properly since they care about the game and the players.\n\nOne will try to help you, the other will treat you like a criminal for asking questions and requesting clarity or context if they don't want to address it it becomes a you problem, they turn you into a problem and punish you for it... this ain't right.\n\nYou want context on the question I'm asking? Its a simple question really but unless you take all the context into account then you won't be able to address it; the question is what else can you do in a situation of a trolling or griefing in actions player if all options equal either punishment from riot or a zero success rate. While the only one that has a success rate above 1% (team communication) is punishable, it remains the only option with a postiive sucess rate. So if its the only option, but your still punished for it as if you shouldn't be doing it, what other options are there that riot would wish for me to use instead of team communication when dealing with trolling or griefing actions or another player?\n\nI mean theres a group on facebook (two of them actually each a bit different) where there are tens of thousands of players trolling and griefing in actions daily...

I don't, but cuz riot does not see the whole conversation, they only see my one sided conversation, I could NOT convince riot that I was talking about myself instead of another player, they refused to read what I was saying, skimming over it and then telling me that its unacceptable to call for a report on another player and that its griefing despite me never calling for a report on another player, but rather just mocking that he called for one on me.\n\nI have no copy of the chat from that game but I guess I could post some of the help request conversation I had of them refusing to see that I wasn't calling for a report on another player but was mocking another player calling for a report on me by calling for a report on myself in a mocking way....","replies":[{"poster":"Subdue","date":"2017-09-10T03:06:03.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, sorry, a single utterance of the word \"Report\" won't do you in either.
