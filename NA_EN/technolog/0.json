This has happened both times I got into my S1 promos, giving me an immediate loss for the first game.  Does anyone know why this is happening, and only when I'm in my S1 promos?  I feel like somebody does not want me to reach gold :(","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-28T09:34:52.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like an unstable connection with LoL servers resulting in a disconnect from champ select.\n\n[Troubleshoot your connectivity issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj","replies":[{"poster":"technoloG","date":"2016-07-28T10:33:22.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's most likely it, but for it to only ever happen in these promos is pretty suspicious if you ask me...","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-28T22:07:28.240+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that a poor connection to the servers is the most likely cause here. I can assure you that Riot is not part of some sort of dark conspiracy to prevent you from reaching your goal of hitting Gold this season. :P\n\nThe problem with connection issues is that they can come and go, much like the tides of the ocean. I definitely recommend working through the guide that *Rineyy* linked, as it addresses the most frequent fixes for this situation. \n\nIf you continue to see this issue after working through those steps, please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"technoloG","date":"2016-07-29T23:56:45.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll definitely try the troubleshooting tips, thank you!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
