There's pretty much always going to be 1 adc that's picked far more than the rest, but that adc should never be someone as supposedly situational as Vayne; and if she is going to be this popular, she definitely shouldn't be having above average success. I remember the days when it was Caitlyn every game and then Lucian every game and then Tristana every game and then Jinx every game.

The problem with Vayne is you do have to look at her a bit differently, and I hear the \"then Vayne IS the problem\" before you type it.\n\nThe problem really isn't Vayne, it is the person playing against Vayne refusing to change their play style or strategy. It isn't a new thing, I mean look at Darius when he was new. He rocked people because they wanted to go against him like other top laners and Darius said no. It took a while, but people figured it out and stopped complaining constantly.\n\nVayne is built for dueling and being a threat late, but she isn't useless before then. People treat her like any other adc in lane when she isn't obviously, but that doesn't mean she is overpowered. Just don't run in her face. Have a more CC heavy support (I play Naut and get in her face if she tries to dive on my adc). \n\n\nIf you are refusing to play against Vayne differently in order to beat her, that isn't the champs fault, that is input error.

Her winrate comes from most Vayne players playing more than 100 games on her because they like Vayne (her winrate rises solidly past 100 games). \n\n\"Lucian/Sivir\"\nLucian/Sivir have longer effective range. Vayne has better duelling. Sivir has better game managing through her high ms. Lucian has better burst (esp when he was balanced) and more long range damage through ult. It's not like Vayne does everything else better aside from the range.. They just have completely separate strengths.\n\nIt seems like Vayne needs a slight nerf to be closer to even, along with a couple other ADCs, though.

Its already % HP its meant to be a tankbuster, so WHY THE HELL does it have FLAT VALUES AS WELL? That just screws over squishes as well!\n\nJust completely remove her damn W's Flat true damage value. She already has enough mobility (which i think is another area that could use a hit) as it is, she dosent need to be a burst assassin as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2015-08-17T05:34:40.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"point of clarity, half of vayne wins are won in 25 minutes? half of vayne games are won in 25 minutes? or half of 25 minute games containing a vayne are a win for her?","replies":[{"poster":"FalconPawwwwnch","date":"2015-08-17T05:37:57.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of all the Vayne games that last 0-25 minutes, she wins over half of them","replies":[{"poster":"zJCavRH7cd","date":"2015-08-17T08:26:13.759+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FalconPawwwwnch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4RVeheMb,comment-id=00130000,timestamp=2015-08-17T05:37:57.665+0000)\n>\n> Out of all the Vayne games that last 0-25 minutes, she wins over half of them\n\nDid you even do your research?\n\nAlmost all the adc's have over a 50% win rate between 0-25 minutes.\n\nThe role is called Attack Damage Carry for a reason. Because they are champions that build full damage to kill the enemy team. And if they get ahead. REGARDLESS OF WHAT ADC IT IS. Between 0-25 minutes. They have a higher chance to win the game.\n\n\n\nHere let me put this easier for you.\n\nFormat\nADC - Time of game - Winrate Percentage\n\n\n\nJinx (0-25) Winrate : 53.59\nAshe (0-25) Winrate : 53.7\nSivir (0-25) Winrate : 54.13\nDraven (0-25) Winrate : 53\nVarus (0-25) Winrate : 52.57\nKalista (0-25) Winrate : 53.85\nCaitlyn (0-25) Winrate : 50.92\nCorki (0-25) Winrate : 54.11\nGraves (0-25) Winrate : 52.75\n\nThen theres vayne (0-25) Winrate : 50.68%\n\nWhoa thats crazy, its almost like, as if. Any adc that gets ahead between 0 minutes and 25 minutes of the game has a above 50% winrate. No way.\n\n\nAll stats were taken from Champion.gg The same site you used for you links and stats.\n\n\nBasically using this stat is pretty much invalid for your argument.\n\n\nSo if you have any other stats you would like to share with me go ahead.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-08-16T23:18:56.011+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Where did Riot make a statement that they have no intentions or plans for Vayne?
