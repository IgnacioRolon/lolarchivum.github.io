Cheese like Quinn and Vayne were already unbearable in solo lanes even with TP, now there&#039;s no hope of dealing with them unless Riot massive buffs Doran&#039;s shield with a ranged AA specifically passive (yea right)\n\n\nTP nerfs needed to happen, it's game warping to the point it's almost needed on midlaners now.\n\nAD buffs are fixes overall, we'll see how it goes.\n\nDoing camps early is and always is a problem when laners can do it before going into lane. Remember when there was no gromp and both sides top and bot did Golems for an early level 2? Yeah that was a huge problem before and it was here as well.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-11-02T05:06:25.531+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Red Ryu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2sEFscfP,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-11-01T20:41:28.829+0000)\n>\n> TP nerfs needed to happen, it's game warping to the point it's almost needed on midlaners now.\n\nWhere is the Flash nerf then?\n\nOh nvm Riot has always been balancing the game with a clear bias.","replies":[{"poster":"Red Ryu","date":"2015-11-02T05:50:05.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2sEFscfP,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-11-02T05:06:25.531+0000)\n>\n> Where is the Flash nerf then?\n> \n> Oh nvm Riot has always been balancing the game with a clear bias.\n\nFlash is ingrained at this point, not much to be done there.\n\nTP on the other hand is debatably much worse in terms of impact.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-11-02T05:51:27.759+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Red Ryu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2sEFscfP,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2015-11-02T05:50:05.450+0000)\n>\n> Flash is ingrained at this point, not much to be done there.\n> \n> TP on the other hand is debatably much worse in terms of impact.\n\nWell that's what preseason is for, to do drastic changes. \n\nI mean they have revamped the map, revamped the entire jungle, revamped the entire class, global nerf/buff etc. Yet still no Flash nerf.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2015-11-02T05:54:59.722+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Or the fact that it is so ingrained into the game that doing anything to it would have catastrophic effects. Nerfing it in any way would either A) still make it the best choice since the gap closer will almost always make it better than another option or B) nerfing it so much that people will all just take something else. Removing it would completely invalidate any champion without an inherent gap closer (Annie would be trash tier since she relies very heavily on it and almost any immobile mage such as TF would INSTANTLY lose to any sort of aggression on an assassins part since he would be physically incapable of escaping them).\n\nYes Flash is very strong BUT it is so used right now that it is DEEMED necessary. It would be very hard to have any sort of objective control if flash was removed from the game. Unless you have a gap closer not reliant on a target stealing Dragon on blue side would be almost impossible as a jungler (same with Baron on purple side).","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-11-02T05:57:36.815+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=My Waifu Chocola,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2sEFscfP,comment-id=000400000001,timestamp=2015-11-02T05:54:59.722+0000)\n>\n> Or the fact that it is so ingrained into the game that doing anything to it would have catastrophic effects. \n\nAt least make it the next Recall or something, I am tired of seeing Flash every game and having me to pick it myself too only because I must.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2015-11-02T01:44:48.616+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget about our new friend ranged brusier assassin graves","replies":[{"poster":"ayNigerianPrince","date":"2015-11-02T02:50:09.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Pick any juggernaut.
