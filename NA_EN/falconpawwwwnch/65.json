Assuming you are attack moving in different directions after every auto attack. It will be close to impossible for Illaoi to hit any of them.

I've done it too. The part that I've learned soon after is that if instead I fight Illaoi, her E becomes useless even if it hits me. Sure, she can heal herself a little bit, but then I do more dmg to her. Again, all the damage the ghost takes is given to me as reduced damage.\nThe match is like:\nyou use 1 second to do an attack that does 100dmg on the close\nI take like 70 or 60 damage.\nIn the same second you do that attack, I attack you for 100 dmg. You take 80-90 dmg due to runes.\n\nThat's the problem. \"I can land my E\" matters only if the enemy is stupid enough to run out of range.\nThe only times you can't trade (attack) illaoi is when she has a lot of caster minions around and you don't.
