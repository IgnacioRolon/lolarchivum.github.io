Each ADC has between 3-12ish% life steal, and it's not a constant fight. While you're right in that Runic will only give you an extra 1 or so hp on your autos at that stage.. That's over the entire lane. So after a fight, when you're AAing to heal back up, that 1 extra health per auto really starts to stack up.
