An auto-attack carry is required in pretty much every decent MOBA. \n\n\nThe problem with league is that _**RANGED**_ ADCs are required. I'd be fine if you had to bring Yasuo bot lane with a support in order for him to be successful, or even Yi. \n\nPart of the issue is that ranged overcomes any advantage the steroids that melees have will ever bring, and most ranged have steroids on top of that, which is not good for game health, as far as balancing between melee and ranged ADCs. Range IS their steroid. In pretty much any other game, range get utility, not additional steroids. \n\nAnother issue is that any carry that can't make it in lane has to function in the jungle to bypass their early vulnerability when it should be supports with them during laning that should cover that.\n\nThe final issue is that most hard carries can function in a solo lane by themselves. Why are Quinn, Graves, Fiora, GP, etc so potent early, mid, and late? Heavy scaling into late game means **crippling** early game weaknesses that force them to take 1 or 2 supports into lane with them in any other game. \n\nOnly very specific champions should be able to jungle because jungle itself should not be a forced 'lane.' 1/1/3 should be a viable strategy as well as 2/1/2, but the EXP mechanics in this game, as well as the per-level scaling are so out-of-whack that several potential strategies are squashed for no good reason.\n\nJungle should allow specific carries to scale that way (Nocturne, Yi, etc) while the enemy team has to actively seek to shut down their farming. Outside of that, picking a jungler should mean your team wants a gank-heavy strategy to scale into mid-game, which often means not picking super hard carries, that way they can assist better in early-mid ganks. If no jungler is picked, its your mid-laner that should be the ganker. \n\nJunglers should not be required to have a functional game just like ranged carries should not be absolutely required, and exp cuts with multiple champions need to be addressed to fix this. \n\nDon't think about mentioning games you've won without ADCs or junglers. We've all won gimmicky games where we snowballed too hard for it to matter if we used the most efficient set-up. There shouldn't **be** a most efficient set-up. All set-ups, barring empty lanes, should be viable, outside of double jungle, simply because it can't function with balanced jungle values. This is a strategy game. Why can't we start acting like it is?","replies":[{"poster":"AsphodelNext","date":"2016-02-27T15:04:13.955+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The early game lane swap meta has been popular and effective, and a common variant is the 4/1/0, where both sides give up on the disadvantaged lane and have 2 people pushing a lane, 2 people jungling on the same side, one person mid, and an empty lane. Though not viable as a long-term plan, it is possible to have strategies that, for a decent period of time, leave a lane empty and have 2 junglers.\n\nJunglers should be required because the threat of ganks prevents winning lanes from getting overly aggressive. Otherwise, there's no punishment for continuously forcing the lane into turret, since you can tell when any other laner decides to leave and back off far in advance, wasting the ganker's time. Sure, a comp with a jungler vs. one without might be interesting, but having both teams without junglers just means winning lanes continue to snowball.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hgjkdlsaf jeldvb","date":"2016-02-26T07:52:25.169+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":5,"body":"ADCs were strong before these shitty season 6 changes.

So they should be hitting item breakpoints and be able to roam bot to create a 4 vs 2/3 play with a tp on your low income player that is top, just in case.\n\nevery single time me and my friends ran this strat we absolutely dominated the current meta. no one could handle it and usually got flamed in all chat for cheesing them.  Sadly it is hard to keep all 5 of us on for much at a time or climbing would be cake.\n\nMost important bans: Blitzcrank (Makes a 1v2 lane impossibly dangerous because a hook = death), Poppy (depends on your jungler, but she is so hard to dive sometimes), Rek'Sai (because she can easily track and counter your plays)\n\nFave comp we did it with:\n{{champion:59}} top/high income laner: enabled diving and was able to bully a little early to to make it even easier\n{{champion:60}} jungle: Imo the best diving jungler right now\n{{champion:42}} mid: scales hard off gold and levels, early level disadvantage didnt really matter because was able to pick up items on time. Also package is super powerful and enables tower taking\n{{champion:1}} the roaming support: easy to charge stun, and corki + annie was able to kill the enemy mid actually a couple times. Also ranged so works great for tower taking too\n{{champion:117}} bot/low income solo laner: really safe, able to clear waves and not die.\n\nOnce you get outer towers down, just group and roam to pressure and take towers, have corki and lulu pickup side waves to keep wave control. Annie+J4+Corki made for some insanely strong teamfights. \nAnnie + Elise is a lot of pick potential if you catch someone while roaming.\n\nSeriously give this a try if you have 4 other people willing to play it with you. Or add me and I can play the Hard roam support (Thresh, Annie, Alistar are my fave to use for it)  And if you dont want Corki cause he is a \"marksman\" there are other champs like {{champion:157}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:31}} that you can easily swap in his place for mid lane. Corki is just rather ideal for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2016-02-26T21:10:35.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FalconPawwwwnch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=f1kn5XWz,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-02-26T06:27:33.222+0000)\n>\n> http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3551106\n> \n> Even back then people were sick of how broken ADCs were due to them being required on every damn team composition, and Riot has done almost nothing since then to change that\n> \n> The ONLY attempt they did to make ADCs optional was the joke that was Mordekaiser&#039;s rework, then they left him in the shitter.\n\nIt would be more accurate to say that ADC's are optimal, not required. If your bringing up Mord. \n\nTheir actually role isn't required for the teamcomp itself. If it were, we would have seen an ADC in another lane when bot lane Mord was a thing. (Which didn't happen when he was pick/ban in the LCS.) \n\nADC's are the optimal choice in the Duo lane, because their damage is Auto attack focused. Meaning they scale more from items than from levels. Making them Okay, when an XP leach is right next to them. (But I don't hear anyone complaining about the support meta do I?) \n\nThe only way you could work around that fact is if you some how got rid of the support. (then you would need to survive the 1v2.) Or cheat the xp system. (Which is what Mord did, and was considered toxic for it.) \n\nThe only other option would be to work a champion so that he's simply better in the Duo lane. Possibly as a result of ally dependent spells. (again, like they did with Mord.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Railios","date":"2016-02-27T17:08:23.738+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you cant kill the weakest role in the game stop playing the way you do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2016-02-27T05:47:06.467+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"I feel like you're all just circle jerking...

When you can show me a champ that can do this without blowing long CDs that isn't a Marksmen and can do it at a range, we'll talk. Until then, quit complaining.

The community is the reason for most of the things Riot does, and then you wonder why Riot does certain things.\n\nZed and Lee not getting nerfs?  If they do, the community would literally go to Riot HQ and murder the balance department.  Riot themselves has stated that they're SCARED to touch Lee because of the community.  The community LOVES Lee, as does Riot, but Riot WANTS to balance him but CAN'T because of the community loving him too much.  Boards isn't all the community, btw, it's a small portion.\n\nNon-Ranged ADC's bot lane?  They tried that and they got SEVERE backlash for both the idea and the champ, when only one was justified (the latter, for any trolls).\n\nIf you guys want to change shit about the game, you gotta change the attitude of the community, which IS possible and starts with you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xl Kirito lx","date":"2016-02-26T06:45:31.483+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"I still say the teleport meta was amazing for dealing with ADC's.
