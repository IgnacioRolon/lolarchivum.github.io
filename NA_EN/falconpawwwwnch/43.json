This mark cannot be activated by Valor. Quinn gains +50 basic attack range when attacking targets marked with Harrier.\n\nE - Base damage is increased by 100% and scaling is increased by up to 100/200/300/400/500% based on distance from target. Increasing the closer you are. (Remember her base and scaling on E is not that large to begin with). CD changed to 24/21/18/15/12/9. Procing Harrier damage reduces this CD by 1.5 seconds. Doubled vs champions. (I word damage as R can consume the mark when activating R. Otherwise E->R would have Valor start with a 6s E which will quickly drop with basic attacks. This is meant to be her dive pattern but the 2nd E is cannot be too short to allow counterplay to it's damage.)\n\nMore power beyond lanning phase. But a doubled CD on E at rank 1 will really hurt her early game safety. Champions with low CD mobility that she tends to even counter(Riven being the extreme) will now be able to bully her if her E is on CD or she didn't rank it first. \n\nHer assassination pattern mostly requires that her team be there to back her up. If she gets a kill she can escape by going to Quinn form and using E to get out. But E is a risky move and Quinn is squishy. As an assassin she'll still likely get destroyed when going in. It'd like talon going in without his stealth. This is fine as she also gets to be a backup ADC. Talon gets to be a sub-par AD caster without his ulti. \n\nOverall weaker early, stronger mid/late. Reduces what makes her so toxic in top lane. She'd probably move to mid lane as her main lane and situational top.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valsing","date":"2015-07-11T21:15:07.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO. At this point Riot needs to rework her and quit putting her off. She a champion with frustrating bugs and a identity crisis. Of which you can't fix or buff her without taking a risk at making her to oppressive to melee lanes. That has been said by most everyone on this post.\n\nAs someone who loved playing Quinn for most Season Three and Season Four. I wish Riot do something about her. Her theme and story are very strong. But it's hard to really get behind a champion when it is not fun to play against her (and sometimes as her). Her visuals are good and healthy. So all you really need to do is a Kit rework. (Think of Ashe or Viktor) I would love to see her reworked so she can work for both Top and ADC with out being oppressive or weak in either.\n\nAlso for those wonder why don't play her much now. I don't have much fun playing in solo lanes. Even when I do well. And seeing as Quinn ADC is not to strong. This due to the fact she tends to fizzle out late game unless really fed and struggles in 2v1 and 2v2 situations imo. Only really leaving top lane her only viable position. So I've laid down my crossbow till something changes","replies":[]},{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2015-07-11T18:17:01.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im guessing this guy got shut down in lane for the first 15minutes?\nAnd Quinn the most oppressive adc top laner?
