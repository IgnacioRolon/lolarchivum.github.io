Take Quinn for example. You go in on her, all she has to do is press E and suddenly she's an arm's length away from you again and pelting you with autos. The fuck someone like Garen supposed to do against that?\n\nOh, and another thing - even if you do jump a ranged toplaner and manage to get a combo off, you'll probably end up losing on the trade anyway because they get to spam you with return damage whilst you try to skulk back behind your minions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limrick","date":"2016-10-14T17:39:31.130+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly, I was playing Riven(yeah sue me) against a Jayce, and he just constantly poked me, and when I said something, he just said \"you have 4 gap closers tho\".
