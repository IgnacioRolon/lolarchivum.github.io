It seems impossible to make a 6 item adc build with no crit (Bloodthirster and BoRK nerfed hard, Runaans has crit now, Triforce, Static and new Static have more crit, Essence Reaver is good now (and has crit)).  The only good options are like the new Youmuus (which doesn't have crit anymore but does have 65 ad) and the new last whispers.  Black cleaver may work I guess (since it shreds all armor while last whisper now only works on bonus armor).","replies":[{"poster":"rampaging poet","date":"2015-10-31T01:02:41.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would you want to build an ADC with no crit?  In addition to interacting with some of the new masteries, critical hit chance increases your DPS more per gold piece than straight AD once you have ~140 AD.  I'm not sure of the exact breakpoint with the new gold efficiencies, but auto-attack champions deal way more damage with crit than non-crit builds.  That's part of why {{item:3006}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3035}}  {{item:3139}} {{item:3508}} isn't a typical ADC build.","replies":[{"poster":"RisenDarkKnight","date":"2015-10-31T02:17:21.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well kalista for one.  Kog'maw, Corki, and Ezreal also don't usually build more crit than triforce in their first 3 items.  Mostly I had Miss Fortune in mind as I like to rush BT on her sometimes, but now you have to rush a crit item since her ult scales with crit and BT is so much worse now. Kalista is probably the only adc who usually builds no crit, but Kog, Corki, and Ez used to go very low crit builds for the first couple items, but now they pretty much have to invest in the RNG.","replies":[{"poster":"rampaging poet","date":"2015-10-31T02:42:06.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, makes sense.  I don't play those ADCs very often, so I forgot about the Triforce builders.  The Triforce builders get a lot of damage from their abilities, so building more AD makes sense.  Kalista also gets most of her damage from Rend instead of auto-attacks, so she just needs the AS and AD.\n\nEveryone else gets their damage from auto-attacks, so critical hit chance is better on them.  Regardless of the fact that bad runs of non-crits (which happen less often than they would if each attack \"really\" had 50% crit chance or whatever), your expected damage output increases faster by \"investing in the RNG.\"  So much faster that after you have one real AD item buying more AD is pointless.  That's why any items they want ADCs to seriously consider have crit - because otherwise they aren't real options.","replies":[{"poster":"RisenDarkKnight","date":"2015-10-31T06:07:29.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh i know crit builds are usually better.
