The problem is that he is already practically useless against vayne thx to her retarded tumble for free auto abuse and because supports are quite strong atm, thus able to keep vayne safe during her \"weak\" early.\n\nWhat he needs is to have is his early game buffed not his mid/lategame, I would gladly take 35-40% early and stay with 50% late, as opposed to the 30% his passive currently gives him, to profile him as the early game bully he is supposed to be, instead of buffing his lategame. It is pointless because no matter how well he does he will always get outscaled by her due to silver bolts true dmg bs, just like every other counterable adc (all of them).\n\nAs for the current state of Vayne, I'm so forking fed up seeing her just about every goddamn game here on EUW, in the last 40-50 games I've played I can literally count on one hand the ammount of times Vayne has NOT been in the game.
