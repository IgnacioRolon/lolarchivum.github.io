Not having a ranged champion capable of poking towers is a massive disadvantage, since to break the deadlock you either then have to have an objective outside of the tower to fight over (dragon/baron, time limited), a champion with sufficient dueling ability to be able to take a 1v1 under a tower and win while not ahead in gold (when that happens they generally get swiftly kicked), or a comp that can tower dive and come out ahead while even in gold (see previous point).

Adcs power is primarily in auto-attacks which they can fire off from a distance. The primary way to buff them up is through itemization which is why they're put bot as a farming champ while a non-farming support sticks by to make it tougher for dive fighters and assassins to lane against them. They get less experience due to being in a duo lane, but still get as much gold as a solo laner since they're the only one csing.\n\nA mage, fighter or assassin bot lane would require the exp more: mages need levels to buff up their abilities' base damages which is where their big powerspikes come from, fighters need to buff up all their stats to survive in a melee, stats which are gained through level ups. Assassins are a mix, needing both stats and ability damage to kill carries fast. Tanks are similar to assassins to, but a further disadvantage is they lack the kill potential of the previous three classes so can't try to just repeatedly kill their laner instead to set them super far back.\n\nThe reason morde is successful (or was) is specifically because of the ridiculous exp bonus passive. Zilean might be able to broaden the bot lane meta, but probably only to fighters and assassins, 2 mages is easier to counter thanks to ad+mr items and tanks can probably be bullied easier. Even then, you still need a marksman on the team to provide solid tower siege unless you had an azir or maybe some weird comp built around initiating on a tower with sion and an ohmwrecker before trying to tear it to pieces as fast as possible.\n\nTLDR: Marksmen need less exp than other classes so can duo lane better","replies":[]},{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2015-11-10T15:50:26.431+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think about it this way. If marksman can go to other lanes, they most likely will. Bot lane has traditionally been the marksman lane mainly because drag was there, and he's a major early game objective. But now we have the rift scuttler that's accessible from top lane, that just happens to go a lot smoother with two people attacking it. Two people like... marksman and support. Top lane marksman/support (or just solo marksman/jungler) could control that crab (and its delicious buff) quite easily.\n\nAlso, if a marksman can now solo lane without the need or help of a support, then _your team won't need a support_. That's right, one of the most unpopular roles in the game is now going to be optional with marksman going into solo lanes. Support mains can still support if they want to, but they might be supporting the top laner, or even the mid. Or {{champion:432}} could follow the jungler around, gathering chimes and providing healing shrines. Yes, that means less XP for anyone the support attaches to, but you get to have someone there to watch your back and help ward with you. Might not be a bad trade for some people, especially if you get counter picked in lane.\n\nOf course, that scenario also means that there might not even be a support in the game at all. Bot lane could be a tank and a fighter, both grabbing a {{item:3302}} and sharing CS. There could be duo mids; one assassin for damage and one mage for utility, both bursting down the unlucky bastard on the other side.

It's lasted this long because, objectively, it's the most efficient way to place your team for the distribution of gold and levels. Certain ranged carries can still go mid, because at the time they were designed, a ranged AD in mid was still a frequent choice due to the safety of a close tower and the guaranteed ability to farm. It shifted to what we have now once players figured out that mages really need levels AND items to maintain relevancy and most supports could function with few, if any items.\n\nDon't speak about \"the meta\" as if everyone is just a brainless sheep. While certainly those exist, the reason the meta evolved to what it is has more to do with logical placement of roles. You could argue that this is a design flaw of League's map layout, since the sidelanes don't offer any kind of real protection for a melee pairing nor do they encourage putting only a single champion down there due to the existence of the dragon. In fact, the design of the game requiring that you always have a jungler, reducing lane dynamics and choice, is something that likely contributes to this as well but I won't get into here as it's off-topic and not relevant to my point.\n\nMy point is that people play these lanes because they're efficient and generally agreed upon by a majority of players. If you have a frequent premade group that shakes things up, then more power to you, but hopefully your group realizes the disadvantages of your choices and works to offset them as much as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"MidEvilKnight3k","date":"2015-11-10T15:49:24.195+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The good players thought about what would be most efficient, but most people are just mindless sheep that follow it.

League doesn't give you much time to work out any alternate strategies in champion select for some reason, so the most popular way to decide who goes where tends to prevail.\n\nAs to Varus mid, I must have been the only person left in the game who wasn't surprised by it. When Varus was released, a ranged AD in the mid-lane was still a common choice so his kit was designed to function there. This is a symptom of Riot building champion kits that are designed to fit the meta the champion is released in, which is another issue altogether that I won't get into here. My point is that Varus was taken into a lane he was designed to be in and was successful. That's not surprising at all, nor am I surprised that the playerbase is either too new to have known that or had forgotten this fact.

If you can make it to level 3 with a yas or Xin bot, you're usually alright. But typically you get poked out of range to cs the melee creeps from someone standing behind their ranged creeps, who is also snowballing the wave so you can't fight but they can because they never have to take minion aggro and if you mess up anything at all in the fight you get taken down to 20% HP\n\nHonestly, melees don't get enough compensation for being melee in early levels.","replies":[{"poster":"SoMNia","date":"2015-11-11T01:02:42.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But I heard they changed minion aggro to make ranged champs less able to abuse melee ones in lane.

If an enemy is near your minions and attacks you, those minions will attack them. So if your lane opponent gets super aggressive with poke to stop you from CSing, they'll probably draw minion aggro.
