Laning phase is basically baiting her Riposte with your E (many people don't know that you can activate your stun after 1 second you don't need to wait entire duration) and she apparently didn't know or if she's smarter you can force it sometimes with your burst or if you're fast enough you can ignore her  W entirely (her parry lasts 0.75 second while you can use your stun after 1 second up to 2 seconds). Also keep in mind that her W CD is longer than your E and you can sidestep her parry and then engage again after a while (sidestepping is easier when you have phage). You can harass her with your WQ combo or after level 6 auto attack on minion then Q aa W, it works well when she just used her Q because she won't be able to gapclose to you and Riposte your stun when you're disengaging. After 6 you can bait her ult and then disengage with ward Q (but you need turret nearby because she will definitely chase you) and when it wears off you can come back with your rotation and beat her easily. \n\nYou can't duel her during mid game though because she has uper hand with Black Cleaver and Hydra but after you finish your Trinity and Gunblade she loses (it was satisfying to see her doing some dancing with Q and flash, doing some AA resets and still lose to Jax that was standing still whole the time). After that you should complete some tanky items like GA, Frozen Mallet etc. and from that point onwards she loses 1v1 terribly.
