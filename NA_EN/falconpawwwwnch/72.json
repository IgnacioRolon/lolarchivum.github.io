So what are you getting at?\n\nDoesn't really matter if you out damage, if they are winning more games, that's all that matters. \n\nNot only that, Jax is a strictly single target combat fighter. Moakai is an AoE team-fighter. It isn't difficult to figure this out dude. Especially when you consider Jax's ult does no damage outside of passive and Moakai's does quite a bit in extended fights. \n\nAnd Jax's preference is to split push all game where as Maokai wants to team fight....If anything, I would be shocked if Jax had more damage dealt than Maokai. That would be a sign that Jax is overtuned....yet again. \n\nThe same is directly applicable to Malphite as well.
