This is because if they can build damage they are a massive source of damage throughout a teamfight - the raw sustained damage of a High-AD, Crit-hitting carry with Lifesteal to sustain them makes them a necessary part of every team comp. They take down towers the fastest, they deal the most reliable damage, and so on. Part of the balance to this is to force them into a \"risk vs reward\" build path - the offensive items they want won't give them the defenses they need.\n\nBasically if ADs had easy access to AD/Armor, they'd just stack that item and call it a day. In early/mid game, the biggest threat to the bot lane AD is the enemy bot lane AD. So you rush that item, and then you get into a race against the enemy where you're both just stacking as much of it as you can because there's no reason not to - you get both stats you need to kill the other.\n\nAPs have a little bit of this but not in a way that would be abused like the ADs. For one, AP paths tend to be less rigid. With few exceptions, ADs build very predictable items. PD/IE/LW/BT is pretty much standard for your average ADC. Sure, an AP can rush Abyssal, but Abyssal isn't always the best item for APs. To get the MR reduction you have to get close to your target, so that part is ineffective if you're a long range mage. And if you're a High-AP Ratio mage that wants to rush a Rabadons, you may not rush Abyssal. Same for mages who need to rush the Hourglass for their ultimates or to survive a bursty enemy.\n\nEven in terms of boots. As a Mage V Mage. Build Sorcs, and be squishier, but deadly? Or build Mercs, and be beefier? And what if the enemy has CC, but you want burst? Where as ADs almost always just go Berzerkers.\n\nAlso, APs tend to be more focused around burst - cast a few spells, throw all your shit on CD, and then hope you live long enough for your next spell rotation. So having defenses during your \"down time\" is more crucial for mages. ADs, on the other hand, never have downtime because they can always AA.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-06-09T09:38:24.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Atma's Impaler had every stat that an ADC wants:\n\nthe most gold efficient AD in the game - equal to a BF sword late game on base HP alone.\n15% crit, only 5% off from Shiv.\n45 armor.\n\nonly 2200 gold with Avarice blade as a component.\n\nWas Atma's core on all ADCs?","replies":[{"poster":"Kouga","date":"2015-06-09T19:55:10.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BluePolarizer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8aloiiIU,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2015-06-09T09:38:24.268+0000)\n>\n> Atma's Impaler had every stat that an ADC wants:\n> \n> the most gold efficient AD in the game - equal to a BF sword late game on base HP alone.\n\nIt may be \"gold efficient\" in terms of its *cost*, but in order to actually **get** a BF's sword with of AD, you had to have 3,333 HP (and to get a Blood Thirster's worth of damage, which at the time of Atma's was 100, you'd need twice that much health).
