You said that, for 3 seasons, top is full of ranged cancer. It is fact that those champions I listed are not only considered viable, but really strong, and each one is melee. Rumble is a strong melee top laner. It is VERY common to have melee v melee in the top lane. Riven is pretty strong right now. Darius struggles, but it's not because of his lane phase.

Any sort of damage that you do to a champ will aggro enemy minions when you and the opponent are near them. Its similar concept to how towers aggro you except they have a larger range and don't move around like minions. \n\nExample, GP, MF, Pre-rework Ryze, and Veigar shoots a enemy champ. The poking champ is in his minion wave (meaning in between caster and melee minions), opponent is roughly safe position. That shot dealing the damage will aggro the opposing minions.\n\nWhat I was trying to get at is that minions tend to fight minions unless aggro'd, and that it is easier for ranged champ to avoid the aggro by being further away from the enemy minions.","replies":[{"poster":"Bodkins Odds","date":"2015-06-09T20:27:34.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, Akali & Shen Q's don't draw minion aggro, but I think those are special cases.
