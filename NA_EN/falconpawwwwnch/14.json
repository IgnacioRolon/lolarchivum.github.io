And remember, life on hit bypasses armor, so it's only 166 AD against a target with ZERO armor. This was a massive nerf to melee dps top lane and Riot never addressed this. Every single melee champ that would start with doran's blade was nerfed very hard and no explanation or compensation was made. \n\nBasically means that AD champs cant really compete with tanks in lane right now because doran's shield is far superior, unless you have stupid mechanics and lane power like Irelia and Riven. Doran's blade is currently the weakest of the 3 doran's items by quite a margin; long sword outclasses blade by quite a margin\n\nAlso, at the people saying \"don't buff all of the doran's blade users because you'll buff the ones that are already strong,\" nobody plays AD champs in competitive now unless you're Irelia.

Of course Dorans is better in that scenario. What you're really comparing is is Doran's shield and 1 health potion to Cloth armor and 5 health potions. And Cloth 5 gives a far great amount of effective health against AD champions except over a very long period of time, like 8+ minutes of laning. It's also more gold efficient since you can use the cloth armor to build into a better item wheras you're stuck with shield.","replies":[{"poster":"Z Statistic","date":"2015-06-10T15:10:44.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"edit: forgot to factor in armor from cloth. It's about 5 minutes and 30 seconds.\n\nAssume we have 600 HP and 31 armor from runes and masteries. Then the EHP at lvl 1 with 5 red potions is 1768.5. Even if we assume the worst possible scenario of the enemy Vayne at lvl 1 having 100 AD, the effective armor increase is +42. So, the amount of time required to make Doran shield1 better than cloth5 is entirely based on the hps shield gives. So the equation can be found as such:\n\n(680+1.2x+150)*1.73=1977\n\nX is the amount of time needed for the regen to eclipse. The solution to this equation is 192 seconds.\n\nSo unless you expect to DIE in 3 minutes top lane vs a full AD Vayne, Doran's shield is 100% better than cloth five on most top laners because it gives so much effective armor than you don't need chain vest and instead can start building BoRK or Hydra or something more offensive oriented.","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-06-10T16:01:33.995+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly have no idea where your numbers are coming from. The way I see it, you're comparing 2 seperate things; the value of 15 armor vs. 80 health and 8 less damage from autos and single target spells; and the 6 per 5 regen of shield to 4 health potions. From a purely sustain standpoint, 4 potions are worth 600 health, and 6 per 5 regen, or 1.2 per second is worth 600 health after 500 seconds, or 8 minutes and 20 seconds. From a pure sustain standpoint, it takes a very long time for shield to surpass what 4 potions would give you. \n\nSo from a pure sustain standpoint, cloth 5 is clearly superior to Shield except after a considerable amount of time. But how does the damage reduction between cloth armor and shield compare? Let's take your example of 600 hp and 31 armor. Now lets slap on a cloth armor and bring up up to 46 armor. 600 hp x 1.46 armor modifier = 876 effective health against physical damage without accounting for any sustain. Let's assume that the enemy Vayne walks into lane with a dorans and 77 AD. It will take her 12 auto attacks to kill you assuming you just let her wail on you and she didnt use any abilites. Now lets compare it to dorans shield. 680 hp x 1.31 armor modifer = 891 effective health against physical damage without accounting for sustain. However, Dorans shield reduces auto damage by 8, so lets just say that Vayne's autos will do 69 damage instead of 77. With 891 effective health, it will take vayne almost exactly 13 auto attacks to kill you, so we'll go ahead and make it take 1 extra auto to account for shields sustain. \n\nSo 14 autos versus 12 is definitely in favor of shield in early fights. But how often do those 2 autos make a difference against a ranged champion in lane? Vayne isn't going to auto you 14 times in a row, she's going to pepper you with 1-2 autos at a time until you are low enough for her to zone you. And in that situation, the extra potions from a cloth start as always going to be worth more than the 6 per 5 regen of shield. I personally don't think dorans shield is a terrible start, but I do think that it is only worthwhile if you're running defensive runes and masteries to better synergize with shields damage reduction passive. I would not recommend dorans shield on more offensively oriented champions like Garen, Riven, or Jax; other options are simply better. But if you want to run a ton of armor runes on Nasus with 21 defensive masteries, feel free to rock that dorans shield. I still think that starting cloth 5 so you can get glacial shroud earlier is probably better in most cases, but shield can definitely work if you feel you can avoid getting low enough to be zoned early in lane. One champion that I think does particularly well with shield is {{champion:98}}, the damage reduction combined with his own sustain and harass can make it very easy to slowly push less sustain oriented champions out of lane. Generally speaking, that is the kind of champion I like to get Dorans on, whether it be shield or blade. Alot of arguments are made for the superiority of longsword 3 pot over dorans blade 1 pot, but I think Dorans blade is better if you can realistically wear through enemy sustain and then force them out of lane with your now effectively free lifesteal.

And I play and build him quite a bit differently than most people and build quite a bit of lifesteal early on. I know that even if an ability hits me while my wall is on cooldown, I can dash out of range, recharge my shield, and lifesteal the health I lost back. Then after that, just all in, cause I'm that kind of person. \n   EDIT: And to add to the wall part, I once had to play against a duo top while playing with some low level friends and had no choice but to use my wall when I wanted to get some cs. Tristana+Teemo combo too much xD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FalconPawwwwnch","date":"2015-06-09T18:40:51.976+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"Ranged champions don't interact with you though\n\nThey spam no counterplay targetted skills and autoattacks to poke you\n\nUntil all of their damage is avoidable the only things melee can do is out stat them.

A recharging shield to mitigate poke, a wind wall to block incoming damage, dashes to gapclose, disengage, and avoid any skillshot. And yes he has the double crit passive to out-stat, but that doesn't really matter until laning phase is over or almost over.\n\nAn ability like Rammus' W creates interesting interactions where for a period of time, ranged laners don't really want to autoattack you (if rammus were played in lane)\n\nEven if you disagree with me about that, my position is still, \"Oh, Fiora, trynd, renek, shyv, are all weaker than ranged top laners because dorans doesn't work as well on them? Let's buff those melee top laners' abilities, instead of buffing the item.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DropFill","date":"2015-06-09T17:54:06.279+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope they see this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-06-09T18:34:14.954+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:107}} {{item:1055}} {{item:1055}} {{item:1055}} {{item:1055}} \n___\nBRING IT BACK@!! lol","replies":[{"poster":"theragingnerd","date":"2015-06-09T18:37:17.901+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RobtoN25,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bwikknfN,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-06-09T18:34:14.954+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:107}} {{item:1055}} {{item:1055}} {{item:1055}} {{item:1055}} \n> ___\n> BRING IT BACK@!! lol\n\nLATE MID GAME BUILD","replies":[]}]}]}
