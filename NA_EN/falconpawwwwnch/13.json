During season 3, Renekton was _sort of_ like the Vayne of toplane; though he wasn't actually all that powerful, most other toplaners had been crippled by repeated nerfs, leaving Renekton with little to no competition. After a few months of this, Riot vowed to bring toplaners back up to Renekton's level, as they deemed him to be at an appropriate power level when compared to other champions in other lanes. Thus, the \"Renekton Bar.\"\n\nRiot later went back on this vow, as instead of buffing 85% of toplaners, they simply decided to nerf Renekton instead, thus lowering the \"Renekton Bar\" and solidifying toplane as a purely stagnant and rather useless position; \"The Island.\" \n\nIt was only with the Summoner Spell overhaul that toplaners actually became relevant again, by means of the reworked Teleport.","replies":[{"poster":"VardenSalad","date":"2015-09-22T18:58:23.419+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Immediately after the Renekton nerfs, we had wet noodle fights for a year as Mundo and Shyvana sat around doing nothing.\n\nWas such a joke after the bruiser bloodbaths of the Olaf, Riven, Jax, Tryn, Irelia era.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2015-09-22T22:11:35.434+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jax could outplay him level 1 methinks ... then again, he was god tier too.\n\n*\"Ooh, nice double kill bot, Jax is getting farm though ... dangerous\"* \n\n*\"Alright, 15 minutes, time for Jax to win lane\"*\n\nGooood times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"brad","date":"2015-09-22T16:47:14.979+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"literally who asked for a renekton buff?\n\njust because you saw one thread with 3 upvotes doesnt mean \"people\" want it, it means that some dude got on his smurfs and upvoted his thread a couple times","replies":[]},{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2015-09-23T09:10:08.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, but at the same time do you enjoy fighting Darius, Fiora, Fizz, Garen, Gangplank more than Renekton?\n\nAt least you knew that Ren would fall off and you could play back for 15 minutes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gimilee","date":"2015-09-23T00:19:01.457+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"These people who want Renekton buffs are the salty ones that DID main Renekton and loved winning every game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-09-22T21:14:47.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FalconPawwwwnch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=h82Ef4d6,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-09-22T06:37:21.299+0000)\n>\n\n> he hard ccs you and bursts you then dashes away and you can't do anything\n\nThis is what I believe to be most problematic about him. He dashes to you, stuns you, heals off you, then dashes out before the stun wears off. He just took half your health while you were stunned and couldn't fight back, it's the definition of a zero-counterplay combo.
