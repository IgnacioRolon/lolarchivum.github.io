It's pretty dumb that ADCs give up nothing for the QQS effect. In previous seasons if you wanted QSS you lost a slot so buying a QQS actually had a tradeoff. Now ADCs just get a super efficient upgrade to the strongest item effect in the game. If Riot want to see tanks competitively again they need to remove or at least cripple this item.\n\nYou can even see this from which tanks are kinda playable right now. Ali's super good, his CC cannot be removed by QSS. Braum is strong, knockup on ult. Zac has a lot of knockups. Before them Grag relied entirely on displaces.
