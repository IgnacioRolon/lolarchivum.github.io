He had everything a mage could have: moderate CC, high DPS and good zoning &amp; sieging power. I don't want to remember the time he was meta because his soldiers could potentially chunk you with 1 Q and 2-3 autos from it. Even tanks struggled trying to face him. I even cringed at how fast he can siege and/or take down squishies and tanks when I played him a few times.\n\n- 99% Ban rate Kassadin:\nTo the people who are new to League, you're really glad you never had to face this.

His W mana steal was removed long before then when League was still removing some of their initial DotA carry-over mechanics to differentiate itself from its predecessor. It gave him mana on hit during the 99% ban rate days, but didn't steal it. That's a pretty important distinction.\n\nCome to think of it, did he ever steal mana? I thought it was a mana burn, a la Anti-Mage.. Hmm... To the archives!\n\nEdit: Found it. His mana drain was removed in patch V1.0.0.96. Very old players may recognize this as the time they were made men, as Xin Zhao was released this same patch, Wriggle's Lantern was introduced, and Season One began.
