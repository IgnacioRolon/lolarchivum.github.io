Ryze gets his damage from mana, meaning that he builds Frozen Heart and Rod of Ages, instead of the full tanky items. Think of him like an AP bruiser with an unhealthy design.\n\nYou do still have a point, though, that you shouldn't be able to be too tanky and still have moderate damage. I think that the changes they're proposing on the PBE are aimed at solving this, but seems more like a nerf to be honest (though this is now somewhat off-topic).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BerserkGoldfish","date":"2015-04-14T03:43:59.734+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":"but hes tanky","replies":[{"poster":"FalconPawwwwnch","date":"2015-04-14T03:45:36.089+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"See above comment","replies":[{"poster":"BerserkGoldfish","date":"2015-04-14T03:56:01.521+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":9,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FalconPawwwwnch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rNYqmlK0,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-04-14T03:45:36.089+0000)\n>\n> See above comment\n\nhow about ryze doesn't have to deal with {{item:3075}} , {{item:3143}} , {{item:3110}} , {{item:3047}} , {{champion:33}} , gromp buff, chance of crit failing him, {{champion:17}} , {{champion:133}} , {{champion:24}} , can also slow with this lil thing called {{item:3116}} \n\nalso, no, but one of his targeted snares","replies":[{"poster":"FalconPawwwwnch","date":"2015-04-14T04:08:59.975+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"ADCs don't lose all their damage when they get silenced, Rylai's is not innate, he'll pay 3k gold for that.
