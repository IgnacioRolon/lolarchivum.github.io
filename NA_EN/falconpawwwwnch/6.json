In this particular case base AD/total AD ratios are things we're looking to focus on juggernauts much more than mobile melee.\n\n\nIrelias don't get her damage so much from anything besides triforce and her kit these days and much of that is from the procs which in turn are based on the champs base AD. And if you simply nerf Irelia's base AD to make Irelia Players less interested in Trifroce and Sterak's there will be little reason to play Irelia. Yes you tried making triforce suck and it worked wonders in making Irelia overall weak. #Season3NeverForget.\n\nAlso Irelia's only ability that benifites from the base AD boost of Sterak's is bladesurge. Her ult gets no damage boost from Sterak's making it hardly a win win situation in getting a Sterak's and more would be gotten from something like either hydra.\n\nBack in season 2 however there was a second damage item that Irelia players tended to get a lot in Wit's end, some would even rush it a lot. This was back when it had a cost around 2150 for 42 on hit magic damage and 40% attack speed but did not steal enemy MR just gave the owner of the item more MR (20 MR maxing out at 45 MR after 5 auto attacks and today would be fine with 25 MR maxing out  at 45 given the changes to MR since then).\n\n It however is not cost efficient enough to justify getting wits these days in most cases since triforce is not as all around good as it was in season 2. Triforce is now more of an offensive item then an it was back then (150% base AD on hit then vs 200% Base AD on hit now now and also 300 health then VS 250 health now) meaning it is more ideal to get a defensive item instead.\n\nSterak's is not really an ideal time for Irelia overall and Triforce would need some kind of nerf to make Sterak's become somethign to realyl justify. But that would likely jsut kill off Irelia.\n\nSo while I am not fully against some changes to Irelia it would be nice if you at least made there be some good offensive options besides just trifroce if you are going to be nerfing her triforce power spike. And FYI BotRK is not an ideal weapon for Irelia in most cases. She will be taking hits and Wit's end allowed for better tanking some hits while also doing some damage that is also not auto countered by stacking armor. Her kit is that of an assassin that does not use stealth or blinks but is resistant to most forms of CC and being tanky enough to not get instantly killed.\n\nI know you plane to rework Irelia at some point but until that actually happens don't make her trash just because marksmen and sona players complain  about any assassin that is able to assassinate them.\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Declined","date":"2015-10-10T17:27:52.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've purposely NOT used Steraks because I can't figure out which champions benefit from this item AT ALL!!!!\n\nLooking at it from an objective perspective, I would say that the ad ratio is pretty low so can you give us a list champion skills using base ad ratios and items.\n\nWould it be possible  to change  the skill description of champions?\n\nOr better yet, change the item description for Sterak to match the champion that you're curretly using, or if viewed on the scoreboard to match the champion currently using that item.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rustling Bush","date":"2015-10-09T21:18:45.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree but i don't understand what you are talking about, someone explain ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)","replies":[{"poster":"FalconPawwwwnch","date":"2015-10-09T21:24:43.843+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Base AD is what Sterak's Gage gives, not Bonus AD. \n\nFor example take a champ with 120 Base AD at level 18, Sterak's gives them 30 AD. \n\nHowever, this is not the same type of AD that 3 long swords give, as that AD is bonus AD. \n\nTypically, most champions with AD ratios on abilities have BONUS ad ratios, not base ad ratios, so they get no benefit on their abilities from building Sterak's. \n\nHowever, champions like Darius/Morde/Olaf/Irelia DO have total AD ratios, meaning steraks buffs their abilities too. \n\nThe OP suggests to rework other bruisers' AD ratios to scale with total AD. the Base damage ends up being similar, but they gain benefits from steraks","replies":[{"poster":"Rustling Bush","date":"2015-10-09T21:27:54.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"does this apply to jax to? i often see pro builds with sterak in them so i'm assuming that jax's abilities scale sterak","replies":[{"poster":"FalconPawwwwnch","date":"2015-10-09T21:40:13.587+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, Jax doesn't have any total AD ratios\n\nHowever, Jax builds trinity force, which scales off of base AD. \n\nJax has about 120 Base AD at level 18, so his triforce procs do 240 damage\nSterak's increases base AD by 25% so to 150, so his new triforce prods do 300 damage","replies":[{"poster":"Cerbearus","date":"2015-10-09T22:17:16.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Trinity force scales off Base AD, not total","replies":[]},{"poster":"Messaiga","date":"2015-10-10T06:17:51.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also worth noting, when the passive on Sterak's Gage activates it grants an additional +25% base AD.
