It's a pain sometimes but there are far worse and less telegraphed moves.\nHer ult - she can heal in an area and knock you back with the initial bit of it.

Teamfight meta? She can help to effectively reset what would be a lost teamfight with a well-timed ult. \n\nShe's always effective in a way that very few other supports are, so she almost always has a strong standing in terms of statistics.

She has clear highs (peeling, buffing an AD ally, cock-blocking engages) and clear lows (squishy, no poke, no sustain outside of the ult that is generally best used for something else than strictly healing, channeled ult). She is very strong against engage champions and people who rely on dashes for their mobility, and very weak against poking champions and champions who blink and/or who can hard CC from afar.

That sounds like me.\n\nI'd only be a hypocrite if I was 'defending an obviously over powered champion' while playing another. She is disengage and in rare cases engage. Considering that this game is pretty much all about burst and mobility right now I'm glad she exists. She offers what no other support does but is also very squishy if you get onto her. That might not be easy but the same can be said about catching Lee Sin or any other number of champions with disengage.\n\nYou say the stats wouldn't be ok for a jungler etc but if she was any of those positions her kit wouldn't make sense. She isn't any of those and can't do any noticeable damage on her own. She is a support that enables an ADC and can disengage well but any real dedicated gank will kill her and / or the ADC. If your problem is that you can't turret dive and kill then escape then that's a good thing because it's too easy to do that right now and has been for a while.","replies":[{"poster":"Dyonas","date":"2016-02-15T23:59:43.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YCitizenSnipsY,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZOvdue0x,comment-id=00020000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-02-15T19:58:35.244+0000)\n>\n> So let me get this straight just so I understand you. \n> \n> You don't think a champion that is head and shoulders above every other champion in their role is a problem.

Since you know a support boasting those kind of stats is apparently not a big deal.\n\nAgain Janna has a lower skill floor so her doing well overall shouldn't be a big surprise. In fact her win rate currently is only 54% which is 2% higher than Sona and Blitzcrank who are relatively in the same skill level. \n\nIt's not that big of an issue. \n\nNow if we had a high skill floor champion with a good win rate (like Vayne) then we have an issue. When a champion that is difficult to master is doing well in all ranks it shows that this champion is op.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
