It went through Jax' E because Nasus' Q is hardcoded to be undodgable which got never changed since the removal of Dodge as a purchaseble stat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2015-11-13T00:55:16.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1ErFQgBj,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-11-12T06:22:32.605+0000)\n>\n> There are a few on hits (6-10 from memory) that didn't get properly updated to respect the revised blind/dodge/block rules.
