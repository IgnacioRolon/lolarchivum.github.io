Different champions for different jobs.\n\nAnd don't tell me that that doesn't matter, I mean if you really want to balance a team between its carries for example, you wouldn't try to force a true hyper carry ADC like Vayne or Kog'Maw into the same team as a late game AP Marksman like certain builds for Cass or Azir. Most teams would try to pair up a mid game Burst ADC to make the best out of all stages of the game with those kinds of champions, so there is in fact strategic diversity.\n\nThat's also one last point. Riot never promised Champion Diversity, they promised Strategic Diversity. The large majority of the work they did with the Jungle items and Jungle rework was literally exactly that, cutting off the excess fat in Champion Diversity so they can highlight Strategic Diversity instead (ex. While the gigantic pool of champions that were able to Jungle with S4's Spirit Stone can no longer do so in S5, different classes of Jungle champions are getting highlighted, like our transition from strictly bruiser Junglers to tank Junglers being the norm and multiple other Junglers revolving around them).\n\nEDIT: Hell, if you watched the LCS long enough, you should know by now that even the whole idea of a \"duo lane Support+ADC bot lane\" is and has been flimsy for quite a while now. Lane swaps, solo Marksman top with Support+Bruiser/Tank bot, the infamous \"double jungle\" from S4, and so on. The players sitting in the highest level of play don't even respect the idea of abiding exclusively to this meta.\n\nEDIT EDIT: To those of you reading wondering about why Supports \"must\" exist, consider this for a moment.\n\nThere are 3 lanes, and one Jungle, 4 streams of consistent income. There are 5 people on the map. You have the option to either split one of those consistent streams of income among two people, or starve one.\n\nNow consider that power tends to ramp exponentially in this game (especially for Carries), meaning two half developed people are not necessarily equivalent to one fully developed person.\n\nAlso consider that there are a lot of elements in the game that do not rely on gold, which we tend to put all into one name: utility. CC, movement speed buffs, enemy debuffs, etc.\n\nWith these three elements in mind, consider why Supports are nearly \"mandatory\" if you want to focus on efficiency.","replies":[{"poster":"FalconPawwwwnch","date":"2015-06-11T03:09:45.382+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":9,"body":"Okay, that doesn't change the fact that 18 champions make up 20% of each team, when there are about 120 champions","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2015-06-11T03:26:23.596+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"It does actually.\n\nThe whole \n>And don't tell me that that doesn't matter\n\nis literally exactly that.

If we want to change the bot lane meta, we're going to have to address somethings. Ranged AD *has* to be relatively weak in numbers and utility due to the power of range, so buffing them might crowd other classes out (and knowing us, we'll *still* send them bot lane). Buffing supports is out of the question, since too much utility and damage can hurt the game (release Zyra, for instance). Nerfing ADC's will Olaf them, and nerfing supports... it hurts.\n\nOne thing I could see is making a support item that rewards roaming, since we got an item that rewards being on the frontline {{item:3302}}, rewards poking {{item:3303}}, and rewards sustain/defensive passive play {{item:3069}}. All of these items, however, do one thing that encourages the support/adc bot meta: *you maximize your team gold income by staying in lane with someone else farming.* One item I could see to encourage a roaming support is similar to how Bard's meeps work: an item that boosts your xp and GP5 when you're out of range of minions and towers (basically in the jungle, I guess) that cancels out if you have machete (so junglers don't abuse it).

Even if they were that gamechanging, there is no reason why they couldn't function alone. It's not the strength of the class that causes the supports to always go with the ADCs. It's the strengths of other classes that lead them to want to avoid having a support in their lane.\n\nThe main reason why supports go with AD carries is because an ADC is the least level reliant laner on a given team, as well as usually being the worst roamer. Your average mage, assassin or bruiser gets more out of levels than an ADC does, and their skills are more suited towards roaming around the map and getting kills. That means that you want one of them in the midlane so they can have the most map pressure, and you want them there alone so that they can get levels and be impactful early. An ADC just needs gold to scale, so it's fine to throw the support with him. The lost exp won't cause nearly so much of a problem, and you throw them botlane to increase dragon control.\n\nTo put it simply, it's ok to have a Jinx that is level 6 when the solo lanes are level 8. If she's getting last hits, she'll be strong eventually, and she wasn't going to contribute massively in the midgame even if she had those levels. It's not ok for a Syndra or Fizz or Katarina to be level 6 if some people on the enemy team are level 8. They need that base damage to secure kills, and they really want to use the burst those levels give them to make thins happen around the map. Take it away from them, and they lose a ton of potential power.","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2015-06-11T05:05:36.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-06-11T14:14:12.118+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">Adding a support doesn't actually take away from a mid laner's exp.

Second, even with the bonus exp, you still end up with less experience than you would have alone. Your Syndra will have fewer levels than if she laned alone.

You are not going to deny that much experience with the short lane and the side bushes, particularly since the central position of the midlane makes it easy for other lanes and the jungler to support. You're not getting that much reward out of it. Hell, look up past replays of season 3 2v1 midlanes. People did shift the ADC and support to the midlane, and the midlaners usually ended up at a higher level than both of them, and this is before the change increasing the range on exp gain. It wasn't effective then, and there is nothing that would make it more effective now. It's just not nearly as good as you claim.\n\n>More importantly, if the support was a drain on exp as you claimed, why wouldn't the support lane with the bruiser/tank and give the marksmen solo exp?\n\nOpens up the ADC to playing against a 2v1 and being completely denied gold, and unlike a tank or bruiser, he can't go roam and try to make things happen on the map when he's in that position. A bruiser or tank can still preform actions early when put in a position when they can't farm.

Have you ever faced off against a Braum/Leona, or Sona/Karma bot lane (not to mention numerous other efficient combos)? Both of those comps can completely wreck an ADC at any point of the game, starting by dismembering ADCs early and making them useless for most of the game.\n\nI've had games as Sona/Karma bot lane where somehow the enemy team lasted 50 minutes+. Their ADC still died instantly to our burst, and was feeding so hard it wasn't even funny anymore. Turrets maybe went down slower than with an ADC, but with two Lich's Banes and a dedicated push any turret would either go down or be heavily damaged. \n\nPlaying a dual-tank bot lane is trickier, but with the right team setup, it's just as easy to get around, and tower dives galore. Any number of comps can smack the traditional bot lane so bad it's scary, really.\n\nAnd, yes, early game ADCs are the weakest class in the game statwise, by a fair margin.

Keeping the Sona/Karma bot lane, Karma takes the farm and acts as mage and Sona plays (not too) aggressively with Spellthief's, both of them sharing ward duty (until Yellow Trinket lvl 9) and both building straight AP, both of them should;\n1. Be able to largely outpoke you.\n2. Be able to outsustain you with two excellent defensive kits.\n3. At least keep up in farm, if they aren't denying you everything by making you go back every time you show back up in lane after level 4.\n\nIt does take a good Karma to handle the farm while still being able to poke or shield Sona against counterattacks. Their mid-game and late-game utility far outstrip the damage an ADC can bring as they both build AP and also have high damage, and this duo allows for insane teamfight potential.\n\nIf they kill the ADC so much as once, the lane is as good as won unless a major screw up happens. Far too much poke for the ADC to handle.\n\nMost of that lane will depend on your own support and how well they can cope/counter (Thresh/Blitzcrank/Nautilus), but the ADC himself can usually hardly do much, unless maybe it's Tristana/Varus/Caitlyn/Kog'maw.\n \n> No, marksmen as a class are better than pretty much every melee class earlygame and on par with mages earlygame. There is a reason why teams can run double marksmen with a marksmen soloing against the enemy mid laner with no problems but no team will ever run a 0 marksmen comp.\n\nThen explain how a smart lvl 3 Leona/Braum all-in can annihilate an ADC so easily? And with both players taking Relic Shield and maybe even Smite for later use/objectives/safe Relic Shield proccing, share ward duty (until Yellow Trinket lvl 9) and minions evenly, all it takes is a bit of communication to nullify an ADC and be able to tower dive very early.\n\nNot to mention the horror that can be a Thresh/Blitzcrank bot lane.\n\nAlso, ADCs are NOT on par with many if not most Mages early game. All it takes is an Anivia/Ahri/Any AP poke champion's Q and they win a trade, possibly without you ever being able to retaliate because of range. It only gets worse until the ADC itemizes, at which point they gain the sheer damage to even out the trades, or the lifesteal to negate the poke.\n\nAnd as far as rolling a 0 marksman comp goes, it's always possible to send an Ezreal/Kog'Maw/Ashe/Varus mid, or Quinn/Vayne top lane, and still do an ADC-less bot lane.","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2015-06-11T23:36:20.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2015-06-12T00:47:56.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=haaaaaaaalp,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7GMmT7IE,comment-id=000200010001000000000000,timestamp=2015-06-11T23:36:20.767+0000)\n\n> A few potions and vamperic dagger is a competent support is all the adc would need.\n> \n\nI'm just going to disagree with this one, since you don't seem to understand how powerful Karma/Sona's combined poke is.

A sport must have rules to what is allowed on the filed to make the game fair. All sports live by this rule to my understanding, so what's up with E sports?\n\nPerhaps queuing before a game you have to pick your role first. The match making system would then fill in the gaps, it could even state that more adc's are needed to queue requesting people to queue for the role if they can, that you cut down the wait time. When you get into champion select, say I queued tank I would only see tanks primary and tanks secondary to pick from. That would cut out the nonsense of first pick and you get a role you are good at. With this method people who carry their role get a better chance of winning. I know some people feel cheated when they get a role they aren't good at. They could have held their own playing what they are good at. Say I am a great quarterback and you make me a defensive lineman, do you think I will win? Honestly the concept is a win win for all. I would rather wait longer with a better chance of winning rather than queuing to losing a 40+ minute game, I never had a chance to win. This new concept gives the game true balance instead of true damage. \n\nI apologies about my other post.

And is one of the wost champions you can pick in that roll for killing towers(he doesn't build as much AS and has low range). \n\nAzir can probably out-kill a turret over most ADC's depending on his available W charges.

With an easy to gank nature putting her with a support isn't a bad idea either. \n\nSo why don't we see pro's doing it? \n\n- I guess first one is that they're mages and not ADC's. ADC mains master their right clicking. Not saying they cannot preform well on these champions, but it is a slightly different playstyle. \n- Heavy AP comps don't usually stay strong for long. And when they are strong it usually because of other champion types(generally bruisers/tanks) being strong. \n- ADC's don't need mana. In an extended fight they'll still put out dps. Cass and Azir can go OOM and end up useless. \n- They're chicken. \n- There isn't a reason to. I can't think of a team comp that justifies having heavy AD in all lanes but bottom. Most tanks are AP. Most mages are AP. Bruisers/assassins are roughly even. There is no roll that is as AD heavy as \"sustained damage + tower killing\" other than ADC's. \n\nIn short, it's the best option 99.99% of the time.

At all. Just, most of the playerbase is utterly TERRIFIED of antimeta (seriously, I just did Fiora support and so many people dodged despite us winning). A good lane to annihilate bot lane (adc+support) is duo bruiser. Kid you not. Fiora+Darius, Riven+Zed, Yas+Diana. These combos destroy bot lane. Sure, they may have a tank. But these people will decimate your bot lane long before they get those good items. Meta is defined by player experience, not by company edging (and Riot has not done a thing to ADC/Support). Also, someone else said it but in LCS the ADC is actually just wherever farm is. Again, this is player base meta not actual meta. However, if you want to Nautilus/Graves bot lane be my guest.

Now add in another one that demands peel, and that 2 on 2 is looking pretty juicy. Granted, not any bruiser/tank/fighter can go there- Nasus absolutely does not go bot for instance or Poppy. But, get someone with a gap closer or hard cc (or both like Gnar and Pantheon) and you are capable of completely taking the ADC out of early and maybe even mid game.
