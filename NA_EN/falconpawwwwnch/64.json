It heals two targets and provides a shield.\n\nHer heal is the weakest in the game actually. 30 at level 1. However it heals 2 people at once, so you could say it's 60. However, Taric's base heal is 60 for *both* him and his ally, and if used on himself then it's 84. Plus it scales off 30% of his AP (Sona's is 20%, 40% if you're counting both heals, but then Taric's would be 60%) plus 5% of his bonus HP.\n\nSona's heal becomes more powerful the lower HP the person is at, but it's not that big a boost. If she healed somebody at 0% HP she'd heal them for 45 HP at level 1.\n\nAs for the CD, Taric's is almost twice as long (8/7/6/5/4 seconds longer) but is twice as strong (at all levels) and costs the same (At level one, it becomes 10/20/30/40 mana more expensive at higher levels)\n\nSoraka's heal is obviously much stronger, cheaper, and on a lower CD, buuuut it also costs HP so I'm not gonna get in to that.\n\nAs for Sona's shield it is also super weak, but as it's a bonus I can understand that. However it has a very small range to apply and lasts for a second and a half, which compared to other shields is really short. Plus the mana cost is huge considering her base mana.\n> Also, Sona is hilariously easy.\n\nShe may be harder then you think. Not with her skills mind you, with the fact that her short range isn't about the support, but the ADC. Get in range to Q and most ADCs (Maybe not Graves) will be able to toss an AA or two and massively out damage you, considering how squishy Sona is.\nYou may say, \"Well she'll just heal up anyways\" and she would... If that wouldn't make her go OoM.\nShe can literally use W 3 times before going OoM at level 1. At level 2 she can use 3 W's, *and* a Q before going OoM.\n\nMy point is, I never saw Sonas dominating recently, yet she gets chain-nerfed to the point where most people seem to think she's not even that strong anymore, and then gets nerfed a few more times.\n\nI think it'd make more sense to reposition her power instead of hitting it until it stops moving.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Skernan","date":"2015-01-16T01:00:16.227+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"All three of those supports are tanky though.

And then the passive some more.\n\nThey absolutely ruined the W heal and upped the manacost to the heavens, but added a shield and a missing %HP scaling. \"We want more clutch heals and less keeping herself and her lane mate topped off\". And that'd be OK too - except they cut the %HP ratio IN HALF.\n\nAnd they give a joke compensation with her ultimate raising the aura effectiveness. Wow, that +30 damage/ally lategame is going to help a lot. It doesn't even compensate for other nerfs.\n\nSO, HER NEW \"ACTIVE\" SKILLS END UP LESS EFFECTIVE THAN OLD \"PASSIVE ONES\". Which means what they are doing to Sona is complete and utter FAIL, both from gameplay and aesthetics perspective.\n\nAnd Leona, Blitz and Thresh might have to \"land a skillshot\", true. But, for example, Blitz's reward for doing so results in kill or burning a flash 90% of the time. Leona \"landing a skillshot\" results in your face being melted if she's paired with an early aggressive ADC. Thresh... don't even bring him up. He is a god of supports, bar none. Morg probably gets you killed, especially if she has her ult too. Mind that Leona and Blitz have double the Sona's pickrate and same or higher winrate.\n\nFunfact: Nami literally does everything Sona does, but better.\nAnother fun fact: Leona and Thresh not only murder Sona by hitting one skillshot (but it's fair, right? because they have to \"hit a skillshot\") with Relic Shield heal more than Sona's W. And if Sona tries to use her heal more often than Shield charges are up, she goes OOM.
