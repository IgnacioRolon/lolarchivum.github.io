Mages can deal *more* damage at once, but while on CD they tend to be useless, where an ADC has a constant damage output.\n\nWhen considering their damage, though, you have to remember that most Champions naturally gain armor per level, but not all of them gain MR, and not at the same rate. And Armor / MR are not the same in terms of cost efficiency and itemization. And there are a lot of item tools to slow down an ADC (thornmail reflects damage, frozen heart slows their attack speed, randuins, etc) whereas there might be MR and spell shields, but there aren't items that \"reflect % Magic Damage back to the caster\" or \"increases nearby enemy cooldowns\"\n\nConsidering all of this - carries have almost always been \"supported\" in one way or another. Very early on, AD Mids were the meta but eventually they realized that it was more efficient to put them in a lane with a dedicated support - but the support would also take CS, because they needed farm too. So then Riot gave 'dedicated supports' ways of getting gold such as the GP5 items which eventually became the current Coin/Targan/Frost Queen items. At this point, it became more efficient to give the late-game carry all of the early-game farm, and the items and mechanics were built to reinforce this meta.\n\nIn the other lanes, however, since they are entirely solo they can more easily be influenced by changes in the items and jungle and even individual Champion strengths.\n\nSo the bot meta has stayed around so long because the game has grown up around it.","replies":[{"poster":"FalconPawwwwnch","date":"2015-04-19T18:13:35.339+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"If carries were vulnerable early game then they wouldn't be the best 2v2 lane in the game with a support\n\nName one lane that has the safety, early game power, and late game scaling that a ranged AD + support does\n\nYou can't, because ADCs are way to safe early game.
