It actually took quite a bit of skill to play him as the easiest and strongest counter to him was kiting, something everyone should be able to do. Despite this and my teammates lack of faith in me, like i mentioned before he was considered trash, i almost always ended up carrying every game.\n\nMorde couldn't 1 shot anything, not since DFG was removed, also considered trash although thats because no knew how to use him. He was very strong but definitely not 1 shot and definitely not tanky. Another champion who required some amount of skill to be effective as he was easily kited and poked without being able to trade back. He was also the only champion that used health as a resource that didn't have some way of gaining it back.  \n\nWhen a champion is simple, so is the solution to dealing with them. So there is a required amount of skill to successfully use said champion against higher skilled opponents.  \n\nSo just to reiterate, before the reworks, those were 2 of my mains along with Malzahar and Nami. After the rework they were both perma-banned or first pick, so i never got to play them which is why i was upset, not because they were nerfed... which doesn't make sense at all, Morde was op for a while and Garen was definitely stronger overall...

Rageblade for example's definitely too strong on Jax, but it's also just too strong across the board compared to other items. Similarly Warlord's Bloodlust was too strong in general compared to where T3 keystone masteries should be (though it's also possible Yasuo might be too strong as well, still watching that).\n\nWhat?

With or without Yasuo/trynd it was broken. \n\nMany of which might get looked at again.\n\nDeath fire even nerfing it the abusers would still have absurd win rates. 55% average on Anivia that goes up to above 60% with a few more games ok her.\n\nThat screams additional work is needed. It's in the game now, so we deal with it.\n\nSo deal with it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
