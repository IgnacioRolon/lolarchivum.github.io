For example Fiora vs Malphite. He has great waveclear, but it takes 2 abilities to clear the wave, while fiora with that item takes 3 AA and an item active. Hes using mana, Shes not, hes getting ultra pushed even tho he has an advantage over her, and shes just laughing in his face. But NOW, she has to fight on par with him. and this aplies to all champs that used to abuse the step itemo to win. as an Olaf main, the change actually hurt, because since there is no aoe, i have less health back from my W. but i see it as a fair change.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"charcharmunro","date":"2015-11-18T18:01:35.023+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"And yet every game I've been in there seems to be a damned Riven.

And then with new patches thousands of people just magically become \"sooo skilled\" at other champions?\nWhy do you think classes like support and tank exist? Precisely because not every champion poses the same danger when fed.\n\nA fed Viktor's abilities can be avoided. His laser is a skillshot. His ult takes a hellova lot of time to deal damage.
