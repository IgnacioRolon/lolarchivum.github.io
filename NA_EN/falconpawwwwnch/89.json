Tanks can't pull aggro.  So they have to have some *actual* reason to be a threat to the enemy team.\n\nSome Tanks do it with CC for days (Leona or Alistar)\n\nSome Tanks do it with significant damage over time (Amumu)\n\nSome Tanks do it by shredding enemy defenses and making their team mates more dangerous (Sion and Rammus)\n\nSome Tanks do it by putting out powerful auras that buff their buddies (Taric)\n\nSome Tanks do it by just *hurting a whole hell of a lot* (Tank Jman or Tank Vi)\n\nThere's no such thing as a 'Bruiser'.

You're misinterpreting the third point to mean a **damage** threat.\n\nThis was something LoL had to figure out a LONG time ago about tanks: this isn't an MMO, and other people don't have an aggro system. Building tanky in LoL doesn't do anything for your team if you're not the one taking damage. For you to be the one taking damage, the enemy team has to have a reason to attack you over someone else.\n\nWhat that reason is varies Champion to Champion, but a tank needs some reason they are a threat, or they simply get ignored, and can't tank anything. Sometimes that threat is spammable CC. Sometimes it's being a ridiculous peel for the Marksman. Sometimes it's simply that they have easy ways of diving onto the squishies and presenting a danger to them that way. It varies a lot, but a tank needs a reason to be hit, or he can't actually tank anything.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FalconPawwwwnch","date":"2014-12-16T16:36:01.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except I'm pretty sure a Frozen Heart-esque item would be much more useful on Alistar, Nautilus, and Maokai than on most fighters","replies":[{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2014-12-16T16:38:45.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"the thing is that fighters use EVERYTHING even the frozen heart","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-16T18:38:15.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Righteous Glory can fit the role perfectly IMO.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Done25","date":"2014-12-17T18:38:38.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, I would argue that a tank is just a melee range mage that deals lots of AoE damage over time. \n\nAluminum tears, tantrum, and curse.\nSinged poison.\nRammus Powerball and Tremors\nNautilus Wrath, Riptide, and Depthcharge.\nMaokai Sapling Toss, that ground smash move, and his freaking giant AoE explosion ultimate.\n\nI'd happily list more but heading to work. :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"FarRockBF","date":"2014-12-17T17:38:41.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's a tank?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bharhash","date":"2014-12-16T18:15:49.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it'd be interesting to make a defense version of Trinity Force would be pretty cool.
