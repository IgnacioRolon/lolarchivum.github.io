As a Juggernaut main I am T R I G G E R E D.\n\nInherently, most Juggernauts have ~5-10 more base movement speed. Also inherently, most ADCs have either heavy slows, spammable or long range dashes, or hard CC, or huge MS boosts.\n\n{{champion:18}} long range dash, knockback ult\n{{champion:498}} movement speed on W, 3-hit feather snare that's only dodgeable by sidestepping (aka not moving directly towards her, which increases the time it takes to get to her)\n{{champion:22}} Hard CC, heavy slow on every auto and long range W\n{{champion:51}} Traps, Dash has a slow attatched to it\n{{champion:222}} Traps, Slow\n{{champion:236}} Spammable Dash\n{{champion:96}} Slow.

Sure if the risk is too low Juggernauts would be broken. Now if the risk is too high like it currently is, getting within auto range of an ADC and then having them hit you with a hard CC, slow or kite you with dashes = dead in ~2 seconds, most of the time less than that. Currently Juggernauts are forced to only fight Marksman if they catch them off-guard from a bush or something. It should be the other way around. Now if they have an ally with them, that's different, but currently ADCs are doing this solo.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2018-01-12T04:07:59.733+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Currently Juggernauts are forced to only fight Marksman if they catch them off-guard from a bush or something. It should be the other way around.\n\nI don't agree. Juggernauts should have a hard time taking on ranged champions alone. They're defined by being immobile melees with mediocre initiation that are very susceptible to getting kited, but make up for it with very high melee fighting ability. When you compare them to a diver, they have greater threat as a frontline because they are naturally tanky and damaging, but they can't get onto ranged as easily as the diver or some other initiatior could. They have to rely on their team to some degree to set up fights for them, instead of setting them up themselves. That's the intended class weakness. Hell, Riot's initial gameplay update post for juggernauts said \"The archetypal raid boss [Nasus] can only do his thing when he’s in melee range, and his lack of gap closer means he often has to rely on allied speed boosts like Sivir’s On The Hunt or well-aimed crowd control like a Morgana binding to get close, but once he does, he unleashes the power of his trademark Siphoning Strike\". Relying on allies was a part of how they described the \"prototypical juggernaut\". That's intended.\n\nDivers should do great against ranged carries. Burst initiators should have the potential to easily fuck them up. Juggernauts? No. That should be challenging for them, unless they have help to get the fight started, or they make an ambush or flash play.\n\nAnd just to cover my ass for the boards because I know someone will bring this up, I am well aware that divers and other classes in general are having more trouble against AD carries than they should. That's a different discussion. It doesn't change that ranged kiting in general should be hard for a juggernaut to deal with, and an ADC beating them alone should be not be a rare occurance.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-01-12T06:16:55.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The kiting should be, the instant deletion once you get \"caught\" by a marksman should not be happening.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2018-01-11T13:14:51.501+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Never in league of legends we had melee meta\n\nSo I would welcome it with open arms","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-01-11T20:03:53.919+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"There was the time when the juggernauts were op.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2018-01-11T14:22:39.514+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"An eye for an eye makes the world go blind.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Elkington VI","date":"2018-01-12T00:48:22.467+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NineTailedMystic,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ldLvvYoy,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2018-01-11T11:05:46.429+0000)\n>\n> Because then if melees are too strong they just roll over everything that isn&#x27;t another melee regardless of kiting?\n\nThat's literally never how this game has worked, especially in today's CC/kite-heavy league.
