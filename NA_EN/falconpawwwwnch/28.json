I agree she's actually weak against poke and siege (even though she can counter siege decently with the tower shield), she wrecks both mobile and immobile melees regardless of the team comp unless you have some form or re-engage. With a Janna on the other team, melees simply can't go in and effectively renders them pretty much full-time peelers. If your ADC is behind you are done for.","replies":[{"poster":"VDc0zCqe0w","date":"2014-12-30T15:38:57.483+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"so you're saying a support that can only disengage...is good at doing so\n\nplay Rumble or Liss solotop instead of a bruiser, and she's not broken aymore\n\ncontrary to popular belief, Lissandra hard counters Janna in every single way","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2014-12-30T18:16:12.591+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well of course champs who have a hard time engaging have a hard time engaging on a champ based around disengage.

There are a million mages who won't let melee champs engage on them. Syndra will scatter and delete you, Cassiopeia will turn you to stone, Azir will push you back and dash away, etc. Difference between Janna and them?

Mages in general excell against melee. Comparing other supports: Nami will bubble you, kite you easily thanks to E + passive, poke you while healing herself and if all else fails use her ult to knock you up. A Nami that doesn't want you to get close won't let you any closer than Janna. Sona has E and her E Power Chord while poking and sustaining thanks to her other skills, etc. By the time you get to Sona you're half health. And again she has her panic button just like Janna: Crescendo.\n\nMages and mage supports as a class counter melee. Janna is better than the rest because of her MS steroids but she's not unique. Most mages say no to melee interaction unless that melee has a variety of gapclosers.","replies":[{"poster":"VDc0zCqe0w","date":"2014-12-31T00:06:46.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sona is utter shit at peeling TBH, Nami is pretty good, so are Zyra and Lulu\n\npeople hate on Janna cuz it's the FOTM","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SeargentAnus","date":"2014-12-30T04:49:41.682+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":8,"body":"This is because Janna is overloaded, and everyone seems to ignore it :/","replies":[{"poster":"VDc0zCqe0w","date":"2014-12-30T15:35:45.053+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"as long as Thresh exists, no other support has got an overloaded kit\n\ndelete Thresh from this game then i'll be fine with Janna nerfs","replies":[{"poster":"Taryn","date":"2014-12-30T18:56:59.335+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll drink to that!
