Making her Q cooldown begin after the 3rd Q (like was done to Jayce's hypercharge) would make her laning phase much more manageable. Making her instant aoe stun have a channel time like you did with Darius's Q would also help give her some counterplay. \n\nI understand as a company that Riven has a huge fanbase, so giving her a drastic change to her gameplay would cause massive lashouts from the playerbase. However, you have to consider the fact that she may have some very abusive mechanics in lane that allow her to win almost all lanes despite having atrocious base stats","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-12T03:31:59.776+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"Sorry, I'm not denying that these instances occur where a skin for a champion comes out and that the champion gets nerfed within a patch or two.
