I personally hate Jayce . She is strong against Melee but other range have their hand on her quite easily, i find myself beleiving she should be buffed to her adc role instead of being pushed more on ranged second teemo.. but it's my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Oelyk","date":"2016-11-16T23:36:33.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick tip to fuck up Jayce's day.

In retrospect, his Hammer is unsafe, but a lot of extra damage, hence makes him powerful in 1v1 where his damage is strong from the start, but weak in team-fights where he cant access all his damage. \nThey would have to really tone down ranged and really buff hammer to even make it remotely possible for hammer cannon balance due to innate ranged vs melee, and how his kit works.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ryan4win","date":"2016-11-17T03:43:25.465+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, it is his only slow. he needs it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolfram Oxford","date":"2016-11-17T15:17:26.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't agree with a lot of your posts but Jayce does need to be dealt with in some way, and I think hitting his early game power is the way to do it, it's just that I would hate to see his late game affected as well.
