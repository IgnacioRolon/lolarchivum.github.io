Many classes were generally dealing less damage in Runes Reforged-world due to lack of penetration (runes, precision mastery / %pen masteries) and damage amps (double-edged sword, sorcery). Our overarching goal with these adjustments is not precise compensation, but to make sure that champions feel similar to live and can succeed in similar ways, since achieving exact parity is mutually exclusive with such a major overhaul.","replies":[{"poster":"Sohleks","date":"2017-10-12T13:04:46.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to nudge AP damage up people have been asking for raised AP values. They're asking that AP items that make defensive/utility tradeoffs for DAMAGE not be troll builds that barely edge you a noticeable damage boost most games (deathcap/ludens mainly. Perhaps even lichbane (rebalancing some of the champions that may be overcompensating for it) and dare I say a reintroduction of a balanced form of DFG)\n\nOK, I get that you want the current builds to feel similar going with such a major rune system overhaul. For now. Before a possible mage item refresh. It's just I don't think similar is a great goal given the flat boring state of AP itemization. I'm sure lower overall pen does hurt Sorcs/Void and what not. It's just really old at this point to regularly build Sorcs/Liandries/Void for \"damage.\" I've been doing that build before Liandries everything was even meta thanks to how ridiculous Rylias used to be (given the classic Rylias/Liandries synergy)\n\nDeathcap being a late game slot only doesn't Actually make sense design wise. That's like saying you're not meant to upgrade BF sword to IE until you have a few zeals because we designed out the extra AD to higher crit bonus. You're just killing choice. And the tradeoffs are REAL being dcap is an expensive no defense, virtually no utility item easily blocked by anyone's MR.\n\nThe thought of buffing already currently good magic pen makes me go ughhhhhhhh, stop it. Forbid that CDR shoes ever be a choice on mages again. Let's just make it so that the game stays the same.\n\nAgain I sort of understand the usefulness of trying to put mage damage and magic pen items in roughly the same spot going into the new season. But dang it. zzzzzzzzzz\n\nAlso before the later on build choices are a thing I recently posted in depth about mana itemization [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/TbHlfb46-quick-gameplay-thoughts-october-6?comment=000f0000000000010003)\n\nMy question is why is glass cannon mage a joke the past couple years..? My theory is because they have really powerful kits and play a really relevant part of the map and it has simply been nerfed out of them. But it's so much a joke \"damage\" mage items are just a weak meme imo. In my opinion \"ap bruiser\" mage builds are actually no more healthy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2017-10-13T00:19:33.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been wondering, and would love an answer, why didn't the Balance team go with Reducing everything such as minion health, damage, ect instead of buffing everything?
