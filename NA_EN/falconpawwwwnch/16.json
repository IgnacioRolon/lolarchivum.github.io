Overall the assassins are much more balanced than their currently live predecessors especially {{champion:107}} {{champion:7}} (Because getting popped in under a 1 second is so much fun am i right?) They can still 100-0 some one but, you will have much more time to react to them than being \"roflmao you're dead, git gud noob\".
