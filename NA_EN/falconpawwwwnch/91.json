It would likely be easier for them to remove it and then be able to balance her like every other champion, getting predictable changes from increases to her health regeneration, defenses, or damage.

Thus my point, as long as she remains able to cancel animations for skills she will remain difficult to balance.  She would greatly benefit from allowing her to queue up the skills but finish the animations for one skill before starting another, and then rebalance her survivability and damage around that, maybe giving her a cooldown refund if she is interrupted in a combo for whatever skill was next up.

Logic. As for this \"buff\". All this does is make Riven available to more people. I don't think it buffs her as a champion. It just makes her animation cancelling available to more people who are not as good at it.
