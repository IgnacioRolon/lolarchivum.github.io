How does that work? He isn't bad for soloQ, isn't punished as hard as 5s, amazing split push post tri force. Is he god tier for soloQ no, he is still a good pick though. Good to gank for, snowballs hard, can lose lane and still be very strong. I would actually put him more around tier 2 maybe 2.5. In 5s he is a much worse pick, needs to be protected, punished by JG as well as top and can be lane swapped and shot in the foot.\n\nYou make valid points for 5s, for soloQ it really doesn't matter, I have seen AP Garen win.

The whole point is instead of basing the win or loss of a game in champ select do what needs to be done to win. This post is almost certainly out of frustration of a bad Jax.
