Here's what I suggest:\n\n> Passive: Riven's blade gains a charge for 5 seconds every time she casts an ability, stacking up to 3 times. Each of her basic attacks consumes **all charges** to deal 50% AD bonus physical damage for each charge consumed. \n> \n\nThis as far as I know would make her animation canceling useless, as the damage output would be less bursty and would require more extended trades for Riven to get her maximum damage out, and even then the maximum damage put out would be **significantly less** than what it is now (assuming the bonus damage from her charges remains the same).\n\nHere are some calculations I did:\n\nAssume: \n\n* Riven level 18\n\n* Riven 300 AD\n\n* Riven no crit chance/armor pen\n\n* Enemy no armor\n\n>Current passive \n_(Q + aa, Q + aa, Q + aa)_\n((90 + 180) + (300 + 150)) + ((90 + 180) + (300 + 150)) + ((90 + 180) + (300 + 150)) = 2160\n\n\n___\n>New passive\n_(Q, Q, Q, aa)_\n(90 + 180) + (90 + 180) + (90 + 180) + (300 + (150 x 3)) = 1560\n\nIt is definitely significantly less damage AS WELL AS significantly less speed, so to compensate, I'm thinking just increase the AD scaling on the stacks just a tiny bit so the max damage output is AROUND THE SAME but a little less than what it currently is. The main point though is to slow the combo down a bit so she's more of a fighter and not an assassin. \n\n____________\n\nAnd this is just one change I would make to her kit to solve only one other problem. I think some other changes should be made to her E (tone down the AD ratio) and her R (maybe make the damage steroid equal to her damage when she has 3 stacks, but she keeps all 3 stacks for the duration of the steroid, alongside your idea of expending the steroid on second cast).","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-10-25T13:05:26.709+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may be wrong, but I think your entire suggestion could be condensed down to one sentence: make only the third activation of Broken Wings grant a charge for her passive instead of all three activations.\n\nWhich I like.

Otherwise you could just mash Q and get roughly the same damage output, only now even the trick of remembering to AA between Qs has been stripped away, making Riven Even More idiotproof.","replies":[{"poster":"John Berserk","date":"2015-10-25T15:49:51.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I didn't intend for just Broken Wings to build the charges, but if that were the case then you might as well just add that as a passive on her Q and give her a whole new passive. \n\nAs to what that new passive would be I have no idea.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-10-25T20:20:18.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on board QQ threads, she'll have the same global taunt as Teemo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stormfire87","date":"2015-10-25T14:22:18.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but what about stacks gained from her w and e. do they no longer give charges?","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-10-25T15:14:55.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would vote yes; they aren't spammable.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Niaphim","date":"2015-10-25T12:30:43.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just IMO, it sounds very interesting.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"chide da jungler","date":"2015-10-25T17:16:45.264+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"she needs a mana bar. that is why she is so hard to balance","replies":[]},{"poster":"KnighRrider","date":"2015-10-26T15:13:47.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is Riven was designed(whether intentionally or not) to be super strong in lane, or really weak, and it always comes back.

But if they compensated for it by buffing anything else like base stats(which are not great at the moment) then she would be just as good and people would start complaining again!
