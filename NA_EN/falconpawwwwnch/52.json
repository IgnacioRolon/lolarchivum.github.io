Basically, before stats were \"Standardized\" or something of the sort late s4/early s5, base stats were pretty much tinkering tools. For example, if Riot suspected a champion to be a little underpowered/overpowered, they adjusted base stats accordingly to compensate. On release, Cassiopeia WAS underpowered, however slightly, and maybe they foresaw that and gave her an unusually high amount of base armor. Of course, they still do that now, despite it being an ever so meaningless way to deal with broken mechanics. (Lowering Kat's health and regen's not going to stop her bullshit resets, lowering Riven's regen and health isn't going to stop her level 2 cheese, at least in a good and meaningful way, and lowering Ekko's movespeed isn't going to change his overloaded, finnicky kit)\n\nOr, it could just be the way the cookie crumbles and they gave her 90 base armor on a whim. Miss Fortune's got  more base health than Shen, a huge amount of health despite being ranged, as does Kayle. Kayle in general Has melee base stats despite her might as well being ranged. Skarner's got 125+ base AD just because.\n\nIt may be a reason to say \"fuck Cassiopeia,\" I'll give you that, but it's her shoddy rework that amplified rather than subdued the frustrating elements of her kit that puts her on everyone's hate list IMO.","replies":[]},{"poster":"djjomon","date":"2015-06-05T13:59:26.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because she won't built it like most melees do...
