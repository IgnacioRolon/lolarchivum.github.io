That's why it's only 3 seconds long. She's also very low range, hence the need for some defense, as most low range mages do (Ryze with shields and speed, Ahri with mobility, Lissandra with Immunity and CC).\n\nI mean, yeah he does. He takes less damage from AOE's and can dodge Autos, on top of the fact that Fighters build a few defense items, with the added bonus of getting free 70 Armor and MR. He also has top tier DPS, with things like Hexblade giving him fantastic sustain with his Empower. (while also having scaling MR too). If a Jax wants to trade, he'll use it for the stun, but if he wants to survive, he's going to keep it up longer. \n\nThe reason he doesn't build Pen, is because his natural affinity with attack speed synergies well with Tri-force and Hextech Gunblade, which give him damage and sustain, the things that work well against Tanks. \n\nAnd i want to point out the stupidity of something. \"they should not be countered by armor or mr Pen\", that's the fucking point of building pen, to get through the MR and Armor of ANYTHING that builds it/attains it. Fighters don't just get a pass because they aren't stacking it like a Tank. When a role is to damage, it does damage to everything, not specific targets because it \"Feels unfair\".\n\nEdit: Oh yeah, I also forgot how Annie has a Passive on her E that allows her to deal more damage just for attacking, like you normally would.

And, for the most part, Annie's E eats out her power budget. If she didn't have her Defensive E (we know sure as hell Riot isn't giving her a dash), than she's going to get more damage because her thing is \"Burst Mage\". (Liss can ult herself for a reason, it's an ult that can be used defensively or offensively as the situation presents. Don't make it binary)\n\nAnd yeah, it does make sense. She is a **very** low range mage, whose entire shtick is to have a single period of Burst to take out her target, and then she kinda hopes she doesn't die afterwards. Her E is a part of that \"This time is my kill time\" since it's only 3 seconds long, and if she's in range of you, YOU are in range of her. If she didn't have a defense buff, than she needs more damage, as it becomes a contest of \"Did I survive your burst? (No) => I'm dead. (Yes) Well, you're dead.\" which is extremely binary, and the thing Riot tries to shy away from. \n\nIt's the exact same reason why Riot gave Talon his over-wall Mobility, or Leblanc her Clone from Ult (the one that appears from anywhere). They're things that AREN'T damage to help eat up power budget, while increasing a Characters power, without adding damage. Annie lost **A LOT** of damage from her Kill pattern. Early game, it is impossible to 100-0 easily because of it, and late game, if she wants to get in range of other people for her Kill Combo, it requires her getting that close in the first place (withholding Flash, because everyone can have flash for their kill pattern)\n\nPENE EFFECTS EVERYONE. It doesn't matter who, it doesn't matter what, if you're building defense or gaining it naturally, Pen is meant to counter that. It doesn't matter if you're Jax, a Tank, or a mage with Zhonyas, Pen is meant to make anyone with resistances *easier* to kill, it doesn't matter if you're a HyperCarry or not. They don't get a special exemption from the rule, Pen is meant to make anyone who has resistances easier to kill. \n\nAnd you're telling me, Jax can't fight a Tank when? Early game when Jax is weak? Mid game when Tanks are strongest? Or Late game when Jax is strongest? Because I'm honestly calling bullshit there. And what if, just maybe, Jax's intended targets to kill aren't tanks, and is weak against them on purpose? Maybe he's meant to get in the backline quick to start poling carries up the ass? \n\nAnd for a final comparison, let's look at other Mage's defensive measures. Syndra has a huge knockback with a 1.5 stun added if Ball'd, and can cast abilities while moving. She also has more range than Annie. Cassiopeia can deny enemy mobility, gains speed with Q, and can Stun for 2 seconds. Her main damage (E) is low range, but still a higher range than Annie. Ahri has three dashes, a charm and speed boost, with semi-low range, but more than Annie. Annie has damage and a single 1.75 stun, well having literally the lowest range of any mage in the game. Either she get's a defense ability, or she gets more damage and starts insta-gibbing with no counterplay again.\n\nAnnie has her buff for her own reasons, and Jax has his for his reasons, each reason different by how they are played, and the aspects of them. Does Jax need a buff? Yes. Does comparing Molten Core to Jax's Ult (Which still has actual damage to it) as a reason for a buff a good one? No. ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"elon wątroba","date":"2017-02-09T19:51:46.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What would you put on her e instead shield?","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-02-09T19:52:34.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk i don't really care about annie\n\nthe point of those posts is just to show that it doesn't make sens that a hypercarry is having armor/mr when a mage is having %damage reduction we don't even know why","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-02-09T22:28:46.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been telling you why.

Maybe when guinsoo's rage was a thing, but Shyvana does better, plus he blows up in teamfights in the super late game, where REAL hypercarries do best, not fall off when the carry gets a GA and/or banshee's, his best talent is split pushing and dueling anyone that wants to stop him, that's the only place where he can dream of being a hypercarry because he can't handle a whole team to stop him. Maybe he needs a small buff to be as good as fiora, who's honestly better, but in all honesty, no, he is not a hypercarry, he is countered by mr and armor as it should be.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"overman inc","date":"2017-02-09T16:45:39.755+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"GUYS\n JAX HAS DAMAGE REDUCTION ITS ON HIS E GOD ALL OF U NOOB ASS JAX MAINS","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raoul","date":"2017-02-09T15:47:20.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jax Ultimate is mainly used for the third hit damage, the active is more of an additional effect.\n\nOn top of that, Annie is an immobile squishy mage, who needs the extra defenses because she is a sitting duck when her flash is down, while Jax is super mobile and tanky by nature.","replies":[{"poster":"Rukaji","date":"2017-02-09T19:00:49.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like a lot of other mages\nAnd they don't have such a spell","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2017-02-11T15:16:41.893+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Instead they get...
