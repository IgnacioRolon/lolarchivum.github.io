This has resulted in older champions that are simply incapable of keeping with with modern champions because they were designed to handle lower levels of overall mobility. When you look at overall power though, the nerf cycle has allowed old champions (hi pre-rework Ashe) to remain relevant in modern teams even if they are no longer \"strong\".

And now we have Vayne, a very strong champ who everybody seems to complain about, and you are so reluctant to nerf her. What makes you guys decide to nerf a champ or nah?\n\nThe problem is, everyone complains about whichever champion is strongest at a given time. The world was clamoring for Kassadin nerfs when he was on top, Rek'sai nerfs when she dominated the jungle, and Sej buffs when she was just the unstoppable juggernaut wrecking face. Everyone complains about them every time and then as you did, complain to Riot about not nerfing them the very instant you want them nerfed. Half of the time it isn't the specific champion that is overpowered, but the current circumstances letting them flourish. Right now we see a lot of tanks and the juggernauts, so someone with %hp shred is bound to be considered strong. This is ALSO why people start complaining about specific champions after they're seen played in the LCS. The LCS picks up champions that can counter the current meta, leading to them creating a lot of these \"overpowered\" champion crazes.

She can correct mistakes in lane with minimal cost, and continue on farming.
