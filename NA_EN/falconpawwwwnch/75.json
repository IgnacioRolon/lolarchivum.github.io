Autoattack and spell ranges are NOT measured using the same standard. Autoattack ranges are measured from the end of the target champion's model, whereas spell ranges are measured from the center of the champion's model. \n\nI.e. The range a caster would be able to cast from a 6 stack cho'gath would not be different from a 0 stack cho'gath, because the center of Cho's model doesn't change; HOWEVER, the range an autoattacker would be able to attack a 6 stack cho'gath would be much farther than a 0 stack cho'gath because the end of his model increases in length. Basically, a 700 range spell is MUCH shorter than a 700 range autoattack, etc. \n\nThere's really no reason autoattack and spell ranges aren't measured using the same standard. You guys went on about \"clarity\" being a priority when changing summoners rift; making AAs and spells use the same standard would be much better because many players don't know about this difference in standards and would help clarify that no, Jax leap does NOT have more range than caitlyn AA.\n\nThe logic might be that autoattacks (bullets) should be calculated from the impact range, which makes sense, but then what's the difference between a bullet and ryze's Q? If cho'gath increases in size I'm pretty sure it'd make more sense for Jax to leap as soon as he gets in range of his tail instead of saying \"Hm, his center isn't in range but he has a good 6 feet of tail that I can jump to... Nah I'll wait.\"\n\nEdit: Fyi this refers mainly for targetted spells like Nasus W, Jax Q, Ryze Kit (lol) etc. Pretty sure skillshots are measured using edge to edge too","replies":[{"poster":"41noob","date":"2014-12-15T21:47:30.243+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":4,"body":"+1 god bless","replies":[{"poster":"DUDE BRO","date":"2014-12-15T22:45:53.729+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":33,"body":"+0 it's not so simple.\n\nThis means max stax Cho will have drastically increased range on his Q.\nNasus will also have increased range on his abilites (A feature that was built in, but manually removed) and anyone who is ulted by lulu will also get increased range.\n\nAuto attacks are fine as normally the larger champions are melee and thus the range increase is needed so they don't have to be standing inside the enemy to attack it.\n\nAlso, elixir of iron will become a 'range' increaser.","replies":[{"poster":"ULTRAF0RCE","date":"2014-12-15T23:40:45.630+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"what if they have the auto attacks have their auto attack range based on the center of the model","replies":[{"poster":"TheKingDodo","date":"2014-12-16T00:10:15.917+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ULTRAF0RCE,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RrrNRURE,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2014-12-15T23:40:45.630+0000)\n> what if they have the auto attacks have their auto attack range based on the center of the model\n\nRip big fat Tanky champs: {{champion:31}}, {{champion:14}}, {{champion:106}}","replies":[{"poster":"ULTRAF0RCE","date":"2014-12-16T01:48:34.563+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will have to admit they would need to modify auto attack ranges to do it effectively, though it would work better to have auto attack range based on center and made longer than to deal with the amount of weird programming that would go into making the spells measured from the champion model extremes, especially with spells like riven's w which is a circle around her.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr chiral center","date":"2014-12-16T04:47:23.140+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but it would look goofy when big tanks are targeted w/ ranged AAs.

Edge-to-edge range measurement should be the standard for all remaining targeted spells, as it syncs directly with the visual feedback you'd get from a champion and their hitbox.\n\nGenerally, there are a few under-the-hood spell mechanics out there that just need to be standardized: a little while back, Riot was focusing on making ults with cast times reset their cooldowns if the user died before completing the cast (e.g. {{champion:222}} launching her Super Mega Death Rocket! or {{champion:99}} casting her laser and them dying before firing either), and more recently there were a few adjustments to targeted spells by making them edge-to-edge.

But most abilities (again, not all) come from either inner power or some mechanism near the center of a champ. \nSince you brought it up, let's use the 6 stacks {{champion:31}} example. His autoattack gains range as his arms grow longer, as longer limbs naturally grant longer reach. But none of his abilities are generated by his arms. His Q is generated by magic, and comes when he stomps his feet (which are located near the center). His W comes from his mouth, which again is located much closer to the center then his arms. His E is being launched from his body, which is of course his center. And finally his R is once again his mouth, which is near the center of his model. So as you can see, it is perfectly logical to have autoattack range cone from the end of the model, and ability range to come from the center.","replies":[{"poster":"FyshinaTux","date":"2014-12-15T22:08:27.354+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the sake of clarity, this change needs to occur.

I think right now there are both in a balanced way,  whereas this change would remove this. \n\nRight now,  having a larger champion hitbox makes you more easily hit by auto attacks and by skillshot spells,  but targeted spells gain no advantage.  Similarly,  a smaller hitbox makes you harder to hit with skillshots and forces closer range for auto attacks,  but targeted spells aren't at a disadvantage.  \n\nSo targeted spells are relatively better against smaller hitboxes, and skillshots (/autos) are more effective against larger hitboxes.  If you make targeted spells edge to edge,  it's just one more disadvantage for larger hitboxes.  Larger champions have enough disadvantages,  mainly wrt skillshots,  already.  Further,  it just doesn't make sense for a targeted spell to be edge to edge,  in most cases a targeted spell hits its target dead on the center to cause the desired effect,  if you allowed edge to edge it wouldn't be the same and should have reduced effects when you hit the edge. In contrast,  making a skillshot need to hit the center is equally ridiculous,  it would make no sense to watch an ahri charm fly right through cho'gath but not charm him (or any other skillshot). From a flow gameplay you need skillshots to be able to hit champions anywhere. \n\nAuto attacks are more flexible,  but in general a larger champion should benefit from increased attack range.  A fully stacked cho'gath should be able to reach farther than an empty one.  An adc hit with a lulu ult should be able to shoot their weapon farther than one without it. \n\nNot to mention,  it's not at all like spell/attack ranges aren't balanced for this difference... Riot is well aware of it and has even made patches to update ranges to accurately reflect these differences.  The amount of rebalancing required alone is enough to make this not worth pursuing,  even if the logic arguments above didn't apply.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xela Syab","date":"2014-12-16T00:19:15.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is to make up for the fact that cho is easier to hit with stacks than a no stack cho.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2014-12-15T22:46:26.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And even if doing this doesn't work, they could make spell ranges scale with size like basic attacks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ImHerVoice","date":"2014-12-16T03:56:27.289+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"+1 preach it babe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2014-12-16T01:40:14.429+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"At first, when I saw the title of this thread I thought it was going to say something like all spells and auto attacks should be like 600 range.
