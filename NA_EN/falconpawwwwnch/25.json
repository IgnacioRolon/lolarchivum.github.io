A slight buff/rework to rageblade might help akali a lot. \n\nIt would not be the crit we're familiar with at the moment. it would resemble that of the new {{champion:22}} a lot. By flattening crit you don't have to rely on so much on chance. Right now in the fast pace nature of this game there are short windows in which you have to deal damage. Relying on 25% crit does not cut it. \na damage amplifier would help a lot with that. \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\nI also have this suggestion for lichbane which I think would be great for a lot of champions including akali. Like for {{champion:28}}, {{champion:60}}, {{champion:78}} who do not necessarily have high ap ratios but benefit from procing spellblade as well as the mana it offers. \nhttp://i.imgur.com/ie1gASU.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"aaronconlin","date":"2015-05-17T02:49:15.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LilxPaprika,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rwE7NncX,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-05-16T22:58:23.975+0000)\n>\n> what akali needs is a way to amplify her auto attacks. \n> something like: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/FKazxyxF-bruiser-crit-modifier-crit-base-damage-on-select-items\n> \n> such that she could build like {{item:3078}} {{item:3142}}  and reach about 50% crit chance with just two items. \n> or preferably even have flattened crit (like ashe) or half and half. \n> Half and half is where 50% of your crit damage is flattened/incorporated into each of your autos and the remaining 50% applies when you crit. Say your total attack damage is 100. if you crit you deal 200.  At 25% crit chance, 100/4 = 25. flattening crit would mean giving you 125 per auto. This would instead give you 25/2 = 12.5 so 12.5 per auto and the rest... 25+12.5 = 37.5 when you crit. so autos would deal 112.5 and crits 137.5 but preferably also with more crit chance as stated above (however it would have to be less/medium sized crit as opposed to the full fledged crit we're familiar with something closer to a 150% but in turn you get to have more crit chance). \n> \n> That way she isn't so reliant on chance to do damage with her auto since she doesn't have much time to get her autos in between all the cc on her.\n> \n> a full build would look like: {{item:3078}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3146}}{{item:3157}} {{item:3065}}  {{item:3111}} \n> or{{item:3078}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3146}}{{item:3072}}/{{item:3035}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3111}}\n\nI really like {{item:3078}} on Akali","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vesper117","date":"2015-05-17T09:58:43.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can only tick one of the rework boxes Riot has: \n-Make Q a skillshot\n\nI don't see what they can do to her other stuff though, delays wouldn't work since they can't justify it when it's not a stun and she has no cc for them to remove.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ryvaku","date":"2015-05-17T08:15:59.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I love the low CD on her E.
