Others are useless at all stages (Olaf) while others can't carry no matter how fed you get (Renekton), most of them just are worse versions of Gnar (Shen, Renekton again, Shyvana, etc), and others have been overnerfed to below 46% Win rate and below tier (Jax, Gragas)","replies":[{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2014-12-07T23:35:29.296+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sad part about you being pretty much right is the same reason I don't play ranked: I can't play champions I find fun because they're simply overshadowed by people who do the same job but better. Riot seems to have a history of knee-jerk nerf reactions that is going to prevent this game from having anything resembling proper balance. Darius was good in pubs, sucked in tourneys - nerfed anyway despite never having been used even when he was strong in tournaments because he was so easy to counter, now even easier with the likes of Gnar who can harass him at range then go in for the kill in his tanky form, and then later do what Darius can't: wreck teamfights.\n\nThat said, just try and stop me from playing Diana in normals (not that you care) AHAHAHAHA!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neidox","date":"2014-12-08T00:48:49.808+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"But I love {{champion:98}}!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Zyvux","date":"2014-12-08T01:07:13.296+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> But I love {{champion:98}}!!!\n\nShen should not be on this list.
