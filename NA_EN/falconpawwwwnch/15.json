Graves is in a weird state. People think he’s supposed to be a marksman but he’s not. He’s some weird front-line ranged burst thing. There’s a reason why he was put in the unique playstyle class. \n\nA lot of the bruisers either have healing, or hard engage style play which means they’re intended to build defenses and be better for it. While Graves damage is so gated by his abilities and terrible attack speed he can’t really afford defensive items and still remain effective. So he’s given a bit more health to allow him to survive long enough for his passive to take effect. \n\nAt least, in theory. In practice the line where a little bit more health to survive allows him to turn into an unstoppable killer is a bit fuzzy. \n\nHe’s strong now but he changed from a below 50% winrate to well above after getting only 4 more hit points per level. That’s not much, in most cases that’s not even noticeable until late game when Graves’ effectiveness already drops. But it gave him the extra second or two for his passive to be effective.\n\nEdit: I can’t do math apparently. They increased him by 8. That’s... a lot more. Still maintain the reason for why his health needs to be high-ish. But that probably overdid it.

If he has that much free Health because he isn't expected to build it, so should get the other Bruisers. The fact that the one Bruiser that has range has more such safety is valid point to be pointed out. The problem is that he's balanced like Marksman, but doesn't build like one.\n\nYou however brought up Sion/Shen/Tank having more free AD than Zed. Sion is a tank, Zed is a Assasin, yes Tank does have more free AD because he isn't expected to build it, as you said, but Graves is expected to build Health as he's Bruiser and his range should be taken into consideration as safety aspect when balancing how much freebies he gets compared to other Bruisers.
