Because Champions like Darius and Garen have to choose between items that give them full damage or tanking abilities, while champions like Singed and Rumble and Diana get insanely efficient AP items that give them tankiness and damage at the same time.

This makes it difficult to define a niche that the fighter class is good at.  When you think of a tank you think Difficult to kill and powerful CC.  When you think of a mage you generally think massive amounts of magic damage, in either an AOE \n({{champion:63}}) or focused onto one target ({{champion:90}}).  Marksman are ranged champions usually designed around maximum possible DPS.  Assassins are champions with huge burst damage and great mobility.  \n\nThe issue of fighters is that they take some qualities of tanks (hard to kill, CC), some qualities of assassins (burst damage, mobility), and a quality of every marksman (DPS).  My personal belief on this is that having DPS, Burst, and tanking on one champion is the main issue.  Fighters should not have much burst (because they are tanky).  Instead, most fighters should be based upon decent DPS, good tankiness, decent mobility, and not very much CC.  The better your DPS, the less tanky you should be.\n\nThat is not to say other problems do not exist in the fighter class.  Many of these champions are very reliant on raw stats to do well (Jax, Trundle, Irelia, Udyr, etc).  As Riot has labeled them in the past, \"Balls of Stats champions\".  \n\nMy favorite example of a well designed fighter champion would have to be Wukong.  Aside from Wukong having fairly strong burst, he's a great example of a fighter.  Passive and his R makes his teamfight very good, Q is nice for harass in lane and amplifies his damage through armor shred, E is a simple gap closer + steroid.  His W is a very unique thing, as it gives you room to escape through smart movement in the short amount of time you have.  At the same time, it could also be used to tank a spell as you flee.  It also can allow you to engage sneakily. Lastly, you can fake your usage of it if you're smart enough.  This spell alone has so many different uses for different scenarios despite being relatively simple in concept.\n\nA not well designed fighter?  I'd say Aatrox.  Aatrox is kind of your generic fighter.  He has decent dps, decent burst, has built in healing, poke, gap-closer + knock-up, TWO attack speed steroids, and then his revive passive.  There is no reason you'd pick him over any other fighter (unless you seek to get ahead in most of your matches and use his toxicity when ahead).  If you wanted healing, why not play Trundle, Warwick, Irelia, Mundo, etc?  If you wanted initiate why not Wukong, Hecarim, or basically any tank?  His splitpushing and dueling is easily outclassed by Tryndamere and Nasus.  The only thing unique to him among the fighter class is his revive passive, which admittedly is nice (and allows for  otherwise risky tower-dives and such).\n\nThe fighter class itself probably needs a massive overhaul (and redefinition).  But the amount of time and resources required to do so is immense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-07-28T12:11:40.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Llanite,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=k1X8fE2R,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2015-07-28T11:51:12.436+0000)\n>\n> It's definitely tricky.\n> \n> Fighter is half-tank half-dps, which makes they jack of all trade.

In all honesty it favored some champions more than others, but it was definitely more fighter centric than Tank centric as an item when it was available. The active allowed you to \"steal\" attack speed from champions that were in the AOE slow (the slow was flat instead of scaling off of bonus armor/mr as well), so it mostly favored champions like {{champion:39}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:421}} but it was definitely more favorable on these fighters than many of the tanks you see who use the item. It wouldn't really help more caster oriented fighters like {{champion:80}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:86}} as much though. I think it was a step in the right direction as far as fighter itemization though. \n\nNot to mention that the new BC is actually a really good AD fighter item as it provides ample CDR, AD, and Health as well as armor shred that is useful in supporting your team and amplifying your own damage. We see some champions thriving with this new item: {{champion:62}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:83}} though for some, the old BC was maybe a better investment for the ability to hold onto Brutalizer for the early game. \n\nThese are steps in the right direction, but I do think that more variety in itemization should be explored. \n\nI will say this though. AD fighters don't really need more than one damage item in most situations. Building AD is more efficient than building AP as it affects AA's and abilities alike whereas in most situations, AP only affects abilities. AP bruiser itemization did get a lot better with this overhaul of AP items, but before that it was very weak, and I still don't think it's in a great spot. \n\nWith Rumble, Singed, and Diana, you are looking at the champions themselves as to why they are moderately tanky while building AP. Diana has a shield that scales well off of AP and doesn't have heavy mana problems, allowing her to rush Abyssal and Zhonya's early. This coupled with her naturally high hp and armor, make her appear very tanky as she can build AP and resists at the same time, making her a very strong midgame champion. The same is very much true for Rumble as he has no mana and he scales very well with penetration allowing him to build Haunting Guise and the other mentioned items without really sacrificing on damage. Singed hp scales off of mana, making RoA the most efficient item for him. So he gets the most HP for his buck along with a good amount of AP. He can build Liandry's and Rylai's because he receives free resists with his ult. \n\nLooking at other champions you might consider: Chogath, Swain, Vlad, Ryze all have access to great use of RoA or have extra stats in the case of Chogath and Vlad and great sustain/spellvamp in their kits to make them seem tankier, but they are usually just a lot of HP without many resists so are easily blown up if they get caught. \n\nWe can look at AD champions and see similar things in some of them where you can see why they can build the way they do. Riven for example is like Diana or Rumble in that she has a shield that scales off of AD which is what you want to build as a fighter. You have Gnar who during his Mega form has a lot of HP, AD, and resists coming in like Singed's insanity potion; allowing him to build Black Cleaver, Frozen Mallet, and Maw without losing out on a lot of tankiness. Fiora, who was more of a Carry, was like Vlad or Ryze with all of the lifesteal and hp regen she gains (this has been since changed with her rework). Garen has 20% bonus resists AND 30% damage reduction on his W allowing him to build very heavily in offense and not be lacking in tankiness (he can be kited like crazy though). Triforce users like Hec, Irelia, or Jax usually can make do with that one damage item and still be really tanky thanks to aspects of their kit and the additional items they end up building. \n\nI DO think that Ad fighter itemization needs to be better optimized with Frozen Mallet being one of the things I feel need a complete rework especially now that slow stacking is no longer possible. I also think that AP fighter/offtank itemization still needs work as in most situations, it's either better to build full tank or full AP and those who can be tanky while building a lot of AP items are exceptions, just like there are exceptions to AD fighters who can amass a lot of AD items and still be fairly tanky. There is a big difference in AD fighters and AP fighters as AP champions usually can't build one AP item and go tank afterwards like AD champions can build one AD item and still be effective when building full tank afterwards. \n\nSorry for the long post. Peace.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-07-28T08:27:26.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MyNamesAmsToki ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=k1X8fE2R,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-07-28T02:39:00.489+0000)\n>\n> I wonder if they'll bring back the Randuin's rework that was on the PBE a few months ago.

I forgot to mention that. I think it was actually scrapped for a reason. It was probably being abused by carries to get a huge steroid. And not just for Marksmen, but for champions such as Master Yi or the aforementioned Irelia, Jax, and Shyvanna. \n\nI think it was a good item in theory and that's why I was wondering if they would revisit it as a possibility to make a defensive item that heavily favored fighters over tanks. I do think there were problems in the Randuin's rework proposed, but I think there was a little bit of gating for ADC's (marksmen) as they would have to get major damage items first and if they were to get Randuin's as their one defensive item, they would be much more vulnerable to Magic damage which has more ability to burst them down quickly. \n\nI don't think your example is very good btw. No offense, but Jax has his Dodge mechanic on his Counterstrike to negate any of the AA's that Jinx would throw at him when it is active, and would result in a stun. He would most likely have a Randuin's at this point too, so he would counter her Randuin's with his own and be faster than her thanks to his Triforce. He also does a lot of mixed damage and an ADC with Randuin's would have very low MR. Jax f***s up ADC's, it's what he does. A better example would be champions that are more prone to kiting such as {{champion:86}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:48}} as this item would kite them even better.\n\nAnyway. I agree with you. The Randuin's that was proposed was probably too easy to abuse by champions it was not meant to benefit. And for that reason, it was probably scrapped. But I think it was still a step in the right direction for AD fighter itemization.

The best we have is Manamune and Essence Reaver, both of which are undertuned quite heavily with how Essence only gives mana based on your ATTACK'S damage and gives a % of that based on YOUR MISSING mana, so it does 2-8% based on your missing mana OF your Auto Attack's Damage. While it gives CDR on top of LS, it can't compete with the raw sustain of a BT or the huge damage of a BotRK. Manamune simply takes forever to stack, barely gives any AD, even when you've got it maxed and have other mana items. Unless you're getting over 3k mana as an AD, which isn't going to happen a good majority of the time, it barely gives anything and when you finally have it stacked, it then siphons your mana, doing damage based on your current mana, so on top of being a POOR item as a base Manamune, the Muramana then does a very low amount of damage. Ezreal, at max, gets about 1k mana and with a Mura, he has 2k mana. He does 6% of his current mana, a max of 120 extra damage at the cost of 3% of his mana, which would be 60 mana for 120 damage. On a normal caster though since nearly every AD caster is AoE, like Talon, they wouldn't even be able to USE that proc since it's Single Target only. Which is what really makes it such a... useless item.","replies":[]}]}
