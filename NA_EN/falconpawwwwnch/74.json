Her perma-slow is a little excessive, but I don't think its necessarily a high priority.\n\nCoupled with the fact that she has one of the longest gap closers of any mage, she's capable of playing aggressively and still be safe. \n\nJ4 is just an all around strong pick right now, stronger than Lee Sin I would argue (awaits down votes), Lee Sin falls off stupidly hard in the end with his only capability of \"Insecing\" carries or peeling for his own carry, or  early LC$ Big play$\n\nJarvan not only applies early game pressure like Lee Sin, but can transit into a hell of an initiator and disrupter late game with E-Q-R that can pretty much get him into even the furthest of back lines to shut them down, furthermore,  if he gets ahead, he's far more difficult to deal with then Lee Sin, and is insanely scary and border on impossible to deal with, and I say this with him being one of my favorite junglers.\n\nHe's become popular recently because he's one of the few jungle champions, if not the only one, which don't have significant damage mitigation or sustain, and still do incredibly well. Yes, his W gives him a shield, but its not really useful in camp clears, since at most it blocks one AA.

Anytime a support can carry in anyway they bring out the nerf bat.  I really don't understand what the problem is with supports being useful for something other then warding and using {{item:3222}}  but Riot seems to have the stance of *\"Supports should be crappy anywhere else\"* Just look at the record, Soraka, Lulu, Kayle, Morg (although she's still good) and more.  I can't even remember the last time a support champ got a straight up buff.  They seems to hate utility and any champ that can support and actually does a good enough job to be close to that of Thresh gets nerfed.","replies":[{"poster":"TotemBuffalo","date":"2015-01-08T00:45:51.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty much even janna which is the true definition of support is getting a nerf on her tornados hit box which isnt that hard to dodge its like wtf","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-01-08T01:27:51.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not like janna sitting at top 3 winrates since over 3 months now, beeing the most dominant support at worlds and also having a rather high popularity...\nI do not understand why J4 doesn't see a nerf, and liss could take a look at aswell, but i do totally understand why sona and janna get nerfs","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
