However, they deal hefty damage, maybe even have it where she can only have homing bullets to a certain range. After that her autos are fast skillshots. Traps will let her auto without the wind-up time, or home in as long as they are revealed.\n\n{{champion:42}} He's already ability based, maybe put his machine gun on his autos, but treat them like Lulu's passive where it is scaling damage with ratios and on-hits and crits apply only at the initial auto. The longer Corki stays in range with his autos the more damage he can pepper on his opponents, but he has to decide to either stay at range and use missiles or to get up close for max damage.\n\n{{champion:119}} This guy is almost perfect already. Except make it so that Draven's auto attacks depend on his axes, that becomes his Q passive where he gains charges of axes, and the active of his Q impales his target with an axe (skillshot), and auto attacking them again gives a boost of some kind. If Draven drops his axes, he is stuck at one axe and cannot auto until it returns to him or he drops it.\n\n{{champion:81}} This guy is already fine, just remove his ability to abuse every on-hit in the game. Make his Q apply only to one on-hit at a time or something.\n\n{{champion:104}} Ironically the most balanced. Maybe work on giving his W some depth.\n\n{{champion:222}} Mini-gun range reduced, rockets made much slower and powerful. Increase mana cost on rockets, make them deal more damage with crit but remove their ability to create AoE crits. That's just disgusting.\n\n{{champion:202}} Remove the movement speed on crits. Make his traps something that can be active immediately but if left for some time, can ramp up to be devastating. This is to give him kiting potential without being The Fast.\n\n{{champion:429}} Remove passive hop. That's just plain dumb. Instead, give her Q a lower cooldown where she can hop away more often, but the damage is reduced. If she hops forward the spear damage is increased. This fits her fantasy as a pursuer and makes sense in terms of force and direction. Have a large portion of her auto attack damage be translated into damage for Rend. Also make her passive/ult interaction consentual and give it more options.\n\n{{champion:203}} Make Lamb and Wolf feel like separate entities, like having Lamb thrive in duels and kiting while Wolf thrives in chases and seeking out prey. Perhaps if an opponent runs and you have a mark on them, wolf chases and you can follow him? Or perhaps you can switch between lamb and wolf, each having a separate HP bar that if depleted, puts their respawn on a high cooldown that resets if you die or shortens when you collect a mark.\n\n{{champion:96}} Make him Kog in Invasion. Long charge-up period with a visual warning, then straight-up turret mode. It rewards strategy and placing teamfights well. Also perhaps make Kog stand still and the range be shown as your focus becomes selecting targets, maybe even allow casting ult during this period of time.\n\n{{champion:236}} Each gun has a cooldown. Double-tap is excluded from this. You can now cast each ability twice in rapid succession (except dash), and you choose whether to blow all your damage at once or save it. Ultimate could have a thing where Lucian does his one-directional cast but you choose how long the ult goes for. It will go on forever, draining mana and locking you out of all spells except dash. If you really want to go all-in with this, make Lucian hit R for every shot he wants to shoot during his ult.\n\n{{champion:21}} Utilize dual guns theme in a different way than Lucian. Q now shoots two bullets, and if the first one crits the second one bounces to the nearest target, prioritizing champions. Make It Rain (E) now increases the damage of MF's bullets (abilities and autos) depending on how long you were in it, but radius is increased immensely. MF ult now deals significantly less damage to account for E changes.\n\n{{champion:82}} This isn't an ADC, silly.\n\n{{champion:133}} Make Valor actually swoop at people and attack them with Q. Still a skillshot, but instead of the burst, he continuously tears at his opponent, near-sighting them. The damage occurs over a period of time, and Quinn gets a movement spees buff toward the target he is attacking. Valor has a set HP bar (kind of like a ward or whatever) that lets his opponent take him down prematurely. Quinn only gets bonus damage if she attacks while Valor is still on the target. Also, reduce the CC on Vault. It's fucking stupid.\n\n{{champion:15}} Actually one of the more balanced ADCs. Perhaps add an opportunity for her to Ricochet her boomerang via Q.\n\n{{champion:18}} Also doesn't require many changes. Increase range of passive, make her Q temporarily remove passive range boost during its duration but make it a massive steroid. Trist can choose to either slowly whittle from a distance or go in hard and risk her safety for good damage. This way her W remians reliable but has less effective range.\n\n{{champion:29}} Q stealth does not allow Twitch to ult until he has broken camouflage for at least 2 seconds. Problem solved.\n\n{{champion:110}} Also very balanced. Maybe, if anything, make E more impactful. Perhaps an intensifying slow into a snare. Or make it apply grounded.\n\n{{champion:67}} Q crit should never return. %HP true damage, sure why not. But make sure she never two-shots anybody with bullshit Ult-Qs again. Also make her stealth shorter.\n\n{{champion:498}} Reduce burst damage on feather pull-back. If anything, make the damage DoT, like a bleed. Her problem is too much burst for a sustained damage champ. Also make the feathers louder and more in-your-face, right now it sounds like I'm getting pelted by cotton balls when my insides are getting torn out.\n\n{{champion:16}} Sharpen banana animations, make those suckers look deadly.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-10-07T12:23:27.727+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upvoted for Soraka adc.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-10-07T07:31:06.866+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm just saying, but there's more to counterplay than dodging.

Just look at the armor pen we have. I also remember 500 armor tanks with 300 MR and 5k hp season 1-3, not no more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kasfas","date":"2017-10-07T22:41:21.995+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's quite sad how they decided they needed to nerf sunfire a damage for being uninteractive, and remove sej w for being uninteractive, and yet leave the most uninteractive source of danage in the game untouched even AFTER their respective class rework.\n\nAt least be consistent Riot. If you want adcs to be the only class in the game with uninteractive and rediculous damage from range with incredible safety who's only counter gets removed by another class in the game who's sole purpose is to remove their only weakness, then you might as well come out and say it. \"We want ADCS to be OP whenever possible so that we don't have to deal with actual meta change\".\n\nAnd if that isn't true then you have zero explanation for the failure that was the marksman update do you? \n\nGet it together. Stop destroying the game and lying to your customers. If this game didn't have the momentum it does I'm almost certain it wouldn't make it far today.","replies":[{"poster":"roppleDopple","date":"2017-10-08T09:48:40.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as someone who is lvl 7 sej they made the w better. It is a slow that applies two stacks for her E and adds physical damage to her kit.

I tried to play her after her rework and just absolutely hated it. Her entire kit revolves around her e which I find to be in interactive and unfun, instead of her w which it SHOULD have been based on. \n\nI liked den because she did sustained damage and had a big ult. Now she has her stupid e which seems incredibly unrewarding and is also broken.\n\nI don't think I'll ever be able to play her again honestly because she just isn't fun anymore.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AninLegions777","date":"2017-10-08T15:49:10.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making Veigar's stun delayed is probably the most sensible nerf Riot ever made.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dEAdbUs","date":"2017-10-08T13:21:54.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADCs AA must become skillshot.
