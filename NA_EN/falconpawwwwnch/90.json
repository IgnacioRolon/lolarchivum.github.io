You already have pretty much been kicked out of top lane while never being used bot lane and rarely being used mid lane, now ranged champions can even outjungle you due to never taking damage from mobs lol. You can pretty much full clear on any ranged autoattacker without taking any damage now.\n\n\"But if you don't pick a melee champion in the jungle you'll need to pick a melee somewhere else to be tanky!\"\n\nOr you could just pick gnar since he doesn't have the downside of being melee in lane lol. Why would I EVER pick a tank top lane if Gnar exists with a better laning phase, better teamfight, more damage, more everything, while also being ranged in lane, might as well start running double AP if you can't get Gnar. As long as Gnar is good you know who will never be used? Renekton, Mundo, Shyvana, Shen, etc. Looks like Riot solved the melee lane problem that they so wanted to!\n\nThis game's balance between ranged and melee is an absolute joke.

What you just stated above.... Doesn't make any sense at all. Late game yi and tryn are the ones who have to jump into the middle of fights and hope noone CC's them. If they get CC'd they will instantly get destroyed. It's why you never see them played in high elo. In low elo, ofcourse most people don't know how to play against them, so just let them reck everyone. Even if warwick gets CC'd during his ult, he's tanky enough that if focused, the rest of the team will just destroy them. He has a heal on his Q and built in lifesteal. That in combination with the fact that he builds bruiser makes him a stupid champion to try and target. If Yi, or tryn jump into the middle of a fight and get hard CC'd they blow up easily.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned there is no difference between Yi/Tryn without devourer at all and a Yi/Tryn with one. Because late game they can still do the exact same thing. Which is blowing up teams. The difference is a some magic damage on their attacks. Either way you look at it, a Yi got penta's before feral was released. He was never played in high elo because of how easy he is to shutdown. Hell, even bronzies like me know that if you CC yi he dies pretty much instantly. Tryn is in a weak place right now kuz frozen smite kills him in his ult. Even so, my point remains the same. \n\nWarwick's ult is his main threat, but even if he is CC'd during the ult it would take a good 4 seconds of the whole team focusing him for him to die. I would give a Yi 1.5 seconds at most before he dies if hard CC'd. The threat is just so much different when you have someone who can destroy your squishy and then KEEP destroying the rest of you team with mixed damage. Assassins like yi jump in probably kill a squishy and die. If the team is good, they don't even kill the squishy.","replies":[{"poster":"Bears Dont Care","date":"2014-12-08T14:28:22.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Waaaaaaaiiiiiit a second wut.

It's just common sense.\n\n> Warwick has no tools to survive when he gets hard CC'ed, the latter have means of dealing with incoming CC.\n\nYou know.... there's this thing called tenacity. I heard it's really strong on bruisers/tanks\n> > \n\n> Dealing an additional 80 magic damage per hit that scales into late game makes no difference?\n> Really!?\nOnce again you're missing the point. I'm not saying there isn't a difference. I'm saying that even without that 80 magic damage they could blow up teams just as easily. There is a difference but its like having a gun that can blow up entire cities. We know its capable of it, but just because we want to put a laser on top of it to blow up even better. Tryn/Yi were known to be able to blow up teams BEFORE FF. Devourer hasn't changed their playstyles at all. It hasn't changed the champions at all. As you said, the only difference is 80 magic damage on an auto attack that already dealt enough damage.\n> Judging from everything you said, it really sounds as if you are horribly inexperienced and you're flat out refusing to acknowledge WW's weaknesses.\n\nnow now. if playing casually for a year and a half is inexperienced then pigs fly. I'm not refusing to acknowledge it. I'm saying that compared to Yi and Tryn's weaknesses, his is minimal. He's a bruiser who can deal tons of damage with 2 damage items. He's hard AF to kill as it is. Yi and Tryn are squishy assassins who deal a lot of damage, but if they get focused they can die extremely fast. Tryndamere's ult late game is very strong, however it has nothing on WW's late game. It's a KNOWN fact that Warwick has one of the strongest late game's period. Even BEFORE FF.\n> Everyone is affected by hard CC, but some can survive it (tryndamere), and some can dodge it (yi), and some have to pray they get ignored (WW).\n> WW isn't a problem.\n> His Kit, was never an issue.\n> Skirmisher was the issue, because it introduced 400+ true damage that he did not possess before.\n> But hey, its totally WW being broken even though **he hasn't done anything worth mentioning for 4 seasons**.\n> Clearly, WW is a problem.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, Yi and Tryn have had the same problem for a very long time. They're squishies who get blown up by any decent team the moment they jump in. They snowball if fed, but in general they are easy to handle early game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-12-07T07:30:53.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's most likely not broken that his grants him 2.78 attackspeed for the duration...

Path of Iron and Righteous Glory are examples. Lee, Amumu, Rengar, Wu, Mao, Trynd, Pantheon, Akali, Fizz, Zed, J4 etc. still seem fine and I'm sure I can think of more examples if I wanted.\n\nRanged junglers have always been a thing. Twitch's most popular place before the rework used to be jungle! The reason they didn't get picked much was their slower clears (back when the jungle didn't hurt), worse ganks, usually higher gold requirement to be relevant, generally worse CC and the squishiness. Most of these reasons still exist now. Just because we see a team pull out TF jungle (with pre-nerf Devourer) to level TSM into picking Xerath and getting countered, doesn't make all melee junglers disappear. The same thing goes for C9 picking 2 ADCs. It's called strategic diversity. Did you see double ADC in TSM's games? These IEM games have been more interesting and fresh than I've seen in years.","replies":[{"poster":"Tortferngatr","date":"2014-12-07T18:23:28.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed.
