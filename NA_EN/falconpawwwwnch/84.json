It's no better to say 'just bring friends' since that's sort of dodging the issue, but so is including randoms all the same. Besides, it's not so bad if you're polite-- even less so if you're just plain quiet. On that note, those points sort of cancel themselves out so...\n\nAs a rebuttal to your original point, you'll always face a stacked comp somewhere along the line. We can't prevent this in any way, shape or form without removing the random aspect of ARAM, which ruins the whole point.\n\nNo matter how we change ARAM, we're really not fixing any particular problem; we're more satisfying a human want for control over the circumstances. Given the number of players queued for ARAM at any given time, I'd say implementing a smurfproofing system would probably have a very nominal effect on the numbers, though I'll only speculate that without actual stats.\n\nI would much rather have a reroll every second or third game than a handful of 'good' champs. All the selection in the world doesn't mean anything in ARAM if you're accumulating a roll every tenth game or so. Nothing will save an all AP team from demise against a team with remote balance.\n\nI think there's enough champs that are solid contenders for ARAM to make this a non-issue. The likelihood of being comp screwed is unlikely to change, just the mindset that you can't smurf-- but ARAM is just as much a matter of being able to use the champs in the right ways, too. There's more to the game than poking.\n\nI think this is probably a problem that seems more dramatic in its moments. Realistically speaking, there are so few champs that are honestly 'bad' at ARAM and even then, virtually anyone is a viable choice in the right hands.\n\nAs a counter-stance, and to bring a little more perspective to this issue, do you possibly have a list of champions you'd consider not to be favorable ARAM picks, going  by what criteria you built your initial list of choice picks on?\n\nThe way I see it, the core of the issue is that smurfs can obviously limit their choices enough by avoiding 'poor' contenders, but there are a lot of excellent choices for ARAM; Ezreal and Morgana are good, for sure, but so are Leona, Xin Zhao, Lee Sin, Galio, Garen, Malphite, Olaf, Karthus, Gangplank, Miss Fortune... to say nothing of champions with strong synergies (Braum/Yasuo, Fidd/J4, Galio/Ori) turning normally viable contenders into unstoppable engines of mass destruction. I would be surprised if more than 30 champs could rank so poorly that they would honestly be a discredit to the team objectively; as long as they're not that, the very extreme cases are the truly irreparable ones, and those will never get removed. That aside, a player's individual skill can go a long way in making (or breaking) virtually any champion.\n\nEDIT: If we did have to select a solution, mine would be to reward non-smurf play-- extra rerolls would pretty much totally leaven the gap, realistically, no matter how it was handled. As little as one extra would make worlds of difference.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMÃ¥rvelous","date":"2015-01-07T17:27:43.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, there's always the chance of facing a stacked comp. Even when everyone owns every champion, you can always face a Ziggs/Nidalee/Lux/Jayce team. However, that's a thing about ARAMs. What's -not- fair is facing a stacked comp every game/every other game. That completely sucks the fun out of the random aspect. I never feel \"Man they got lucky and got a really good team!\", I feel 'Oh ok they have stacked accounts\". The problem isn't facing a stacked comp, it's how often you face these stacked comps because people want to cheat the system.\n\nA smurfproof system wouldn't really be the case however. Imagine if ARAM now only allows 25+ level accounts. Suddenly a ton of people who queue for fun but aren't 25+ are shut out to limit the smurfs. Not fair to them. More so, this doesn't solve the issue of 25+ smurf accounts, which there are a good amount of. Building on that even further, what determines a smurf account? Level? Champions unlocked? Skill level? In ARAM it's difficult to tell.\n\nThe second issue you bring up (Making everyone competitive on ARAM) kind of already happened. While every champion is good on ARAM, the general strat is that poke and harass wins early but sheer tanky power wins late game. Garen's a great pick even though nobody wants to play him because his regeneration is through the roof, meaning he can stay alive better than anyone. However, people don't want to play Garen and wait 20 minutes to hopefully get to that stage. They'd rather play Ezreal now and poke to their hearts content. \n\n\"But I don't want to-\" That's great that you're better off with rerolls but we're not talking about outliers here, we're talking about the majority that are causing this problem. And unfortunately the majority would rather have strong champions than to have a bunch of rerolls to hopefully get strong champions. Hell, using your own argument about control I can point out that having a small pool of champions you own affords **more** control than having a bunch of rerolls because of the chances of drawing a stronger champ you enjoy.\n\nAs I brought up in my original post, the champion ARAM strength is subjective. Everyone is good but there are several high poke/strong tank & poke champions in an ARAM that rise to the top. These are the ones I'm picking but who it is doesn't matter. My point, at it's core, is that people are stacking the deck and being able to skew the odds with stronger picks compared to picks that are good but not as good. Again, yes, we can argue relative strength but we're going off majority opinion and champions who are clearly great on ARAM (Nidalee for example).\n\nSo basically the entire argument you made danced around the point I made about skewed ARAM accounts. The problem isn't champion strength, the chance of stacked accounts even with all champions unlocked, etc. The problem is that this is a real, substantial issue that is currently happening right now. Above all, with a solution as simple as unlocking everyone for ARAM mode, I cannot see why they would refuse to do this.\n\nPS: Riot already said 2 is the maximum reroll they'd ever do because anymore and you can basically chug rerolls, which they want to avoid. They want you to be able to reroll as an emergency, not as a free privilege. So we circle back to the original solution proposed: Unlocking everyone.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2015-01-07T17:33:43.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i find it interesting that i own 28 champions yet a group of 4 or 5 of them are much more \"random\" than the other champions or free week champions. i'm also surprised that Vel'Koz isn't on the list","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMÃ¥rvelous","date":"2015-01-07T18:24:53.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe it could be the RNG algorithm they use.

However, I think that if you open up all champs in ARAM you should also grant more re-rolls to people so if they get a champ they really hate and don't own they can reroll (i.e. do something like double the reroll points you get per game and allow you to store up to 5 rerolls but only use a maximum of 2 per game.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ValorOfArms","date":"2015-01-05T21:01:38.497+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Things to even it out\nMake it instead of just well how it's done there is few changes to even it out\n\n-re-rolls max increase by +1 for each 25 champions you own and you always have a minimal 1 re-roll for every game capping at 5 re-rolls.\n(This method assures you #1 have a reason to save up for the pool and #2 given chance to get a better choice fill)\n\n-Role based ARAM where each person it randomly assigned a role (Markmen-Fighter-Tank-Mage-Assassin-Support) then a champion that fits to the role type cast. and at least 1 of these archtypes must exist within the mode to fair even so you don't get stuck with a full Me-lee team.\n(This method literally just makes it less random and more expecting...it be closer to All Random Archtype All Mid ARAAM)\n\n-You must have at least 10 champions owned and all free weeks are locked out. also allow trades with people that do not own your champions (visa and versa) but you cannot received the champion you traded for anymore.\n\n(this opens up allot of trades, and undoes trade hunting allot smartly trading champ for champ. granting also people to try new champions to enjoy cause some ARAMers want to randomly try something new like a unpredictable team fight practice) and finally the champion limit and unallowing of the weekly ones permits a more understanding pool. along with shrinking the pool choice of troll down for more ARAMed up accounts.\n\nChanges to the re-roll system should be made IMHO so you can more freely burn them, as I sit on 2 allot cause I can comfortably play nearly any champion myself on ARAMs and easily build up 2 re-rolls by having such a huge champion pool.\n\nthere is indeed ARAM accounts built solely for ARAM usesage\n\nalso can we replace sanguin blade with bloodthirster...you allow essence reaver, but why do you have sanguin blade at all? it's really not that great and useful as essence reaver in as a whole of an item on that game mode\n\nalso be cool...to have a trinket other than a poro snack ^^;\n\nmostly thing #1 re-roll system be best option as it still remains ARAMs just evening out the bigger champion pooled people also keeping a min 1 re-roll per person still is, highly random as you then take a risk non the less.","replies":[]}]}
