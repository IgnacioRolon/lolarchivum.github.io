Have _anyone_ with a solid CC ability? Well, unless that ability is only solid at level 16, you've suddenly got a champion that is terrific at enabling kills early on and stays strong either as the game goes on because they can just decide that an enemy can't act for however much time. Which suddenly makes all early game damage dealers turn into spitwads late far, far worse, because why pick them when you pick someone that won't turn the game into a 5v4 or worse later on?\n\nBeing strong doesn't mean stronger. You pick a late game champion because they're stronger than early game champions late game, not because early game champions practically don't exist late game.
