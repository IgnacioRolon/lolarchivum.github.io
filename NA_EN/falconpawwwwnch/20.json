Interested to hear it!","replies":[{"poster":"Cowsep","date":"2018-03-08T08:01:47.445+0000","up_votes":68,"down_votes":2,"body":"Heres a longer post but I've been using the Phantom Hit mechanic since it was released and it'd be really disappointing to see it removed.\n\nNote, I tend to play champions like Master Yi, Jax, Tryndamere, Kayle, Shyvana - on hit champions - I also used to play on-hit Braum, Twisted Fate, and Teemo jungle back when Devourer was a thing. Its always been my favorite playstyle.\n\nThe current iteration of Phantom Hit is more healthy than the instant Phantom Hit from Devourer because it gives some players the ability to kind of work around it. For example, if you see a Jax, Master Yi, Kayle farming in a minion wave you obviously want to wait until they clear that minion wave. Likewise, as the Jax, Master Yi, Kayle if you suspect someone is coming, you want to clear the minion wave as slow as possible. These are two interesting situations that both sides can play around. \n\nIn all honesty, it is really hard for a melee champion to get Phantom Hit before a team fight starts, in fact, unless they're pushing into your base and you're killing super minions, or they engage on you during a Baron or Dragon, its highly unlikely to even have one stack prepared (since you usually wait for your initiator). Range champions don't really have that issue because they use their ranged auto attacks to poke or help clear minion waves, which means that they can start the fight fully stacked. This creates range vs melee issues which you're trying to address, which is great. \n\nGetting stacks while hitting only champions, in my opinion, is not the way to go. This makes Rageblade significantly more useless in anything other than team fighting. Objective taking I'd argue is more important than killing champions. There used to be a time in this game where people would say \"don't fight so much and instead focus getting more objectives\" but now it seems that everything that comes out relies on having an enemy champion around. The game is largely becoming more PvP based and champions that like to split or PvE suffer more and more (the champions I generally like to play, sadly).\n\nPhantom hit is also currently the only way certain champions like Master Yi can even come close to dealing with tanks. If you build full Critical on Master Yi and try to approach a tank, you will not even get him under half health before dying. Phantom hit allows Master Yi and other champions to work efficiently against tanks, but doesn't make them too powerful against squishies because they the on-hit build lacks burst and supports can have time to peel for them. That feels like a good balance. If you go for Phantom Hit you won't assassinate the squishies but you can deal with 1v1ing people with no peel. Phantom hit is a really good mechanic please don't remove it just because of Kog-Maw, Varus, Kayle (all ranged champions!)\n\nWith that said, I think that Guinsoo's Rageblade is trying to do way too much at the current moment. \n\nChampions like Master Yi, Tryndamere, Aatrox, Shyvana who generally do not want to build AP, have to build an item that turns their adaptive damage into AP if they want to take advantage of Phantom Hit. Its a bit odd to me that an AP dominant Hybrid Item has a mechanic that auto attackers want to take advantage of. Riot over the years has continuously been trying to remove alternate playstyles from champions and lock them down out of hybrid gameplay, for example Tristana, Master Yi, Tryndamere, Sion, Poppy, Katarina, Shaco, and more have all had their kits touched up to remove multiple playstyles, yet they try to preserve this Hybrid item strictly for Kayle, and maybe Jax, but he doesn't even build it.\n\nI think that Guinsoo's Rageblade rework yesterday was a fine example of a good direction that Rageblade should be going. I think it should have a very clear purpose that multiple champions should be able to use. On top of that, I feel that Guinsoo's Rageblade could be our first item candidate for adaptive stats. If an individual has enough AD to make Rageblade change to AD, I think that user would use AD quite well. On the flip note, if they had enough AP to make it change to AP, again, I think the user would be fine with that.\n\nHowever, another good idea is to simply have Rageblade focus on one thing - on hits. The problem with Rageblade now is that since it has Phantom Hit on it, on-hit champions are forced to get useless stats, unless they scale with both AP and AD. An interesting direction you can go is to simply make it heavily Attack Speed reliant or make the on-hit damage itself scale with adaptive AD or AP, sort of similar to the iteration of patch 6.8 Rageblade (Check it out if you don't know what it did). Rageblade or another item should be an ON-HIT item, not a hybrid one.\n\nI think that Phantom Hit is a powerful enough mechanic it should remain expensive but it shouldn't require champions to purchase useless stats for themselves. Its also a fun mechanic so I really hope it is not removed. Just keep in mind that Rageblade can have usage outside of team fighting (like doing Baron, Dragon, Splitting, 1v1ing), and that ranged champions have a way easier time of abusing it than melee.\n\nThanks for reading my wall of text.\n\nCowsep","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-03-08T09:44:13.438+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the input. Some thoughts.\n\n> Getting stacks while hitting only champions, in my opinion, is not the way to go\n\nI'm leaning this way as well. I didn't have high hopes for that iteration, but decided to give it a day anyway. To try to achieve a similar goal of making pre-stacking less powerful/overbearing (on ranged champions especially), tomorrow has a vastly reduced stack duration (2.5 seconds I believe) but retains its melee stacking bonus.\n\n> Champions like Master Yi, Tryndamere, Aatrox, Shyvana who generally do not want to build AP, have to build an item that turns their adaptive damage into AP if they want to take advantage of Phantom Hit.\n\nThis is one of the things I wanted to resolve with this current iteration, and it carries over tomorrow! By swapping the Blasting Wand for the Amplifying Tome, AD becomes the dominant Adaptive stat while rushing this item, unless you have more AP (like from a Doran's Ring), but I think it's safe to assume at that point that you prefer the AP. Additionally, because the stats are even on upgrade, champions' natural Adaptive states take over if the item is rushed now. Basically, there should be fewer cases where Yi is turning his Adaptive into AP.\n\n> However, another good idea is to simply have Rageblade focus on one thing - on hits.\n\nThis was my inclination as well when I started work on this, however I've decided that I want to maintain a hybrid feeling as best as possible, since there are so few items like it left in the shop and I believe, based on feedback I've seen here and elsewhere, that's fun for a lot of players. What you'll see in the next PBE update is a version that essentially tries to be whatever the user wants from it, without getting too much useless stuff. Percent bonuses to AD, AP, and - as of tomorrow - multiplicative Attack Speed, means that the more of other stats you buy, the more of that stat you get from Rageblade. Building AD? Rageblade gives you some extra AD. Building AP? Rageblade gives you a bit more. Buidling on-hits and have a bunch of AS? Rageblade now multiplies that AS out. The idea here is you feel like you're getting less useless stuff and more of what your current build cares about. That said, as long as phantom hit exists on the item (which it still does), it needs to be powerful as an on-hit item regardless of what else you're building alongside it, so the innate on-hit damage is a bit higher tomorrow.\n\n> Thanks for reading my wall of text.\n\nThanks for the input, and good luck with your next headset!","replies":[{"poster":"Cowsep","date":"2018-03-08T09:53:39.408+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually the idea of making the bonuses % based is sort of interesting because it accomplishes 2 things:\n\n1) You can't build tanky with Guinsoo's Rage Blade because you'll benefit significantly less than building another AD item. (This is a big problem for Phantom Hit users, being too tanky and dealing too much damage).\n2) You don't get a bunch of wasted AP because it scales (mostly) %.\n\nHopefully melees can keep longer stacks than ranged because they need to close the gaps, especially after someone flashes or dashes away. Theres no way Yi can keep those 2.5s stacks going (Especially when Alpha eats up .8s of that lol). Not a bad way to separate ranged vs melee, the stack time.\n\nI think this is a pretty decent approach so lets see how everyone likes the next iteration on PBE.","replies":[{"poster":"SirDante830","date":"2018-03-12T23:42:05.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like Xin's W delay's buffs by 0.5 seconds, should Yi's Q pause buffs like his E and R when in Q?

Also makes it a rather weak rush item and makes it weaker in tankier builds.\n- Passive is now always active, but needs 3/6 attacks to proc. Not differentiating between melee and ranged for on-hit is a nogo and causes balance issues (see Wit's End Kog'maw). If Yi proves to be problematic with that, just disable his passive second strike from counting towards this.\n\nThe stacking mechanism to proc the passive just proves to be problematic to balance all around. It causes high high's and low low's, something players are instantly frustrated with (Zoe).\n\nAs for Rageblade as a hybrid item, I would like to revert it to a point where it stacked from ability casts as well and just gave stats.

You could balance it by making stacks drop after a very litly time 1.5 ~ 2 seconds, just like old (old old old) jax passive.\n\nNow, if your intention was to completly drop the on-hit item multiplier wet dream niche and make another generic adc item that is somewhat core to kayle, you did great.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fawksea","date":"2018-03-08T17:00:34.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QVEZ37ME,comment-id=000200070000,timestamp=2018-03-08T01:32:27.109+0000)\n>\n> Well that&#x27;s unfortunate :(\n> \n> Thanks for the heads up.

This made them more flexible and stronger early, but therefor the lack of multiplicative scaleing resulted in a lower lategame dps compared to crit.\nanotehr difference was that on-hit lacked sustain but therefor got def-stats.\nThe next one was that on hit effects were all magic, granting mixed damage which again is strong early/mid and on bruisers that usually couldn't afford %pen in their builts. They still were situationally good vs high armor low mr targets even for adc in the late(i really miss good ol madrets)\nAsides from that, on-hit also was rather linked to AP. Most on-hit effects in kits had ap-scaleings, giving also synergy with as/ap like nashors and old guinsoos. \nA bit later the ap-affinity increased and the magic/mixed damage also got more emphasis with the mr-shred and ap ratio on malady, which later was split onto wit's end and nashors.\nThen later with the introduction of hurricane, on-hit had a lategame multiplyer for teamfights that made it an aoe-dps built compared to the sigletarget focus of crit.\n\nNow on-hit is all over the place, we have physical damage, magic damage, synergie with lifesteal, an hybrid item that also is a multiplyer for on-hit, the strongest teamfight amp for on-hit is ranged only and a crit item, it's just a mess, there is no clear guidline on what on-hit is supposed to offer compared to crit, as two of the more powerfull on-hit tiems, botrk and hurricane, synergies better with crit than with other on-hit.\nAnother big issue right now is that we have two strong multiplyers for on-hit, of which one is ranged only, and on-hit effects now have to be balanced around those multiplyers and thus feel ratehr lackluster on their own.\nThis is one of the main issues for melees and onhit/guinsoo's. Most melee's exept for some special cases like Yi can't afford to get to much off items, they don't want items that rly on other items to be strong. They need items that are strong on their own, or at max a two item synergie(like trinity+steraks) so theri built can stay more flexible and they can get more tankiness or more damage depending on how the game progresses. It just doesn't work out for them if they are somewhat forced into a rather squishy built.\nIt's just exactly why you don't see crit builts on melee's exept for a few that have their kit specifically designed for it.\nAnd the current PBE changes puts even more emphasis on guinsoo's enableing your already existing offense instead of beeing a strong standalone, which makes it less usefull for melees(exept yi i guess) despite the faster stacking.\nIf you want guinsoo's to be viable for melee's, it needs to be less depndent on other items to be effective. If you fear a to strong early spike from rushing it, try tieing the stats to champion lvl, like you guys did with the sunfire burn back in the day.\nMadrets kinda worked that way with the %damage, giving a good powerspike the moment you get it and still scaleing well later into the game.\n\nHowever, the biggest issue for guinsoo's and melee's is the current state of the game and it's impact on melee's in general.\nThe overall CC, especially CC that isn't affected by tenacity, is absurdly high and so is the damage. This makes it near impossible for melees to stay in any bigger fight and actually get off some AAs, they just get stuck in CC and die way to fast if they don't go straight fulltank.\nAs a result, melee's either need to be able to unload alot damage in short time or have enough utillity to just go fulltank and be CC bots(or kinda both in the case of camille)\n**Melee-dps** is in a poor spot for a long time and so are bruiser builts that rely on a mix of damage and tankiness, as so many items rely onstacking one or the other to be really effective, and damage overall is just to damn high.\nThis means the type of playstyle that guisoo's would want from a melee just doesn#t work right now, and the fact that you have to stack it up first makes this problem even worse.\nGuinsoo's would need to give boosts that help melees actually getting off AAs to really enable dps style melees. Like some cc/slow resist and ms on the stacks.\nit would also help if it wouldn't rely on getting off AAs in order to stack up, but rather just require beeing in combat, like grasp, or atleast get extra stacks for takeing damage so melee's have a more realistic chance reach full stacks **and useing them** befor dieing in a teamfight.\n \n------------------\n\nAnother thing that is important about guinsoo's is it's hybrid nature. One of the reason i really like it is a viable way to get a decent amount of AP on champions that others wouldn't get any, allowing to use ratios and empower parts of the kit that else are rather neglected.\nBoth PBE versions fail in this regard by either giveing no or hardly any flat ap.\nI understand that there are quite some champs that might use the on-hit oncrease from guinsoo#s but don#t make much use off the AP and thus don't go guinsoo's, but it would be far more interesting to give them enough ratios to feel good about guinsoo's rather than just takeing the ap from guinsoo's. This might also make gunblade a more interesting choice for such builts, though i guess gunblade it's self could use some work. it's not a good sign that the about only user asides from akali is LB...\nYi could get the nerf on his meditation ratio reverted, same for Xin's passive heal, irelia could get a small ratio on the W damage and heal, Noc could get either a even higher ratio on the passive heal, or increase the ad-ratio on the passive with Ap, like every 100 AP increase the ad-scaleing by 0.1.\nThere are plenty of options to use ap-ratios for buffing parts of their kitsthat don't get used as much with ad, trinity or crit builts, createing a more distinct playstyle for hybrid builts and causeing interesting decisions.\nSure this would need more work and thus probably isn#t suited as a short term solution, but it would be nice if hybrid scaleings and itemisation was on your rader for longterm changes, as it has alot unused potential(that back in the days was used ALOT more-,-)\nJust how on-hit items would need a good look overall aswell, especially the mix-up with crit through BotrK and Hurricane needs to be adressed.\n\n-------------------------\n\nJust some thoguhts on a possible iteration for guinsoo's\n\n{{item:1026}} +{{item:1037}} +{{item:1043}} +775g(3500total)\n\n30ad\n25% as\n40ap\n**Passive:** 2+lvl magic damage on-hit\n**Passive:** 1-15 health on-hit(melee only)\n\n**Unique Passive:** Gain one stack of guinsoo's Anger on attack or uppon takeing damage against champions, towers or epic monsters (1sec cd on takeing damage), doubled for melees, up to 8 stacks. \nEach stak gives\n1/2/3 ad (38-54ad max)\n3/5/7 ap (64-94ap max)\n7% as (81% AS max)\n**MELEE ONLY** 1% ms (8% max)\n(sacleing with level, increasing on levels 11 and 16)\n_Stacks last 1.5sec (3sec for melees) and then fall off 2 per sec_\n**_Upon reaching 8 stacks, gain guinsoo's rage_**\n\n**Guinsoo's Rage**: every 3ed attack, you strike twice for 65% damage each and applying full on-hit.(similar to Yi's passive, just that the second hit doesn't already count towards the next proc)(this equals a 33% increase in on-hit dps and 10% increase on physical dps)\n**_MELEE ONLY_** 25% tenacity and 25% slow resist\n\nSo what's the goal here?\n\n - The new stacking system should make it less opressive in a laneing enviroment where you currently can pre stack it on minions, while also makeing it easier to stack in teamfights, especially for melees, aswell as makeing it easier for melees to keep the stacks up\n\n - delaying some of the stats and on-hi power through level scaleing keeps it's power as a rush item more reasonable while still keeping it a strong itemeven without further off-items throught the game\n\n - The new guinsoo's rage is a bit lessextreme on increaseing on-hits (33% instead of the current 50%), evt allowing other on-hit items to get some love so they can feel better on their own rather than only good if paired with guinsoo's\n - The oncreased physical dps should open up more different buitls with guinsoo's, makeing it somewhat effective in ad focused builts and critbuilts while still keeping it's main focus on on-hit\n - the aditional melee only effects should help melees to stay in fights and actually use their AAs","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2018-03-09T00:19:02.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also feels kinda bad that because of the 2.5 sec timing jhin is unable to use it\n\nhe could've done so good with the % bonus ad. btw seems like the total bonus as he gains doesn't count for his passive multiplier.
