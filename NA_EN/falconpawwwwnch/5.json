We still don't intend to use this widely, but I should definitely have mentioned we had another case in development.\n\nI just want to take a moment to point out that you tied a mechanic meant for tank busting to a passive which targets people who get kills, who are usually squishy damage-dealers... and apparently wrecked Garen's early power and both offensive and defensive scalings to do so...\n\nI really don't see how this is going to help him do anything at all. I really do like the anti-snowball shutdown-focus idea, especially as a tie-in to actually make his ultimate worth something later on, but I don't understand at all why you wrecked the silence on his Q (which is what gives him strong matchups in lane) as well as removing base damage and crit scaling from Judgement, which was a pretty unique thing for a bruiser to have. RIP IE synergy.\n\nOh and the abysmally low hard-cap on defensive scaling for W? The tenacity removal from the active, which was meant to let garen soldier his way into the fights? That change alone makes it look like he will be weaker than Season 2 Garen as a pick.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-08-05T00:38:35.443+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a really good point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2015-08-05T12:42:07.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">I really do like the anti-snowball shutdown-focus idea\n\nSeems to me that this would better fit an item. \n\nAn item named \"Last resort\" with bad stats but specifically made for shuting down the most dangerous enemy player.","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2015-08-05T15:45:56.694+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wullf,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AKp7LP28,comment-id=000400000001,timestamp=2015-08-05T12:42:07.072+0000)\n>\n> Seems to me that this would better fit an item. \n> \n> An item named \"Last resort\" with bad stats but specifically made for shuting down the most dangerous enemy player.\n\n\"Deal double damage against any champion who was enough of a jerk to buy Mejai's Soulstealer or Sword of the Occult\"","replies":[{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2015-08-05T17:04:26.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PER-FECT!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2015-08-05T23:42:40.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL \"in case of fed enemy break glass.\"","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FalconPawwwwnch","date":"2015-08-05T00:39:09.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Off topic, that new hydra item, does that fulfill the item you described the other day? \n\nSpecifically, you mentioned that fighters need an item that worked like Atma's did (allowing tank stats to scale into things that didn't benefit tanks) but in a more healthy way.
