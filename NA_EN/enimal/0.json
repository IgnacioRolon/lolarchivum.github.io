In other games like CS:GO and Dota 2 you can freely change your cursor without it being called an unfair advantage.\n\nI would also like to ask why changing your cursor is allowed on the EUW server, but not on the NA server?

If the cursor is adjusting the way which you make selections then it could certainly be perceived that way.
