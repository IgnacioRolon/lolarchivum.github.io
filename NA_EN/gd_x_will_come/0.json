AP Ezreal will still be viable, but what you are not looking at is hybrid or Double tear Ezreal will be absolutely disgusting. I am even thinking it would be broken strong and will have to be tuned down. with his New W he gets mana sustain, and high single target damage just thinking putting the numbers alone here lets look. \n\nOld EZ Lvl 18 with just Lich Bane\nATTACK DAMAGE\t102.5\nLich Bane - 80 AP - 75% base AD + 50% AP (76.875 + 40) 116.875 damage\nOLD W rank 5 - (250 + 80% AP) (250 + 64) 314 damage\nQ Rank 5 - 115 + 110% total AD + 40% AP (115 + 112.75 + 32) 259.75\n\nTotal combo - 116.875 + 314 +259.75 = 690.625\n\nNew EZ Lvl 18 with just Lich Bane\nATTACK DAMAGE\t102.5\nLich Bane - 80 AP - 75% base AD + 50% AP (76.875 + 40) 116.875 damage\nNew W rank 5 - (255 + 60% bonus AD + 40% AP) (255 + 32) 287 damage\nQ Rank 5 - 115 + 110% total AD + 40% AP (115 + 112.75 + 32) 259.75\n\nTotal combo (Q damage + Lich bane and W proc) - 116.875 + 287 +259.75 = 658.625 damage\n\nNow looking at this with 80 AP with the Lich bane you only lose 32 Damage. What you haven't though about was how much better his lane will be. He gets a refund on mana, and now AP Ezreal scales really well with Gun blade I want you to look at this. This would Make AP ezreal able to sustain in lane no problems.\n\nOld EZ Lvl 18 with just Gun blade\nBase ATTACK DAMAGE\t102.5 \nGun blade + 40 AD and 80 AP\nTotal AD 142.5 \nTotal AP: 80\nOLD W rank 5 - (250 + 80% AP) (250 + 64) 314 damage\nQ Rank 5 - 115 + 110% total AD + 40% AP (115 + 156.75 + 32) 303.75\n\nTotal combo - 314 +303.75 = 617.75\n\nNew EZ Lvl 18 with just Gun blade\nBase ATTACK DAMAGE\t102.5 \nGun blade + 40 AD and 80 AP\nTotal AD 142.5 \nTotal AP: 80\nNew W rank 5 - (255 + 60% bonus AD + 40% AP) (255 + 24 + 32) 311 damage\nQ Rank 5 - 115 + 110% total AD + 40% AP (115 + 156.75 + 32) 303.75\n\nTotal combo - 311 + 303.75 = 614.75\n\nThat is a total loss of 3 Damage from 1 combo, and you now have passive sustain from W for mana and heal for all damage dealt.\n\nFor AP ez I would recommend \nStarting either {{item:1082}} +{{item:2031}} or {{item:2033}} or {{item:1056}} or {{item:1055}} \nWith mana not being as much of a concern as there was no mana refunds on EZ's you can build much differently\nI would go with either {{item:3146}} or {{item:3285}} (I wonder if Luden's Echo Passive procs new Ezreal W)\nFull build I would think \n{{item:3146}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3285}}\n\nAlthough This Build would probably be disgusting for AP ezreal for straight damage with the AD and AP scalings.\n{{item:3003}} {{item:3004}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3020}} ","replies":[{"poster":"FullmuteAll play","date":"2018-09-27T03:42:38.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I saw in video. The issue is need to proc it. It makes poking much harder, you need to also hit Q, AA or E. \nQ is a skillshot; AA is a dangerous range, that ideally as AP Ezreal you don't want to go into; E is your survivablity, that you want to use only if you are sure you can get away after using it. Plus need to proc W gives enemy more time to react on you, which is also very bad.\nGiven your numbers, he can still work as \"assasin\", but poking becomes really disgusting.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-09-27T15:14:28.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think to OP is just over reacting a but I think it can be done and I believe this Ezreal will be healthier.

My guess is they lowered the AP scaling on W because they added the mana refund and AD scaling to it. If they left it the way it was, Ezreal would be way overpowered since you pretty much no longer need to build Manamune because he now has mana refund built straight into his kit. You can just build an AP item instead.","replies":[]}]}
