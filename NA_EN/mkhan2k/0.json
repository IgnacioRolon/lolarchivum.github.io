You can't \"bully someone into leaving\".

Well it's understandable. \nthe process goes something like this \n\nPrerequisite: Riot made it so having an AFK on your team grants you 30% less LP loss. (E.G. having an AFK past remake time means you only lost 7 LP instead of 10)\n1. 4 man premade gets into a game\n2. 4 man premade starts to lose\n3. 4 man premade bullies the solo player for 20+ minutes\n4. Solo player leaves the game. \n5. 4 man premade receives less LP loss and can climb even with a negative win rate.","replies":[{"poster":"SanctusEquitem86","date":"2016-09-29T00:54:01.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This whole thing is inaccurate, and could be solved with only using this in solo or duo ques so this thing didn't happen or even better yet game reviews for afk players, there problem solved no abuse.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LateCustomer","date":"2016-09-29T00:48:10.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mkhan2k,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wXj5U60A,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-09-27T02:43:07.651+0000)\n>\n> So as a low elo player who actually wants to get gold for his first season its VERY annoying and VERY frustrating when someone in my team goes dc in a game after the remake mark.

If there was a way to allow a remake during THIS kind of situation, I'd rather have that.  Disconnects after the fact would be abused to no end.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-27T02:46:10.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did you lose game? then you lose LP if you win the game you get LP its the same for all","replies":[]}]}
