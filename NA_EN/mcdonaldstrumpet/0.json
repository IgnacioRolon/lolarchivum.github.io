When it takes place outside of chat and can be actually verified as malice, the first punishment is a 14-day suspension, after which is a permaban.\n\nLack of game knowledge is already punished by a higher likelihood of losing matches, which already results in MMR losses and rank demotions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-11-14T17:49:17.549+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> **Add additional report reasons to state in the post game report module**\n>\n> **What would they be?**\n>\n> Troll Picking - Picks a champion that does not fit the given role, with the intention to ruin one other's game.\n> Lack of Game Knowledge - The player is incorrectly placed in a higher bracket of the ranked system.\n\n\"Troll Picking\" is such a nebulous concept, and adding the stipulation \"with the intention to ruin someone else's game\" doesn't really change the fact that I doubt anyone would care if the person picking the off-meta Champion is playing it straight or not.\n\nIf someone is deliberately ruining the game, \"troll picking\" would just be an aspect of it, and ultimately, you'd just report them for **Intentional Feeding** (since that category covers the breadth of gameplay-related offenses already). Otherwise, people are allowed to pick any Champion for any role; there's no guarantee that it'll work from match to match, but there's no rules saying that they need to strictly play whoever's meta for whatever role.\n\nAs for \"Lack of Game Knowledge\"...That's neither something you can really detect nor something that's in any way punishable. If someone lacks game knowledge, their rank will drop. Iron and Bronze tiers exist for a reason, after all. If they're at a higher tier, then there's a probability that they got to that tier with a variant of game knowledge that you do not recognize.\n\n> **What would they do as punishments?**\n> \n> **Troll Picking:**\n1. Ranked game restriction for 5 games. This means the player has to win 5 normal draft games to play Ranked again.\n2. Ranked game restriction for 25 games. This means the player has to win 25 normal draft games to play Ranked again.\n3. Ranked game restriction for 100 games. This means the player has to win 100 normal draft games to play Ranked again.\n4. Ranked game restriction for one season. This means the player cannot play ranked during this season again. If there's less than 1 month left of the season, this will include the next season as well.\n5. Account suspension for 14 days + limiting XP gain on account (to make level ups harder) and closing the opportunity to play Normal Draft and Ranked for the next 100 games. Only TFT, Blind Pick and ARAM will be available.\n6. Permanent account suspension.\n\nFirst of all, \"Ranked Restrictions\" are not legitimate punishments. What they are is shirking off the player and letting them continue to misbehave in Normals, ARAM, or wherever else; so ultimately, you're not disincentivizing the behavior, you're just encouraging them to do it elsewhere for a little while.\n\nSecond, \"limiting XP gain\" wouldn't do anything. Even if Riot decided that it was worth their time to see about sussing out a player's alts/smurfs, limiting XP gain on one account would not do anything. As for locking out Normal Draft; read above. **If they're still ultimately allowed to play on other modes, then it's not a punishment. It's an encouragement to keep misbehaving in other modes.**\n\nThe current punishment track for trolling is fine as it is; 14-day suspension > permanent ban. No extraneous fluff, no conditional punishments that only affect a subset of players, just straight bans.\n\n> **Lack of Game Knowledge:**\n1. Decrease MMR slightly to reduce LP gains and increase LP losses. (reduce MMR by 50)\n2. Reduce MMR more significantly, add a ranked restriction for 10 games and a low priority for 5 games of 5 minutes.\n3. Demote the player with one division lower than their current one and restrict them for playing ranked for the next 25 games.\n4+. Drop the player at the exact same division with exactly a tier lower than their current one. Ranked restriction for 35 games.\n\nAgain; **Lack of game knowledge isn't punishable.**\n\nAdditionally, there's no way Riot would consider giving players any ability to fudge another player's MMR, and they're not going to allow you to force-demote other players either. If they got to that rank, they very likely got there through their own skills, which are bound to be greatly different from your own. Just because they lack _your_ specific skills or game knowledge does not mean they belong in a lower rank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2019-11-14T15:58:24.426+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">Lack of Game Knowledge\n\nHow would you even **detect** that?\nAnd if you just wanna go via number of reports:\nI used to frequently be the only member of the team that knew spell vamp worked on physical damage spells.
