While you can support Windows as it's one mainstream OS, you also decided to add Mac support. Mac OS is based off UNIX, which is the base of Linux. I don't see why wouldn't you release a Linux version of the game when you don't want WINE to be supported. At least a 64-bit version? I know, 32-bit users will struggle but nowadays there are good and cheap 64-bit CPUs for like $20 to $30 which can do the trick to play League of Legends.\r\n\r\nI mean Riot Games, look at yourselves. You are the most played game, right? Yeah, it's right, not Fortnite yet, don't worry. We will exclude Tetris and Super Mario, for the reasons that nobody almost plays there, except if we get nostalgic. However, these both are available for Linux. That's okay, they were originally made for Linux, but then made for Mac and Windows as well.\r\n\r\n_______\r\n\r\n> ***Apart of this, let's make you sound fun to your fellow community, how does that sound?***\r\n\r\nTo me this sounds as fun as to do it. Starting off with Dota 2. I want you to open up this link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/\r\n\r\nDid you have a look at the page? You haven't? Okay, then please go and check Supported Operating systems. What do I see here? Isn't that Linux? Weren't Valve the company you were fighting against? Seems they won this one. ;)\r\n\r\nThumbs up for you Riot Games!\r\n\r\n_______\r\n\r\n> **That's not enough? Want some more? There you have it.**\r\n\r\nBy saying League and Linux... hmmm.. the first thing that comes to mind is something with a more unique gameplay. Even Dunkey baited many of us with a thumbnail of League of Legends. Correct, that's **Rocket League**: https://store.steampowered.com/app/252950/Rocket_League/\r\n\r\nWhat do I see again? Linux support.\r\n\r\nYou are doing great, Riot Games! Lolz!\r\n\r\n_______\r\n\r\n> **Let's give you more pain! BRING DA PAIN!**\r\n\r\nOkay, the pain has come. Now comes the trouble.\r\n\r\nRUSH B CYKA BLYAT IDI NAHUY! https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/\r\n\r\nLike okay, not even similar to League, yet played almost as much as League of Legends. It's like... 3rd place worldwide? The biggest Steam game.\r\n\r\n_______\r\n\r\n> **Top Played Games Ranking, FYI**\r\n\r\n1. League of Legends [no support, even for WINE]\r\n2. Fortnite [supports WINE]\r\n3. Counter Strike: Global Offensive [native Linux support]\r\n4. Overwatch [supports WINE, but it's a bit harder to setup and it's a bit choppy]\r\n5. Dota 2 [native Linux support]\r\n6. Call of Duty: Black Ops II [supports WINE, but the game is heavier itself]\r\n7. Garry's Mod (surprise, yep, it's a very well-known and played game) [Another surprise - native Linux support]\r\n8. Warframe (among the free to play games, this one is a top of the tops) [only Windows, but has WINE support, which works very well, tested myself]\r\n9. Minecraft (didn't expect this one coming?) [native Linux support, though it's written in Java ShitcodeÂ® for every OS, but the Linux ver can run on both Win and Mac as well]\r\n10. PUBG (kinda debatable if it's 10th or 9th, but IDC, I don't play this shit) [Windows only, supports WINE]\r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\nI am tired of making this list larger. Also, just to mention, Linux can look 50 times better than Windows.\r\n\r\nWindows 10: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fa/Windows_10_1803.png\r\nKubuntu (Ubuntu with KDE): https://i.imgur.com/R8Hz1NB.jpg [my laptop, yeah, don't watch the 32 GB RAM, Riot Games, you don't even have that much money to spend on just supporting Linux]\r\n\r\nAlso, in Windows, the default screenshot thing is Prnt Scr as well as in Linux, but there you can only capture the entire screen and you need to go to Paint and cut it there. But Linux on the other side has a built in system tool, that can even upload to imgur like I did. On Windows, I need to download their tool or use ShareX. Another reason why I won't install Windows again.\r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\nAlso, Linux is free of any things like... paid licenses. And wait a minute, could you ask your technicians and programmers what OS do your server machines use? That's correct - a server edition of Linux, could be either Debian or Ubuntu. CentOS is dead, but can be that too.\r\n\r\nIf you use Windows Server, then I'd kindly ask you to change to Debian Server 9.0 if you respect yourselves and your company at least a little, as well as us - your community, which gave you all the money you have now. Wasn't the description of League of Legends that it's a community-made game, that we decide what happens, did that ever happen? No, not at all! Riot Games - just counting money and are mean to release some miserable $50,000 to implement Linux native support. But you earn over $100,000,000 per month, and I am being a realist.\r\n\r\nAlso, again change to Debian Server 9.0 if you are not on it, the lags and the disconnect issues will stop. Bugs maybe not, but just hire more and new programmers. If you are already on Linux, then just change programmers, they are your problem.\r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\nListen, as much as I like your game and don't want to leave it, but you are being mean and you don't even allow us WINE support, my laptop would handle it perfectly, then I have no other choice than saying: *Bye, I am done with League of Legends, because Riot Games ruined my dreams.*\r\n\r\nBest of luck in life,\r\nRiot Games","replies":[]}
