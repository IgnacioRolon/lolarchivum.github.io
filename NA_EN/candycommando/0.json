If I wanted to play this game again  I wouldn't have called the entirety of my team porch monkeys. This game is going down hill and has been for a while now and honestly I'm just toxic because everyone's toxic so I feel like its just a standard at this point. This game penalizes players for leaving games as well and forces them to wait before enjoying the game further as if some teammates game getting ruined by someone else leaving is actually relevant in normals at all. Also the ranked system is a joke but to be fair ranked in any game that has ranked is a joke. Its unoriginal and is a copy of a Warcraft 3 map that riot just kinda took the liberty of cloning because \"Its not like someone can patent a Warcraft 3 map so who cares\" The games mechanics are a trainwreck. I play this game TOO be mean to people and when my account is unbanned I'm just gonna hop back in a game and be racist as all hell anyways so why not just permaban me? So permaban me riot I don't really wanna play anymore and I'm pretty sure you don't want me to play anymore either.\n\nP.S. I also just don't need this game anymore it makes my long list of mental problems significantly worse by playing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-30T00:18:04.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't go in and just increase your punishment level for no reason, but if you are certain you want this account gone you can reach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) letting us know you want this account deleted.","replies":[]}]}
