I'm not looking to play on an older patch, I'm just trying to get my old replays. Is there any way to go about this? Or a way to get them to play without having to do patch things?","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-30T00:23:50.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly there isn't an implemented way of reverting a patch or watching replays from previous patches. <:(\n\nOne workaround is to make a 'highlight' of a whole replay during the patch it's recorded in. That will be saved as a .webm file instead of a .rofl file, and you can convert it into whatever medium you want for later viewing. :D","replies":[]}]}
