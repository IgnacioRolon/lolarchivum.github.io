So I&#039;m a longtime rengar player, on and off since season 3 he&#039;s been my pride and joy. I&#039;ve played him in every role, with every build and I honestly am terrified of what&#039;s going on. I&#039;m going to be covering pretty much everything he talks about in the video from my point of view.\r\n\r\n1: The indicator on his ult. Okay so I played rengar back in season 3 before the indicator and I&#039;ll agree it was a little broken. If he has the ability to 100-0 a target that target should have a bit of time to react. So they added the exclamation mark. You guys decided it wasn&#039;t long range enough...Okay so it&#039;s fine the way it is now. The indicator is about double his jump range if not more. People have plenty of time to put down a pink, and use some sort of cc to distort him. Playing against a team as rengar that&#039;s actively doing these things you feel kind of useless. But that&#039;s how counterplay works so it&#039;s fine. People have tons of opportunity so I have no idea where that&#039;s coming from.\r\n\r\n2: The kit changes. Again back to season 3. Rengar felt very fluid and mobile with his kit. The only negative thing was his bola being targeted. He felt very fast and everything you did just flowed so nicely. With current rengar he feels really clunky. Especially after you changed the bola interactions where it goes where you&#039;re facing not where you threw it. Making bola-flash and using it mid air while jumping from your ult or a bush near to impossible. We have an assassin character who you guys are trying so hard to make feel like an immobile clunky stone and it&#039;s such a shame. You say we can use his abilities too quickly but that&#039;s all we have left to actually make rengar feel good as a champion. Before the bola changes where throwing it mid-air was impossible, getting the ult-youmuu&#039;s-ferocity q-jump-bola-roar-hydra-q again combo off felt so good because it felt soo cool having all these things that worked so well together and being able to weave them together expertly to assassinate somebody. I&#039;m scared that riots idea of an assassin is becoming skewed. An assassin is somebody who&#039;s supposed to be able to pop squishies in an instant when fed and do little to nothing when not. It&#039;s a high risk high reward type of role and you guys are just trying to make him a tanky bruiser just like you did khazix and that&#039;s not fun, that&#039;s not innovative. \r\n-Side note on this\r\n--Playing games of league where every person on the enemy team is tanky isn&#039;t fun. It&#039;s not exciting to have wet noodle fights everywhere. However tanks are healthy to the game....As are assassins. Tanks should be able to destroy assassins if they&#039;re caught out of position as assassins should be able to pick off an adc or mage who&#039;s not careful quickly.\r\n\r\n3: Ferocity changes. I think this is one of the things that bothered me the most. You want an assassin to stack something up mid fight? That&#039;s not an assassin. That&#039;s a fighter. An assassin should be able to execute a squishy target in seconds. Not jump in and hope they can ramp up before they die. Assassins are supposed to build glass cannon with maybe one tanky item to make sure they can carry out their job. If rengar is caught out without his ferocity stacks he should be punished for that. That&#039;s part of the assassin gameplay. The assassins supposed to engage and not be engaged on. If he&#039;s engaged on he should die or atleast not be able to win the fight. Why force an assassin to be a duelist. That&#039;s not the class fantasy of rengar. Ramping him up is only a tool to stop him from assassinating a target. He&#039;s supposed to set up and prepare for a fight.\r\n\r\n4: Bonetooth Necklace: This is another one that makes me a little mad. Killing unique targets to stack bonetooth necklace? An assassins job is going to be to kill the adc, mage and or other assassin that is on the other team. The 3 squishy targets that are high priority. You&#039;re telling us that the gameplay option we&#039;re going to have is ruining ourselves for doing our job and focusing the same target or screwing over the team and trying to kill the tanks for our reward? That&#039;s not class fantasy that&#039;s putting the lore of the character before the gameplay and that is not okay at all.\r\n\r\nAll in all this new 1-2 second combo thing for rengar sickens me. Riot doesnt like assassins and they never have. People get angry when they&#039;re killed instantly because they&#039;re squishy/dumb and out of position or not paying attention when that&#039;s literally the whole point of the assassin role. I dont know what riots doing and it might very well cause me to lose my favorite character in the game but we&#039;ll see what happens.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-08-11T04:48:05.085+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Did you not realize that Redmercy was speculating throughout the video?

But his ult also includes a speed boost. So that distance closes really quick. And the reason why their isn't enough counterplay, is simply, you don't know where he's coming from. Basically giving you no way to kite him, and no time to counter engage. \n\nBut I'm more curious on the stealth system itself. Cause that's going to affect a lot more than just rengo. \n\nThe other reason I might challenge some of your arguments is his Duality. He's part fighter, and he has fighter builds. especially with that stacking ferocity mid fight thing. (His current kit can do that with a high CDR build) And if you do maintain a more fighter esk build, you can take out most targets.\n\nI defend his fighter build, partially because I like Duality in general. But also, with assassin being historically problematic to balance (and not be considered cancer) I really feel like many of these champs need to lean on their secondary roles a little more, to actually produce something that is healthy. Full combo in a split second pretty much leaves you with no ability to react. Which means there's no counterplay in the combo, the counterplay would have to come from the moments before. But again, there's very little time to actually react once Rengo pops his ult. \n\nEither way, it's still presumptuous. We can complain once the Rework actually hits the PBE.","replies":[{"poster":"Homeless Raccoon","date":"2016-08-11T05:59:07.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay one thing that you have to understand about the range indicator for rengars ult is that it goes through fog of war and walls so the majority of the time you're going in for a gank with the exception of mid lane, you're not in direct line with them. You're around the corner you still have a wall to walk around. That gives enemies plenty of time to place a pink and dish out something or run away. I dont get why it is that if you're playing against evelynn and you don't buy a pink then you're dumb but if you're playing against rengar and you don't buy a pink then rengar is overpowered. And duality of a champion isn't a bad thing. But hands down rengar was made to be an assassin and riots slowly taking that from him. They're adding new options just as much as they're taking away his base. They've turned him from a fluid assassin into a clunky assassin and now they're just trying to make him a clunky fighter with no ability to actually effectively assassinate a target.","replies":[]}]}]}
