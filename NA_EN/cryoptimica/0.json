I am not a programmer. However I do know a few things. You shouldn&#039;t release a patch a few days before a huge event. (Or you do and this happens) OR hype an unstable program in which we all get fricked in the process when we decide to clear our schedules to participate in this huge event, which is just going to get cancelled. \r\nYou&#039;re loosing all credibility for this whole thing, if this was a first time offense it would be fine but this has happened EVERY SINGLE TIME you try to host Clash; and then we can&#039;t participate because we have stuff to do and it makes me so sad because Clash looks like a lot of fun...\r\nPlease fix this soon, I love you guys and I&#039;m not going anywhere, but I want to be able to trust you guys you know?\r\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[]}
