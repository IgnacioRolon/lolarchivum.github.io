Why is her being in another lane an issue?\n\nWe got promised an ADC and Riot has been hyping it. However, I would be sad to see she&#039;s just much more viable in another role.

If she can insta clear a wave with missiles she will be played bot, but she will also be broken because an instant fire skill can kill a wave. If she can't insta clear the wave she probably won't be played bot because she will get bullied too hard. The only way it kind of works is like a semi low cool down on q so she can clear in like 2-3 casts, but even then she lacks the defensive option of someone like Sivir to hang around the minion line for that long.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2018-02-21T10:15:05.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh god another toplane nightmare?
