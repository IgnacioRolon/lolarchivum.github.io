As said above, an AP fighter would love a heavy AP + health item, but that's not really something an AP assassin wants, and the many manaless AP champions don't really want to opt into the mana-heavy itemization of mages. We also see several marksmen pick Duskblade and Black Cleaver (an item that's popular on assassins as well, so it really is universal), and when Lethality was released it was heavily co-opted by marksmen when it was successful (this still happens, too), so AD itemization isn't really as super-distinct as it's made out to be.\n\nThere have also been many occasions, which persist today, of AP champions experiencing legitimate problems from their lack of item diversity: AP fighters often struggle to get tankiness and damage at the same time, and when they could with Rylai's, the item was so over-statted and generic that it had to be nerfed, as it was also being used by mages. Assassins who want to go for flat pen with Haunting Guise are railroaded into building a) health, a stat they don't really want to prioritize spending gold on, and b) Liandry's, a DoT item that doesn't really help their burst in the best way. Whereas even squishy AD champions can easily purchase life steal and make use of it (via Death's Dance or Ravenous Hydra, for example), AP champions have no major sustain option besides Catalyst of Aeons (exclusive to mana champions) and Gunblade (which is mostly bought by assassins for its burst active). AP champions play just as differently as AD champions, and also want very different stats based on their class, yet they're still being forced to contend with a much smaller pool of items, many of which cover multiple functions instead of just one (Morellonomicon is notorious for this, which is why it's essential to most AP builds).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2017-11-07T03:09:25.719+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"They've removed around 300 AP from the game since DFG.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skorch","date":"2017-11-06T22:02:48.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could almost guarentee no, simply because RR is changing so much.

It changed mid lane to being all about bullying.  Removed slow playing champions early for bursting dps champions late or bursting champions early.    Almost of champions got hurt with Rylai's nerf.  Yeah Syndra and a few others were abusing it.  But it was being used more for the good of itself, than being abused.  (Was a malzahar main prior to rework.  I am sad now)","replies":[{"poster":"Skorch","date":"2017-11-07T07:18:28.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with most of this... however i think you are heavily underplaying Rylais, it was a little insane before. Although i do think it was overnerfed, it was DEFINITELY heavily abused.\n\nI think they shouldve nerfed either the slow, or the stats. Because a 400HP 100AP item that slows for 40% was insane. Either make it like 300HP 65AP and be a Slow tool. Or, nerf the slow but let it keep its status as a HEAVY AP item.\nBUUUUUT They nerfed both.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Last Ballad","date":"2017-11-06T18:22:22.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They actually touched on this with a [dev post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/tqLzRtbG-ap-itemisation-context)(or something like that).\n\nThey plan on getting it out sometime during late this year and early next(if I remember correctly from one of meddler's posts), with a look at starting items(hopefully {{item:3165}} will no longer be mandatory for everyone that doesn't want to wait for {{item:3003}} or {{item:3027}} to stack, or not have GW, it will take either but both would be nice) and choices mages have in general, maybe like the fact that there are only 3 possible mpen items({{item:3020}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3135}}) vs the 5 possible armor pen items({{item:3142}} {{item:3033}} {{item:3147}} {{item:3814}} {{item:3036}}, technically 4 as lw builds into 2 items, but those items confer different bonuses so they count as separate items)","replies":[]}]}
