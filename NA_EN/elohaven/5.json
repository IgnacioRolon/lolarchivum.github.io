Just like Swain, I&#039;m feeling her kit was given too much power from the buffs. A week isn&#039;t enough to judge a &quot;highly mechanical champion&quot;. High mechanics take at least 100 games to master. Give the champion a month at least.\n\nHow do you feel about Kai&#039;Sa and Swain right now?","replies":[{"poster":"DrTeath","date":"2018-03-30T10:07:11.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw this and thought you were on the recieving end of me and my  bestie's Kaisa Swain bot lane .","replies":[]},{"poster":"1st Time Yasuo","date":"2018-03-30T09:36:10.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swain needs toned down a fuck ton, he has some of the highest base stats in the game atm, he could build straight tanks and just kill of the base dmg of his q which I belive is close to 385 base damage at max rank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-24T01:02:45.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swain?\n\nVayne?\n\nYou decide.","replies":[]}]}
