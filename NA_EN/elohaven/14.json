Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I&#039;m out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I&#039;m really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I&#039;m a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she&#039;ll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she&#039;s the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can&#039;t sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can&#039;t take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she&#039;s sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what&#039;s up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I&#039;ve been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo&#039; and behold, there&#039;s my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it.ï»¿","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Daddy","date":"2018-07-01T00:16:02.154+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"Still a better love story then Twilight.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-07-01T20:11:50.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is the comment I needed in my life.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FireDrizzle","date":"2018-07-01T06:50:31.583+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why did I read it all?","replies":[]},{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-07-01T00:46:24.426+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spank the Fox","date":"2018-07-01T09:44:43.614+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"This comment was funnier on Youtube.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BoilTheOil","date":"2018-07-01T10:45:17.926+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"repost im pretty sure","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rhai","date":"2018-07-01T09:43:47.324+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hold up, your battery lasts 5 years before recharge?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Type Null","date":"2018-07-01T20:16:53.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"phones battery life was insane","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2018-07-01T08:14:40.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/392/685/a9c.png\n\nhttps://media3.giphy.com/media/jTYrkhaM5Fbs4/giphy.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"NorthernRedStar","date":"2018-07-01T13:05:06.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is so rich.
