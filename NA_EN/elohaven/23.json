This large sample size with give enough statistical data on where you may want to change said champion and a large enough period for feedback.\n\nWith Kai&#039;Sa being unstoppable every game and Swain being a monstrosity for a period of time before your demagation (word similar to deforestation where mages are gutted), I think there&#039;s enough evidence to support new champions do not deserve immediate buffs.\n\nThus, with your new champion, we hope you can wait and monitor its progress.

Riot has a tendency of just going overboard with either buffs or nerfs on a champions release.

We brought up many past examples of champions suffering, including many who suffered much harder (e.g. Ivern, Tahm Kench, Gnar), before turning into complete balance monstrosities after a few misguided buffs, in addition to dominating the competitive scene the moment pro players figured them out. Riot's response to this was to reassure us that this time would be different, that these buffs were extensively researched and tested, and that they were sure to land Kai'Sa in just the right spot. They didn't. This total lack of hindsight worries me, because not only does it indicate that the devs balancing new champions aren't learning from past mistakes, but it also suggests that they _refuse_ to learn, and somehow believe that repeating the exact same methodology as before will somehow produce different results.\n\nI absolutely agree with the OP here: one week, let alone a couple of days, is not a good enough window of time to properly assess a new champion's strength. There is always a learning curve, especially when Riot releases more complex or mechanically difficult champions, and it's only once a certain number of players have gone past that curve that we can have a better idea of where a champion lies in terms of power. What Riot is doing right now is that they're effectively balancing new releases around their win rate at under 15 games, which as anyone can check on any stat site, is always much lower than a champion's actual win rate over a larger spread. This effect is even more intense on new champions, because players are figuring their kit out on their own, and do not yet have any sort of solid build or guide to follow. Because of this, I think we need _at the very least_ one patch cycle to gauge a champion's power: if they're doing far too well, then for sure they could get hotfixed, and the same should likely be done if they have some crazy low win rate, e.g. some sub-40 win rate as was the case for Syndra and Azir (though both happened also because the champions were super buggy on release), but anything in-between should be met with patience and proper analysis.","replies":[{"poster":"TempName74814","date":"2018-05-01T07:44:08.394+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"she was definitely objectively bad on release. but they overbuffed the shit out of her. the e buff and passive buff (the passive buff could be halved) were enough. she just didn't need the auto range buff or the q range/dmg/cd buff or the w dmg buff ","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-05-01T19:55:27.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that Kai'Sa wasn't perfectly balanced on release, and was likely on the weaker side, but to this day it's not entirely certain, because none of us were given enough time to properly gauge her power level before she received blanket buffs.
