They should be bursting you with AAs and abilities and of them only Jhin and Draven use the supposed broken Stormrazor. MF uses duskblade and lethality with Dark Harvest and Lucian is honestly trash right now unless you're a god at him; his winrate is low and he builds Bork. Not Crit \n\nAs for cost being lowered, it's not an overstatement in the least. Their core three items and boots(IE, shiv, RFC) still come out to 10100. I dont see a significant cost lowering here at all. \n\nIf you're referencing the cost lowering to StormRazor, it was more the items cost was lowered for everyone who abuses, of which that still more Assassins than ADCs. \n\nADCs are weaker than they were pre 8.11. Even if their strength was stronger in the late game, that's where they're intended to be strong and doing their damage.\n\nI want them to rework stormrazor as much as the next person but I'm not blaming ADCs for it or making up nonsense about them blowing people up with it. The primary abusers of the item have always been Assassins and that's an issue multiple people said would happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaìju","date":"2018-08-23T13:59:51.214+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"Those four are meant to nuke people too, MF literally goes lethality a lot.
