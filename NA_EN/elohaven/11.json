I'll try it out as it may actually be better to do this.\nPlus, mid-lane has the shortest travel distance mathematically so a lot more farm can be gain which would lead to a lot of heavy scaling.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-01-28T05:08:19.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but that is thinking outside the meta and not being a sheep... \n\nthe one thing is the reason mid is normally an AP mage lane or an assassin lane.. they level faster with the shorter distance to lane therefore they hit power spikes earlier then other champs/lanes and can assert that power before someone can build against them accordingly \n\nsay like an LB mid who has strong roam/ burst early game and due her getting lvl 6 1st typically no one in the sidelanes, or jungler has enough mr /hp do deal wit her burst and advanced lvl which makes it easier for her to do what she does...\n\nsimilar to zed with armor pen... and so on...","replies":[{"poster":"Elohaven","date":"2017-01-28T12:59:25.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hence I like Teemo as an off-meta ADC.
