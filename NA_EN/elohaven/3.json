One flash+Q under tower with his glasscannon build with R chunked me for 50% with a E+W proc&#039;ing electrocute brought me down to about 50 hp which his W+E did the job for him. Then he walked away with 75% of his health remaining from my tower. Thankfully, the Malphite was on my team because the damage from just one R was insanity but not as much as support Brand with no items.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s such a shame base stats for ADCs are pretty much null. I wouldn&#039;t mind with 2 items but 1 item and 100-0&#039;ing me while he was behind in farm, xp, and gold is bullshit. (Store says Amumu&#039;s damage is on 2nd level on the scale while most assassins have it on the 3rd level since he&#039;s a tank).\r\n\r\nGranted, Amumu should be rewarded for landing his abilities but 1-item shouldn&#039;t allow people to start 100-0&#039;ing opponents. Miss Fortune with Conqueror can 100-0 you with one ultimate with duskblade. I thought the whole point of assassins was a 2-item powerspike where they started to 100-0 you and a 1-item powerspike where they can snowball for those 2-items. \r\n\r\nThen again - Amumu isn&#039;t even an assassin. He&#039;s a tank. But glasscannon is much more valuable for him since he gets health, his base stats offer free resistances with scaling, and marksmen can&#039;t do anything about it. If he 100-0&#039;d me in DPS with his tantrum under tower - I would have respected it. However, it&#039;s burst which I can&#039;t build against before 2 items on Vayne - so thank god I wasn&#039;t playing a 3-item ADC. \r\n\r\nTL;DR - Electrocute, assassin design, and burst need to be fixed - not looked - FIXED - in general in this game. Then we can look at tank flat damage. Then working on assassins for high elo\r\n\r\nRegarding solutions, I have several regarding how assassins should work with damage and burst but I&#039;ll leave that to the day Riot decides to open its doors for a discussion on it.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-25T22:26:02.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amumu has hilariously high AP ratios, he has _always been able to do this_.\n\nI had great fun playing him as an AP support last season.

I mean, yeah, there are tanky AP items that provide as substantial amount of AP, but since Amumu is typically a jungler, I'm hesitant to believe he didn't finish his Machete+Talisman item into the AP enchantment according to what you described.\n\nActually just looked at the op.gg for his build against you: can't tell if he finished RoA first or Runic Echoes (if RoA, then yeah, he'll have some slight tank itemization). Also, not sure why Sorcery secondary at all for Amumu, but Scorch/Gathering Storm may have had something to do with it.","replies":[]}]}
