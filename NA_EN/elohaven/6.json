Because everything else that was attempted at bot, where adcs are mostly played in the meta, other than adc and support have been nerfed out of the lane, and so it became an echo chamber where only adc and supp play against each other.\n\nThere are few adcs who are broken among themselves, doesn't mean adcs as a whole are balanced in the scope of the entire and the rest of the game. And they really aren't balanced when the rest of the game are concerned. It's that simple. Just think the fact adcs are perfectly viable in solo lanes as long as it's not organised play where team dynamics is far more important, and many of the adcs are actually early game lane bullies despite their late-game champ status, and let it sink in.\n\nIt's not just adcs, adcs and supp and crit items and supp items together are easily the worst BY FAR balance point in the game.\n\n......\n\nEDIT: If you want to say \"if adcs are so good, why are they only played bot?\" As briefly touched on, adcs are played bot out of almost purely formality in solo queue, there is not that much reasons why people play them at bot because they're actually perfectly viable and often strong in other lanes in solo queue. It is only in organised play where their lane position actually has a real purpose and reason, where they are stationed at bot because sidelanes are obviously safer and bot has more strategic importance due to being closer to the dragon pit; and for the team comp importance in organised play, they would also obviously only use 1 adc; but that's not because they're somehow only viable at bot or whatever, no, and you don't interpret it that way.","replies":[{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2018-03-13T05:32:13.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BtoVTKwj,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-03-13T05:19:10.395+0000)\nJust think the fact adcs are perfectly viable in solo lanes as long as it&#x27;s not organised play where team dynamics is far more important, and many of the adcs are actually early game lane bullies despite their late-game champ status, and let it sink in.\n\nThey aren't, though.  There are maybe two or three  ADCs that are viable both in bot lane and either mid or top lane.  Vayne only works as a specific top lane counter or she gets shit on.  Lucian provides nothing for the team when he goes mid (and he's a garbage tier ADC atm anyway).  Same for Ezreal minus his attack speed buff.\n\nExcept for Ezreal and Twitch, the ADCs that can jungle aren't viable bot lane, but the jungle isn't a true solo lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Colton147","date":"2018-03-13T03:32:57.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:222}} {{champion:145}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bazooka Blade","date":"2018-03-13T02:12:40.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"are adc better then {{champion:68}} if so they all need a nerfing","replies":[]}]}
