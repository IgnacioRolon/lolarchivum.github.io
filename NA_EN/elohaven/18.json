Yet, ARAM has the worst &quot;randomness&quot; to it. \r\n\r\nConstant marksmen teams and toxic poke compositions against all melees. \r\nARAM only accounts.\r\n\r\nWhy don&#039;t we fix ARAM? We can easily address a majority of these issues with minor fixes.\r\n\r\n- Make the entire champion pool available instead of the player&#039;s own pool of owned champions\r\n - Helps new players possibly try out champions they haven&#039;t played before\r\n - Stops ARAM only accounts from dominating\r\n- Offer melee champions waveclear options/sustain options\r\n - Melee champions against ranged compositions just get too abused early on to the point of being bursted once they engage\r\n- Configure the algorithm to always allow the enemy team to have an equal amount of ranged champions(mages/marksmen)\r\n- Offer surrender at 10","replies":[{"poster":"TheProfezzor","date":"2018-02-26T04:19:13.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should be random the only thing I agree with on your list is all accounts have access to entire champ pool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2018-02-26T02:19:20.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To play something casual and mindless when you're burnt out from summoners rift.","replies":[]}]}
