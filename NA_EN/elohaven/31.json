Didn't know Braum was this hot for the Boards.\n\nI was playing League inside the Library and the librarian thought Santa Braum&#039;s scroll was a huge donger. Of course I didn&#039;t realize this, and responded to her request to get off the computer with stating I play with my friends a lot with this. I guess the wording was a bit off as she was fuming. Many of my friends watching were also secretly offended by this massive donger looking thing I called a scroll. Fortunately, they revealed me to the light.\n\nhttps://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/004/411/396/large/crow-god-snowdownbraum-1920.jpg?1483531831\n\nhttps://pre00.deviantart.net/b631/th/pre/i/2016/328/5/2/santa_braum_by_yy6242-dapgald.png\n\nDear Riot, \n\nAs a player who has been playing your game for a while, I would love if Braum wasn&#039;t so sexualized. I am thanking the librarian for kicking me out and revealing my eyes to the male oversexualization in this game and how much inappropiate innuendos are made. I understand the word THICC is modern day joke, but in a gaming environment with teenagers playing - this is inappropiate. Braum is just too THICC.\n\nAlso, his beard and mustache are just too masculine. I was hoping he would not be made an attractive hunk so that I could play a game of League without being told I am playing an oversexualized version of males.\n\nSeriously,\nYour Entitled Player","replies":[]}
