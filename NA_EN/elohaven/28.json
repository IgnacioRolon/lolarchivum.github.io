She does not fall off anymore with her damage.\r\n\r\nVoid+Sorc&#039;s+Lich Bane+Charm Boost allow her to easily take 70-80% of a squishy&#039;s HP through Maw in one ability.\r\n\r\nGranted, if a squishy gets charmed, they should die but that much damage and a charm on top makes resistance/reaction impossible. You need a QSS and Maw to survive before you get ulted or attacked again. Her damage does not fall off anymore. \r\n\r\nShe&#039;s really strong so nerfs are possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-01-12T15:06:36.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"? It's not that she's strong, it's because everyone practically depended on the you know 27+ mr per lvl to nullify it with 200 hp at lvl 18 etc deal, besides how can she be that strong when in the past you had to run magic pen marks+ scaling ap to do wonders and her ult is an execute.","replies":[{"poster":"Elohaven","date":"2018-01-12T21:39:33.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne is strong because all her counters got nerfed.\n\nEvelynn is strong because defense is a lot weaker than damage right now.\n\nThe issue with Evelynn is her high damage - one shot immediately leading to an ultimate that you cant stop.","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-01-13T08:42:22.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, shouldn't the issue not be eve but all mages and assassins in general that got buffed now cause everyone's weaker *Mo snowball* Rito pls ;C didn't you learn from s7\n \nAd items getting more dirt cheap, her base kit is better than the opponents cause they depended on runes/masteries (like majority of champs)\n\nHmm, well when I saw a fed Eve in s7, it was nothing you could do as a squishy,the lich  bane lover like tf synergizes with her low cds giving her nukes at all times, practically she was harmless when she wasn't fed, or counterjg/ stomp her before she becomes a monster placing key control/pink wards where she'd normally gank or group with tanks surrounding you etc.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kivolan","date":"2018-01-12T15:08:51.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Stealth + Hard CC in a kit is extremely unhealthy.
