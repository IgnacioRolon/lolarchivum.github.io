It's really hard to make a damage-oriented melee-champion that functions as such in pro play, can survive pro-level teamfights, and is anywhere remotely approaching fair in solo-queue, especially lower levels.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-04-23T20:37:49.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the real issue with assassins in pro play is that they are risky and require support from their team.  You suddenly need someone else to provide waveclear and you suddenly need someone else to do magic damage (usually).  Then the assassins themselves are high risk, high reward, and pro teams generally don't like taking risks.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wild Geese","date":"2018-04-23T17:08:55.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bring back silence on {{champion:91}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:38}}  , and give some disarms to some others!.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2018-04-23T17:12:51.941+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean as long as you're ok with having those champions push the 90%+ ban rate like Kassadin used to do when he had a silence why not.","replies":[{"poster":"Wild Geese","date":"2018-04-23T17:22:57.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kaioko,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EaRbEQFM,comment-id=000a0000,timestamp=2018-04-23T17:12:51.941+0000)\n>\n> I mean as long as you&#x27;re ok with having those champions push the 90%+ ban rate like Kassadin used to do when he had a silence why not.\n\nI mean the answer is so obvious I don't see why not have silence in this game, removing it was just a scrub change to begin with and it will make these characters viable again.\n\nI don't see why it isn't fair in a game with airborne, stun, and suprression, 3 statis effects that don't allow you to do *anything* to not have silences (you can move, you can attack, you just can't cast!).\n\nOf course they'd have to adjust around Talon, Kassadin, and LeBlanc if they had Silences again but it would be totally worth it and make the game far more interesting.\n\nAs for disarm, which is a fantastic anti-adc cc, who do you think should have it?\nI'd say; Zed.. the disarm in his ult. It would be a neat bit of utility for him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-04-23T20:20:55.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I think disarm would make sense on assassins to a degree, so long as they aren't spammable.  It wouldn't stop enemies from kiting/cc locking assassins, wouldn't help them much against mages (where it seems they don't need help), and it would help them survive long enough against an adc and support for it to be possible for them to pull off their burst.\n\nIn the case of against support and adc, they'd still lose if they get hit by cc and shields would suck for them, but they may still manage the kill if they evade some or all of the cc.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
