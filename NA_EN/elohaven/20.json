A {{champion:91}}  or {{champion:238}}  are just as broken with it since there is literally nothing you can do to stop them. {{item:3814}}  needs to be nerfed into the ground. There is no reason only 2 champs in the game have a spellshield and it only lasts like a second, but this fking thing last 10 and only has a 30 second cd? For the amount of power this thing gives in stats alone, its active should be really punishing if used wrong. I personally thing it should be either 5 second shield on minute cd or 3 second shield on its current 30 cd.\n\nRiot was fking retarded to make an item that is a mix of on demand {{item:3102}}  and {{item:3156}}  and didn't think it would be broken in and of itself. Let alone being even bigger failures at design and balance by making the thing only really have a 20 second cd.\n\nPeople cry about {{item:3157}} that thing has a 2 minute cd, only protects you for 2.5 seconds and also is a negative since you are stunned during it, EoN has 30 second cd, protects you for 10 seconds, you freely move during it, and has insanely great stats all at the cost of god forbid channeling it for 1.5 seconds before a fight and poke taking it down which often enough is cc trying to stop the bastard.","replies":[{"poster":"Elohaven","date":"2017-02-19T07:15:59.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Banshees and Maw is an issue regarding the redundancy of the passives+EoN.
