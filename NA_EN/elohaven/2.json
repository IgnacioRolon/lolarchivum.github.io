I know that icon distribution is something that (rightfully so) is not very high priority compared to other game system changes. However, earning an icon and then receiving it almost a month later can be a crummy feeling (especially when it's holiday themed). I know that your system for icon distribution handles some icons automatically (such as the ones for clicking a link, Piltover, Star Guardian, etc) which usually are received in hours to a few days, and some are handled more or less manually (ones earned in game) that often don't show up for weeks. \n\nIn the future, it would be awesome if a fully autonomous system could be implemented for all icons so that players could use them while the event is still ongoing, instead of getting them after the event is already over.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-19T04:44:05.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're still sending out these Icons until the end of the month, so give it some time and you should see the icon arrive on your account.
