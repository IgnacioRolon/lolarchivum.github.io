It is fine.\nThe only issue is his double critical chance in which he can scale at any point in the game even when he&#039;s very behind - and still dominate.\n\nJust give his double critical chance and -10% critical damage to a new ADC since their squishiness balances this.\n\nHis shield is really good, he can farm really well, and with the removal - he will still be a monstrosity mid and late game. Just he has to earn it like everyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"Salron","date":"2017-04-12T17:32:44.533+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"His damage is fine\"\n\"Let's remove this major source of his damage with no compensation\"\nhttp://puu.sh/vi3zd/d9a6d83785.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"BlackEyesBlue","date":"2017-04-12T18:27:39.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd take this more seriously if the posters name wasn't a yasuo pun...","replies":[{"poster":"Yaśuo Main","date":"2017-04-12T21:03:10.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if I said this?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SexyBabyJesusZ","date":"2017-04-12T17:20:03.348+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"every ability yasuo has is balanced,\n\nits just once you put all those abilities on one champion, shit gets crazy","replies":[{"poster":"Yaśuo Main","date":"2017-04-12T21:03:32.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No no no..\n\nClearly that's {{champion:23}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShiraZen","date":"2017-04-12T18:36:34.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apparently no-one realizes that without the crit chance built into his kit, he would be free to build whatever he wanted for damage? There's a reason why he's made like he is. Take away the crit passives and suddenly you have Triforce/FM Yasuo again, or whatever us Yasuo mains come up with. Then you'll make even MORE threads about him, and the cycle of life and death continues. We will win, you will QQ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-04-12T18:25:36.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Come on man, do you even #gamedesign? You can't just remove portions of Yasuo's kit without it having major effects on the entire thing. He's not some mid-lane mage where you can take away a slow or what have you and merely look at it as a net nerf. His kit is like a machine with loads of interconnected bits, and regardless of how unhealthy it may or may not be, balancing champion kits like those needs to be handled with finesse, not with a sledgehammer.\n\nHell, the last time they outright took out part of his kit was his old W passive, and though I'd argue it only needed tuning, you can look at this change log and see that nothing else they've done to him as been as drastic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brain Errör 404","date":"2017-04-12T17:35:53.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or they can just take away his shield.
