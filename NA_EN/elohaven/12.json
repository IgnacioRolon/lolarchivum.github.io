WTF you mean grab the lantern? (I WAS using Dark Star skin so....slightly understandable...but still)\n- Yo, Morg, what's with the KS? (They were standing in my puddle when they died. Like I can control the dmg ticks.) << Repeat for anyone with any sort of poison, or my favorite, a tank with Sunfire Cape.\n- WTF Teemo support? They have a Nautilus. We're going to get owned. (Jhin and I proceed to eradicate the Varus and Nautilus in lane. Jhin gets all the honors. No more mention of how bad Teemo support is. Amazing right?)\n\nBonus - Wtf man why you feeding so hard? (Maybe if I didn't have to protect your ass that can't stay out of combat and continually insists on following me while I poke instead of getting CS .................................................) I have no problem making the sacrifice play for a teammate - once, maybe twice depending on the circumstances AFTER the first one. If I sacrifice and you die 3 secs later, either I made a mistake and you came to cover me so I took the fall to get you out, or you're an idiot and ran BACK into combat (in which case I made a mistake I won't be repeating), or you got away. If you got away, I'll do it again if needed to keep you up. The support can be down kills/deaths - it's the assists that matter. Kills are good too, you know, more gold and all, but it's better for the team to split it.\n\nPS - Objectives, not KDA, are the point of League. Get it through your heads. A support dying 10+ times is nothing new (less is preferable yes, but we ARE talking Bronze here), because that's their JOB IN THE GAME. To save the squishy ADC and whoever else to fight another day, or at the very least, to contribute some sort of CC to fights. Of course on the flip side, the best CC is death, so......\n\n{{sticker:sona-playing}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-07-03T13:52:55.432+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"ADC and Deserved kill they worked hard for never go in the same sentence.
