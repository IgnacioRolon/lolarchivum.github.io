Started happening a few patches ago I figured it'd be fixed by now due to me seeing I wasn't the only one reporting this same bug. I thought it'd be fixed in the alpha as well but it was not. I('m aware not everyone has this bug and ive had to ban jayce even if someone on my team wanted to play him because if I don't ill probably lose due to that jayce's can hammer form numerous times during a game and team fights. it only freezes client for about a second but in a team fight it can be very game changing at the right moments. Especially when I play a lot of adc I don't think id need to tell you how a 1 second freeze can be game changing while kiting, laning, or team fighting. I've made a post before but it keeps getting ignored its really annoying at this point cuz I used to main jayce and now I cant play him or play on a team with him on it without it being pretty much a loss. Jayce was working perfectly fine before so idk what file you added or took out but i'd like it to atleast be looked into. This is a new laptop with literally nothing but league on it xD it aint the best computer but it can run this game fairly well.\r\nHow to recreate bug/glitch:\r\nGo in game with a jayce on your team, or yourself, or on enemy team. Watch client while he goes into hammer form. (It will freeze client as he presses hammer form)\r\nWhat's supposed to happen:\r\nJayce goes into hammer form and no freeze lol\r\nSteps taken in attempt to fix bug:\r\nRepaired league client 5 times.\r\nRedownloaded league twice.\r\nrebooted my computer once (was yesterday)","replies":[{"poster":"I Will Solo Kill","date":"2016-11-10T01:23:43.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, idk what u did but 6.22 fixed it.
