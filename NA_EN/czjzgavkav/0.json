Slay Belle Katarina  is missing a majority of her green particles on E and a majority of her snowflakes. Sandstorm Katarina  is also missing her sand-coloured particle on her initial location before E, instead having the basic red smoke.\r\n\r\nRIOT, I think we should get what we paid for in these skins, and after so many patches could we please see a particle fix.\r\n\r\nYou can check the Skin Spotlights for what the particles should look like:\r\n\r\n[Sandstorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiLZ_udJOjA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=43s) and [Slay Belle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU7UKEFl3g8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=44s),\r\n\r\nCompared to what they currently look like:\r\n\r\n[Sandstorm](https://i.imgur.com/JQzaGRt.png) and [Slay Belle](https://i.imgur.com/9mOGjxD.png).\r\n\r\nThank you for reading, I would love to see this fixed. :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-04T21:11:26.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya AND RUN OFF,\n\nThanks for the report!
