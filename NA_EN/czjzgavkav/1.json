I have confirmed this with my friend, so it is not just a problem on my end.\r\n\r\nWhat we should be seeing is heavy green particles and snowflakes on Slay Belle, but it&#039;s been reduced to the red smoke with a faint amount of green.\r\nOn the Sandstorm skin, the sand-coloured particles have been completely reverted to the basic red smoke.\r\n\r\nThis bug has been happening since around preseason 5. While it may not be incredibly major, we should get what we paid for in a skin and I really liked Slay Belle&#039;s E particles and Sandstorm just isn&#039;t the same as before.\r\n\r\nPlease may we see a fix for this, Riot? I&#039;m sure it wouldn&#039;t take so long as other things, even if this isn&#039;t on the top of your list.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-28T17:33:04.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya Shunpwned (holy crap your name is awesome. XD)! \n\nThanks for reporting this! I agree that although it's not a gamebreaking bug, those particles were cool, and should definitely be back on the skin! \n\nWe'll see what happened with these particles and get them back where they belong. :]","replies":[{"poster":"czJzgavkAv","date":"2015-04-28T17:57:18.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!
