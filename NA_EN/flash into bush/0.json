Rito, fix your game. I cannot control your server not connecting to mine and I should not be punished for it. The point of this is: don't punish your player base (LP and 5-game penalty) for not being able to connect.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-03T04:59:36.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Regardless of the reason the disconnection happens, your absence from the match impacts **everyone in the match**. For this reason, the system treats all disconnections equally and we're unable to remove penalties associated with it.\n\nMost of the time, these disconnection issues are caused by network settings that cause an *unstable connection* to our servers. Our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) will ensure your local settings are configured properly for League, so I recommend giving those steps a go.\n\nLet me know if this caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
