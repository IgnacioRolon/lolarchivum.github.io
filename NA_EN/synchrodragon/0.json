And are not on the said discounts they are said to be on as such. I was wondering if i could have this fixed, and my shop reset, because for one, I dont use any of these champions so i have less insentive to buy any skins for them. For two, things like 750 skins being labeled as 1620 and being on a 40% discount is just.... yeah. Weird. Seeing as ive never had an issue here before. Im glad i didnt just go ahead and buy something (only champion i play here is poppy and i dont want to buy skins on a smurf account for a champion i have as a pocket pick, i save that for champions im adding to my main champion pool) Anyways, i would greatly appreciate it being fixed and possibly having my shop reset so that I have insentive to throw some toonies atcha guys","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2018-01-04T17:25:14.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It takes the prices of the champion as well if you dont own them.
