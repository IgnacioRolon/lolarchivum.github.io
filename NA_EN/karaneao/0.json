In game ping from other plays can be helpful but also taken advantage of. To ping something 5-6 times for no apparent reason is just spamming your team and to people who have sound on the noise is irritating. I Believe there should be a limit to how soon you can use a ping after you have already used it to limit players from intentionally damaging their team's game with spamming. It only takes one ping to catch your team's attention any more than that afterwards and it causes issues between players who may find you to be toxic to the team's chances of actually winning.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Eno","date":"2014-10-13T15:18:44.160+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good news! You can now mute pings all together if you wish!\n\nIn your in-game sound settings, you'll now see additional volume sliders for pings as well as ambiences. \n\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Karaneao","date":"2014-10-14T05:12:55.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you i used it in my last game and im so happy there is this option.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Skiren","date":"2014-10-13T15:41:18.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obviously constant pinging is annoying, but for one, ARAM does use pings plenty, \"stay away from that bush\" for teammates that didn't notice enemies in it while you did, for engages(Panth, Sion now, Singed, Voli, etc.), for when someone tries to sneak by to get your Nexus when your team isn't looking, etc., and secondly, pinging more than once *does* have a purpose, like if someone pings once that their enemy is missing, that just makes you wary of ganks, but if someone pings 2-3 times that their enemy is missing, it's usually trying to tell you that they *know* the enemy is ganking and it's usually followed by a ping of their approximate path.(there ARE however, still just plain spammers as well, obviously)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gear Kitty","date":"2014-10-14T07:18:17.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's also the fact that pings give the placement of Teemo Shrooms, Shaco Boxes, Caitlyn Traps, and anyone trying to be sneaky in a bush or going past you for a Nexus kill.\n\n\nIt can also tell your one remaining ally to clear the super minion wave instead of chasing down the fleeing enemies who will most likely turn around and murder them anyway.\n\n\nSo no, pings are sticking around, and I personally will keep using them. And if you keep hearing pings in just a few seconds, it means someone should be grabbing a health relic, or pointing out which poro to feed. And what sick, evil, twisted creature wouldn't feed a poro?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zhugan","date":"2014-10-13T17:37:49.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pings still have a place in ARAM. Yes, the overall objective is obviously pretty simple, but who to target in fights, when to fall back (or if you are falling back and others don't realize), and when enemies respawn are all easily communicated through pings and have made the difference for me on wins and losses in ARAM before.\n\nSure, there are jackasses that ping way too much, but that is true in every game mode. Taking the pings away would solve that problem, but it would also reduce the overall effectiveness of communication on ARAM.","replies":[]}]}
