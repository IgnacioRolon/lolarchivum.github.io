Instad i play one sided games most of the time.\nI know riot dont give a damn , abut i just want to let them know that this matchmaking is stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2013-10-02T17:48:26.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not mocking you at all, so don't get me wrong, but I find it hilarious that you're technically posting on-topic for the name of this subcommunity even if you're off-topic for the aims of this subcommunity :) The Live Balance discussion community is more for the live balance of the game in terms of gameplay, not so much ranked / league play.\n\nAnd matchmaking doesn't have an agenda when it comes to placing you in ranked games. I know it can be frustrating but if you focus on getting better and improving rather than climbing you may appreciate the first option more than the second :)\n\nI'll leave this post up as an example because it's also kind of a funny interpretation. Once again not making fun of you.","replies":[{"poster":"migty1joe","date":"2013-10-03T16:57:05.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Finaly, someone likes my humor. The Live Balance! \"on getting better and improving\" -i played around 7k games, i have no fun in playing one sided  games all the time to improve, that is the reason why i qq. When i was newb, it was fun for me to play game even if it was one sided, but now i clearly see how this mm works, and it sucks. Some games are not even funny. Problem is that there are tons of new unexperianced players that somehow find a way in those games and they clearly cant play.  I suggested sperate servers for all players above 1k games or fix in mm. \n","replies":[]}]}]}
