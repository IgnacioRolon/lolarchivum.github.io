If it's around 30% or less, make sure you're running the installer with admin rights and try turning off any firewalls/antivirus while it's installing as those can sometimes mess it up. \n\nIf you're getting much further along in the install, that might be happening if your network is hitting some kind of hiccup in its connection with our servers. In that case, update your DNS and Port Forward settings by following the steps outlined in this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).
