The exact situation was: Maphite ult into Syndra, Yasuo Ult off of the Malphite knockup, and Syndra using Zhonya&#039;s as Yasuo is slamming her down, before she hits the ground. I have looked around and seen a few articles on this, but could not tell from them if this is a bug or if Riot changed the way either Zhonya&#039;s or the ults&#039; CCs worked. Does anyone know more about this, preferably with a reliable link to technical information as to the relationship if it is not a bug?  here is the link to the match history: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2061932996/210264010?tab=overview","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-01-08T23:42:30.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if it's intentional, but based on what I remember from an old incident during a tournament, the zit's a thing happens when a command (Zhonya's active) is buffered during a knockup, then, when Yasuo's ult applies its own CC, there's a miniscule gap during wich the buffered command is allowed to go through before the champion is suspended in mid-air.","replies":[]}]}
