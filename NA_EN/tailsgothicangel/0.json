I hit the \"reconnect\" button, but I was still unable to reconnect! I hit it and hit it, but to no avail. I sent several bug reports -- trouble-shooted the game, exited out of I-tunes, updated my laptop, etc. But it was to no avail! I couldn't reconnect! The game ended and I was only able to connect to the stats screen where you go at the end of every game. I apologized but only the players of the enemy team were there. I then thought -- to my idiocy -- \"It might have been a bad server..\" so with a bit of hope -- I tried to get into another game -- but it happened again. after only a moment, I get Leaver Buster. I was in the new client.... I tried get into the old client but got nothing. my game was also saying that I wasn't connected to the internet..... obviously it was wrong because I'm currently typing this just after it had happened!\r\n\r\nIn the games that I was supposed to connect to I was supposed to be in these roles:\r\n\r\nTop Lane - {{champion:17}} (omega squad skin) {{summoner:14}} {{summoner:4}} \r\n\r\nJungle - {{champion:78}} (Star Guardian skin) {{summoner:11}}  {{summoner:4}} \r\n\r\nfor those of you who were in these games that I was supposed to be in -- I'M SO SORRY! I hope you all understand.\r\n\r\nI won't be playing until this is fixed -- I'm gonna give it about.... 24 hours, if not then 2 days max. Depending. I tried everything I knew. heck I have Razor Cortex game booster to help with lag problems! Nothing has worked. Riot, please fix this, and get your 'Leaver Buster bot' to know the difference between a crash and hitting the 'leave game' button.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-03T02:40:58.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like there's something up with your network settings or path to the servers since you're seeing network connectivity error messages and having issues connecting to matches. While I cannot remove your Leaverbuster penalty, as we're locked out of making changes to prevent any sort of abuse, I **can** assist in troubleshooting and resolving this issue.\n\nBecause different servers and services you access are located in different geolocations, there could be issues reaching our servers while no issues reaching another service like Google or YouTube. I recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to verify all your local configurations are good before we investigate further. I'd recommend testing any changes in a custom match alone to prevent any further penalties.\n\nLet me know if you still experience these disconnections after taking those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"TailsGothicAngel","date":"2017-01-03T05:43:36.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This morning I made a custom game in hopes that the servers weren't messing up again - and to my surprise I was able to get into a custom game. After that I decided to take a risk and try to play a coop vs AI game -- and it worked. I continued to play coop vs ai until leaver buster was finally over. If it was bad luck or something else I don't know, but I do know that its over. If it ever happens to me again I'll be sure to check the connection guide and alert you all if it happens again and the guide doesn't help. Thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}
