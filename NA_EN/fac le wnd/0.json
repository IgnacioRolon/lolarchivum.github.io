HELP PLEASE","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After the released of the new patch a few days back, I tried logging into LoL and my game started acting up. It sets all of my graphic settings back to low, and sets my capped FPS back to 25 FPS. I have to redo all of these settings when I get in game and it gets really annoying. Someone help?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T18:49:27.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your settings are not syncing to the servers.
