The game won't show you a log that has 80% innocent chat and 20% toxic chat if it can avoid it - because then you're left to pick through it to find the bad parts. The system will show you \"enough\" - it'll pick 1-5 recent games to show that clearly show the type of behavior you displayed, but it doesn't show all of them necessarily.\n\nFurthermore, if you haven't spent the RP purchase, I'm almost certain Riot will refund it as they have in the past. Submit a **clear, concise, and polite** support ticket. Don't contest the ban, simply say \"I purchased RP and immediately after was banned, can I have a refund as I literally could not have spent any of it\".\n\nIf you wish to contest the ban, do so in a **separate** ticket - the financial transaction is a completely separate issue and goes to a different team - so if you try and claim how \"bad\" the system is then they're going to forward it to the ban team, and that team can't refund you.\n\nPlease keep in mind that Riot is under no obligation to refund you - and it is not fraud. You lost access to your account through your own actions, which means **you** had the ability to prevent your loss of access to your purchase. While Riot will almost certainly refund, they are under no obligation to do so, and your attitude in dealing with the support team will likely play a big role in whether they decide to help you out or not. Be polite, do not be argumentative, do not complain about how \"bad\" Riot or the client or the punishment or whatever is, simply state the facts and ask for the resolution you want.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Brotha","date":"2019-11-08T14:46:08.339+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ask for money back if not just back charge it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sky Cardis","date":"2019-11-08T14:43:38.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol they arent giving you money back...I wouldn't hold my breath.","replies":[{"poster":"YTmustangcody","date":"2019-11-09T09:37:55.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's where your wrong","replies":[{"poster":"Sky Cardis","date":"2019-11-09T16:18:06.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YTmustangcody,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=4GAOxEjs,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-11-09T09:37:55.182+0000)\n>\n> That's where your wrong\n\nNah you'll either rage quit or get banned again because of your mouth.
