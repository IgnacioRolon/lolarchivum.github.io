One thing I noticed from the get-go was that Mundo looked a pale green instead of his regular purple. (He wasn't using any skins, even Mundo's normal splash art popped up in the load screen) Not a big deal, I thought, but as we laned we encountered an even stranger bug: Mundo's infected cleaver was completely invisible.\r\n\r\nI don't have any recording device or anything so I don't have any proof to provide you guys. But everyone in my team noticed that his cleavers weren't showing up whenever he used his q, only the noise it makes once it hits you. We even discussed it in the all chat, though the guys on the other team said everything was fine on their end.\r\n\r\nJust thought I'd report it because an invisible projectile is nearly impossible to dodge (Not even the animation of mundo throwing it appeared) and can prove to be a bad experience, even if it's rare.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-27T17:54:10.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! \n\nWe're currently investigating this issue!

I believe there is some sort of script causing this, Which Riot would have to take furthur measures to patch these. It could be a bug, but high suspension that it's a cheating script.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deathsuckit","date":"2015-03-21T19:03:34.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just played a game with this exact error.
