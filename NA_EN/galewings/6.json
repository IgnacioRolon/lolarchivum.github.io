In my thoughts I realized that the Furor enhancement has some good synergy with Ashe's Q. For every basic attack, you get faster and the enemy gets slowed so it would be nearly impossible to catch you. (Err, that is if we didn't live in a rift with so much mobility everywhere)\r\n\r\nYou can also throw in a Trinity Force for the Rage passive it gives for even more movespeed (I'm not really sure if Rage would stack with Furor's passive and I'd appreciate some clarification). If they do stack I believe you'd end up having an Ashe with something along the lines of 475-500 ms that is perma slowing you.\r\n\r\nSo what do you guys think? Would a build that looks something like this: {{item:3252}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3139}} be any good? (not a final build you can swap for armor pen or defensive items and such)","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-02-28T22:54:36.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might be, however Shiv>PD on Ashe. She has cute little synchronization with Shiv in that her first auto always crits, combined with the fact the shock from Shiv can crit adds alot of AoE damage. There are very few champs in which Shiv is better than PD but this is one of them. I also wouldn't recommend triforce on Ashe but I do see the point you are making on it. It would be inefficient as Q to my knowledge doesn't proc Sheen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Chin","date":"2015-02-28T04:57:27.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, triforce isn't that great on ashe but the furor boots is a good idea. It's a really good enchantment when you don't need homeguards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vallant","date":"2015-02-28T01:24:18.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldn't need the tri-force on top of furor with Ashe's slow. Tri-force would be great if toggling q on and off triggered it but to my knowledge it doesn't, slot could be filled with something else, like a Hurricane for aoe slow or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Galewings","date":"2015-02-28T02:20:58.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are correct that Spellblade doesn't proc with toggling Q on and off but it will proc with your W and since you want to weave in your Volley with your basic attacks whenever you can I still think it'll be useful.\n\nI don't think Hurricane would be that good personally. I believe Trinity Force offers a lot more stat-wise than just the 70% as and the extra attack arrow thingies. It's true that with Runaan's you can apply an AoE slow with your basic attacks but you can already do that with W anyway while getting the T force proc.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NIEKUH","date":"2015-02-28T01:20:34.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"id like to know cause i was using some furor boots  just cause on my ashe a few games... and  if was useful when engaging and getting some boost to catch up while i slowd them but hard to get out!","replies":[]}]}
