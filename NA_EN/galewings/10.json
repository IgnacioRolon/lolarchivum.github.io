The current punishment system is automated I have never been \"Banned\" by the automated system\" however only restrictions because of players who just absolutely refuse to do Team Play which is part of the summoners code, and Riot is not enforcing the summoners code at all they are just enforcing communication abuse, and intentionally feeding, that is all, they don't care if players even do team play, or how it effects other players like myself doing very poorly then having to deal with harassment, or report spam in a huge number of games which results in automated restrictions.","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-08-03T00:50:41.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two points you may want to consider. First, some people who don't communicate much/any are chat restricted. The may not speak because they may not want to insult someone and extend their chat restriction, or they may have muted you. If I'm having a bad day I'll mute my whole team so I can't type things to them. My mechanics are terrible, but I coach sports so my strategy and understanding are much better than my ability to play the game (I'm terrible). It becomes a problem because I can generally point out both what I am doing wrong and what my team is doing wrong, while often teammates can only point out what other people are doing wrong, and I would call that stupid imo. Even if your team is doing something to throw the game you probably are too if you're struggling that much, and players who are chat restricted probably would rather not say anything than to have to be nice about their opinion of your criticism.\n\nSecond, my general understanding and experience of play is that 9 times out of 10 if I lose a game I get fed in, it's my fault. Low gold is the level I start to struggle. Hell silver 1 and silver 2 I start depending on my team more and losing more games where my team struggles. On the other hand, drop me in bronze and I can win 90% of my games if I play my main mid/top. I have a second account from leveling up with a friend who started league and placed both my accounts in bronze at the start of the season (I was out of practice and bad) and when I jumped on the second account after getting the first into gold, the climb from bronze to silver was sooooo much easier than it was the fist time. I reacted to things faster than people in bronze and out rotated most enemies. My lead became my teams lead and a half dozen games that started with double kill for the enemy bot and then 2 more in short succession ended w/ our bot lanes tied bc ours kept dying and I kept rotating bot and killing the enemies. So while you may not be playing poorly, unless your challenger there is probably something you can improve in, even if it's just learning to adapt to a team that isn't playing optimally.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-08-02T03:38:12.584+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report them and move on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"yukonl","date":"2015-08-02T02:13:43.649+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you did nothing wrong, you won't get punished.

You can very likely get a legitimate punishment because there is no real person seeing and understanding the context of what they are seeing.

If that wasn't demoralizing enough he then expects them to join in on his fun when theres clearly no point in playing any further. You should get perma banned for calling bans on people. Who made you \"Deputy Ban Hammer\".\n> \n> Why should i get banned? Because i use bad words? Because I'm voicing my displeasure with his standpoint? Should i say it like this instead\n> \n> \n> \"Man Im sorry to hear that about your team. Maybe you should of offered them some care bears after the match so you can all hug it out? Lets be friends forever guys! Yea!\"\n\nor you can just say nothing if all you can think of saying is negative input. No one says you need to have fun while in a losing game, that doesn't mean you have the right to make a bad situation even worst. If you cannot say anything positive or neutral then don't say anything, and that doesn't mean to never say anything \"negative\" but there is also a limit on how much you can use those and how much that is, it's different from person to person and should pretty much be avoided and use in EXTREMELY short amounts regardless","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LaceUp23","date":"2015-08-03T21:23:35.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, get used to it.
