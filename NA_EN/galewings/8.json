Why?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":127,"down_votes":32,"body":"&quot;Base damage lowered to 70/110/150/190/230 from 70/115/160/205/250, augment explosion damage lowered to 70/110/150/190/230 from 70/115/160/205/250&quot;\r\n\r\nWhat are the justifications for this nerf? Viktor is in no way shape or form a broken or overpowered champion. He has clear strengths and weaknesses with pretty clear counterplay. Hell, even his winrate hasn&#039;t been spectacular for a long amount of time either, 47.25% winrate overall, capping out at a clear 50% on average on players with more than 125 games on him. (http://champion.gg/champion/Viktor/Middle)\r\n\r\nSo is it because he is constantly picked in pro play? Well he gets picked because of his ability to clear waves, which is really desirable because of what YOU have implemented into this game, Riot. YOU made turrets standing butter bars that need to be protected or you lose too much. \r\n\r\nSo yes, they&#039;re nerfing him for his waveclear. But Ahri on the other hand got a buff to her Q a while back to &quot;help her clear waves&quot; despite the fact that her wave clear also deals true damage. And that Ahri has been sitting on a much more comfortable spot than Viktor ever has, for a much longer time as well. 53% win rate which increases to 56% once you have 125 games on her. But then I forget the balance team likes to play favorites.","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-02-11T21:39:37.641+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ahri's wave clear being true damage is irrelevant, minions don't have MR.","replies":[{"poster":"kile147","date":"2016-02-11T21:52:00.807+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":"Makes her slightly better if they use Banner of Command I guess?","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-02-11T21:59:13.716+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kile147,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RrUlEtJJ,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-02-11T21:52:00.807+0000)\n>\n> Makes her slightly better if they use Banner of Command I guess?\n\nSure but if Banner becomes strong we will see Zed and Talon more often, since their wave clear is physical.","replies":[{"poster":"KING 5HARK","date":"2016-02-12T00:03:22.900+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"*and Varus, who arguably has the best AD ranged waveclear(Poke Meta, yay)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-02-12T05:08:19.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NeoSeraphi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RrUlEtJJ,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-02-11T21:39:37.641+0000)\n>\n> Ahri's wave clear being true damage is irrelevant, minions don't have MR.\n\nIt is relevant.
