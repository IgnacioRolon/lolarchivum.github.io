To be fair to my teammates, no one exploded in toxicity.\r\n\r\nBut I'm talking about the awful calls they made and their refusal to listen. I would ask for help warding, no one would buy a single ward. I supported a Kalista whom I asked not too push the wave too far into the enemy turret because I needed to back and we had no wards at the river. What did she do? Pushed in all the way, didn't even use her trinket on the river and got ganked by the jungler and killed.\r\n\r\nThen we would have people chase around low health enemies into their own jungle while we had no wards there. I kept telling them not to do it because it was so obvious that they would get lead to the enemy's teammates and killed but they did it every chance they got anyway and got killed every time.\r\n\r\nAnd then late game no one wanted to group while the enemy team was besieging  us. Everyone would go do their own thing while I begged my teammates for help because the enemy was attempting Baron. I was support, so I had next to no damage and had no hope of contesting. Once they did get Baron two of our teammates got picked off and killed.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying I was the only good player there. I make mistakes every game Which is probably why I'll end up a bronze after my provisional games but if only my teammates would listen I feel we would actually do a lot better and actually win.","replies":[{"poster":"CharQueen","date":"2015-02-01T21:24:01.782+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those problems in Ranked persist regardless. Mainly because a ton of players believe that their ego surpasses good advice. \n\nAs Support, your best off doing what you can, muting everyone, and making good calls whenever. If they aren't followed, take solice in the fact that you did your job.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mikal Pikal","date":"2015-02-02T15:31:31.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is solo queue with no communication other than pings...so that makes it difficult for everyone to be on the same page. Moreover, your teammates are the same skill as you so the only way to get better teammates is to win more games. In low elo like I am in, the key is to make simple plays. Always go for towers and ping the shit out of them, especially when your team starts chasing that singed into the enemy jungle. Caution ping and ping tower. Keep everyone on task with the true objectives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thresh Outta Fux","date":"2015-02-02T06:21:17.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's very true. In a minute though, you'll have a bunch of trolls show up and tell you how that you only lose games because of things you screwed up.\n\nWhich is not true. Because there are five people on one team versus five people on another team. If four of your allies are afk or feeding, then it's not your fault. But you will be dragged down with them, because this is a team game.\n\nSo you can expect that anyone who says that it is solely your fault is a Free Win or Jarwin 4 player, or Riven/Leblanc/Zed, you know, all the regular freelo abusers. Ranked isn't about skill, it's about getting lucky with teamwork or abusing freelo champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BardLivesMatter","date":"2015-02-02T06:15:56.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I queued with a friend.\n\nOur team, no fucking clue. \n\nEnemy team, LCS plays for days.\n\nForever bronze, even though I'm above that. ;_;","replies":[]},{"poster":"BallisticMouse","date":"2015-02-01T22:10:16.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My last match I played our Xin Zhao said he could only take jungle. He then died to Raptors, told us to ask for ganks. I asked him to gank top, he got caught in enemy jungle and died to their top lane. He then tried to gank from on lane, when I wasn't there, and died to their top lane again.\n\nI can't even. He was trolling in chat, feeding in game, building bad items and I am still motivated to avoid playing Ranked cause of this. I'm afraid to place cause of teamates like this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-01T21:26:07.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything in solo queue is generally this bad.  There are surely awesome people out there who are friendly and willing to cooperate, but for every one of those guys, there's a whole team of dudes who either don't listen to anything or only speak using insults and blame.  The idea is to find a set of those friendly guys who are around your skill level then work from there, as it seems solo ranked will always be what they call the yolo queue :D","replies":[]}]}
