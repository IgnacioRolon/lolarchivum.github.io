From keys and mouse clicks refusing to register, to hilarious yet sometimes disturbing champion skin glitches (I once encountered a Winter Orianna that looked more like an upside down spider then an actual robot girl). But the thing that has happened the most to me is incredibly frustrating: Champions can sometimes get stuck in place. Sometimes, when I walk near walls my champion will just stay stuck there without moving while still doing the run animation. I keep thinking it might be my ping that's spiking, but no. It stays a solid 60 and I can see minions and other champs move around and use their skills perfectly fine.\r\n\r\nI've missed kills and opportunities to go and aid my teammates in fights because of this glitch. Not just that but it also happens while you're looking at the map while jungling and you just waste a lot of time walking in place (it's only a few seconds at most but a few seconds can make a huge difference in this game).\r\n\r\nSo am I crazy here? Or is this an actual problem that needs to be fixed because it can be game breaking, however rare they might be.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-02-02T16:16:00.068+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Turret diving is a deathsentence right now with most melee champions.\n\nYou will literally stand in front of the turret while the AI considers which way he should go to get around the turret.\n\nI have never hand this problem before.
