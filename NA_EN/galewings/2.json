But, if the items you were going to build anyway also give extra stats now combined with other eq/masteries, then I think you can see why they say it is \"like\" free stats. It is. ER gives good damage and crit and cdr and mana return, other adc items that they would also build increases the cdr. They might as well give it scaling cdr to 30 on a time scale, it would essentially amount to the same thing on an adc. Remember that with the new masteries, crit is also giving great lifesteal and some AS as well. So building crit+AS items which adcs do anyway, give them extra lifesteal, AS, and with ER they get extra cdr as well. IE, ER, and then 2 of the other AS+crit items to bring an adc to the extra 20 AS, 100 percent crit and lifesteal on every hit. I don't even bother getting BT anymore. There is little point in giving up damage for LS when you get it already from building more damage.\n\nCompare that with mages who have to choose between damage/cdr and don't get 15 percent spell vamp from building what they were going to build anyway. Or tanks choosing to build between hps and resists and sustain. They take a hit by making choices in their builds that adcs no longer have to make. ADCs get to build along a pure damage path and still get everything else on top of it. It feels a little like injury after insults after reduction in mana, cdr items, armor items.","replies":[{"poster":"Szunray","date":"2015-11-17T17:58:22.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I guess in that regard, mages also get \"free\" stats from deathcap, since it gives you AP for building what you were going to build anyway, AP.\n\nI mean, it seems like you're upset that \n1.
