It's not uncommon for projectiles to be 'invisible' because they were thrown from the fog of war and you were against a wall or simply walking towards the missile. The missile tends to become visible when it enters your little circle of view. If you're moving towards it and it's moving towards you, any bit of delay can cause it to seem invisible because it didn't have time to register that the spear went into your line of view. Normally, you can still see the Aura around it still, which is why Nidalee's Head Hunter skin is the most common one to be 'invisible' because the aura on it is much smaller and harder to see. \n\nNow, Mundo's cleaver is about the same reason, but it's a rather small object when you actually look at it. It's hard to see as is, so when it magically becomes visible, you usually don't realize it until it's in your face. \n\nI should also mention players with over 100 ping will experience this EVEN MORE because they have a LARGE DELAY from the minor bit of lag you are experiencing and also makes it harder to react because you not only don't see it coming, but the delay prevents you from properly dodging it.","replies":[{"poster":"MohawkBird","date":"2015-07-21T16:14:17.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-07-22T02:49:54.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Elias1724,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cWXpOeft,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-07-21T16:14:17.507+0000)\n>\n> I've had Ekko's Q be completely invisible without being form the Fog of War.\n\nSound like a Graphical Error or Lag error. Not uncommon for a lag spike to happen and prevent you from realizing his Q was even thrown, but likely more of a graphical error. If it persists, I'd suggest running a repair on your game because it shows that you likely have a corrupted graphical file that's not properly registering the look of the game for you.\n\nUnknown to most, the game's graphics are all on the person's computer, not on Riot's servers, which is why custom skins still exist. Any and all looks of your game are purely PC-based and constant graphical errors are part of your computer most of the time with lag causing delays. Mix delays with errors and you just learned why you shouldn't play League on the NA server on a Potato while you live in the North Eastern side of North America. lol.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Curling Veigar","date":"2015-07-21T18:12:17.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love playing versus Nidalee jungle. \n\nTry to guess why.","replies":[]},{"poster":"idoki","date":"2015-07-21T15:57:50.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> This has been complained about since last year,\n\nOh, my sweet summer child.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AutoreactiveCD4","date":"2015-07-21T14:47:24.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They said they fixed this in some patch notes...on my computer it's worse than ever though","replies":[]},{"poster":"shadecrapper","date":"2015-07-21T14:04:18.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont you love loosing LP","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-07-21T14:49:47.150+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":7,"body":"WOW\n\nIs this still being complained about? \n\n1.
