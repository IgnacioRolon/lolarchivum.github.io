All of the benefits of this mode do nothing for him since he's completely gated by his passive. You can only cast X rotations before he silences himself for 5 seconds. Something that's already easy to accomplish without a single point of CDR.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2014-04-04T21:50:39.769+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warwick in URF is absolutely fucking insane. You just build straight wizard wolf with maybe a Spirit Visage. Don't forget DFG and Zhonya's, also lichbane is your friend. You burst like hell and heal yourself for an insane amount of health.\n\nPersonally I think Rumble is the single worst champion in URF.","replies":[{"poster":"jwf999","date":"2014-04-04T21:52:55.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"really i haven't played it yet lol but wouldn't rumble with rylays and liandries just wreck house with his q and e?

He does have his ult always on at least.\n\n**Nasus** - Can stack faster, but even having permanent Wither doesn't seem to stop him from being kited or CC'd to death.\n\n**Yasuo** - His Q and E don't get any benfits from this mode. He just gets to Windwall and ult more.\n\n**Tryndamere** - When AD, he can't abuse the lowered CD on his heal because it destroys his Fury generation. And even with his low CD spin and shout, good luck trying to stick to someone without getting blown up, CC locked, etc. His AP build is a little better, but just not as good as other champions.","replies":[{"poster":"jwf999","date":"2014-04-05T11:37:26.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For tryndamere his ult lasts 5 sec and is on 18sec cd. With lower cd on spin it means that he has 13 sec to kill him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sinspunch","date":"2014-04-04T22:37:35.314+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:157}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:77}}  I think are pretty bad. esp early.

Not sure if it was just bad luck or what, but he got completely demolished in lane and I wasn't able to catch up until the team helped me feed lategame. Seems like Corki just doesn't get as much benefit from the URF buff as other champs do, and in general falls behind.
