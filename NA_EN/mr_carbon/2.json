It's so much easier when you already know how to play a lane so you can focus on other things like the macro game.

So there could be a much broader sea of high ranking players but they cannot climb continuously do to losing. When I say this, I am in no way saying that \"Dota isbetterthisiswhyiquitleaguelol\" Dota has a MMR rating (not perfect) that scores partially the player, based on how well they perform. That is less stress than being brought down a rank because of your team and having to worry about \"can I carry\". If you  think about it, and this may sound like something you hear in elementary and middle school, but there is no I in team.  Everyone is supposed to pull their own and work together to win. So that when something is done competitively, rather it be a sport or non-sport, one person is not responsible for making sure that team succeeds. LCS players, don't generally have to worry about that, because they have a team. Right now, it's more of a \"Yes there is an I in team\" and that is pressure going into every game like that. And it also forces you not to be able to play champs that you want (outside of picks and bans and team competition).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emerald Fang","date":"2016-11-05T15:49:51.232+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Bronze III, I present my reasons:\n\n1. Ranked \"mindset.\" You have this mentality that ranked is scary and such a high-pressure test of skill when in reality it's barely more than your average normal draft game (at least in Bronze).\n\n2. \"____ Syndrome\" : If you're fed, you think you can 1v5 the entire team and you'll start doing just that and making dumbass mistakes. Commonly known as Yi Syndrome, Yasuo Syndrome, Jax Syndrome etc. Happens with almost every champion.\n\n3. Anger towards others. Instead of focusing on what you did wrong you'll just get mad at another player on your team because you have such an inflated ego about your gameplay. \"Oh, I should be in Gold right now.\" No you shouldn't; if you should be you WOULD be; that's how ranked works. I go by one simple rule: ALWAYS BLAME YOURSELF. Even if the ADC was 0/20, you have to deal with your gameplay EVERY ranked game, while your ADC is different each game.\n\n4. \"Potatoes\". Let's face it, sometimes you get those people who have NO idea what they're doing. It happens. But see #3 for how to deal with it.\n\n5. The matchmaking. I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure LoL matches you with worse people the more wins you have, to try to balance your wins/losses to 50%. It's frustrating when your MMR is really high and you can go up 2/3 divisions, and then get matched with terrible players. BUT that is testing your ability to carry the team, so I guess it's fair.\n\n6. \"Bitching\". If there is ONE \"broken\" champion on the enemy team, everyone starts complaining in chat (including me). \"Oh gg ff at 20\". If a yasuo shows up (rarely b/c he's always banned) players go crazy. They subconsciously already surrendered; their mind will not be as sharp as it could because of the dread of facing an op champ (who they arbitrarily deem OP).\n\n7. This is the main reason, in my opinion, why bronzies can't climb. THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO COUNTER THESE \"BROKEN\" CHAMPS. If they see a Yasuo, they have absolutely no clue what to do except try to kill him before he kills you. If they see a Katarina you bet they'll be trying to dive her, and then realizing how fed she is after they're 0/3, proceed to be useless the whole game. The Bronze NEED to learn how to counter or at least PLAY against some of these champions. And there is ALWAYS one of these champs on the enemy team, so they're trapped in this state of fear and mental submission.\nMain \"broken\" champs in bronze: {{champion:84}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:238}} . Just the community's opinion based on games. (I personally don't think Yas is that bad but the rest I can see being somewhat \"broken.\")\n\nNow, I've done all of these things above. I used to be Bronze 5. But I've climbed to Bronze 3 in about 20 games, which I find impressive. The trick to climbing is above. \n\nAnd the rule of thumb: DO NOT RAGE AT ALL. DO NOT BE SALTY. \nI used to be a ridiculously toxic player, yelling in chat in all caps constantly. I'm surprised I didn't get reported / chat restricted, honestly. I lost every game, and I thought it was the enemy team. I was 0/10, 0/9, maybe 1/9 if lucky, every game.\nThen I tried to see what I could do to improve myself. I practiced constantly in norms, and customs (CS practice). Then I went into a ranked game a month later; it seemed just like a normal. I went 5/4, and I was so excited. I won my first ranked game! I realized I didn't rage at all, even when my team made dumb mistakes. And since then, EVERY SINGLE TIME I have raged in chat, we've lost. So don't do it. Spout curses in the safety of your room, but don't waste your time typing into chat.\n\nThat's all folks. \nTales of a Bronze Player (Who stopped playing Ranked until S7).","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2016-11-05T18:49:58.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">  I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure LoL matches you with worse people the more wins you have, to try to balance your wins/losses to 50%.\n\nThat is true.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/PH8OvFv\n\nbut still not really a good excuse.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/bDzI77T\n\nI'll be the first to admit that I check ranks before every game.

No sense of self-preservation (picking stupid fights all day long, not recalling when it's obvious the tiniest little auto-attack could kill them, forcing unnecessary ganks while severely behind, being baited into everything under the sun, etc.). No idea how to rotate/pressure objectives. The system picks people on losing streaks and crams as many of them as possible for me to force me into a 'carry or negate every inch of ground gained, THEN SOME' because \"50% win rate\" is the goal the system tries to implement.\n\n3) I don't have anyone to team up with to better my chances because I don't know any real-life friends who also play League outside of one guy who duo'd with his GF to hit Gold and they play side-by-side. Even if I wasn't restricted by who I could queue with, I would still need communication which would eff up the bandwidth as they live on literally the opposite side of the country, putting us at a disadvantage against more formal pre-mades, as in those who co-ordinate via voice communication.\n\n4) I find myself on teams of all solo vs 3+ premades far more often than is the reverse situation. Just last night, it was clear one team was smurfing as they had a 5-man jungle invade, and ended up a 1v5 as literally everyone else on my team fed super hard then afk'd simply from how badly they were out-maneuvering us.\n\n5) I don't play certain champions. Ever. I'm probably the one person in League who finds champions like Master Yi or Zed or Katarina (just to name a few, there's quite a lot of them) hard as fuck to play. My brain just freezes up trying to play these sort of cheesy (spelling?) champions. Maybe it's because I overthink them combined with the fact that I do have some genuine mental co-ordination problems that don't translate well to self-described \"fancy moves\". I find Fizz to be mechanically simple but if I were to play Zed, I'd feed all day long because there is way too much you technically CAN do with him but everything moves way too fast and is far too combo-oriented. Basically, it's the same reasoning why I can't play fighting games like Street Fighter/Mortal Kombat/Tekken/Soul Calibur/etc.\n\n6) I know I'm not a great player in the wider scope of things, but I play games far better in realistic team environments. Random people who you'll likely never see again apart from maybe one or two more queues immediately after a single given game and being rated solely on wins as opposed to play mechanics within the game makes me feel helpless because you can't force other people to do things. You can only change your own behaviour to suit the needs of the situation but by basic mathematical principles be able to always be able to \"cover\" for those who are just blatantly bad at the game and have absolutely NO DESIRE TO IMPROVE BUT STILL EXPECT TO WIN BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY DESERVE IT WITHOUT PUTTING IN ANYWHERE REMOTELY CLOSE TO THE REQUIRED EFFORT.\n\nI screw up a fair bit now and then and I know when a loss is to be pinned on me, not others. I accept that no one wins 100% of their games and it is folly to believe that I supposedly \"deserve\" to win. But with all of the pressure from every possible angle (and I'm sure I'm missing several key points I forgot to mention), I seriously don't know what I can do. I have lost basically all faith in a fair ranked experience. I don't know why I even try anymore. Maybe I'm just addicted at this point and too stubborn to move on and only play normals from now on? I wish I knew.","replies":[]},{"poster":"69469238DEL1","date":"2016-11-05T19:29:54.192+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"G5 I know I can climb to Plat, but I had 8 ranked games in a row with an afk on my team so I'm scared to que up now.

Don't force them, but simply take them when they are available.\n\nDepending on team compositions, you may need to neglect or thrive on risky plays at certain times.","replies":[{"poster":"Bbayam","date":"2016-11-05T16:50:41.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's some helpful advice, thank you! The advantage converting to team advantage depends on who I play. Immobile mages are hard to roam with I suppose, and I play a fair number of those. However, playing Ahri, I don't really find a problem with the conversion of lane advantage to team advantage. Normally as an immobile mage I try to draw attention to my lane if I have a huge advantage so team can focus other objectives.
