Thoughts?\n\n http://leaguetales.com/","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2016-11-19T17:49:04.850+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think we will see him, but not as an contested pick.\nHis early laneing is way to vulnerable, and his teamfighting also isn't that great. His main power is enableing map-mobillity for the full team to creat a numberadvantage. \nHe might work as a jungler, the Junglechanges actually improved his jungleing quite a bit, and you pick him for prettymuch only the ult anyway, so no big issue if doesn't get as famred.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WarlockLaw","date":"2016-11-19T04:16:48.650+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel Kled is too easily punished and shut down for competitive scenes to want. If he gets dismounted by a jungler/gank he may as well back because he lost all of his dueling power. Repeat this a few times and Kled is so far behind in gold that he won't be a good tank or deal any damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ïnsidious","date":"2016-11-18T19:22:14.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think so, he's not underpowered, but I think the fact that he is all single target focused, and lacks any ability to escape/reposition himself (Besides his ulti) severely limits what he can do. Then again if the team gets to engage on their terms in every fight, or most fights, I could see him getting some time","replies":[]},{"poster":"ømg","date":"2016-11-19T02:38:01.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mr Carbon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PEuZkB50,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-11-18T14:05:45.990+0000)\n\n>  http://leaguetales.com/\n\n??????\n\nI like lux\n\nLux is cool, she is getting a new skin that will be bigly awesome\n\nTell me your thoughts\n\nI am not a sell out,\nhttp://leaguetales.com/","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Carbon","date":"2016-11-19T04:49:03.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you referring to where I see her in the Meta right now?","replies":[{"poster":"ømg","date":"2016-11-19T07:47:20.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mr Carbon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PEuZkB50,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2016-11-19T04:49:03.009+0000)\n>\n> Are you referring to where I see her in the Meta right now?\n\nYes, what are your thoughts,\n\nhttp://leaguetales.com/","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Carbon","date":"2016-11-19T14:42:16.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lux is in a relatively balanced spot right now through all tiers of the ranked ladder consistently in the first or second tiers of play. Her kit is simple but effective. Which makes it very easy to pick up at lower levels of play and carry with it. She is a true backline caster which means positioning is just as important for her as the adc. Though her win rate doesn't reflect that stellar 50%+ rate that you would like to see, keep in mind most models are on a plat+ sample. If you shift the sample size down to Gold and below you'll see her effectiveness rise. As with most linear champions you see a gradual decrease in play as you move up in tiers due to higher skill cap champions being available with more potential damage :)\n\nSpin: Lux believe it or not, with her shield and barrier can typically combat assassin play, so I have a positive outlook for her especially because most of the assassins have an increased window of burst. However if she misses light binding she can say \"lights out\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2016-11-19T02:49:34.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I rather see the new Yorick in pro play instead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Danjeng","date":"2016-11-18T22:42:55.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't seen too many Kled's.\nBut not too long ago, Kled on my team dominated his lane without grabbing any starting items :o\nGot first blood.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frius","date":"2016-11-18T21:32:33.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kled quotes so cool and badass ,he s like a rat like twitch ,but so violent ,gotta love it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rockm Sockm","date":"2016-11-18T19:42:02.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He will always be a niche pick.
