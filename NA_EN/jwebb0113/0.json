Riot has recently had the thought of changing how the ladder works, by moving all Bronze players to Silver, and make new players be automatically assigned to Bronze. The one to confirm these changes is Riot Ghostcrawler through an interview for a Russian portal.\r\n\r\nBut is this a good idea? It probably is.\r\n\r\nMany inexperienced League of Legends players don&rsquo;t feel okay by playing with players of other divisions because they are not experienced enough to face against them, and thus they almost always lose their lane and then the game.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that concerns Riot is that the Bronze division is overpopulated, and transferring some players from Bronze to Silver and then making Bronze a global division for new and inexperienced players would help by diverting the Bronze division and thus making it be a better place.\r\n\r\n\r\nso much for rank meaning something. LMAO \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}
