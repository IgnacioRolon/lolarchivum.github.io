I tried to muse on the whole thing for a while and really digest it all, which is why this one comes somewhat late, but it&rsquo;s still something that&rsquo;s bothering me and I needed to lay it out, especially concerning one thing in particular. While it _is_ fairly opinionated, I tried to make sure it was still at least referencing things already laid out as canon. But, for those of you who still might not get where I&#039;m coming from, here you go:\r\n\r\nSince the moment it was said that Targon was going to get lore updates, I had a bad feeling about it. I absolutely knew in my head that, somehow, the writers were going to mess it up. I thought they&rsquo;d add more, progress the story, pick a direction they wanted to take with the existing lore and kill off either Leona or Diana. But what they actually did is something I never expected. And I don&rsquo;t like it any better.\r\n\r\nIf you were like me, you might have seen Diana and her abilities and immediately wanted to know more. You read her lore, you tried to play her in-game, you listened to her theme, sought out the teaser image, and gobbled up every single bit of information given in her AMA. You were _enthralled_ by the story of this angry, hurt, vengeful character who demanded the blood of all Solari and an end to those who would deny the power of the moon, now so plain before them as that very power coursed through her. She was harsh, she was cruel, everything in her life had pushed her to be bitter, cold, and unforgiving, and she&rsquo;d decided that it was enough. And, now, all of that is gone.\r\n\r\nAs Diana is now, she no longer owns her own anger. Any hint of abuse she once had is gone in favor of something watered down and harmless: sweeping the library as punishment for arguing with the Elders. With how much they improved the depth of the lore, they failed to leave any sort of conflict that would inspire Diana to want to kill the Elders and destroy the Solari. And once it finally came down to it, she was appalled, she was shocked, she couldn&rsquo;t believe what she did, and she ran away. And that is not the mark of a merciless killer. That is not a person who is pushed to kill. The only thing that could have made her do such a thing was the entity now sharing her body, which is now the only thing that inspires the hint of the anger and vengeance she had in her previous lore. As I see it, the only way they found to maintain the Diana/Solari rivalry was to _force_ it.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the character that now seems the most vengeful is Leona, which is completely backwards from how it used to be. Leona was clearly a very good-willed person in the previous lore. Though her in-game abilities show her as someone who&rsquo;s potentially a brutal fighter, or one who won&rsquo;t let you escape so easily, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s necessary to water this trait down. Though she staunchly avoided unnecessary killing, she was always a defender of those who needed it and, if Diana was seeking to kill all Solari, then death would be necessary for her. But now there&rsquo;s only a singular hint that she still shares these previous, positive character traits: Guiding the strange boy to safety. Where the writers could have hinted at Leona&rsquo;s protective nature in Pantheon&rsquo;s lore where he was being bullied, they left her out. Where they could have emphasized this in her _own_ lore amongst her tribemates, they chose not to. Instead, they ensured more references of her warrior nature, of her zealousness to the Solari, and her anger at hearing Diana describe this new society. Worse yet, they emphasized how _fury_ sustained her on her hunt for Diana, where it simply could have been duty. Though her anger is seemingly quelled at the end of the story, it is no less dampened as a new, defining trait of Leona&rsquo;s, and the blindly trusting faith Leona had now only seems to be further weaponized.\r\n\r\nAs for the story, itself, I&rsquo;m equally disappointed thus far. The timelines were altered, the ways the two of them ascended were changed entirely, and the true sense of _conspiracy_ filling the story is gone. Though Diana&rsquo;s lore mentions that she suspected information was willfully left out, there&rsquo;s minimal effort to prevent her from questioning the Solari. Instead, there are only harmless punishments up until the final confrontation between her and the Elders, something that _leaps_ to retain the same severity. Where distinct parallels existed between Leona and Diana&rsquo;s ascensions, both of which saved their lives but where only _Leona_ was rewarded for defying her peers and traditions, it was decided to remove these entirely. And equally disappointing is that the character development and progress they could have made has been removed, as well. While I always desperately wanted to see Diana and Leona make peace, to see them no longer seek to fight and kill each other, and to understand what actually happened to Diana and the Lunari, it trivializes it all to erase the _struggle._ As it stands in this reset lore, peace between them is readily available and it&rsquo;s now _Leona_ who needs the most character development.\r\n\r\nAs I originally feared, this event has already gone wrong. Leona and Diana never needed redefining and neither did the overarching story of Targon. Everything that I previously loved about both of the characters is now gone, and everything that entranced me about the original story is gone with it. The major attributes of the characters are now either non-existent or barely hinted at, the sense of conspiracy filling the Solari and the collective Elders is missing, and Leona and Diana are no longer the same foils they were to each other.\r\n\r\nAs someone who deeply invested themselves into the original story and characters, who took likely far too much of their own time filling in the lore spaces themselves, and who was head-over-heels in love with them as they were and as I hoped they could&#039;ve been in the previous lore, I implore the writers to reconsider the stark changes they&rsquo;ve made in this new, default state. There&rsquo;s other people who were just as in love with the story as I was, and we&rsquo;ve tried to make it clear how unhappy we are with the magnitude of these changes.\r\n\r\nI can&rsquo;t claim to know what they intend to do with the story and where they intend to take the characters now and I can&rsquo;t claim yet how much of the peripheral information they&rsquo;ve retconned from the teasers, the song, and the AMA, but I can see plainly, in this moment, that these are not the same characters and that this is not the same story. And if they won&rsquo;t return the previous character traits, then please at _least_ have enough honesty to avoid telling us that these changes match up with Diana&rsquo;s &ldquo;merciless in-game persona&rdquo; or anything similar. Seeking unity and running away has _nothing_ to do with bringing down the sun and being merciless.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, thank you for taking the time to read this.","replies":[{"poster":"The Last Ballad","date":"2016-03-06T02:57:35.561+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"You have some decent points there. I do love it when someone puts their thoughts out in a way that forces me to actually think in order to argue against it.\n\nHowever, you claim that Leona's rage sustaining her is not the mark of a good person, but what kind of person hoping to have even the slightest chance of being called such would be able hunt down the killer of what became their family, on only a sense of duty? Especially a person depicted as a defender. Leona strikes me as a person that defends her people not out of duty, but out of love for them. I liked(and still do) because her personality kind of reflects mine. And I know that if anyone even tried to hurt someone I love, I would beat the ever loving crap out of them. So I can see Leona striding up a mountain focused on nothing but the death of the person who dared to kill her loved ones. She does not wish to kill unnecessarily, but will do with great prejudice if anyone threatens her people, for that was what she was raised to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyvani","date":"2016-03-06T04:03:41.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh, thank you. o: I was hoping they'd be good points. They've felt like good points to me, which is part of the reason why I've still been wanting to lay it out. I'm really glad it evoked such thought, though.\n\nAnd what you say makes sense, actually. I should've remembered a little better how angry a person would be at such personal people being killed in front of you. Maybe I'm just having a hard time getting past the personality I keep reading, however. Considering that the traits they note are just, devoted, and zealous, all of which just comes off coldly positioned next to all the mentions of her warrior nature and her anger, I just can't picture her previous warmth of character at _all_ anymore. I mean, of course Leona would have loved the Solari and been just as angry in the previous lore, I shouldn't overlook that, either, but I just wish her compassion and kindness could have been emphasized at _least_ as equally and not feel like an afterthought.","replies":[{"poster":"Bladeglory","date":"2016-03-06T08:36:51.512+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was also upset that it was \"anger\" she felt at hearing Diana's speech about the Lunari. I feel that she should have been as confused as upset. \"This problem-child is now going on about a moon-worshiping antithesis to the Solari? What is she even on. Aw crap the elders are pissed and... scared? They're gonna make me execute her aren't they. Well, she is off her rocker, isn't she...\"\n\nI'm hoping that the end of the story is hinting that now she knows she was wrong/overzealous and will go back to being about protection more than sun worship.\n\nBut since we're on the topic... There's a point you didn't cover that I feel really strongly about. It's her call to defiance - the golden boy. In this current lore, she does something against her entire culture and is caught, deemed a heretic, and forced to fight. This is inferior to her previous lore, I believe, as it removes the magnitude of it.\n\nIn her League Judgment, we see the events of Leona's Rite of Kor - a ritual duel to the death between 16 year olds. Every person of the tribe was in attendance and watched Leona stomp her opponent... And then she typed /ff.\n\n\"Finish it\" they said. \"No.\" Leona noted her mother's silent expression of horror.\n\"You need to do this\" Atreus said. \"I won't\" Leona replied without breaking eye contact.\n\"You know what the punishment is.\" Leona simply gazes up at the sun for the last time.\n\nEven in condensed form, I feel this vastly outweighs the new incident. She stood in front of everyone she's ever known, knowingly disgraced her family, and willingly **chose her own death**. That, to me, was the defining ingredient of Leona. \n**_I would rather die than be merciless._**\n\nYes, it's all well and good that Leona was merciful and was truthful about what she did and defended her actions by combat... but it still feels like she got _caught_ and Atreus is a _snitch_. Atreus could have confronted her then or later, rather than run to his dad. They could have had her do it in front of other people and even defend the boy, verbally or physically, from them.

Her old lore while interesting, can be summed up with: Diana likes moon, Solari likes sun. Diana tells Solari about moon, she gets mad when they don’t listen and kills them all. I find that this new lore has so much depth and makes her seem really well-rounded. She still kills the elders out of her rage, but now we have more depth into how she got her powers (Aspects). I actually like that now she now wants to unite the cultures of the moon and sun, as she can still be the righteous killer, but has a clear goal and purpose apart from murdering everyone who doubts the moon.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyvani","date":"2016-04-05T22:45:56.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking back at this again, I feel the need to point out that you seem to have misunderstood Diana's old lore, even as vague as it was. Truthfully, Diana's lore can better be summed up as:\n\n> Diana likes the moon. Solari likes the sun. Diana questions why the Solari likes the sun. Solari Elders ridicule and punish her. Diana is sure she's onto something; spends years researching whether the moon has power. Diana finds proof that moon had power. Diana shows proof to Solari. Solari Elders try to execute her. Moon decides to save her. Diana decides she's not taking any more shit from the Solari, kills Solari.\n\nIn the new lore, I feel I can accurately say that Diana _does not_ kill the Elders out of rage because:\n\n1. She was barely punished for her questions (thus had little preexisting resentment towards them)\n2. She's currently half-possessed by some strange entity\n3. She was _appalled_ that she killed them (AKA _she_ didn't mean to)\n\nBesides that, Diana had an equally clear goal before in the form of she believed the Solari were a bunch of a-holes who deserved death and wanted to act out that death sentence. The goal of uniting the Solari and Lunari could have _easily_ become a new goal for her if Leona and Diana could have come to an understanding, which would have been done through story progression and character development, which is an option I find _far_ more interesting that reworking everything and making that peace readily available to both of them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LANWhale","date":"2016-03-06T03:55:39.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry if this question was already answered.

From my perspective, considering that their defining traits are altered or non-existent, I'd say yes. If these characters had been this way from the beginning or introduced now in this way, I wouldn't say that at all, but where my primary problem lies is that Diana, especially, was advertised to me (by e-mail) as matching her \"merciless in-game persona,\" which is why that is in quotes. But, by removing her aggression towards the Solari, they've taken away that key aspect of her character. I doubt I would've had as much of a problem if they had progressed to story to eliminate that aggression but, because they simply rewrote everything, they failed to match it as claimed. I will admit that _Leona,_ in some ways, _does_ match up a bit better with her in-game persona, but that's also at the cost of all the warmth of character she previously had. Instead, what she comes off to me as is a merciless warrior, like what Diana used to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Spitemaster","date":"2016-03-06T16:44:15.879+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree - in part.

She was the first non-450 IP champion I bought, the third champion I bought overall, and I saved up for her for weeks.\n\nShe is by far my favourite champion and I have been feeling so sad that she's no longer perfect. This new lore has diminished her. They took out almost all of the tragic depth out of her story, diminished the transformative aspects of her character development and made her very diluted. Her character development now feels like a jagged line, full of random leaps and jumps, whereas before it was more like a nice, gradual curve.\n\nThey took away her trauma. They took away her scar, that she was strong enough to transform into a symbol of power, they took away almost all the narrative elements that make you -understand- why she is treading the edge of evil. They decided to get rid of the burden of trauma that led Diana to become Diana but still decided to keep the scene where she kills the Elders. This is even worse than if they had just gotten rid of all of that altogether and simply changed her into a scared girl who doesn't want to fight and just wants acceptance.\n\nI cannot believe that we will witness her VO becoming defunct and non-canon before we ever finally managed to find out who did the unequivocally brilliant job of portraying her in it. 'They could NOT break me.' Such bitterness and resolve. And now? Of course they couldn't break you, sweet Moonmaiden. They made you sweep floors.\n\nI get so sad when I think about it. I really, really hope they add so much more to the whole story that will round it out and make everything make sense. Even so, she is no longer truly Diana. {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"TzQGRUST39","date":"2016-03-06T10:31:40.545+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Diana is fine, she actually has gradual character development now. Before, she went from a good knowledge seeking person to a decidedly evil person in a single moment. She very knowingly slaughters them all and then destroys the temple to put the icing on the cake. Now she goes around trying to convince those to join the Lunari, killing anyone who doesn't. What is bothersome is that she does this for no reason other than, \"My team is better then yours, heheh.\"\nThe funniest part about it is that the new iteration of Diana would actually make the actions her old versions make sense. Her motivation now is that the sun and the moon together are \"essential for universal harmony\", so going around accruing Lunari while \"diminishing\" Solari would actually make sense. Her cold blooded slaughter of the Solari elders would also make more sense because she is straight half moon deity. \nOld Diana lore is like that of the new Pantheon lore. You take a character that is semi-interesting and relatable and you turn them into a one note copy and paste character with a single sentence, except in the new Pantheon lore it was intentional. When old Diana comes out of that temple, she isn't Diana anymore, she is the moon, which is Ironic seeing that the new Diana would have an excuse for that. When new Diana comes out of the temple she is still Diana, but an altered version. She is haunted by what she has done. When she was young, her parents died shielding her from the perilous cold of Targon and the Solari brought her in and raised her like their own. These people are her life, everyone she's ever known or cared about are in that temple. When she arrives at the temple with proof of the Lunari, it isn't about, \"I'm right, you're wrong, moon = bestest, sun = worstest\". It is about what she believes to be the well being of the entire world she believes all of those years of being an outcast and mocked have destined her for this moment; she can change the world for the better, she can be the hero now, she can be believed now, she can be **accepted** now. And so she stands in-front of the elders, ecstatic, this is the turning point of her life. She tells them what she has discovered with great enthusiasm, that same enthusiasm fades slowly, and slowly, and _slowly_ with every passing word. Every syllable becoming more desperate than the last as Diana realizes that her life is collapsing around her, her greatest moment has become her ruin. She comes to a comprehension of what will occur as she stares into the hatred of the elders's eyes... she is going to die here. That is when she snaps.\nEven with how traumatic experience that is, she still comes out the temple Diana. She sought knowledge while living with the Solari, her hunger for it was the drive of her life and true enough to her character, she still seeks knowledge, but she knows what she must find. She has a very specific goal in mind for the future, piece together the memories of the Lunari and unite them with the Solari.\n\nAs for Leona, it is hard to argue that she hasn't been vastly improved from her old iteration. While I ragged on old Diana to get a point across, Leona is just a straight Mary Sue. She runs around Targon being incredibly kind and protecting everyone while refusing to kill **in a society built around killing**. New Leona actually has a fraction of depth, she actually kills, it's like she was raised from birth to be a cold blooded killer or something. What makes new Leona better than her piers is that she isn't for mindless blood shed. She protects her people and those she views as helpless. Why is every one so salty about Leona being angry at Diana for killing the elders? I want everyone who is bothered by this to say this exact line in their head, \"Why is Leona angry at Diana for killing her people?\" and hopefully it would become apparent after digesting that for a second or two. \n\nOne more thing, \n\"Leona felt her anger build with every word Diana spoke, and when the elders rejected her words and named her a blasphemer, Leona knew it would be her blade that ended the heretic’s life.\" Everyone seems to interpret this line as Leona being so filled with rage that she is going to leap at Diana and take her head, I'm pretty sure that was not the intention. To me it seemed obvious that it was meant to say that Leona knew that Diana would be put to death and as the leader of the Ra-Horak it would be her duty to kill her. That was my interpretation at least.\n\nHopefully I have convinced someone, sorry if somethings I wrote came off rude, I'm just getting tired of writing the same things over and over again. If you have made it this far and haven't been convinced, please go back and read the Old Diana and New Pantheon comparison, I think that is a pretty good example.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyvani","date":"2016-03-22T16:22:28.088+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I'd actually intended to reply to this sooner, but I hadn't wanted to think too hard about replies for everyone at the time. I do want to say you actually didn't really come off as rude for me, so you won't have to worry about that aspect, at least. But the thing I really wanted to make note of was the quote that lacks clarity in the story.\n\n>Leona felt her anger build with every word Diana spoke\n\nIn truth, I read this first as Leona being angry, then switched to Diana being angry, but finally settled on Leona because, if it _is_ supposed to be Diana who's angry, it should have been written as \"Leona felt Diana's anger build with every word she spoke.\" As it is, it could be read either way with no definitive idea who's actually getting angry. This would also be helped if it was noted in Diana's lore, too, but any anger she feels or is possibly being infected with is ignored.\n\nI did somewhat forget that, in her original lore alone, it wasn't really explained why she turned so sharply on the Solari. There's hints of \"the Elders showed her a different face than she showed Leona,\" but it's still not clear. This could have been fixed, but it can't be since they decided Diana doesn't want to hate Solari anymore. Otherwise, she doesn't actually try to get people to join the Lunari. She wanted recognition and acceptance, and I suppose her final goal at the end of her lore was primarily getting rid of the rest of the Solari. The AMA instead described that she didn't _want_ a following, but wouldn't shun anyone who wanted to follow her.\n\nPersonally, though, I don't like the idea of having something else control characters. It feels cheap to me. It'd be fine if these were new characters entirely, but I really wanted them to develop the existing story, make note of good reasons why Diana would hate the Solari so much, and make progress so as to develop these already interesting characters. When you bring in some possessing entity, you halve a character's personality, motivations, and drive. All of these things are split between the original character and the possessor, and to use the possessor to create conflict is exactly where it gets cheap. I personally never saw old Diana as having been entirely possessed by the moon, like Leona wasn't possessed by the sun upon her ascension. I simply saw a character who's drive had been reset to a new goal who had been granted the power to see it through. Rather than allow her to progress as that character, however, they reset everything.\n\nOn Leona, though, it still feels like her original, defining aspect of her compassion has been almost entirely erased. Before, it was key to her personality. Now, it's not. Yes, it should have been addressed that she wasn't defined well enough as a potentially brutal fighter, but while they fixed that aspect, they made this ruthlessness her new defining trait. Just like Diana's anger had previously been her defining trait, this changes the identity of these two characters.\n\nBesides that, you are right that Leona's right to be angry when chasing Diana. It just seems overly intense that that anger fueled her, alone, enough to spend seemingly days hunting her down and chasing her to the mountain's peak. It seems equally strange, too, that none of the other guards followed her to help. Considering the supposed harshness of the mountain, though, I would think that anger driving her would at least shift to duty when the chase goes on for such a (again, seemingly) long time and that initial anger fades and fatigue sets in.\n\nI appreciate your defense of the new lore, but I will still be unable to... well, _stomach_ it, really. I really did put too much thought into what had already existed and the new lore still sits wrong by me and makes me feel extremely sour about all of it in general now. Not that I needed that for me to feel wrong about Jhin, too, but it doesn't help it, either. Nevertheless, it doesn't matter much anymore anyways. They've picked their direction and are running with it, and any development to whatever previously existed lies in the hands of unaffiliated writers, much like it did in the first place anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Ghostagram","date":"2016-03-25T03:59:32.545+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tyvani,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=mU7Ap2h6,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2016-03-22T16:22:28.088+0000)\n>\n> Personally, though, I don't like the idea of having something else control characters.

Why not just demonstrate your powers by blowing out a wall? In fact she could've done that during her speech to add weight to her argument. Instead it just so happens to activate at the worst possible moment with the worst possible outcome.

We know Leona is supposed to be a protector, and Atreus was bullied as a kid.  Imagine if in both of their stories they bring up that Leona stood up for him/was one of his few friends.  And when she went against the interests of the tribe he had to choose between his only friend and what he found morally right, and he chose the tribe over her.  That'd be an awesome and sad little story of how the circumstances and personalities clashed, while keeping Leona true to her role as a protector and Atreus as the law before friends Spartan soldier.  But, instead we get no build up to it, Leona apparently ignored that someone in her tribe was being bullied and Atreus is just a snitch.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyvani","date":"2016-03-24T21:00:17.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes!

Generally a normal person would feel grief and horror at the fact that they just slaughtered a group of old and wizened individuals who raised them.

A woman who will kill for her beliefs and protect what _she_ deems as worth protecting, not all those who need protecting. She seems more of what would come out of an insane cult that lives on top of a mountain who worship the sun more than Dark Souls players.

I'm writing the old Diana as someone who was abused heavily by the Solari because of her questioning and so on until her exile. She wandered, scarred by her abuse, until she came across the Lunari temple with her now signature cuirass and blade. The magic inside the cuirass manifested her anger and hatred, causing her to commit genocide of the Solari. Witnessing the horror she had sown, she fled to the Institute and tried to be of some help to her scientist friends (namely Xerath, Heimer and Viktor who form a research group) since they were all Heretics to some degree. She's still running and the arc I'm going to write will work on developing her character in that scenario.\nI just find Diana easier to write that way.\n\nApart from that I completely agree with your sentiments and it's nice to know that people have the sense to find out how their favorite champion functions.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyvani","date":"2016-03-07T00:13:38.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, I've always been drawn to the idea that some pretty bad things had to happen to Diana in order for her to justify a crusade against the Solari as a whole.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find it reasonable to actually use it as a basis in my opinion piece because of how vague the writers have been about it in the past, although I suppose that didn't stop my perceptions from tainting my it anyways. But, in that vein, the writers have certainly said that Diana gained her forehead symbol in her ascension, but I've always found this unreasonable as Leona should have had a similar one, which causes me to lean towards the idea that she was branded as a punishment, among other things.\n\nNevertheless, that's definitely an interesting place to take Diana's story, and I wish you good luck in seeing it through.
