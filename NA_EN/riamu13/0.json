Any hardware access is via drivers or other intermediate software.\n\nThere area few likely causes: \n\n* A driver is broken: wrong version, corrupted, or just bad. Something the game is doing is triggering cataclysmic driver meltdown as a result.\n\n* Your computer is broken: something the game is doing is trying to use damaged hardware or over-stressing the system, and down it goes.\n\n* The client is damaged and is sending garbage instructions to a driver/system, which is not checking the validity of what the game is telling it to do..\n\nActually, there is a third less likely but possible cause:\n\n* Windows sucks. Sometimes it stands in for a broken driver, since it also has a fair amount of control over the hardware. Any updates recently?\n\nThe first thing to do is look for logs and try to find out if anything is aware of the crash. Depending on what is happening, windows may last long enough to produce an error log that gives a hint at what caused it. You can do that manually if you know how, but there is also this useful tool that will look for windows crash logs and translate them to something you can probably read. Post the results of what you find: https://www.resplendence.com/whocrashed\n\nYou may as well run the hextech repair tool for the client, if the client is corrupted, this should fix it.\n\nAlso worth running checkdisk (open command prompt as admin, type **chkdsk /f**), see if it finds any errors on your drive. If it does, you may have a failing drive that is causing corruption.\n\nThere is not much else worth guessing at without crashlogs and a detailed explanation of the crash (is it instant? what do the system fans do? any odd noises? how long does iit take to reboot?)","replies":[]}]}
