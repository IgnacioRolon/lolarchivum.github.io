I feel bad for all the kids who got banned in tribunal cause the system didnt work and now riot is trying to fix it. If you average 1 report every 8 games you will get a chat restriction lol, very laughable. Im not chat restricted but about 90% of my community is chat restricted with about 75% of my friends list all have it. Good laughs cause when you get a email it says to \"REFORM YOUR BEHAVIOR\". RIP GD and Lol 2014 this will be the last worlds they make money on.","replies":[]}
