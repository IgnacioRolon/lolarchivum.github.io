It was very much like the legendary Samus reveal of old--looking at an armored figure and foolishly assuming that it must be a man underneath, but then finding that \"Kayle\" (a name that gives nothing away) was the name of a woman and that it was actually a super-awesome lady angel in practical armor. It was such a refreshing change, and it helped to establish her as one of my faves.\r\n\r\nThe whole \"fooling people into thinking she's a boy\" element is not a necessary element of her character, but I really hate the fact that her new splash art is so...typical female art. Look at how she folds her leg so you can see her butt, look at how her breast is actually covering her head as she thrusts it upward...it's also so blocky and bulky, and doesn't have any of the grace or majesty that Kayle is supposed to exude. It looks ridiculous, and I am very glad that I already have several skins for her so that I never have to look at such a ridiculous appearance. She's not looking down upon us, preparing to smite the world with her justice--she's showing off her butt and boobs and gesturing for us to join her in the private shell she's forming.\r\n\r\nCompare the splash to *every other Kayle skin there is* if you want to see what I mean. Every other splash art conveys Kayle perfectly...except for the default. And that is a huge problem.","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-10-14T16:53:33.616+0000","up_votes":70,"down_votes":13,"body":"The artist is clearly very skilled, but I think a reroll on this one might make sense.\n\nThe weird golden egg is a peculiar way to represent her ult, which I pictured as a holy aura of celestial magic, rather than … a giant bronze egg she's hiding inside.\n\nThe boobplate is weird for all the usual reasons.

Kayle descending toward the viewer is compelling, but if you're going that route she should be charging headlong with her sword raised to strike, with her torso and shoulders forward, and her wings dominating the space behind her. If they want a less aggro image, then I think her previous splash had it basically right: have her serene, aloft, and balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2014-10-15T00:35:20.054+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":9,"body":"> The weird golden egg is a peculiar way to represent her ult, which I pictured as a holy aura of celestial magic, rather than … a giant bronze egg she's hiding inside.\n\nJust an observation, as I'm not part of the art team - In medieval theology there's something called the nine choirs of angels, which sorts various angels from Judeo-Christian (Catholic, mostly) religious texts into rank order under the divine.

I happen to find it quite beautiful... though as you might be able to tell, I'm a bit biased.\n\nI also really enjoy Judeo-Christian mythology, and fantasy re-interpretations of it. I mentioned *In Nomine* in another thread, and though I feel a bit silly responding to your more scholarly allusion with a tabletop RPG setting, I'll bring it up again, and say that I believe you're referring to **[Ofanim](http://innomine.wikia.com/wiki/Ofanim)**. Of course, the *In Nomine* interpretation of Ofanim differs considerably from the more abstract/Kabbalah version which I believe you're referencing. Incidentally, if you're ever looking for some clever ways of handling supernatural elements in fantasy, I definitely recommend a flip-through of the *In Nomine* materials. It's one of my favorite fantasy worlds, and certainly the most intriguing tabletop RPG setting I've encountered. In particular, they do a really good job describing celestial and infernal politics. (Its applicability to LoL is debatable, as it's more \"modern occult\" than high fantasy.)\n\nOn that same topic, if you're feeling more like a film, there's always *The Prophecy*. (Five second pitch: Christopher Walken as a fallen archangel, and Viggo Mortensen as Lucifer.) At one point, a loyal angel has a line whose excellent delivery calls both the dark and light aspects of Demacia to mind: *Sometimes you just have to DO what you're TOLD.*\n\nAs for Kayle, again, I'm deeply impressed by the artist's style and skill, but I just can't make myself like the metal egg approach to her ult. For one thing, it suggests a physical barrier, rather than something that Kayle could strike through. It's almost like she's being trapped.\n\nI do agree with you that the angel bearing a fiery sword which *turns every way* is one of the most majestic and compelling images in Western mythology. Kayle's voicework is exemplary, and I hope the new VO retains its resonance. I wanted to call it \"booming\", but on reflection it's more … **[steely?](http://images.wikia.com/leagueoflegends/images/a/a1/Kayle.attack4.ogg)** Very well-characterized, in any case.","replies":[{"poster":"Rivenwind","date":"2014-10-15T18:51:24.531+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a kayle fan, I really like the artist's skill and interpretation of her character. But I feel that the burnished, dramatic appearance that they tried for is really too dark overall, imo, especially compared with her previous splash. It's almost diablo-esque to me. The metallic ult, given it's current in-game particle effect is very misleading. Literally, the first thing I thought when I was looking at it was \"Oh, so it's like zhonya's.\" which is mechanically true to a point, but not honestly what I'd expect artistically.\n\nWhat I do like about it though is the \"hot/molten\" look that you can see on its fringes and especially around kayle's hand, which I feel is far more fitting and truly suggests how powerful Kayle's ultimate ability is and stays true to it's current in-game effect. But what I find interesting about it is that we see parts of her body projecting from the sphere (apparently covered/protected as hinted by the sheen on the leftmost wing), enabling her ability to fight...but with its solid appearance, how in the world would Kayle be able to see if she became fully encapsulated in this metallic field as the image suggests?\n\nAs for the whole boob-plate thing...my major gripe with it is the fact that boob-plates are entirely impractical (they direct blows to the sternum, re: good way to die) but I feel it's a breach of kayle's character concept as a judicator. They often depict justice as blindfolded, representing an unbiased view. Justice and angels in general, as two abstract concepts I feel are sexless, genderless and an embodiment of their purpose. I don't feel it's a bad thing that kayle is female to begin with, but I feel that to her character, her sex/gender is merely an afterthought to her duty to her people, and her place the league.\n\nHer sword...just nyeh. She'll still beat you to death with it, but I'm not sure if it's because they don't die laughing first. It's true to her in-game model, but I feel with so many \"newer\" champions with far more sinister, wicked, and intimidating weapons (however highly fantasized) Kayle's own arsenal might need a little love.\n\nAlso, anyone notice that her tabard/sash is entirely missing from the splash?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Legacy of Xion","date":"2014-10-15T00:42:03.329+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> > The weird golden egg is a peculiar way to represent her ult, which I pictured as a holy aura of celestial magic, rather than … a giant bronze egg she's hiding inside.\n> \n> Just an observation, as I'm not part of the art team - In medieval theology there's something called the nine choirs of angels, which sorts various angels from Judeo-Christian (Catholic, mostly) religious texts into rank order under the divine.

Her foot and sword would likely cause a similar effect within the sphere if she moved them as well.\n\nAs for the splash being so dark, it's really only dark *outside *of the bubble, whereas everything within it (including Kayle herself and even the sky beyond) is bright. The only reason she looks \"menacing\" is because her face is shrouded, as it's always been on her base skin.\n\nI think the splash does her justice, personally. Kayle isn't a perfect source of \"goodness\" and \"benevolence\", she is \"law\" and \"order\". She does what needs to be done for the greater good, regardless of \"morality\". The new splash I think does an excellent job of neither showing her to be good nor bad, but rather a paragon of someone who gets shit done (pardon my language), regardless of whatever it takes to do so.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Motajo","date":"2014-10-14T19:58:25.360+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"> The weird golden egg is a peculiar way to represent her ult, which I pictured as a holy aura of celestial magic, rather than … a giant bronze egg.\n\nYeah, I had no clue what that egg-like thing was supposed to be until you mentioned Intervention.\n> The boobplate is weird for all the usual reasons.\n\nWhat was their official reasoning for this kind of thing?

Deal with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Voishin","date":"2014-10-15T07:45:12.344+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"Congratulations on \"explaining something\" while having no idea what you're talking about.\n\nAlthough yes, breasts do protrude from the body, they are not (unless filled with silicone) rocks; they are often quite squishy. I have a feeling you have very little (read: zero) experience with them. Things like sports bras used today are great examples of how much the size and visibility of a womans chest can be reduced while retaining enough comfort to perform vigorous exercises unimpeded.. and that's just a relatively thin piece of fabric.\n\nThere's also the fact that plate armor does not rest against the skin, there are multiple layers of padding between flesh and metal to absorb and distribute force. You have no understanding of this subject either. A proper set of plate armor has enough layers to relatively (if not completely) comfortably fit even the bustiest of women.\n\nThe most important thing about plate armor is the rounded nature of it; it causes sharp direct attacks to glance away and blunt ones to be distributed and absorbed. It is important because a weapon (designed to be able to penetrate armor) will ALWAYS penetrate armor of equal material and craftsman quality unless it glances away (or doesn't have enough force which is irrelevant to this). Boob armor, on the other hand, creates a point that would glance a blow into the heart, completely opposed to its purpose.\n\nIgnoring actual combat, simply falling forward in boob armor could easily cause the collar bone to snap and/or compact the center of the chest, potentially killing the wearer (not that a snapped collar bone wouldn't be quite likely death on its own back then).\n\nThere have also been quite a few females in chest armor through history; Joan of Ark wasn't the only one, just the most well known. In battle they would be largely indistinguishable from males on the field (which was preferable as an injured male on the battlefield would very likely be killed, an injured female would not be.. for a while).\n\nYou're also, funnily enough, wrong about boob armor. It did exist, but was ornamental and/or sexual, but never for combat.\n\nLastly, you've never actually seen a military woman in a kevlar vest, have you? Hint: The vest doesn't become boob shaped.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsaalyo","date":"2014-10-15T13:01:31.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":11,"body":"Oh the ad hominems. \"Lol you like boob armor you must be a fedora neckbeard virgin\", right? Sorry, I have plenty of experience with them, being in a relationship for about 8 years and all. The question is, do YOU have any experience with them?

Even your mother, if you must.\n\nSecond, I'm sorry you felt the need to jump to the absolute extreme of \"kevlar perfectly cups each boob and even nipple\". The kevlar DOES have a forward curve for the comfort of the wearer. There is indeed a threat of bullets bouncing upwards, but this is nullified by the soldier leaning slightly forward - something all soldiers are trained to do, anyway. So again, it's cute that you're accusing other people of having no real-world experience in these matters, but for once, it really does seem to be opposite day.\n\nI know you're immediately going to jump on \"BUT KAYLE'S IS PERFECTLY BOOB CUPPING, THAT'S THE PROBLEM, WAH.\" You know what? This is a fantasy game. Just as the men are ten feet tall and 400 pounds of muscle, just as the other men are slender and sleek and chiseled like a Calvin Klein model, just as these men walk around topless in the arctic tundra (even though you whiners bitched about Sejuani doing it, lol typical hypocrisy), the women are going to be a touch on the sexualized side. Kayle is still clad hair to toe in solid armor, and you're bitching because she's not a solid tube? Pantheon runs around in his underwear, and you bitch about Kayle being too sexual?

Stuffing MORE padding into the same space to somehow make the extra breast mass more comfortable isn't going to work. Frankly, I question whether or not you're even female, by offering such a ridiculous idea. Your two options are:\n\n1. Have a forward curve in the chest to accommodate the breasts.\n2. Have the entire piece of armor several inches forward, meaning extra mass, less maneuverability, less flexibility, and generally being a stupid idea.\n\nKayle's armor goes the right route. Is it sexualized by cupping each one rather than having a nondescript forward hump? Yes. And the moment you start whining about Pantheon's armor style, I'll take people like you seriously when you whine about how armor looks in a fantasy game.","replies":[{"poster":"cshakes","date":"2014-10-15T15:27:41.835+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"The extra padding would go between/around the boobs to help with jiggle problems.\n\nPlease note that historically regular plate has always had room for many, many layers of padding.

Kayle already has absolutely more armor than anyone besides maybe Mordekaiser, and the only reason THAT character wears as much as he does is because he doesn't want people to know who or what he is. It could be a hollow shell, for all we know. The simple fact is, this is a fantasy game. No character is going to be walking around in a historically accurate set of full plate steel, with the enclosed helmet with two tiny slits for eye holes. It's just not going to happen, **nobody **wants that in a fantasy game like LoL. Honestly, if that's what you want, go play Age of Empires or something. Kayle is indeed a business-first woman who armors up from hair to toe. But this is a fantasy game, there are certain archetypes that consumers of the fantasy genre want - men AND women - and one of those archetypes is stylized armor. Kayle's is VERY modest and practical, and if it still offends you this much, seek counseling.","replies":[{"poster":"missinggrave","date":"2014-10-16T01:45:24.857+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, I have to put my two cents in here:\n\nFrom a strictly non-historic viewpoint, I'll try to do my best to prove this from a SOCIAL point. When you look out in a crowded area - assuming it's during something that isn't an organized event - you see a multitude of people. Every day we see people from modest clothing, to provocative, to flamboyant, to religious (( I.E; Seen in Islam and Jewish practices )). Each person shows their personality in their own unique way and you can often tell a lot about a person STRICTLY from how they dress.\n\nNow, let's take a look at some of the champions of League - specifically some enemies. Jarvan the Fourth is enemies with Urgot and Swain. Where he dresses in practical armor and helmet, making sure to use a lance to keep his target at bay, he also dresses in very striking colors to lead his men into battle (( I.E; Yellow, Red, White )). Then there's Urgot who wears no armor - aside from the potentially protective metal pieces he's constructed of thanks to Zaunites - has a wide arrangement of weaponry that he uses despite his preference to some and has very dull, dark colors showing his DEAD ((puns of damage)) and cruel personality. Then if we look at Swain, he wears limited to no armor depending on the skin you use and doesn't even USE a weapon because of Beatrice and magic. Swain however shares a similar pattern of bright colors to inspire his men but wears those colors in a fashion similar to inspiring a sense of confidence to believing in his plan versus his actions - after all, he's five steps ahead in a game of chess you already lost, who needs a second player?\n\nMaybe I've done a bad job at explaining that, but TL;DR before I move on: Champions in the League often have different appearances in their clothes and armor based off of their personality and iconic rivalries with other champions.\n\nTaking a look at Morgana and Kayle, they SHOULD follow the same pattern to remain consistent - since I know that Riot <3 consistency. Let's look at Morgana first to get a ground as to how Kayle should look, since this is a debate about her and not the two of them. Morgana revolves around being very liberated and being the \"rebel with a cause\" and is very comfortable with showing off her body in a form of self expression and freedom - even having dark wings and colors showing off her training in dark magic. I would expect her to even choose to not wear armor - even if it would be smarter - strictly to spite those who DO wear it. Kayle, however, is modest, she intends to remove all things that could cause chaos (( after all, she believes in strict rules and order )). This means she becomes someone who is not defined by their gender, no defined by their social rank, and not defined by individuality. She becomes someone defined by her actions in accordance to her morals. That's why people are upset, because even something like \"boob armor\" seems unlike her and to others it seems impractical. It simply doesn't fit what she stands for to them, and people want to make sure that is made clear to those at Riot to keep her the way she is already.\n\nI hope I did a good job at explaining that, after all, I enjoy the diversity of characters in League from J4 to Ahri to Kayle and seeing their uniqueness taken away seems wrong and out of place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2014-10-15T19:37:01.542+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not even wanting it to be historically accurate: I'm no expert, but if you look at Kayle's current splash, I'm sure there are things that aren't right. I mean, that fact that she can even get airborne is a wonder with all that armor. But that's ok, because as you said its a *fantasy* game. \n\nI suppose I should be more clear. I mean less \"sexualized\" and more \"I'd like Kayle to be heavily armored and I don't want her gender to be important to her identity.\" By Riot adding more feminine features to her armor that weren't there before, they are saying \"Hey, she needs to be girly\" when this is really just not the case. \"Is Kayle not allowed to have some peronality?\" you say? Of course she's allowed a personality. And she already has one, since when do boob-plates add to her personality? Any changes to her armor in this splash do not add any elegance or god-like attributes to her what-so-ever. Furthermore, why would Kayle be elegant at all? She's a ferocious defender that soars over the battlefield to smite her foes. Does she really need to be girly or elegant? Would evil fear her more if she was? I have to disagree. Lastly, we already have a handful of other female champions that fill the \"elegant\" role much better than Kayle ever would. \n\nSaying I'm \"offended\" by this splash art is a gross overstatement. I'm more displeased than anything else; I'm not going to lose sleep over this or anything. You say that there are certain fantasy archetypes, yet several of those archetypes are ones that Kayle fulfills with her more gender neutral qualities.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
