Out of 8 matches, I won 6 against Gold IV players. My IGN is EzCarry1. Why was I placed in Bronze IV? If it matters, when I play in norms I get matched against Plat players as well. I honestly might stop playing because I do not want to have to climb out of bronze and silver to get to where I think I belong (gold).","replies":[]}
