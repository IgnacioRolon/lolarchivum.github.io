Out of 8 matches, I won 6 against Gold IV players. My IGN is EzCarry1. Why was I placed in Bronze IV? If it matters, when I play in norms I get matched against Plat players as well. I honestly might stop playing because I do not want to have to climb out of bronze and silver to get to where I think I belong (gold).","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-01-12T05:00:18.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least youre not iron\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"EzCarry1","date":"2019-01-12T06:32:43.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True!
