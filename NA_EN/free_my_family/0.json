Can we, hopefully, make this an unofficial Bilgewater Lore response discussion? I would love to hear what everyone else thinks! Personally, I can&#039;t wait for Act Two, which I believe is tomorrow. I wonder how Aatrox, Quinn, Garen and all their skins will incorporate into this whole little feature Riot has brought to us.\n\nAnd for the record, I have nothing wrong with people complaining about Fiora and her changes and whatnot. I get it, you guys don&#039;t like it. Nothing wrong with that. I was just noting how I saw next to nothing about something with so much potential right now that Riot has given us.\n\nANYWAYS: This is for discussing Bilgewater stuff!!! Have fun, feel free to discuss whatever, of course.

I'm being somewhat purist here and realize that Riot wanted to go a different direction but personal opinion time. I don't like how TF didn't truly betray graves, and made an intelligent decision and Graves was just too stubborn listen. To me it's less interesting because it makes these characters less complex. TF isn't totally selfish and didn't want to leave Graves but he had to look out for himself here. This makes Graves unsympathetic to me because he is now dedicating his life to killing someone who tried to keep him from making a huge mistake.  Graves is like the guy on your team that goes, \"we could have totally 2v5 if you hadn't left noob.\"  Overall I don't like this as much as the original lore's because it's a lot harder to debate who you would side with in their conflict.\n\nGangplank and MF are great. GP is a true monster, but has a reason for being one. His interaction with the kid you can see why he is a leader. He is rational and does value those who do right by him. His crew most likely feel that they can follow him because he won't turn his cruelty on them for no reason. MF is beautiful and the life of the party, but intelligent and very skilled based on how she interacts with the guy that followed her. Of course it seems she may have a devious and even ruthless side because she sent a child to trick GP into a trap. Lord help that kid if GP finds out, but maybe she did it cause she knows GP would never intentionally harm a child...still things we don't know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordHippoman","date":"2015-07-24T01:28:45.035+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, I left the Boards a while back because I was tired of what felt like endless bickering.  \n\nThis is turning things around.
