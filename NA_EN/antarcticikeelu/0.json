People have the right to be offended by your cursing, just as you have the right to use said curse words. Youre saying they shouldnt play the game if they get offended by cursing....but yet why should you have the right to even play the game if you find the need to excessively curse all the time?! YOU are the one ruining other ppl's game experience by being the offender. The other people arent doing anything wrong at all...they just dont like you cursing at them or others. Sooo according to the summoners code....YOU are the one in the wrong, not them. Just think about that. Other people shouldnt have to be subjected to your excessive cursing...it obviously ruins the game experience for some people. Simple solution....dont curse. And if thats not possible for you to do, then you've got bigger issues my friend. You dont NEED to curse to make a point","replies":[]},{"poster":"Archon X","date":"2015-09-23T14:45:53.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please clean up your language, I wouldn't want to have you thrown off the Hoover Darn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"slippykitten","date":"2015-09-23T15:58:11.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"The game is catering to as wide an audience as possible. The game is too big to be enjoyed by reasonable people. in order to sell the most skins they have to make sure the most amount of people will play, and like it or not, there will always be more kids playing games than adults. \n\nIt's just business, don't take it personally.","replies":[]}]}
