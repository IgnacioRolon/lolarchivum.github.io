And it's possible that they don't have enough data on the newer champions. Also, the AI for each champion may have to be written by hand, meaning that it simply takes time for Riot to actually pump these bots out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-01T15:28:41.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While there are champions that don't have bots at all (like Kled and Camille), some champions do exist as bots, but they're not available for custom games. Yasuo and Teemo are both examples of that, you can encounter them in Coop but not in customs.
