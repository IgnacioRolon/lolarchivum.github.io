Map is kinda like SR but much. Teams have 1 leader, 5 captains 10 builders, and 84 soldiers. Soldiers have 3 health, no skills, all have the same attack range and speed, and their health works like ward health where it is three hits and you are dead. Captains have their basic skills and 5 health bar units. Leaders have their full champion abilities and 10 health bar units. Builders only have 2 health units and a slightly lower range than Soldiers, but they can build structures.\n\nFor skills each health bar is 100 health and there are no items for anybody. Gold goes to a team pool and is used by builders to build wards (which are large, visible, and destroyable) and turrets, (which are larger and have additional skills to help them fight multiple opponents), and maybe siege weapons of some sort.\n\nCaptains and builders stay dead longer than soldiers, and leaders stay dead for even longer than them. Maybe leaders, builders, and captains could cost gold to return to play or something.","replies":[{"poster":"SirΤeemο","date":"2017-04-08T18:41:14.870+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"seems nice ! but 200 people in 1 game would be laggy/buggy AF !","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-04-08T19:58:18.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After I wrote it I reread it and said to myself, \"That is just a crappier Fantasy Earth Zero.\" XD\n\nFantasy Earth Zero was a sort of battlefield mmorpg with early ps2 era graphics on pc, it got shut down in the US though because the company that had the rights to it sucked XD\n\nAnyway, it could be somewhat laggy if the other players had garbage internet, but with Riot's server side hitboxes it might be doable if the north american internet infrastructure didn't suck.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2017-04-08T18:59:35.580+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zezockary,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=18mEgRM9,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-04-08T18:16:51.900+0000)\n>\n> I have one... kinda out there though.\n> \n> Two teams of 100 people. \n\n\"GG my team had 16 AFKs and 3 trolls and their team only had 12 AFKs and 2 trolls\"\n\n\"Pls report Yasuo, Vayne, Camille, Lulu, Lee Sin, Syndra, Xin, Zac, Blitz, and Zed ty\"","replies":[{"poster":"SirΤeemο","date":"2017-04-08T19:14:18.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahahaha xD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2017-04-08T21:38:40.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So vayne gets 5k hp and full build instantly?
