I want more people to see our honest response to this question.\n\nThis orange essence thing is a spicy one but I'll take my best shot at addressing it. The most honest answer it comes down to is that we wanna be able to spread out orange essence type loot and rewards across multiple systems without having to take an additional huge revenue hit at the same time that we're making runes free.\n\nI'll explain what I mean.\n\nBasically, when we first started giving out skins and stuff through the loot system, the only way you could get it was by \n\n1) paying for it \nor \n2) earning it through the mastery chests.\n\nGoing into 2018 you're also gonna get skin content through things like events and honor (lets call them \"orange shards\" since we're really talking about anything that can be disenchanted into orange essence). We lowered the disenchant rate on shards, and we're giving out more shards.\n\nSo that's what I mean by spreading it across multiple systems. I think we'll actually have to wait and see whether players feel that the additional shards from the other systems make up for the disenchant rate changes. Preseason shipped with some other upgrades to loot like bad luck protection and chances for double drops in chests, and I think we'll have to wait and see how that feels for players before we'll know.\n\nNow, there's another question implied here, which I think also bears addressing: **\"Why can't Riot just give us more orange essence and more shards?\"**\n\nThe answer is that we make money on League through RP sales, and we want to be really responsible about how much we cut into RP sales when giving away stuff. Giving away skins and cosmetics through our in-games systems is something we have to manage really carefully—if it becomes to easy to earn orange essence and shards, RP sales would go down a lot (why pay for it when you can just get skins for free?). Even though League is free to play, we do need to make money and manage it responsibly so we can reinvest it back into the game. That's why making cosmetics too easy to get for free would be irresponsible for us, as a business.\n\nI know it's hard to get excited about an explanation like this, but I hope it makes sense!\n\n##ONE MORE LONGISH EDIT TO CLARIFY A POINT:\n\n**I don't want to make the promise that the orange essence amounts you get will “even out” or be the same as before.** There’s way too much variance in the rates that people get OE from mastery and all the other systems for us to say that with a straight face. And the truth is the nerf to OE disenchant rates was significant.\n\nIt’s more than we reigned it in to give ourselves wiggle room with these other systems. And honestly, the revenue hit from making runes free was a factor we considered as part of that. The goal is to make rewards systems that feel meaningful, rather than just constantly increasing the amount of stuff we give out every year because player expectations keep rising.\n\nIt feels icky when we start talking about protecting revenue and budgets and shit, but we’re open to feedback on this stuff. I see basically no one talking about the double drops or bad luck protection that we already added to the system, so I wanna wait for a while for people to get used to the changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2017-11-12T18:59:22.714+0000","up_votes":121,"down_votes":28,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Cactopus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fRZopjhE,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2017-11-12T18:53:04.273+0000)\n>\n> This orange essence thing is a spicy one but I&#x27;ll take my best shot at addressing it.

There was no justifiable reason to do this other than shortsighted greed. You should not have implemented the system with higher shard rewards to begin with, and then lower the shard rewards later on. \n\nPS: The amount of skin shard rewards have not encreased, honor capsules and level up rewards don't give any of those so the excuse of getting more skin shards now is statistically false.","replies":[{"poster":"Raoul","date":"2017-11-12T19:11:26.062+0000","up_votes":64,"down_votes":148,"body":"Are skins something you need to play the game?

If you actually have any standard logic, you would realise that this change is objectively bad.\n\nLets make it simple.\n\nYour boss gives everyone a raise of 500 dollars a month, everyone is happy, they can get lots more then before. \nThen after some time the Boss takes away 300 dollars away from your earnings. You would never say \"be glad he gave you additional 200 dollars\", you would say \"what the heck, bring back my 300 dollars\". \n\nAlso no, we aint getting it for \"free\", we earn them from playing the game and actually continuing to make Riots game revelant because of that. If it werent for the playerbase being active and keeping the game up and a float, they would not exist. Yes, its indeed because we play the game, and they have already implemented the orange essence system. they didnt have to, but they did, it was working fine as it was, they had no real justifiable reason to nerf it. This all goes back to that example at top. Why would we ever go back to sand if we know what water is now?\n\nYes, people these days are so damn greedy, but point your fingers to those that implement a much more greedier agenda than those that were perfectly fine with what was before just one patch ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Raoul","date":"2017-11-12T19:22:00.973+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":58,"body":"Not even remotely the same, games are not work, you dont have to play games, and work is (usually) not fun to be at.\nNext.\n\nHonestly, I am suprised how many people act like playing this game is work and therefore you deserve some kind of real life payment (RP Items which normaly cost real money) for it.

As if Riot doesnt owe us anything and they can just make it worse from what was objectively better before and we should just be glad they exist for us to serve them like mindless pawns. \n\nSecond, any type of activity is work because you WORK for it. You work for your enjoyement, you work for your money. If a human being doesnt work for anything, they will die. What you precieve as workis questionable since everything we do as people is work for something....games are just one type of work where we work for enjoyement, and enjoyment comes in many different forms, it being a rewards of winning, a reward of a special item, and reward of just playing.

It is a business and there is direct competition by other games and genres. It is due to player retention and public image politics that we are \"allowed\" to get free stuff. \n\nSecond: The orange essence system depends EXCLUSIVELY of the Hextech crate system. The Hextech crate system is bought by many, giving profit to Riot. If they devalue the virtual coin #2 used exclusively in the loot system bought with cash, they are effectively affecting a wide array of costumers who supported and had faith in Riot. \n\nThird: The change was (in my opinion) poorly expressed and communicated. I've only noticed today as I wanted to upgrade a skin shard.

I feel like I was blindsided and did have the chance to get rid of some of the shards I did not want IF RIOT HAD CLEARLY STATED THAT THE VALUE WAS GOING DOWN.  This is on top of the fact that I am one of the people who paid money for boxes and passes.  I calculated my expected return based on the old values and you literally stole half of the value from me and did not return half of the RP I spent on them.  I wont be purchasing future boxes as they are virtually worthless now, and out of principle.  A simple warning like the blue essence reminder would have been what a responsible company does.  I mean you did for blue essence.    \n\nThe other issue I have is \"the loss of revenues from runes\".  WE SPENT IP ON RUNES NOT MONEY.  So, unless people were really buying a ton of Rune pages with RP (and no one I know was including myself) then you should have lost very little in revenues.  Just to be honest the entire change is a cash grab.  Everything in the game now is less valuable to the player and generates more revenue to Riot.  That usually means the company is in cash out mode, because they cant see a way to ACTUALLY DIVERSIFY revenues to increase profit.  So, they just increase price and in riots case just steal from players.  Cutting the value of shards clandestinely is literally stealing half their value.  Riot is a one trick pony and this pony is old now.  Seems like what they see 5 years down road is not so good, so you just pull the cash out method.    \n\nNever seen a business model in college that involved screwing paying customers and expecting to stay in business.

If Riot wanted to implement aka force a new OE system they should have nerfed the disenchant value at that precise moment, not way before it. Thanks to this poorly thought direction the consumer feels toyed and helpless. Specially if the target of the nerf is a virtual currency directly related to putting cash into the game and gamble through loot boxes.\n\nThe player doesn't want \"more free stuff\", the player wants to keep the system if it has worked. And there is no proper justification to take a system that works and trample over the costumer alleging \"but, but more stuff is coming to compensate duh\", specially if that new content is locked behind awfully designed missions and greedy cash-grab events.\n\nTo sum up: If the player is going to invest more time and resources to get the new stuff to compensate the preemptive nerf, the new content and features are not worth.

Would it not make more sense to do both at the same time?\n* The way this whole above post is phrased makes it sound like any cosmetic gained through anything other than RP is a pure monetary loss for Riot. This, in turn, implies this whole system of orange essence, shards, etc. all comes from the goodness of Riot's heart, even though it generates a net loss in revenue. Unless the system isn't being managed as it should be, this should not be true, as any kind of loot box system is designed to generate both revenue and player commitment, the latter of which also can be boiled down to a monetary value. Therefore, cutting back on a system that is already largely seen as far less generous than, say, HotS or Dota 2 randomly giving out lots of cosmetics on a regular basis, doesn't really seem like a sound decision even if the goal is to increase revenue.\n* To reiterate, cosmetics weren't too easy to get for free before this change, and they're certainly not now. I'm pretty sure Riot has economists working on these systems, so I may be wrong, but I feel there's a lot that could be done to improve this system, allow players to at least feel they're getting more content, and generate even more revenue from this. Riot has vast amounts of quality cosmetic content for sale, far more than the other two games I've mentioned combined, so it perplexes me as to why League's loot box scheme would be more stingy than the rest, not just as a player, but with Riot's revenue in mind as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DorQuendi","date":"2017-11-12T20:39:00.640+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is... why not tell us?

I feel it wasn't communicated well enough, and due to that, I am stockpiling skin shards I might wanna upgrade with a devalued disenchant cost. \n\nWhat about all the people who invested into Hextech Crates and wasn't expecting the devaluation?

This change just completely drives me away from buying them, as I've got to suffer some champion shards (useless, I have all champs), then ward skins and icons and now probably emotes, and the skin shards I do get have such a lessened value of OE that I just don't see the point of gambling with chests.\n\nOutside of trying for gem stones, and at this point I question if even those are worth.

So let's take a look at the issue here: \n\n\n_**Before pre-season**_\n\n* Skin shards disenchant value were higher. An example to illustrate: Corporate Mundo, a 1820 RP skin could be disenchanted for a total of 1050 Orange Essence, a 57,7% (rounded) of the total value if you purchased the skin with RP.\n\n_**After pre-season hit**_\n\n* Skins shard disenchant value drop way off the charts. For the sake of the argument let's continue with the Corporate Mundo skin example: With today's system, Corporate Mundo is equivalent to 364 Orange Essence, an astounding 20% of the total value (exact, not even rounded).\n\n**Effectively, we've (as a players) have lost a total of 37,7% Orange Essence of a Legendary Skin Shard**. You would think that's enough, don't you? \n\nWell, now is where shit is going to hit the fan. The total Orange Essence required to Upgrade the Legendary Skin to permanent is 1520 Orange Essence. Thus, in order to Upgrade the Corporate Mundo skin, you would need to disenchant 4,17 Legendary Skin Shards in order to Upgrade one with the new system. Looking back at the old one, you would only require 1,45 Lengendary Skin Shards. \n\nTo sum up: **Riot has ninja-nerfed the value out of Hextech crafting. After changing the BE system into a RNG shitfest (which, with all respect it is, no matter how you look at it) Rito has devalued the Skind Shard crafting beacause....

While It was true they told us to disenchant/enchant/reroll shards, I would assume most of the people assumed Riot was referring to champion shards, as the blue essence system was about to be completely changed. I don't recall EVER to touch upon Orange Essence stuff nor did they expand on why should Orange Essence disenchant (and only disenchant) be devalued. \n\nTo devalue a working economy system partially, without apparent reason and with (in my opinion) poor communication is totally unacceptable, period.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
