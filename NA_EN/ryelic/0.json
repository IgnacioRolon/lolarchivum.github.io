People in solo queue hate laning against aatrox because he’s a giant lane bully. Pros don’t like aatrox because he’s “blind pickable” to their limited champion select.

But again the same nerf parade happened with Mordekaiser, because people still seem not to understand, that Juggernauts were always about huge damage with tankiness and sustain with bad mobility and limited engage opportunities.\n\nBut then again, I presume it was bound to happen, when you rework a Diver champion into a Juggernaut. The issue is that Aatrox kept part of his old Diver self, but became a Juggernaut. It's really something, which is hard to balance and will be problematic in gameplay. I personally liked the old Aatrox more, when he had multiple build paths and had a toggle on his W, so he could decide when he wanted to deal more damage or have better sustain.\n\nAs for pro play: Does anyone actually care about pro play? I mean... I found them really disappointing. I thought professionals play much more complicated champions, like Aurelion Sol, Kindred, Ivern, Kalista, Bard, Anivia etc. (champs you barely see in solo queue), yet they seem to cry about champions, which at first glance seem to be low elo pubstompers.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2019-09-30T07:29:42.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As for you question, no not that I'm aware of, funny enough a couple buddies of mine that only played ranked still didn't bother watching any of their esports despite being excessively competitive players themselves.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2019-09-13T14:30:07.520+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"He is one buff away from being omnipresent once again, if he does not get reverted first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2019-09-13T15:59:09.429+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"People hate laning against a champ who's early isn't that great when compared to others of that lane?

And not in the way such as fighting a jayce, or a kennen, or another juggernaut or even someone like jax or irelia. He just sucked to fight against period. You couldn't fight him 1v1, it was hard to keep up in waveclear, hard to finish him off even if you did out duel him, You couldn't poke him out of lane, or even safely farm under tower. Basically, if you were even with him in CS, kills, and xp you were actually way behind, and if he had even one kill, it was lane over (Barring jungle assistance of course). The problem is that most lane bullies don't share ALL of the problems at once. A jayce? you generally can play safely under tower using minion blockage properly, and you could either potentially outsustain him or all in him. A renekton? He might be able to dive you, but only if you're way low, but otherwise he can't really constantly poke you under tower with no consequence. Etc.\n\nI think they should have nerfed his minion healing without hurting his waveclear though. Heck, they could even ramp up his healing vs minions at certain levels. The problem is that he has neither mana costs nor can you poke him out (sure vlad is that way too, but vlad has at least hp costs and isn't that strong during lane, aka, he's super easy to dive). \n\nBasically, if you don't nerf his sustain, you'd have to nerf something like his ability to cast E during his Q, and I don't think aatrox players would appreciate that at all. But the dude needed some kind of lane nerf. All lane bullies need at least one true weakness afterall.","replies":[]}]}
