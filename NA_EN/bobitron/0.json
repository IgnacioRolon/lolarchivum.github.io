The first game or two I try to play, everything is fine until loading screen. Then it shows a popup saying \"You have disconnected from the server\" and some other text. My client still is open, connected and I can chat with my friends. However every time i try to rejoin game it starts loading and then gives me the same error message. This has cost me multiple rank games LP now, when I literally had never lost more than 1 or 2 games in playing for over a year because of DC leaver loss (at the start of game). It's happened 5 days in the last week now that I disconnect from the server when the game is loading. It is not my internet as everything is still working fine, including as I said even the client messaging area. The game just refuses to load. I watched the same kind of thing happen to RTO in the twitch rivals competition yesterday and they lost a finals game because of it. Riot fix your servers please...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Synu","date":"2019-03-27T23:28:21.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RESTART UR PC, IT SHOULD WORK.\n\n YOUR PC DIDNT OPEN UP LEAGUE OF LEGEND PROPERLY THAT WHY IT SAID THAT","replies":[]},{"poster":"kolrick","date":"2019-03-27T23:14:37.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"happening to me too.. this sucks","replies":[]},{"poster":"wrc","date":"2019-03-27T23:13:31.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"happened to me twice just now","replies":[]},{"poster":"MilkBuddy","date":"2019-03-27T23:13:13.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happened to me just now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Synu","date":"2019-03-27T23:02:58.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"restart ur pc \nthat should do it","replies":[]},{"poster":"KRO0KED","date":"2019-03-27T22:55:17.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked queues have been disabled the moment I got ingame, Now my game is crashed, I can't join and I can't access my lobby.
