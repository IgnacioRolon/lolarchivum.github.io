This way both AD and AP assassins can get good items, without ADCs abusing them. On top of it, Sterak's IBG, and Mallet should be made melee only as well, andd Sterak's returned to it's pre-nerf stats would help a lot for tanks being able to survive being bursted, but not DPSed assassins and ADCs, while assassins can survive ADCs but not tanks.
