I&#039;ve been using TLD for a while, but I want to know if the speed Stormraider&#039;s gives me is better than the burst TLD provides, as his bleed gives good burst on its own.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2017-02-02T22:36:39.354+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Join the Church of Stormraider's and see the light that these Scrubderlord's users fail to see!\nGotta go fast!\n\n\n3 main reasons why Stormraiders is better.\n\n1. Stormraiders allows you to actually trade in lane. Without it, you are forced into an all-in pattern during laning phase, or else you get punished very hard for proc'ing your passive. With stormraiders, you can Combo a Yasuo and he and the speed boost will make it to where he can't immediately hit you back with his Q and autos.\n\n2. the damage difference from Thunderlords is negligible. Thunderlords isn't gonna be the difference between a kill or not for talon. He is capable of all--in ing at level 2 just fine without it and the cases where he can't, Thunderlord would not have been enough to win him the kill. Stormraider speed boost also give shim chase potential and the extra 1-2 autos more than makes up for the difference of Tlords damage you aren't getting, and on a more consistent basis since Tlords CD is longer than Stormraiders.\nTherefore, simply having stormraiders. It also just make sit easy to proc your passive since the speed boost guarantees you stay into melee range long enough to get your auto attack off for your passive in most cases.\n\n3. Stormraiders scales better into late game. The damage from Tlords becomes more and more irrelevant as the game goes on since the scaling on it is eh at best. Stormraiders gives Talon much more chase an escape potential, and the Movespeed and Slow resist combine perfectly with his E which scales with his MS and is affected by slows. With Stormraiders and {{item:3009}} , Talon can dodge skillshots , chase opponents, escape or even just use the burst on someone in a sticky situation to chase a different opponent entirely, and when using his E to escape after his target has been dealt with, the slow resist makes it to where if he is tagged with slows before he leap a wall, he doesn't flip at the speed of molasses since the slow resist and speed boost counter this. This is important because more so than any other assassin, Talon has some issues with being kited and has the least simple, consistent and easy to access escape and mobility among his class.\n\nStormraider's opens up Talon's kit to far more versatile plays than Tlords, which doesn't really provide you with anything you truly need.\n\n\nTalon's damage is high to where he doesn't even need his full rotation to kill in most scenarios, so the Tlords damage is overkill to me.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-02-02T22:49:06.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah.\n\nI have to try Stormraiders.\n\nThanks for the help.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-02-02T22:03:36.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends.\n\n\nBut i prefer TONS OF DAMAGE ; ^)","replies":[]}]}
