Stay with your main!\n\nA main is a champion that is supposed to be your companion in League, to stick with you through thick and thin, a champion that you love to play not because you get freelo or you stomp everybody with them. You have to have fun playing your main even if you&#039;re losing. Your main should be an extension of you in the game, your conduit into Valoran and Summoner&#039;s Rift. Your reactions have to be precise, your damage calculation imperative for last hitting. You have to love your main&#039;s VO, their abilities, their nuances that make them 3D characters. \n\nSorry for the ramble, but I see so many people main a champ because they start losing and throw their champ away and try to learn a new one.\n\nEDIT: according to people who actually play Pokemon,  rip me, my analogy was stupid. XD\n\nSo uh, have this temporary substitute until I can think of something else. \n\nEDIT 2 : It's perfectly fine to have multiple mains, especially if you play multiple roles.\n\nEDIT 3: Woo!

You're going to argue she isn't OP too just cause she isn't perma-banned?\n\nChamps can start growing OP if their counters or competition get nerfed, in case you havn't noticed. Hopefully riot doesn't nerf  either and just slightly buff their counters, cause while they're very  dominant atm it's mostly due to nothing to deal with them being prevalent. So yes, OP is subjective since you can't seem to agree.\n\nAnd I still don't agree that all perma-banned are OP, zed still the same to deal with to this day. It's simply cause the QSS change(which only affected adcs) that caused a knee-jerk reaction. All ban means is there's heavy dislike for a said champion even if they aren't OP. Not saying there's bans due to OP picks but automatically tying a champion's OP-ness to ban rate isn't good at all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2016-09-29T17:56:20.988+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">Word of advice passed on down to me by another.
