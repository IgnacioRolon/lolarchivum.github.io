What light reaches below is filtered through fumes leaking from the tangles of corroded pipework and reflected from the stained glass of its industrial architecture. Zaun and Piltover were once united, but are now separate, yet symbiotic societies. Though it exists in perpetual smogged twilight, Zaun thrives, its people vibrant and its culture rich. Piltoverâ€™s wealth has allowed Zaun to develop in tandem; a dark mirror of the city above.\n\nZaun is an undercity district. Piltover and Zaun are now separate _societies_. No mention of cities, let alone separate countries. What you described would be a good solution, but unfortunately it isn't like that currently.\n\nZaun doesn't have its port anymore, nor does it have fertile land. It can't grow food, it can't trade, it's dependent on Piltover's economy. The \"culture\" part sounds like it's describing a subculture which developed from the mainstream.\nAnd if they started as one city, that means they are one people. They can no longer have distinct origin, culture and language. Zaun is more akin to just a very very large industrial, \"dark\" part of Piltover now.

However the biggest and most relevant is how difficult it is to find lore entries.\n\nFor example, let's say my main is Cassiopeia, and I want to know more about her. So I go to the champions section and find her page in Universe. I see a short story about her killing some random nobleman, and how she sees herself as an ugly monster that needs to be shut away. I see she got her snake form through a transformation in a Shuriman tomb.\n\nOkay. Now I want to know where to go to learn about that.\n\n... Where would I go?\n\nThe Shurima page, you might say. Well, for one thing, you can't actually get there directly from Cassiopeia's page. You need to go back up to the Regions tab (or be dumb like me and go to Noxus first BEFORE finding your way back to the regions tab), then find Shurima, THEN scroll halfway down the page. Descent into the Tomb doesn't list the characters involved; it just gives a short introductory description, presumably what's in the YouTube description. \n\nNow, granted, that description mentions Cassiopeia's name, so this might be a bad example. But if I don't know that this video is there to find, how am I supposed to find it? I knew what I was looking for and I nearly missed it because its section is so far down. \n\nAnd if it had touched on any other aspect of the video - say, Nasus' first quote about the tragedy of Shurima's rise, or had spoken of Sivir being betrayed? There'd be nothing to go on.\n\nShouldn't the video be directly accessible ON Cassiopeia's page, since it's such a big part of her life and her lore? It doesn't even need to be embedded, just a small section of 'Related Lore' with links or something would do.\n\n(EDIT: It's not just Cassiopeia who has this problem, I'm just using her as an example. I first noticed it because I couldn't find Ahri's stray fox lore)\n\n(Oh and something I just found out: while there is a title bar you can use to go from champion pages straight to the region section, there isn't such a bar in the region section for some reason.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TBakes","date":"2016-11-21T15:32:47.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't there a time element to the League universe?
