I could use idk, Mundo and Caitlyn as an example aswell. The thing is that Lux's SG skin is a very recent one. Yes 1 year doesn't seem that recent but you must know that Ultimate skins are normally developed for 1 year before they get released. So they basically gave her 2 skins at the same time, 1 of which is an Ultimate. I mean did they not have faith in the SG skin's quality?\n\nMeanwhile, to throw the obvious bias in, Janna's Forecast skin is pretty good but i feel like that's the only Janna skin  you can actually call a skin since the others are ridiciulously low quality. Especially Tempest since it makes her appear even more naked and that's a Legacy skin.
