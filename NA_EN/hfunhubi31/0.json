It has been awhile since nocturne got any love, so why not try to tweak him a bit.\n\nI agree that he does need some tweaking but he has had like 3 or 4 buffs this season, I imagine he's on riots radar but this meta just isn't healthy for him.\n\nDuelists out duel him (especially in a devourer fight, new sated is good on him, better on others) tanks out tank him (if he goes that route) and most junglers have better gank potential. He's been in the LCS like twice so far, I feel the biggest reason that he sees play is because he's still probably the best diver in the game and with Shen coming back into favor, expect to see a bit more of Noct as those two together are amazing, his other use is the first part of his ult, vision denial in a team fight is colossal.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Taredom","date":"2015-07-21T03:12:34.441+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good lord I hope so, I know a fair bit of the community is on the same boat.\n\nThe primary changes suggested would be to allow Duskbringer to let Nocturne walk through terrain (I recommended moving it's range to a 2/3rd scale of what it is now but drastically increasing his MS while in it) as well as increasing his Paranoia range at all ranks and maybe making it so that when you use it, you have the AD bonuses from Duskbringer when you land.\n\nI actually just thought of another cool one, I've been using his Paranoia lately in team fights for the vision denial, how cool would it be if after using his ult, it applied the Duskbringer bonuses to you while Paranoia is still going and for one second after the dash?\n\nHe also suffers from a problem that Xin does as well, his cc has a ramp up time (Xin being his Three Talon Strike taking three hits and Nocturne being his Unspeakable Horror takes two seconds of being tethered to fear.) While I'm not certain that it would be in any way a good idea to give him an instant CC (despite a shit ton of other junglers having them + AoE) I do feel like it needs some sort of change as a 465 (?) tether range feels abysmal.","replies":[{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2015-07-21T12:13:32.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well his cc needs counterplay that's why it was nerfed 4 or 5 times, and i'm ok with this, enemies need a way to deal with him and that's why again the shield duration was nerfed.\n\nwhat i'm not ok is paranoia range at lvl 2 and 3, lvl 1 was nerfed because you couldn't ward against him why the range at lvl 3 is so small? you can give him a global range at lvl 3 and he won't be broken.

He definitely does not need a rework as his current kit is more than enough to take down many champions. I find him very fun to play in the current meta. He doesn't need huge buffs or even a gameplay rework, just something to help him be more......... Ghostly... I guess is the word. Frankly, I find all his abilities to be very good. All except for the spell shield. You would think that a spell shield on an assassin wouldn't work, but on Nocturne, it works very well. My only problem with it, is that the duration is very short and many people often mispredict when an ability will hit. To reward successful blocks, it should either... A) give him a movement speed boost in addition to doubling attack speed. This way, you can keep up to your target while getting the tether off, or B) give him protections for a short while on successful block, or C) to reflect a small percentage of damage back on a successful block, or D) allow it explode in a small radius around nocturne when it blocks an ability, dealing damage, and slowing for a short period of time. \n\nNow, I'm all for giving him the moving through terrain with the Q, but that gives him incredible mobility in the early game, so it would have to be a passive attached to his ultimate. That way, by level 6, you can level your ult and start chasing down those pesky mobility champs. \n\nI'm not down for increasing the range of his ult. As it is, you can still successfully gank someone that is out of position. That's what it's used for. I don't want people to start seeing it as a way of zoning. I don't want him to become Blitzkrank. Everyone is too scared to push the wave or even make a risky play like going for the dragon. Being able to ult from anywhere makes for a boring gameplay. It punishes way too easy. \n\nNocturne is a great overall champion that is actually in a very great spot as of now. He's fun to play and teaches everyone not to overextend. He might need a few tweaks, but I would never recommend a full rework. I want him to stay LOL's best diver.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-07-21T15:23:03.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you.
