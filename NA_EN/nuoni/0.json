Every time I clicked on redeem, the website refreshed instantly and restarts the quiz.\r\nA week ago I used a different browser, redeemed the icon again, the page did not refresh and when I took the quiz again, it stated I already redeemed the icon. OK nice.\r\n\r\nBut now that I took the quiz again (5 min ago), it's no longer mentioned that I already redeemed the icon and it confuses me like crazy. I really want that icon because I love the look of it. Any help would be appreciated because I'm running out of ideas (and time to take the quiz).","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-19T15:23:20.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the site says that you've already redeemed the icon, then you're all set.  Just make sure you were logged into the intended account during that time.  It can take a few days to receive the icons, and some may get it before others.  Make sure that you are accessing the site from your specific region.  You may need to log out entirely, then  login through your region's league site.  Go to the star guardian page from there, and that should clear up any odd refreshes or errors.\n\nIf you haven't received your icon after a week, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can see what's going on.  Hang tight until then!","replies":[{"poster":"Nuoni","date":"2016-10-19T16:34:00.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the swift reply! I didn't know about the region specific sites. It told me the icon was already redeemed so I'll wait for it to show up soon :)","replies":[]}]}]}
