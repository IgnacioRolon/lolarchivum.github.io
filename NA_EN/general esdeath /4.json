When you consider that League of Legends has over 100 million monthly players, and the average player is going to play 1-2 games per day or so, you're looking at billions of monthly games. What percent of games do you think have at least one report issued (valid or not)? 10%? 20%? Personally I'd say probably 1/4 games has **some** form of report issued by **someone** - not me, but someone else reporting someone. I think that's really low still, but 25%. So you're looking at 250 million reports per month. There's 730 hours in a month. Simple division says you're looking at over 340,000 (340 thousand) reports per hour.\n\nYou're never going to find numbers that are exact, and there is nothing to say that my estimation can be proven to be better than Subdue's. However, when you look at it logically, 1000 was picked as a round number that is very easy to work with. You're looking at potentially **1000 times that estimate** at even a best case scenario.\n\nFurthermore, doubling the wages to account for overhead is... very naive and inaccurate. Overhead will cost different depending on the number of people it's for. If you have 500 people, your overhead costs per employee are likely to be lower than if you have 5,000 people all in one place - because it costs more to have more people in one place (building size matters). If all you're going to do is to fictionally and without logic say \"let's double it\" instead of providing actual reasoning, then there's no reason anyone should listen to you.\n\n****\n\nYou keep talking about  \"billion dollar company\" - but where does this money go? Riot makes a billion or two in **revenue** each year. Revenue does not mean profit - it means money brought in before taking out overhead and other expenses. Riot operates 20+ offices throughout the world, each likely costing (in land/mortgage, power/water, local taxes/fees, etc) around $50,000 per year - so you're looking at a couple million just from the office buildings themselves. They have 2500 employees - if we assume an average wage of $20 per hour you're looking at over 100 million just in wages. Contracts for benefits such as healthcare insurance likely range in the 25-50 million range altogether (benefits can be anywhere from 25-50% of what the actual wages paid to the employee are). Riot has to pay contractors for various things that aren't handled by their own employees. They have to pay for software/hardware licenses for their computers. They have to buy and maintain server and internet equipment. They have to pay the internet itself.\n\nSo no, Riot does not have billions in **expendable profits** every year - so stop spouting this off. Even if it *was* financially feasible, that's not to say it *should* be done.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Subdue","date":"2019-12-25T22:55:31.432+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=General Esdeath ,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=yiy0ElXu,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-12-25T22:37:58.479+0000)\n>\n> oh my bad I didn't realize this billion dollar company couldn't afford 11 million dollars in labor.

That's a fraction of the actual number, and it already results in 11 million annually, on wages alone.  At any given time there are 8 million people playing league of legends, or about 800,000 games per hour (actually a little more since the average game takes less than an hour).  If only 1% of games has a report, that's still 8,000 reports per hour.  If it's a more realistic 5% of games that have a report, that's 40,000 reports per hour.

But some of them are alt. accounts. So we don't have the exact numbers.\n\nThere is also the issue that the work load does not reduce. X part of the 80 million are the same people who continue being toxic over _multiple accounts_. Riot bans accounts but not the people playing them. So the 'X' part of the 80 million is going to remain consistent and this work load will not reduce unless some of these people decide to stop playing the game after being banned on their accounts. As a result, manual labor is not going to come into play anytime soon. All they can do is deal with this using their current scan system and # of reports accumulated before being reviewed. \n\nRiot's choice presently is to continue allowing these toxic players who have been banned on their former accounts to continue playing the game. But is that the better option? The X number does contribute to faster Q times, even matchmaking but to what point is this tolerable? In exchange, they are continuing to deal with potential toxicity and poor gaming experience for the 9 other players. \n\nThere there is also the fact that these banned players learn to take advantage of loopholes. Whether on accident or learning from others. For example, griefing. Intentionally feeding but not making it obvious. Saying stuff that isn't ZT but intentionally misspelling some racist slurs to get their idea across. Or even being vulgar in a way that isn't punished. \n\nOverall, OP. Manually reviewing reports will probably not be in their agenda anytime soon unless they start banning people from playing their games for a fixed period of time. Because, no matter how much $ they dish out, they aren't reducing the toxicity because these people have free reign to keep returning. All they are doing is facilitating the handing out of appropriate punishments so this turns into a long drawn tug-of-war on whether the player behind the banned account is now reformed. Whether he refuses to reform and then quits after his 7th banned account etc.\n\nI also noticed that the basic age for playing League is 13 or older. Do you expect someone younger than 18 to be able to keep their mouths in check? Or even adults. Maturity doesn't really have an age limit but most of these young kids wouldn't exactly be able to control their emotions. Most of the 'I got banned back when I was 13-17 years old- and want to get my perma. banned account back' threads make me question this age limit. Of-course, Riot probably has no way to know someones exact age behind their accounts. But this was just another observation.\n\nI think that they need to drive the idea that winning is important out of the community's mindset. Most of the arguments etc. happen when someone misplays and it makes one think, \"Now we might lose!\" Its better to ingrain a mindset like, \"Enjoying the game is more important.\" Because, winning is so important. There are even friends who refuse to play with each other after a few years. I saw a thread the other day where some guy was talking about his friend claiming that he was 'cursed' and would always break his win streak.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2019-12-25T22:57:13.808+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"they could at least pay a student 1 pizza a day for a working client...","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2019-12-25T23:05:07.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"$15 an hour?
