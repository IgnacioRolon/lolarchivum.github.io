Riot, you gotta stop trying to make everyone some unique thing. Some champs can fill the same roles and be better in some fields than others. We don't need a hip new unique tank buster that does massive true damage with an aoe heal ({{champion:114}}) or a \"versatile\" burst mage with utility in the forms of a snare, a shield, a speed buff, and an aoe TF ult for his team ({{champion:13}}).","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2017-04-05T06:15:30.669+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"{{champion:122}} was an improvement\n{{champion:19}} was amazing\n{{champion:114}} was an improvement\n{{champion:3}} is amazing\n{{champion:104}} was successful \n{{champion:78}} was amazing\n{{champion:134}} was successful\n{{champion:161}} was successful\n{{champion:45}} was successful \nMage Rework - Successful\n\nyou can't just cherry-pick friendo\n\nif you're going to hold each class rework accountable for their initial effects, that'd be unfair.

The heal made him more frustrating to play against and they funneled a lot of his damage into his new 5-stacks bloodrage passive.\n* Graves' rework wasn't \"successful,\" considering he was perfectly fine and highly viable as an adc already.  It ripped him out of the adc role and turned him into an overtuned jungler that has been a balancing nightmare.\n* Vel'Koz is still just a poke support.\n* Veigar was only \"successful\" in the fact that they returned the power he lost when he was GUTTED as \"compensation\" for DFG being removed from the game.\n* Mage Rework was a failure, I've never known anyone to claim otherwise.\n* Sona rework was literally a list of over 30 simultaneous nerfs.  It was sooo bad, Fearless intentionally hid the kit's numbers from the patch notes, the champ update news and even her champ page for the entire 2 years until 6.14.  Patch 4.13 made Sona the weakest support in the game & she's still considered a troll pick to this day.\n* Season 5 jungle rework, probably the biggest travesty this game has ever seen.  Fearless made jungling so impossible, barely 2 or 3 champs in the entire game could even perform the role.  It took constant tweaks, nerfs and buffs throughout the entire season to undo that shit.\n* Season 6 jungle rework, massive failure.  Rito undid all of the previous year's worth of effort fixing the jungle and only to allow Fearless to pull the exact same shit all over again and it took months to fix this time.\n* Meddler stated last week that all class reworks have been failures.  Every single one has created more issues than they solved.\n* Fearless also worked on the juggernaut update, which Meddler specifically called a failure.\n\nNotice how Fearless has been involved with a large number of these failures.  You won't find his name on a single successful rework.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DonnieDarkin","date":"2017-04-05T16:33:02.394+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Graves is cancer.
