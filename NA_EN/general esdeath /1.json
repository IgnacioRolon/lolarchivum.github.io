Can the system NOT detect them? Does it take time? Because I&#039;d understand like 20 minutes, but 7 days? And I doubt nobody reported that person. In my game they asked for a role swap, got it, inted mid, and then sold their items to buy 2 mobi boots and run down bot. Come on Riot, how you gonna do me dirty like this? If the system can&#039;t do it that fast, I&#039;ll gladly look at reports by players.

I was a toxic player, i admit that, but i stopped after a 14 day ban, stopped even mostly talking at all in game. But then a single game, where i had a support that inted 3 times in bot lane then went afk, where the jungler literally decided it was better to finish the  enemy raptors instead of help me and counter gank, when i was running right to him, then say \"I was there dude\", and later int for the rest of the game, and trap us in the game after our top laner went afk as well. Like literally run into 5 people every time he spawned, and refuse to surrender. Where the other team responded to me asking them to just push mid and end because of our 2 afk players, and our inting jungler, by hunting me down anywhere i went for the rest of the game, and refusing to end. This ridiculous game, i got reported by the other team for just wanting the game to end, and i got an instant permanent ban, From One SIngle game, when i had literally stopped talking to people because it wasnt worth losing my account. Riot only cared about their automatic system and takes it as gospel, when more likely than not, now in todays community you are going to get reported more likely for playing bad than actual toxicity. I have submitted a ticket and sent response after response, my ticket has been pushed to a second person now and all i get is a cut and paste response from someone who refusus to actually watch the game and see what was going on. Riot really doesnt care about what their system is doing, how bad it is, the way it enables toxic players who know how to bend the system.
