Sure, maybe she has counters but people feel like shit playing against her, therefore I do think she still needs a kneecapping.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LegacyDAP","date":"2019-04-25T05:16:50.225+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like how only 2 of the champions you mentioned counter her (Renekton and Yorick.) Not only that but they don't even have a great winrate against her, it's like 51% against her. Man that lane must be so tough for Riven.\n\nRiven loses like 1 or 2 lanes, but honestly she doesn't really lose any lanes she just doesn't win all of them. I don't think Riot should nerf Riven per say, but they should definitely nerf conqueror and see where she ends up after that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"haaaaaaalp","date":"2019-04-25T15:25:50.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because no matter how many game someone decides to play on a champion, it will be insignificant compared to the hundreds of thousands of games that sites like lolalytics or league of graphs compile on a weekly basis.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RR8Rosie","date":"2019-04-25T05:23:49.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have never played riven, but as long as you know what you are doing get her early game, and then scale above her. \nI sound like a pro but I'm not I just pay attention to champs and match ups.
