Anyway, onto the point of this post; Riot, I'm liking all the new games, and the changes coming to League certainly look interesting, but you REALLY need to improve your Instant Feedback System. I know no system is perfect but this is just out of control sometimes. I had a Nocturne in my game flame his top lane and drop the \"kys\", and reported him (Gonna ignore the racial slur because I know for a fact kys has been discussed before several times). Now, I assume the IFS takes about 5 minutes to punish someone. Maybe 10 if there's a lot of reports coming in at once, so I feel players can probably sneak into another game before their ban. However...\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3L5lwqj.png\n\nThis guy was still playing even after another 30 minutes had passed. I don't know exactly what's wrong with this system but I've seen a LOT of people use \"zero tolerance\" phrases without punishment. Someone here once said they think the IFS needs 2 uses of it, but that's not exactly zero tolerance. But OK, typos can happen, trying to call someone fat but your finger slips and suddenly you're being homophobic. But what's the case here? I can't see accidentally typing \"kys\", and there's 2 things here that should trigger the system. I've seen chat logs here with 1 use of zero tolerance phrases (not sure if I'm allowed to link other player's threads on this matter or not. Not gonna search up old threads if they're not allowed either). \n\nObviously we need a separate system for trolls, and I'd fully support live person review (pitchforks away everyone), but the current IFS is easier to fix in my opinion. So Riot Games (adding the S because you finally have more than 1 game), please review and fix this system. Thank you for reading this. I've seen more Riot employee activity on boards, Reddit, and in game. So please, take this chance to bring it up to someone, or at least be more open about what's wrong with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-10-16T05:48:45.009+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I know no system is perfect but this is just out of control sometimes.

Errors are going to happen and people are going to get away, unfortunately.

Remember that:\n\n- Consistent manual reviews are out of the question.\n\n- AFKing isn't always done with malicious intent. Some people have IRL emergencies, technical issues, or more pressing matters to attend to.\n\n- You can't label someone as an intentional feeder if they're not... well, **intentionally** feeding. Playing poorly isn't an offense, you can't label someone as a feeder or troll by just their death count alone.\n\n- If you're too strict with labeling people as intentional feeders, you'll drive players away (and wrongfully take their money) and if you're too lenient with them, people will complain that you're not holding players accountable.\n\n- You can't label someone as a griefer or troll just because they're doing something their team disagrees with. Something like AP Lucian mid or roaming Teemo support is not inherently malicious, the person's _intent_ and what they actually do is what matters. \n\n- Some chat messages can be taken out of context or have alternate meanings. It's not as simple as adding a word to a checklist.\n\nSo, knowing all of those stipulations, how would you easily improve the system?","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2019-10-16T06:10:12.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hotarµ,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=t9THwMYE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-10-16T05:48:45.009+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, that is punishable and should be met with an instant 14-day ban (or worse, IMO.) \n> \n>  The problem is that no automated system is perfect.

Whether it's actually giving you 3 strikes or if it can be evaded by replacing a letter with a number, Riot needs to take a look at it. I don't think it's been touched since 2017.","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-10-16T06:25:34.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Can't, if you report in game and then send a ticket you get a message from Blitzcrank bot.
