Don't play broken meta champs, and it is easy. Hell, I got S even on Ahri 5 times in a row.. It's easy to get S and get chest. The only problem people have are their champion pools, because you need to earn S on multiple champions to get more chests.

I rarely get key fragments, but I get plenty of chests when I play. I usually sit around 4-6 chests at a time, but rarely to I ever get any key frags to open them. Perhaps after two weeks of playing I'll get a key fragment, but the drop rate is so inconsistent that I'll go months without getting a single fragment as well. Sometimes I'm super lucky and get maybe 1-2 fragments in a week. But getting that third usually takes another 1-2 weeks for me of playing. I don't have as much time to play every day as I used to, but on the weekends I generally like to play 3-4 games a day depending on what time I can get on :) \n\nIt would be great if I could use IP to buy keys. While I don't have everything yet to buy IP wise, I still like the idea of Hextech and want to keep using it.

Now we have a way to earn \"premium\" items without spending money. Essentially riot gains nothing from you playing matches 24/7 since they don't advertise during games, so \"how could they profit from a increased play?\" Well dear forum member, to frustrate you into buying rp. \nBy creating an avenue through which free to play players can \"unlock legendary and epic skins through dedication\" but then almost immediately defeating the purpose by causing the drop rates to parabolically decline as you earn each key fragment (not to mention placing a cap on how many chests you can earn) riot pisses players off to generate profit. \nNow, you may wonder \"how is an emotion more lucrative than a virtual currency?!?\". Well here's the thing some free to play players ACTUALLY can't afford or are unable to buy rp, HOWEVER some just don't want to but have to ability to. Rather than pissing off the entire group of Influence point saturated players ,or allow a sharp drop in their profit margins, riot decided to go with option three and somewhat satiate the desires of their broke player base while tapping into the wallets of previously free to play players. \n*It's a Summary THANK GOD am I right*\nTo sum all that up. The heavily restrictive chest drop archetype aims to:\n-Increase player activity (secondary goal)\n-Allow free to play players to feel like they have the ability to equal paid players \n-Convert more players into paid members \n-Create a new market of RP items \n-Seem like a responsive company (promote their image among the league community as a caring entity instead of one that just wants your wallet)\n-And I guess move some discussion away from broken champs while they attempt to fix them\n\nI'm not saying this was a bad move on riot's behalf, because honestly it's still the only way to earn skins without spending actual money. This is just my attempt to reason out they mentality behind this system. \n\nAlso I don't think it would be a smart idea *for riot* to allow for the purchase of keys or key fragments through influence points. Not because it would hurt profit, any decision making the player happy has the potential to hurt profit. But rather because, the insanely high price they would undoubtedly have to place on key fragments to keep them from damaging their to profits, which would consequently piss off players in a way less ideal than causing them to buy rp. Instead of causing players spend rp on the skin they want and then go back to playing, this could cause players to take a break from league all together as they would feel riot just sees them as a wallet ripe for harvest and not a \nplayer. \n\n~~~~~~~~~Suggestions~~~~~~~~~\nI instead suggest Riot to:\nA:increase key fragment drop rates or decrease the rate at which drop rates decline\nB; Add a card like loot which has a chance to drop at the end of any match and can be crafted to create a skin, or at the very least the skin shard\nC: Do whatever the hell you guys want because we're all honestly you're slaves until we acquire sentience and stop playing league/ stop bringing dishonor to our bloodlines\n\n*this comment could have no merit and I could just be a rambling fool*","replies":[]},{"poster":"TyroneWatermelon","date":"2016-08-22T10:46:56.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I bet 10â‚¬ to each person that replies to this comment,that Riot will never make this feature","replies":[{"poster":"LurkerLZ","date":"2016-12-13T15:59:45.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll take that offer.
