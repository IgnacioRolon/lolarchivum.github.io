Anyway, I went on over to the JP league site, made an account, downloaded the client and all that. But whenever I try to login on that server/account it just comes up with an error message (which is in japanese and I can't read) but I know I am putting in the right login info because when I type in the wrong password, its a different error message. I have tried switching servers on my NA client, and I have tried using the JP client I downloaded but its the same error. Anyone have any advice?\n\nTL;DR I made a Japan server account and can't login to the client, please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-07T23:06:18.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you know it's a different message than the incorrect password one, it's like to be the network connection error message instead =\\ . This might be related to how your connection is being routed, so do me a quick favor and try running through the steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as some basic troubleshooting.
