Like I get I was tilted, but 25 games????? I wonder what my mid laners punishment was when he was purposely tilting me and dragging the game on to get his \"30 minute XP bonus\". \r\nP.S. the \"im trolling\" comment was clearly a joke so don't start blaming me for stuff you have no context about lol. \r\nP.P.S. This is the only game I was punished for. I usually get honors every game.\r\n\r\nSomeone shed some light here. If this is truly \"worthy\" of a 25 game chat restriction in the communities eyes I guess I'll go play another game that isn't tailored to literal 8 year olds. Maybe I'll go play Fortnite or something thats tailored for 10 year olds. \r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nPre-Game\r\nSchizo Skarner: should i teemo top lul\r\nSchizo Skarner: yeah that singed pick locked me in lmaao\r\nIn-Game\r\nSchizo Skarner: riot bad\r\nSchizo Skarner: fuck riot\r\nSchizo Skarner: minions op\r\nSchizo Skarner: cry me a river im trolling\r\nSchizo Skarner: HUR HUR HUR\r\nSchizo Skarner: ur so funny bro\r\nSchizo Skarner: telling enemy player hes bad\r\nSchizo Skarner: youre so good man\r\nSchizo Skarner: hes super aggro\r\nSchizo Skarner: free kill\r\nSchizo Skarner: if jungler wants to jungle\r\nSchizo Skarner: i wonder if ill ever get a gank lmao\r\nSchizo Skarner: only being shoved under turret all gmae and all\r\nSchizo Skarner: singed is broken af\r\nSchizo Skarner: lmfao\r\nSchizo Skarner: diving my turret taking no dmg\r\nSchizo Skarner: doing 1000000000 dmg\r\nSchizo Skarner: and of course the toxic team\r\nSchizo Skarner: i forgot asking for a gank is being toxic?\r\nSchizo Skarner: ive officially been ganked more than he has lmao\r\nSchizo Skarner: lol\r\nSchizo Skarner: singed literally one shot me at lvl 3\r\nSchizo Skarner: so\r\nSchizo Skarner: how do u cancel teleport\r\nSchizo Skarner: yeah u can\r\nSchizo Skarner: since when?/\r\nSchizo Skarner: i havent played since season 6 so\r\nSchizo Skarner: cool\r\nSchizo Skarner: youre so good bro\r\nSchizo Skarner: is that what u wanna hear?\r\nSchizo Skarner: illl boost your ego with a chapm ive never played\r\nSchizo Skarner: u prob need the ego boost\r\nSchizo Skarner: ????\r\nSchizo Skarner: singed is talking mad trash to me\r\nSchizo Skarner: ype\r\nSchizo Skarner: yasuo logic here: *sees top laner getting trash talked by his opponent*\r\nSchizo Skarner: *teammate talks abck to his opponent* \"Teammate wtf is wrong with you bro see a therapist\r\nSchizo Skarner: i said singed is op\r\nSchizo Skarner: how is that talking shit?\r\nSchizo Skarner: so because i said his champ is op that gives him the right to talk about how bad of a player i am?\r\nSchizo Skarner: LOL\r\nSchizo Skarner: man\r\nSchizo Skarner: youre a great teammate yas\r\nSchizo Skarner: this yasuo so toxic\r\nSchizo Skarner: 30 minute cut off is not a thign\r\nSchizo Skarner: ....\r\nSchizo Skarner: alright guys guess well play the extra 5 minutes just so yasuo can get his +4 xp\r\nSchizo Skarner: yasuo why do you not stick up for your teammates man?\r\nSchizo Skarner: you realize you tilted me 10x harder than singed did?\r\nSchizo Skarner: idk man yasuo is a really mean teammate\r\nSchizo Skarner: yasuo, i dont get why you keep looking down on peoples attitudes when youre the one who is trash talking your teammate and tilting him?\r\nSchizo Skarner: you cant win games and get to high elo by tilting your own teammates\r\nSchizo Skarner: and u wonder\r\nSchizo Skarner: u need to learn that tilting your teammates is a guaranteed way to lose\r\nSchizo Skarner: yasuo wants to win but tries to tilt his teammates on purpose lol i dont udnerstnad that logic whatsoever\r\nSchizo Skarner: ggwp guys\r\nSchizo Skarner: sorry about yasuo\r\nPost-Game\r\nSchizo Skarner: GG &lt;3\r\nSchizo Skarner: i agree yi lol\r\nSchizo Skarner: its sad\r\nSchizo Skarner: you ok singed?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-09-21T20:02:55.530+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, it has come to this: someone displayed misbehavior in a LoL match in flagrant disregard for the game's rules, ToS, EULA, and Summoner's Code. That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it. If this misbehavior happened in chat (including emotes or ping) and they don't respond positively to a _single, courteous, constructive request to focus on the game_, your best option is to mute that player. Submit a report after the match. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by asking them to keep it down and then notifying library staff and moving to another area.\n\n_Do not respond with misbehavior of your own!_ If you do that, your teammates may mute and report _you_, and those reports would be valid. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it. I'm sure you're familiar with the \"s/he started it\" trope, where two children get into an argument or fight and then try to claim innocence of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didn't instigate it. As any parent, teacher, or other supervisor of children will tell you, that excuse doesn't fly. When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem. Making faces at him or shouting at him has never been a good way to get him to stop, and it makes you just as guilty of that as he.\n\nRiot doesn't care who started it. Someone else's misbehavior does not justify your own.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> * Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n> * Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nIf you misbehave but a teammate or opponent does or says something even worse, you should definitely report them after the match, just as someone reported you for your own misbehavior. Yes, that's certainly possible. Reports are not a limited resource. Any time someone believes that another player violated LoL's behavioral standards, they can report that player. Punishments are similarly not limited: if more than one player in a game merits a punishment, they can both get a punishment. This can happen even if the players in question were antagonizing each other. The IFS doesn't need to weigh the severity of all reported players' actions and then \"award\" the \"winner\" with a punishment; it's not a contest.\n\nThink of it like dealing with a noisy person in a library: ask them to keep it down, and then notify library staff and move to another area if that doesn't work. If you get into a shouting match with them, you're just as likely to be removed, even if you weren't shouting _quite_ as loudly as they were. The goal is a quiet library.\n\nIn a perfect and just world, everyone who deserved a punishment would get one. In reality, it is possible for some punishable behavior to go unpunished. First, punishments in LoL can only occur after a valid report. Second, punishments take into account the consistency and severity of the punished player's misbehavior: if two players in a match break the same rule in the same way, one who consistently misbehaves in this way might get a punishment while the other who almost never does so gets away without a punishment (this time). At the end of the day, though, all this does is explain how differences in player behavior over many games can produce different results for equivalent behavior within a single game. It doesn't excuse poor behavior. One person having a rare bad day doesn't give a consistently toxic player the right to join in. The only behavior that matters in your punishment is your own... and a good thing, too: how would you feel if you behaved yourself but got punished anyway just because all your teammates were spectacularly friendly, communicative, and positive?\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025054153-Understanding-Your-Temporary-Account-Ban):\n\n> We can not discuss other players’ actions with you but you can always report them at end of game and mute them when in game. There is no excuse for raging back or responding to people trying to get you to tilt. You are the only one responsible for your actions and your words which is what we are trying to address with these bans.\n\nYour opinion of the rules is of zero relevance. When a cop stops you for going 40 in a 25 zone, you can claim \"I think the limit should be 45 here\" all you want. You're still getting a ticket. If a librarian asks you to keep your voice down while you use the facilities, shouting that libraries should be loud will simply get you escorted out. If you go to a friend's house who insists that you remove your shoes while you're in their home, \"that's a stupid rule and I do what I want\" will lose you a friend. If you are using someone else's services, facilities, equipment, etc., you abide by their rules or you deal with the consequences. If you think the rules should change, that is a completely different conversation (and I wouldn't give a plugged nickel for your chances at convincing Riot to change their rules to allow behavior like yours).\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024051193-Understanding-Different-Ban-Types-FAQs):\n\n> We work with the overall community and within our own company guidelines to identify what disruptive behavior is and what the consequences for those behaviors should be. We understand that it can be difficult to know where the line is, which is why we provide chat logs and we have a few tiers in the ban process in order to allow for you to learn and grow.\n\nYou spent a lot of time in that match harassing your teammate. That's not what chat is for. If you believe someone is breaking the rules, report them after the match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emperor Talquin","date":"2019-09-21T17:54:52.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having a negative attitude is enough for chat bans, usually not enough for instant 2 week ban tho. \n\nObviously i can't see what the other player has typed, but two wrongs don't make a right.
