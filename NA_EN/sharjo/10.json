Kled fits the personality and attitude of what I envisioned that character to be in my head perfectly. There is nothing wrong with off-meta supports (and to the guy who mentioned support Sion, I've done it and it's fun as hell), but as an actual support main  (yes we exist) I scrutinize champions very thoroughly on what they can actually bring to a team comp in my preferred role. \n\nWhat does Kled bring to the bot lane? A resounding meh, novelty and maybe a few cheeky roaming ganks once you hit 6 but not much else. You don't have the gold income as a support to build AD (which Kled scales off of) and your bonus health only applies to the mount. Without any form of hard crowd control in his kit he really just doesn't bring anything worth having as a support.\n\nIt's a fun idea, and it's cute, but it won't work. Don't let that stop you from messing around with it if you want, far be it from me to tell anyone what they can and cannot do, just don't expect much from it.","replies":[{"poster":"AFK Push","date":"2016-07-26T22:53:38.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you are saying man, no harm.
