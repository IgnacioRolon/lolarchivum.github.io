I thought there was a bit much of the \"made up words to make the setting unique\" trope towards the beginning, but it settles down and it gets far better in that department.  The characters were great, the flow felt really good despite changing viewpoints, which is tricky to do in a story like this, where everything is happening so quickly.  I enjoyed the hell out of it.\n\nTaliyah's a better character than I thought she was.  I don't like her ingame VO too much, she felt kinda generic, but her character is very well portrayed here, she's got an almost Braum-level compassion to her, and she stood up to the giant Jackal man.\n\nSivir, again, bores me in game, but she was great in this.  Clearly getting stabbed has taken away zero of her snark, which is fantastic.\n\nNasus is one of my favorite League characters, and this was a different sort of characterization than I was used to.  Nasus is usually so serene, but when the shit hits the fan, he can clearly be a force of nature.  And I really liked seeing that.  I also love that he's basically an old man grumbling to himself about these whippersnappers and how they can't respect the good ol' Shurimas.\n\nI think we can erase any doubts about Xerath having remorse.  He's in full on \"cackle as I lob meteors into a town\" mode, Veigar would be proud.  Still, the descriptions of his powers and the way he moves, being...a sarcophagus and all, were just top notch.  I've written a story with Xerath in it and I kinda struggled to go beyond \"uh he shoots blue lightning at a dude????\", but this was really good, and made him READ like the demigod wizard he is in Lore.\n\nOverall, my only two real complaints are that it didn't really drop us any big new plot elements like Burning Tides did, (Yeah, Nasus and Renekton are going to fight, Xerath is a bastard, we knew that.), and that it looks like there won't be a sequel.  At least for a while.  Still, I loved it, and I'm looking forward to whatever comes up next.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pyrodinium","date":"2016-05-31T18:51:11.868+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":">\"The caravan master advised against traveling farther south, but Taliyah told her that her family needed her, and there were no more warnings.\"\n\nThe whole story is awesome, but this little tidbit goes a long way in illustrating how important family is for Shurimans.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2016-06-01T03:01:53.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pyrodinium,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=kaLOLWJk,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2016-05-31T18:51:11.868+0000)\n>\n> The whole story is awesome, but this little tidbit goes a long way in illustrating how important family is for Shurimans.\n\nYeah, that was one of my favorite lines in the piece.
