How exactly does one kill one of those menacing sea creatures?\n\nThe thing that terrifies me is - they likely go after them at night.\n\n_\"Fleets leave port at sunset each night, seeking these mighty beasts.\"_\n\nI'm not familiar with the background, but what can it mean that it's easier/safer/better to hunt them at night, than it is during the day?  Do they glow?    Do they get less violent at night?  Do they surface once the sun goes down??","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2015-08-27T06:30:43.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me it sounds as if they are nocturnal. During day they rest deep down on the bottom of the sea, and at night they surface to hunt and eat (maybe to mate?). You just can't capture them by day. I struggle to find another sensible reason to prefer going out at night :/","replies":[{"poster":"Ant in Oz","date":"2015-08-27T17:33:37.223+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is pretty much what we were thinking. We took inspiration from all the terrifying creatures in the deep, abyssal darkness of our own oceans that rise closer to the surface at night to feed, and things like squid, who mainly hunt at night. Squid fishermen go out at night and use lights to lure them to the surface - we figured that certain types of sea monster could lured be up in similar (though much more terrifying) fashion.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-08-28T00:52:26.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess that ties in with the Serpent Callers; the Slaughter Fleets need them to draw out the sea monsters in to the open where they can be properly dispatched.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-08-27T16:31:56.572+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd assume that they go by night because the monsters are more manageable then. If you consider that the majority of sea creatures are day goers then the same can be inferred for the serpents, krakens and whatever else. In the day navigating certain parts of the sea is likely impossible because of the sheer number of sea beasts, and potentially the fleets hunt by ambushing them while they sleep. I mean if you think about it:\n\n- If you hunt in the day you risk having more sea monsters attack you\n- They'll see you coming\n- Other monsters might be attracted to \"blood in the water\" so to speak\n\nWhere as at night:\n\n- Monsters are asleep and there are fewer nocturnal ones, so less risk of multi-monster attacks\n- Because they're sleeping less risk of dead sea monsters attracting other predators.\n\nI'd assume that's why. Might be some cultural beliefs as well like \"The Bearded Lady sleeps in the depths at night, so we hunt her children then, lest we incur her wrath\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"MythicTwister","date":"2015-08-28T00:22:06.434+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it should be about how the sea monsters react to light. Maybe the ones that live deeper underwater have adapted sensitive eyes and don't come to the surface during the day because the sun deters them. Maybe a moonless night is the best time to set up a trap, lighting a luminous \"lure\" that mimics the light color or pattern of a bioluminescent mating dance, or the display of a prey fish. Either way, it conjures an exciting visual for a hunt with the slaughter fleet.\n\nImagine a choppy sea and a slew of ships, carefully and painstakingly navigated to maintain a circular formation. The sailors all work in total darkness, relying only the least amount of deck lighting possible to stay keep pace with the other vessels. The metal clad fleet is tied together by massive cables, holding a chemical lure in place that when lit, will attract a terribly denizen of the deep to breach the waters and face the pirate's waiting barrage of wicked harpoons and hot lead!\n\nI can almost see the seas sway and the hunters screaming, while a giant serpent thrashes in their midst, hooked and harassed while they try to blow out it's brains.

That'd give the proceedings a very ominous and threatening tint, making blood look much brighter than anything else.  Maybe it's ruby-windowed lanterns.  Maybe it's stained glass.  Expensive, and delicate, and covered in iron mesh to protect it when the inevitable blows from the monsters hit.\n\n(Also, don't think I didn't notice the bioluminescent comment there.
