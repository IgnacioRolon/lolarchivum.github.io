This is the song that plays when the heroes finally enter the mountain and descend into the forge: the clang of the hammer, the humming of Ornn. It's awe-inspiring.","replies":[{"poster":"Talondor","date":"2017-08-15T01:20:02.666+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"It makes me so happy that you heard the connection to, \"The Path to Hearth-Home\"!

They sound similar enough to the scandinavian languages, that it'd be interesting to see how close they get in written form.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lùmen","date":"2017-08-15T05:22:51.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kind of reminds me of Galio.
