It was also heavily implied that while Cho was content to follow the rules of the institute of war while he learned about runeterra, that he could break free from the league whenever he felt like it.

He no longer resides within the Void and doesn't have the ability to pass in and out whenever he sees fit. In addition to that, Aurelion Sol would've prior been aware of Cho'gath's presence, whereas his lore describes the presence within the void as something alien even to him.

I think some important points people have already mentioned but I'd like to expand on. \n\n-Firstly, the nature of Aurelion's imprisonment. He's stuck working for Targon or they(it?) kill his star children. We're not sure if it's simply blackmail or he is compelled to follow orders with dire consequences if he refuses through inaction or willful harm. He cares for each star like a child, but also almost like a piece of himself (like an artist cherishing their work). One thing that I feel really need to point out that I haven't seen people discuss yet though is that Aurelion is literally the antithesis of the void. He creates energy from nothing, and not just a little, he wills self-sustaining generators of pure heat and light into being with a flick of his hand. The void is like entropy, consuming everything that exists and giving nothing back, whether by need or some purpose is unclear. It seems pretty clear that Aurelion's greatest fear is that all of his works vanish from the sky, yes because they are his children and yes because existence would be less beautiful but I also think it may be because that's literally an unfathomable amount of matter just POOF gone. It's a victory for entropy. It may seem out there but when you consider a lot of Aurelion Sol's concept and lore is based off of not only astronomy but theoretical physics, the fact that entropy might have a lot to do with his motivation for star forging may not be so far-fetched.\n\n-Secondly, Aurelion has figured out HOW to rebuke the enchantment. He knows how it works, he knows there's a caveat and he's so confident of it he's literally risking the wellbeing of his children to put fear into the heart of Targon. Which may have something to do with the next point.\n\n-It's weird that Patheon's aspect literally kills Atreus to use his body, but Leona and Diana keep their personalities? Maybe the aspects behave differently, or maybe it does have to do with a shift in focus on how Targon plans to deal with the Void rifts, which seems to be their focus for Aurelion's imprisonment.\n\n-Finally, there are some very subtle clues as to who the voice in the rift is, and I do believe it is Cho'Gath. The first thing that Aurelion notices is the lack of mindlessness and purpose in the creature. It mocks Aurelion. Next little bit is conjecture here, so bear with. The voice doesn't seem too bothered by the fact that pantheon has literally called a celestial star dragon to close it's rift. It seems amused, almost like a cat toying with it's prey. Kind of like how Aurelion reacts to Pantheon telling him to close the rift. A sort of amusement at someone who has just signed their own death warrant. One thing I've noticed about what Riot consistently mentions with Cho lorewise is that he is scarily intelligent. He has some sort of knowledge we are not aware of that made him join the league in the first place and allow himself to be controlled by summoners. The idea that Cho toys with his prey is a theme that is repeated in his lines, he talks about keeping his captors alive for eternity to torment, he talks about the fact that, the webs we weave ARE tangled (whatever that means to him). His thinking is not only complex, but deliberately vague. All we know is that he's having fun while he's doing it. Also he had his spell icons sneakily changed about, REWERK CURNFURMED.{{champion:31}} \n\nThis whole thing just spits of lovecraft so much it hurts I love it so much, thank you lore team. This is the most I've ever been excited to discuss League lore.\n\nEdit: Reread twin dawns and have a revision to make. Apparently whatever is letting Aurelion weaken his bonds to Targon is on Runeterra. Not completely sure of what that power could be, but it could have something to do with mystery champ #2.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fayt Loki","date":"2016-03-10T20:12:59.973+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting to note that he wasn't enslaved through a trick exactly but a gift instead( I would be pretty annoyed if my gift I got from my fans enslaved me.) and that pretty much, current Targon is thanks to him.

I devoured each sentence of it and I revel in my catching of how he got himself \"tricked into servitude\".

These are what I got.\n\n---------------o---------------o---------------\n\nAurelion Sol is born with birth of lol universe, he is probably much older than Bard.\n\nHe is the creator of stars and he cares about his stars so much, he even accept to bown to Targon, rather than seeing death of his stars.\n\nAurelion Sol is controlled by a crowd that is magical. This crowd enforces Aurelion Sol to make everything that Targon says, if he doesn't, with every insubordination, a star dies. It gives him unimaginable emotional pain.\n\nThis case happens even before the Shurima's Fall, which is actually 1 millenium old in current timeline. So, Aurelion Sol is controlled by Targon for at least 1 millenium.\n\nSun Disc is builded by an unnamed emperor's command. \n\nShuriman magic is familiar to Aurelion Sol, which confirms ascended powers come from celestial magic if not exactly itself. There is highly chance they're using his corrupted version. We can also say arcane and celestial energy are 2 sides of a coin.\n\nShuriman Empire is the most advanced society of his time, confirmed by Aurelion Sol.\n\nThere is a huge Void Portal in Targon and Pantheon wants it locked. He commands Aurelion Sol for closing this portal but even Aurelion Sol admits and feel bad about this portal's energy. He figures out a really strong will and sense its power beyond this portal. This entity also laughes to him. Not something acceptable for Aurelion Sol, so that's why he gladly destroys the portal.\n\nPantheon was in a woman body before Atreus.\n\nMagic on Aurelion Sol gets weaker and weaker, so that's why Targon starts to be afraid of from himself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"L0ve Is Blue","date":"2016-03-26T04:05:55.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a portal to the void is near Targon with all those void references in the lores...","replies":[]}]}
