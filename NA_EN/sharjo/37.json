I do not care about the lore at all at this point. The lore has always been something mildly interesting that I read once or twice while waiting for a game to start. It's just not something that interests me. I'm complaining because something that does interest me, gameplay, was taken from me so that another group of people can have what they want. The lore did not require gangplank being disabled because they've established that the lore and league have been separated entirely. They disabled gangplank to make a few people feel good about lore, while ignoring the people who enjoy playing as him. I don't care about the new default gp because I already own skins for him. I don't care that they're hyping him up in the lore. What I do care about is that I've had my game play experience detracted from because people whined that the lore was disconnected from the game, so Riot did something incredibly stupid to show that they suddenly want the lore to be part of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Archenz","date":"2015-08-02T18:47:05.401+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":5,"body":"That's all very nice.

Your complaining that Riot disabled a champion from their game and that was totally unfair to you and the other few people who can't live for a week without the Gangplank.\n\nWell I'm going to be 100% honest with you, I don't care for anyone who complains because one champion out of 126 being disabled. Don't be selfish. The people who never get lore, got an amazing event and lots of happy lore.

Gameplay and lore are not mutually exclusive to each other. In fact, they are meant to enhance each other. That's why people got upset when they retconned the league of legends and made it so that your battles mean nothing. They told us that what happens in the world doesn't matter in the game, and that what happens in the game doesn't matter in the lore. I thought that was pretty dumb, and I don't even care about the lore.\n\nYou can have a cool event for the people who care, and you can have a stable game where the people who like playing the game can do that. Why can you only have one or the other? You guys are praising riot for integrating the lore into the game, but they've done it in an extremely irritating way. \n\nYes, I really only wanted to play gangplank this week. I only played when friends asked and to get the event icon. I'm not upset enough to quit playing the game, and I'm not upset enough to stop being a customer. I know he'll be back. I admit, for a moment at the beginning of the event, they almost had me interested in the lore. The story was interesting enough, and the world they were building was pretty cool. Then they killed gangplank and I was like, meh, he'll come back. Then they disabled him and I no longer cared about the lore at all. \n\nI understand there are a lot of champions. I own a hefty number of them. There is a reason I have played more games as gangplank than the other champions. I love playing as gangplank more than the other ones. I get less enjoyment out of the game when not playing as him, and I get really frustrated when people act like the event has gone perfectly when there are people out there that are genuinely upset and ignored.","replies":[{"poster":"Archenz","date":"2015-08-02T19:58:25.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well look at it this way.\n\nYou dont get to play Gangplank for 1-2 weeks.\n\nWell since the last Skarner rework, i basically didnt get to play the real Skarner, since the current Skarner is really just a gutted version of the old.
