{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-09-25T00:43:19.593+0000","title":"So Bilgewater needs a Saviour, but who might it be?","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":46,"down_votes":2,"body":"So Bilgewater&#039;s kinda screwed right now. Like super screwed. It&#039;s not even funny how screwed they are right now. Some of you may be asking yourself, why is that? Well allow me to give you a bit of context!\n\nBilgewater is located in the same sea as the Shadow Isles, and has been subject to some abuse from the land of the living dead in the form of the Harrowing. The Harrowing is an event that comes around every few years where the black mist reaches out across the sea from the Shadow Isles, carrying with it monstrous undead abominations. Now in the past these weren&#039;t of major concern to anyone, but in the last fifty years things have been heating up in ways no one in Bilgewater really wants.\n\nFifty years, ten harrowings, with each getting progressively further out in to the sea and coming ever closer to completely annihilating Bilgewater. To recap on how these events transpired, here&#039;s a link to &ldquo;First Light after the Harrowing&rdquo;, a bit of lore that was released following last year&#039;s night of terror.\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/special-event/first-light-after-harrowing\nhttp://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/2/2d/Black_Mist_Map.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141106011552\n\n**DISCLAIMER: Now I&#039;d like to elaborate on how this thing works because it&#039;s a bit unclear, but keep in mind this is how I personally understand this. I might have the wrong impression of how things are actually going on. **\n\nAs far as I can tell the Harrowings are listed in order of severity, ranked from the worst to the least impactful of the last fifty years, with the year denoting how long ago since the present day they have occurred. Now going by this, the last Harrowing was the tenth, with the three top Harrowings being separate parts of the same event:\n\nNautilus meets the Harrowing head on and stalls it, forcing its forces to split. Some go north and some go east.\nThe forces that went north arrive at Smuggler&#039;s Cove and reap it completely, leaving no survivors.\nThe forces that went east were met by a unified armada headed by Gangplank and Miss Fortune, who managed to somehow have negotiate a temporary armistice to protect Bilgewater. They repelled the Harrowing but at the cost of many, many lives.\n\nAgain, my interpretation might be wrong, and these might all be separate events occurring over the span of a few years, but regardless one thing remains the same: the last Harrowing was only repelled by a unified force of Bounty Hunters, Gangs and Pirates, headed by Bilgewater&#039;s most notable champions, and even then casualties were high. This year, things are different.\n\nThe aftermath of Burning Tides left Bilgewater in chaos. Gangplank was assumed dead, and his control over Bilgewater was lost. Gangs turned on each other and anarchy spread through the streets, which is something Miss Fortune definitely didn&#039;t expect. In Miss Fortune&#039;s quest for revenge she ultimately doomed the entirety of Bilgewater and the Blue Flame Isles.\n\nWith Gangplank having been deposed and chaos across the port town there&#039;s no one to unify the people, and the Harrowing&#039;s right around the corner. There&#039;s no united armada, no force to stand against the Shadow Isles; there may be no light after the Harrowing this time.\n\nThree words my friends: _Bilgewater. Is. Fucked._\n\nOr is it? A few sly comments from Rioters have hinted towards a &ldquo;saviour&rdquo; of Bilgewater. Perhaps not a hero, perhaps not even intentionally being a saviour, but regardless someone will be there to intervene, to at least give the port town a fighting chance. Someone who can stem the fell tide.\n\n_But who?_\n\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J4eYIuH6zXQ/VgR5pfbMj3I/AAAAAAAAGzE/76qMpA1esSE/s1600/Kindred_Splash_0.jpg\nPerhaps Kindred? Would they feel obligated to stop this corruption of life and death, or will they simply watch from the side lines? \n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Gangplank_0.jpg\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/MissFortune_0.jpg\nCould Miss Fortune or Gangplank still rally Bilgewater? Doubtful considering the current situation, but a possibility right?\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Nautilus_0.jpg\nNautilus stood against the Harrowing once before and seemed to be able to at least keep some of it at bay. Could be step in for a second time?\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Nami_0.jpg\nPerhaps it could be Nami? Could she perhaps call upon the seas themselves to protect Bilgewater, or perhaps coerce some mighty sea beasts to fight for their cause?\n\nOr maybe someone else who hasn&#039;t even appeared yet? A new face, a new champion, perhaps something completely unexpected.\n\nSo I&#039;d like to ask you all, who do you think could be Bilgewater&#039;s saviour? Will Bilgewater rally? Will the sea come to their aid? Will death itself come to stop the Harrowing, or something else entirely? Hell maybe there will be no saviour, or this &ldquo;saviour&rdquo; fails, leaving the port town to be destroyed! My money&#039;s on Nami, but I&#039;d love to hear what you guys think.\n\nEDIT: I'm blown away by the response, thanks for giving your thoughts guys, and also for reminding me of some important people I neglected to include!

The Noxians strike me as relatively non-tyrannical, in the sense that they seem more concerned with being sure that they're in charge rather than actually executing their power. Swain and LeBlanc are certainly nasty people, but they're uncommonly nasty even by Noxus standards, and not necessarily going to remain in power indefinitely. Plus, they seem a fairly goal-oriented evil — I don't see them being the type to kill a bunch of people without what they feel is a good reason, or even to really care what the commoners are up to, provided it's not seditious. It's probably much less safe being in the court of Noxus than that of Demacia, but it's also probably freer for the average citizen. Basically, I can't see Noxus being in charge being much worse than Gangplank being in charge.\n\nIn contrast, the parts of the Shadow Isles that are in the Harrowing seem pretty much set on killing as many people as possible. It's unclear if they'd really wipe out Bilgewater if Bilgewater posed no resistance — shear the sheep many times, slaughter it only once — but they'd certainly cause a lot of damage. It's also not known just how bad joining Karthus's choir is, but even if it really is better than life for your typical Bilgewaterite, there's also Hecarim and Mordekaiser raiding, and they don't even pay lip (mandible?) service to taking people to a better place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2015-09-25T21:23:56.178+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot ShadowStorm,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=718h7GgB,comment-id=00170001000100000001,timestamp=2015-09-25T20:21:55.970+0000)\n>\n> Which brings up an interesting question: If fighting off the Harrowing were to result in a Noxian occupation of Bilgewater... were they really saved?\n\nBetter idea.

Well, for any reason... {{champion:429}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:83}} \nKalista could be put into a pact to take down this year's Harrowing. Mordekaiser has been stated SEVERAL times that he works for his own gain so I wouldnt be surprised if he for some reason turned. Yorick is seeking freedom from the undead curse by \"paying his due\". He could use this to turn on the Isles.\nThere is also the possibility that Nautilus or Fiddlesticks could be the one here since Nautilus is definitely deeply modified and possibly undead after drowning into the black waters of the Harrowing. {{champion:9}} might also get a VU this Harrowing to explain why he would turn. Come to think of it, Fiddlesticks also has a scarf... hmmmmmm...\n\n> A silver serpent coin, scratched with the Shadow Isles symbol\n\nThis is symbolism no doubt. Everything about this screams {{champion:111}}  to me. A silver serpent coin, symbolizing that Nautilus was once a man from Bilgewater. Scratched with the Shadow Isles symbol, he was corrupted by the Harrowing.\n\n> Shadow wood wards\n\nThis no doubt is {{champion:57}} . Shadow wood wards, that is Maokai. He was a forest spirit in the Shadow Isles who possessed a tree there as it was dying, do doubt becoming what seems to be called Shadow Wood.\n\n> A vial of deadsee\n\nThis is a bit of a tricky one. Deadsee makes me think of {{champion:111}} because he \"died at sea\". However, I doubt this is what it is. I think the main thing here is see the dead, which, for some reason, makes me think of Kindred.\n\n> A dead canary in a cage\n\nSymbolizing {{champion:236}} . His wife is caged in the lantern. Dead canary in a cage. This one was too easy. Of course, it might also be, as mentioned before, {{champion:111}} since he is possibly, as said, undead and trapped in his cage, or diving suit.

I mean, it's a good place to start, and the undead are a really big threat for Bilgewater so I'm quite sure that he'll be glad to help them and join the fight. It's also somewhat close to the Isles themselves, so if he ever wanted to go on a hunt for more undead, in the Shadow Isles, he could get there pretty quick, as long as nothing will be standing in his way.\n\n{{champion:236}}** I vote Lucian.**\n\nI wonder if Maokai will be willing to ever join Lucian as they have a similar goal, and/or maybe even join Bilgewater in the fight against the Shadow Isles during one of the next Harrowings. I don't think that Maokai will go to Bilgewater by himself though- Only if he'll become Lucian's partner and Lucian will want to go to Bilgewater.\n\nEDIT: I'm not sure about Tahm Kench. Maybe Aatrox would help? Bilgewater need a great general, after all, since GP is still somewhat recovering.\n\nI feel like Miss Fortune will be worse than Gangplank and she wouldn't even realize.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doctor Dyment","date":"2015-09-25T21:40:47.267+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"My question is HOW exactly Nautilus fought off the brunt of the Harrowing's force by himself.
