The purple effects are kind of reserved for them but if she's a myth in Shurima she might not be. The void is, I believe, something that's kinda recent in the lore and it would take awhile for an urban legend to really kick off. Non-void purple champs? Aww yeaah. Although with Void generally being purple and shadow isles generally being a sickly green, Demacia blue, Noxious red, etc etc, I feel like if they mix up colors we might get a little bit of visual overlap and confusion thematically. But hey, purple is my favorite color and I'd like non-void champs to have it, since I rarely seem to click with void champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2014-11-24T19:48:08.817+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hope she's a tank/support\n\nPS {{champion:72}} love affair?","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2014-11-24T19:49:55.680+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"I bet she eats her partner after mating.

I have to disagree with you there.  I understand the hyperbole when you said \"demolish your universe every six months\" because yes, it can get confusing and frustrating, but that's not what they did.  The retcon only took out the League, not the rest of the setting. Now, the characters are free and even \"community lore\" isn't constrained by the League anymore.  If that doesn't give everyone more creative freedom than before, I don't know what to tell you.  The league isn't a necessary Part of Runeterra and the city-states are still around; I don't see a problem with separating lore and gameplay in a moba.  \n\nYou could think of it like pre-retcon and post-retcon if you want.

If that doesn't give everyone more creative freedom than before, I don't know what to tell you.\n\nIt doesn't work like that. \"We deleted the Empire from Star Wars. Everyone has more creative freedom now!\" I'm not going to waste an hour rehashing months and months of community discussion for you here. Read the Story and Art board and you'll find plenty of threads spelling it out.\n\nAs for the characters being \"free\", the lore community rejected the \"Champions are slaves\" thing a long time ago. Nobody's advocating for that. Riot used that as a strawman, and we're still quite bitter about it. Not only were we not made part of the discussion, but they didn't even fairly represent our opinions in absentia.\n\nOne thing we do agree on:\n\n> You could think of it like pre-retcon and post-retcon if you want. Just because the official lore no longer includes the League doesn't mean fan fiction can't include it.\n\nThe lore community obviously will never convince Narrative to reconsider its \"Great Retcon\", or the misguided assumptions that led it there. I don't think that fight is worth fighting any longer. Instead, I believe we should direct our energy toward keeping community lore alive and driving it onward to better and better things. No more begging for table scraps from Narrative, no more pleading threads beseeching them to change their minds. I for one am done with that.\n\nThere is silver lining here: if Narrative isn't going to write about the League anymore, that means it can't screw it up. It belongs to the community now. We'll take much better care of it, and do much more interesting things with it, than Riot ever did.\n\nAnd this rather brings me back to my original point, that so far most of Narrative's new stuff is pretty easy to bring into community lore. It'll always be weird when they abruptly retcon a Champion's backstory for the fifth time, but we've gotten used to that, and it certainly hasn't stopped us before.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stompburger","date":"2014-11-25T02:52:45.744+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">That's like saying Star Wars fan-fiction should impact the movies and licensed books.\n\nHmmm.

One reason is that some measure of stability allows the community to get involved and participate in the story.\n\nI can sit down right now and write a Star Wars story about, say, an ISB agent on Kashyyyk during the Galactic Civil War. I could have written the same story five or ten years ago. In all that time, there's been plenty of development and storytelling in the Star Wars universe, but they haven't executed any massive retcons that would compromise this sort of story. They haven't said \"actually, there is no ISB anymore\", nor have they declared that in fact the Empire is run by giant bugs called Troknar who eat Jedi.\n\nIf Star Wars were handled like Riot lore, the universe would be completely unrecognizable by now, and any community lore written since its founding would now be totally disconnected from the \"canon\" universe. (I'm setting aside the issue of Episodes VII, VIII, and IX.)\n\nSo far, the lore community has managed to adapt to recent changes: mostly by ignoring the Great Retcon and just incorporating new material into the traditional framework, that bizarre League of Legends universe that (**gasp!**) actually contains a League of Legends.
