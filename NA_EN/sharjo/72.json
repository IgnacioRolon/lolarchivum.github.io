I do want to clarify - playing a game with a Rioter is not a promise for 1000 wins.  It's something fun that some Rioters try to get involved with, but it's not something we can guarantee happens every time.  There's a whole lot of you guys, and a much smaller number of Rioters.\n\n(In other news - bloody incredible effort, getting to 1000 wins!  Congrats!   You have my admiration, if not my bad-teammate-playingness.)","replies":[{"poster":"dr lichdeath","date":"2015-08-15T19:29:42.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh i see thx for the reply \nthought it was a promise but ye it might not be that feasible if u think about it xD\nbut i just wanna play with a rioter for once seems like a thing i want to do once","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-08-15T17:25:03.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like them more than Poros because they're god damn Wharf Rats.
