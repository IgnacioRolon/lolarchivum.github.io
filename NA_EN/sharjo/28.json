Perhaps that comet from &quot;The Spear of Targon&quot; refers to this? I dunno. Either way it seems like a new Targonian champion might just be on the horizon right now.\n\nEDIT: Just a note for folks, I personally doubt it's Taric, given Riot's stated in the past that they have him slated for sometime between the release of the champion after Jhin and the champion after that fellow, so the earliest timing would be sometime in late march or early April. Of course timings can change as things fluctuate but it's something to keep in mind.","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2016-02-29T19:28:54.755+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sharjo.
