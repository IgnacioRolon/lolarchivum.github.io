Look at the Planescape setting in D&D as an example. They explain a lot, but leave so much out, with subtle clues given here and there. That is good world building.

You need a base to speculate from.\n\nThere's enough champion backgrounds that're vague and mysterious. It gets repetitive and can easily make the champions feel distant, even though we directly play them in the game and they're the main focus of things.\n\n***\n\nMystery is fun.
