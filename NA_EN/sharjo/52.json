I like how Demacia is more fleshed out as a whole; they are only a perfect city in their _minds_, but the entire city, society, and way of life is built on _fear._ They fear magic, as is expected as it was founded by Rune War vets who were sick of the stuff.\n\nI fully imagine that their military might far outdoes any other nation, but the thing that holds them back is that they refuse to use magic, so in a regular battlefield far from their petricite they are completely outmatched. Hence they play the defense game, and their extremely tight-knit community and honor-filled values really shine in my eyes. They are ruled by fear to be sure, but they are good people at heart. They just need to understand that magic can be used for good as well as evil.\n\nMy thoughts on the champ lores can be best expressed if I put them in sections.\n\n{{champion:99}} Phew, I really feel for her. As a member of a prestigious family in a nation that despises magic, Lux was in a tight spot before being taken in by the Radiant Ones. Her strained relationship with Garen is painful to see, they still love each other but Garen pushes her away. He doesn't want to be too close to her in case she becomes evil with her powers and he's forced to kill her. Her cheerful facade makes more sense now, as this is what's expected of her. She truly is a happy person, I believe this, but her demeanor is more tempered by the struggles to control her powers around her family and her people. Her romp with Galio was pretty adorable as well, and it's nice to see that Lux eventually found her place in Demacia. Her bout with the demon who many suspect is a retconned Nocturne was pretty cool as well, and it really shows her inner strength.\n\n{{champion:86}} Loved this guy's lore. He's far from the oafish warrior that charges in yelling DEMACIA!! like many previously thought. He has more depth to him, he loves his nation, his ideals, and his family, and he will fight to the death to preserve them. Raised in Demacia's values and losing an uncle to magic, he despises it, but yet the fact that Lux has it tears at him. He fears getting too close to her because of her powers and what that means, but he is also willing to let her use it in certain circumstances. As in their fight against Nocturne, she was realistically the only one who could stop him. He does not employ guile or cunning, choosing instead to employ simpler tactics most of the time, but he's not stupid. His short story really shows this, heck it even shows he has a sharp mind.\n\n{{champion:102}} My thoughts on her lore are briefer as I'm as attached to her as with the Crownguards, but I know much of her old lore. The retcon of her origin was inventive, and I'm personally glad they don't have to explain dragon-human mating practices. She walks a line between dragon and human, and I'm really glad that everyone doesn't hate her, merely is suspicious. \n\n{{champion:59}} His story departs from his old lore in two crucial ways which I think strengthen his character. First, he doesn't leave Demacia on his own, he is taken and fights his way back. Second, he fights off his captors and escapes on his own. This really makes him seem stronger in my eyes, as he isn't saved by Garen, but fights his own battles. His lore shows a trial that tempers his overconfidence, and I really like this build of his character.\n\n{{champion:67}} FREY!!!! Vayne is a broken woman, this is obvious. But I really like her lore. I like that Riot decided to go all the way with her hatred of magic, and her ruthlessness of being a hunter. I feel she embodies the raw hatred of Demacia towards magic. The same fear that would drive a nation to expel its magic-users to slums and separate families would drive a woman to kill a mother figure in cold blood because she exhibited magic. Her short story finds that Vayne finds enjoyment from her hunts, and her flair for flashy kills was a nice touch as well. If she's gonna be doing this for the rest of her life, she may as well enjoy it.\n\n{{champion:133}} Well, they just killed the Talon-may-be-her-brother theory. Other than that, I liked her stories as well. It really gives you the feels. Heck all of the Demacain lores give you feels in one way or another.\n\nSorry for my rambling, but I had a lot of stuff to get off my chest.","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2017-03-24T00:22:05.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normally I hate demacia, and I'm not the biggest fan of all the new lores (Jarvan should have been macho-er), but Lux lore was just perfect.\n\nI'm the person with the outlier opinions, the one with the weird secrets that I don't want ot let slip, etc. While I'm certainly not extroverted or adventurous, I'm closer to her than most champs.
