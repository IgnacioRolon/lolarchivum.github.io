Let me tell you a story about beauty. Most people arent super models, most people have flaws. Most people look differently depending on where they live, what culture they belong to, and their biology. What you think is attractive is only one example that exists and is not the definitive \"this is how all attractive people should look like\" rules. \n\nShe looks like a normal girl with middle eastern facial features. She also is kinda cute to begin with. So please dont exaggerate someones features (which arent that bad to begin with, in actuality she looks perfectly fine from where she comes from), you wouldnt like it as well if someone exaggerated yours (which can happen because different cultures and levels of tolerance, intelligence, and understanding).\n\nhttp://mein-mmo.de/magazin/medien/2016/05/loL-Taliyah-980x500.png","replies":[{"poster":"SoMNia","date":"2016-05-02T21:50:04.031+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tesla Effect,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=HZyJXum9,comment-id=002a0001000000000000,timestamp=2016-05-02T21:09:49.413+0000)\n>\n> Most people arent super models, most people have flaws.\n\nNot to mention that super models also have \"flaws\" and don't actually look like their magazine pictures.
