Unfortunately, scorpions can't swim.\nBut frogs can!  So, Scorpion asked Frog to.  Frog said he will, but he will only do so if Scorpion promises not to stab him with his stinger.\nScorpion agreed, so Frog let the arachnid ride on his back.\n\n\nUnfortunately, in the end, Scorpion stabbed Frog.  I don't remember fully how the story goes. Either Scorpion waited until the end to get off, or if he stabbed Frog as they were riding, but I'm sure you can see the implications of what Ivern is talking about when it comes to other champions on the rift.\n\n\n**EDIT**\n\nIt was Scorpion and Frog.\n\nHere's a wikipedia [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bultz","date":"2016-09-21T13:51:23.109+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FauxSchizzle,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=TO2ln2gA,comment-id=00070000,timestamp=2016-09-21T13:15:04.183+0000)\n>\n> Ivern the human is definitely from a certain nationality.

Just to throw that in. I am currently only able to play (mage) Supports & (Tanky) Tops (Mid if I have to, but honestly it's just my supp Lulu taken mid lawl) but I think I may have to finally make my way into the jungle because THIS GUY, looks amazing. Truly. The fact that they've said he's arguably the first support-jungler in the game makes me even more compelled considering how much I LOVE playing support. \n\nAnyways, there's my two cents.
