Severity is one of the largest reasons.  We are doing these in between are large Reworks (Taric for example) so the amount of splashes that need reworking is a factor. Character popularity is a factor as well though not the primary factor. Age of update is currently not something that we are using. \n\n As I mentioned in another post Trist/Nid/Trundle were largely picked due to the fact that we had partially finished splash art already for them. Tristana is also a champion we use to teach new players about skins (giving Riot girl trist away for free) so it makes sense to update her sooner rather then later.\n\nAs for the question about production, the splash arts are generally the last thing we do in a update. This is why Shen's Splash art weren't even complete when he first hit PBE (They went in a week after he hit PBE.) The base splash is usually finished a week or 2 before it gets announced and hits PBE.","replies":[{"poster":"exe3","date":"2016-01-27T08:01:40.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What goes into deciding which particular splash arts need updating?

They're high definition, capture their personality and gameplay, and let's be honest man, Sion's looks freaking awesome.\nI think you guys at Riot should just leave those splashes alone, and fix old-old splashes like Rammus, Warwick, maybe Kennen's to add more personality. Though, you'll probably be reworking Rammus and Warwick at least and I know Taric is being reworked, so I can only assume you'll be updating their splash arts too.\n...\nUnless you mean updating their skins, in which I will walk out of the room hanging my head down in shame.","replies":[{"poster":"Moonboy65","date":"2016-01-27T00:29:37.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he means the skins lol","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-01-27T01:03:44.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct, I am referring to the skin splash art, not the base splash art.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2016-01-25T22:41:21.508+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They really are outdated.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2016-01-26T00:14:13.525+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope Karma gets hers sooner rather than later.

Hextech, Lumberjack and Barbarian are ridiculous as well as just painful to look at. Warmonger is ok, but feels like the wrong colors. Compared to his base skin, they're just a bit garbage.\n\nThe splash arts looking horrible probably doesn't help though.
