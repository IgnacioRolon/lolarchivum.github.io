I felt so happy! But then I looked over the text for Martyr&#039;s Gambit, and it says the following:\n\n> \"Battle is not a test of strength. It is a test of will.\" - Buhru Proverb\n\nI dunno If I&#039;ve missed something or not, so I&#039;m gonna ask, does anyone know what Buhru means? Because looking at the item it looks like a sea monster skull, which made me think Bilgewater or perhaps the natives of the Blue Flame Isles. But the manner of speech from the quote and it being a proverb kinda makes me lean to it being Ionian. So what is Buhru? The name of the indigenous people of the Blue Flame Isles? An Ionian order? Something else entirely?\n\nEDIT: We have an answer curtesy of Meddler! Buhru is in fact one of the Blue Flame Islands, making it the second location there we've come to know about after Bilgewater.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-07-09T19:50:48.297+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Buhru's one of the isles in the island chain Bilgewater's part of.","replies":[{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-07-09T19:59:51.072+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sweet lore drop.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-07-09T20:00:25.454+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah ok, thanks for clearing that up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"debtLOg","date":"2018-06-15T07:13:17.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Illaoi's  holds gods eye one of the idols of her god Buhruâ€¦ Buy me RAkan","replies":[{"poster":"Tyravinor","date":"2019-02-03T20:14:41.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buy him rakan for giving the wrong answer, stat.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Neon Robot","date":"2015-07-11T08:56:57.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Stexe","date":"2015-11-19T20:17:25.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nastra Dark,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=PzEpb2lp,comment-id=00010005,timestamp=2015-07-11T08:56:57.940+0000)\n>\n> Neat.

Who lives there? What are its peoples like? What's the environment like? Why is it significant? How long has it been inhabited? What is the topography? We know it exists, its people worship Nagakaburous, and she is from there. That's about it.\n\nThere is a bit more if you read in between the lines and read all her quotes. Assuming people are like Illaoi then they are all about embracing action and individualism. As a Rioter said, they are basically the Ciphers (with a dash of Fated) from Planescape. Life is motion and if there is something you want then you take it. Kind of like hyper objectivism and libertarianism.\n\nThere are obviously things missing, but it does give some information.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dreamspitter","date":"2015-07-10T19:36:44.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=PzEpb2lp,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-07-09T19:50:48.297+0000)\n>\n> Buhru's one of the isles in the island chain Bilgewater's part of.\n\nBut did they learn that proverb from {{champion:266}} ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2015-07-09T20:22:59.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2015-07-09T19:11:19.656+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Black Market has all sorts of things from across Runeterra so its difficult to say where they are from.
