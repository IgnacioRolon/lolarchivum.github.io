If they were honest with themselves, they would realize that the old lore has little to no substance to it. It's likely they had gotten attach to alot fanon or personal headcanon in their head that were squash by Riot new direction. This freakout is going occur time and time again after each LU, especially with the more ethtablish region such as Noxus, Ionia and Demacia.\n\nRegardless I really don't think Riot should listen to these people, as often then not they are rather self absorbed about their own belief. It's like argueing with comic book fan who is extremely stuck on to the old canon everytime a major retcon occurs. It's the pain of dealing with retcons, people get attach to old things that they are blinded with reality.  \n\nAs for how Voli direction wise, I say I like it better than another generic goody goody leader who was allied with ashe.

The Aspects only connect to their Avatars at Mt. Targon. The Freljord deities... are well in Freljord. The Ascended are quiet powerful but they got locked away/cryostasis. Even Bard has a physical form\n\nThe only exception would be Kindred: 1) because Death is an absolute, it doesn't need a god and thus they aren't gods, but rather something akin to us wanting to face death - personified 2) while having a physical form it seems to be highly subjective and is omnipresent as well: meaning a Demacian and Noxian both die by the Wolf in their respective side of Valoran at the same time. They both catch a glimpse of the Wolf  but he looks entirely different for the former and the latter.\n\nand A'Sol... cause he's from the Universe and was only forcefully tethered to Valoran.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Darrosh Jewfist","date":"2017-08-23T03:42:53.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something that confused me and is making me struggle to better understand this is that this entire thing ties in the Volibear rework and re-imagines a lot of the 2011 (?) Freljord rework.\n\nI think the Freljord is one of (if not the most) interesting regions in League because it has an ongoing Civil War. There's Avarosa, Frost Guard, and Winter's Claw. Champions are part of different factions. Volibears old lore says he was an Ursine chieftain who joined the Winter's Claw for reasons. Now it seems Volibear is a Demigod who aligned himself with the Winter's Claw tribe? At least, my understanding of the Ursine/Volibear were part of Sejuani's faction.\n\nThis made this line read pretty weird:\n\n> We could only ever stand a chance against the Winter’s Claw. If the Ursine struck first, our defense would be terrifyingly short. That hideous legion of half-bear abominations would overwhelm us.\n\nBecause if you read it knowing the old lore, you'd be wondering why they'd only stand a chance against the Winter's Claw when the Ursine are considered _part of the_ Winter's Claw. I was wondering if they renamed the Winter's Claw as the Ursine Faction and Sejuani was getting a different tribe name at first. Now it seems there's some kind of half-bear-man alliance with a human tribe. It's not a bad idea. It's cool actually. I just think the story didn't do enough to emphasize they're separate but coordinated armies.\n\nOther than that, the story follows typical Riot Narrative patterns of '_everyone that is pretty much everyone of no consequence going to die_'-sort of ending except this implies the people either fought to the death or somehow fought to survive against impossible odds. I think the universe building suffers a lot from this - there's simply just never any secondary characters of any consequence and those that are introduced (like MF's first mate Rafen) are shown to be incompetent.","replies":[{"poster":"Beyond Legends","date":"2017-08-23T04:03:19.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Voli was only switch side during the frejord event with little reason as to why.

Unless your character is entirely alien to the point they no longer follow logic or emotional responses then people will be able to comprehend it just fine.\n\nDon't forget to read the color text. The Bio is meant to be a summary of the character. FWIW, I enjoyed writing Lost Tales more. Bios are a lot harder.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-08-23T01:07:52.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"I did, still liked Lost Tales more, had a nice vibe to it that seemed to get the oral traditions of mythologies a lot better than some of Riot's other attempts (the Targon lore for example).\n\nMostly, my problem comes from disliking the scope that you guys have decided to take the story in general, and it is just pretty blatantly on display in the Ornn lore.  Humans are in trouble, they're against some otherworldly force, they can't do jack about it.  Then a god shows up to solve their problems for them because their opponent is literally beyond their scope to deal with.  And it works in this story, because the focus is on introducing Ornn, nor the tale of the unnamed narrator and their tribe.  They are just the framing device for Ornn.\n\nBut, as a whole, I don't really care about the troubles between Ornn and Volibear.  I'm way more interested in which of the queens gets the crown.  But the queens don't matter once gods are on the playing field.  What is Ashe going to do now that Volibear is working for her enemy?  Get some god to do her work for her?  That's not compelling.  Why does it matter if Ashe is a good queen or not when Volibear or Anivia or Ornn could turn everything she does to rubble and make the world as they want it?  She's insignificant.\n\nSame thing happened in Shurima.  Xerath is trying to kill Sivir.  Xerath can turn rocks into a gas in a second.  There is nothing that Sivir can do against Xerath.  So, thankfully she has Nasus to go do the fighting for her.  That's pretty lame.\n\nOr Targon.  We have Pantheon, Pantheon's opponent is a star creating dragon from space.  Pantheon is a guy with a spear.  Admittedly, a guy with a spear that's supposed to be possessed by an alien parasite.  But still his body can be killed like any other.  So what does he do against a star dragon?  Probably something overtly magical, or that fight ends in 1/2 a second.  But, this is Pantheon.  He's the warrior guy.  He's the soldier.  Who thought it was a good idea to tie him to the magic god shenanigans? ","replies":[]}]}]}]}
