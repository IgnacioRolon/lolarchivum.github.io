The murals on the wall appear to be of Zilean, with information and pictures/locations of his studies or of the device on his back.\n\nAlso, oddly enough it states in Zileans lore that Urtistan was destroyed by \"entire phalanx of dark summoner-knights of unknown affiliation\" but they chose to leave the Clock Tower alone. So the fight there would make sense if Ekko was followed inside by the massive dude. It also appears that the guy he was battling is a creation of The Headsman, which is the same guy who created Urgot and would explain why they look similar.\n\nEither the item Ekko uses to time travel or his sword is most likely an Anchor to prevent him from suffering the disease Zilean has called chrono-displasia. Otherwise, he was probably searching through Zilean's stuff to see if there is a cure for it because he may have early stages of it.\n\nLast thing I noticed and sparks this theory (Literally) was the devices in the beginning below the murals that appear to be either a light source or conductors that can also be seen in the Time Machine Zilean splash art in the background.\n\nMay just be a far left analysis theory, but it's spooky.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-05-11T02:02:00.883+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dark skin?

Architecture! The city seems definitely layered, the place Ekko and his aggressor are standing on is suspended on thin panels. Cybernetic augmentation, if Vi/Urgot/Singed Jr. is anything to go by, seems to be more commonplace than previously thought. Unless the unnamed character is one of Viktor's Glorious Evolution, which I doubt on the basis of aesthetics, mechanical sophistication, and personal bias, people are slapping gears and pistons on themselves with surprisingly little reservation, which also makes me wonder why Viktor's goals are considered odd, though that may be by the world at large rather than just Zaun.\n\nAnother thing about our unnamed assailant; take a look at the face on the mural's far right, then look at Big McLargehand's hair. Seems rather familiar to me. Could be the same guy. Also the broken goggles, which are with their rightful owner in the mural, something Ekko willingly turns back time to preserve. This makes it clear to me the painting, and by association the people in it, are important to him. Perhaps they were part of a gang that has been whittled down to just him, and Big McLargehand is a former friend turned human experiment?\n\nAlso also, Ekko's name may be more than a play on his abilities. He is in obvious pain after each temporal reset, yet has no visible injuries. This could be graphical limitations, as changing his model would have cost more time, effort, and money, but I think it may have something to do with the nature of his time travel. He clearly remembers previous events, despite them technically never happening after he alters the future (paradoxes, yo), but is physically no worse for wear; perhaps the pain and memory are an \"ekko\" of his time travel, like phantom pain for body and mind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"supes the lost","date":"2015-05-11T00:50:30.326+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, from just watching the video, I've come to a conclusion on a general idea of how his device works.\n1. As his wrist device and the identical return point show, pulling the rip cord on the hourglass activates his time device, setting a bookmark of sort to that exact moment.\n2. Turning the dial on his wrist device causes him to move back to the bookmark that was set when the device was activated.\n3. His memory is fully transferred back and he is capable of acting on these memories.\n\nThese are more of my speculations on the device on how I feel it can do.\n1. The wrist dial most likely does nothing unless a bookmark is set.\n2. Physical injuries are not taken back in time, but he most likely feels the phantom pain from having been hit by it.\n\nOther things.\n1. I feel like he's going to be an AD champ, as outside of his time device, he spends the entirety of the video fighting with a sword.\n2. On top of this, he's most likely either gonna be a melee carry or an assassin, if his base stats are high enough and the time function is decent in a duo lane, he may also find himself as a off support for a kill lane.\n3.
