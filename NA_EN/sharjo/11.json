She finally did it.  \n\nExcited to read these, and the Princeling's Lament is interesting...seems to confirm that Karthus and Thresh would work together, despite Karthus' objections to Thresh's methods.  Certainly takes his sympathetic note down a notch.\n\nI didn't find Evelynn's too surprising, sort of confirms what we've always suspected of her, she's an assassin, but it seems interesting that she isn't bound to the Mist at all, and doesn't seem to be interested in the same sorts of schemes as, say, Morde or Karthus.  I also like the brief cameo mention of Singed still being up to his usual tricks.  The one thing that struck me as odd is that the client's name is \"Saito Takeda\", which sounds super Ionian, if we're going by the usual Ionian characterization of \"Mini-Runeterran-Asia\", but he's Zaunite.\n\nIt seems we have an origin for the Blessed Isles now, and his name is Maokai.  I liked this one a lot.  Maokai's color text is also interesting, in that it uses a lot of blunt, short sentences, and it's in first person, so it does sound sort of like the way the Treant would talk.  It's simple, but I think that makes it work.\n\nI'm really pleased with most of Elise's story.  Elise is smart, cunning, and devious, and she's got all those traits in spades.  Also, direct, canon confirmation of her ties to the Black Rose and LeBlanc will make a lot of people pleased.  The one aspect I don't like is the whole \"I want to stay beautiful\" trope, because I feel like it's a bit overused in fantasy stuff.  That kinda brought me out of it, but I do like that they kept a lot of her traits from old canon.  (Also, damn, you don't want to be a guy named \"Marcus\" or \"Markus\" in Noxus, nothing good comes of it.  Also the man made of spiders is some of the creepiest imagery League's ever had, holy shit riot.)\n\n\nYorick's new lore seems pretty similar at the beginning to Karthus' old one.  Making friends with the dead, being an outcast, etc.  I will miss the Mori Family stuff, as I always liked that, but his new story is good.  I also love that he constantly carries a cape that just sasses him.  Even Yorick's clothes make jokes about Yorick.\n\nOverall it was all very somber and downbeat, which is, honestly, to be expected of the Shadow Isles, so I think that's alright.  I'm a fan, and I'm happy to see another set of champs get their updated stories.

(It didn't work)  I hated it from the gif teaser on Facebook and I hate it now that everything is revealed.\n\nOld Yorick was a gravedigger who was forcibly resurrected in order to \"fill his quota,\" seeing the League of Legends as a method to this.
