I can see this being incredibly hard to balance in the future since once late game hits one team will have a permanent item advantage over the other.

But at the same time they shouldn't be so strong that comps become built around surviving to late game with Ornn and then insta-winning when your whole team has a full item advantage.\n\nAlso since items change stats all the time I would expect that the upgraded items would have to change as well.
