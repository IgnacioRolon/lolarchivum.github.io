In his current backstory, he's a very calm individual. I see him as a cold and calculative person, not someone that has a very expressive temper, he'd hide it well behind an attitude as if he was, disappointed. \n\nThe teased splash gives off the impression that he's, inquisitive, but not really showing any outward emotion. Which is what I think is core to his identity. He's not someone that gets furious when his plans are ruined, instead, he learns from this mistake, permanently storing this type of strategic counter, so he can plan to destroy it if he encounters this later.\n\nI imagine he'd be the kind of guy to sigh when bad news came his way. Like say, if a General reported that they lost ground by Demacian forces, he'd sigh, and ask for more information on how this happened. Of course, just his very disappointed look would scare the shit out of this officer, as he'd know how powerful he was, and that he screwed up. All the while, Swain, the Master Tactician, is planning out his original fight, with this new factor.\n\nYeah...

There's a reason you brought up another situation of \"that's like this\", because the 'this' we are talking about here you have _no_ argument for.  You _know_ (hopefully) that looking back at it you just tossed out hate and not real critiques, what you gave out wasn't a critique, it was shitposting.

Just read your first comment compared to this one man, see how delivery can mean so much? At first you just gave out some pointless hate and now you turned it into a nicely delivered message that gets your point across without sounding like an ~~asshole~~. \n\nAnd yes, I know it was your opinion (obv) but you gotta realize the way you come off, as I said in my first response you word it in a way that makes it come out as a fact. Yea, I wasn't calling the artist a god or anything, if you dislike it that's fine, that's your opinion, but I don't personally share my opinion unless I have something more to say behind it. Not saying that just tossing an opinion out is bad, but I only toss mine out if I have reasons to believe, what lead me too those thoughts. If you had said \"I think\", \"in my opinion\", \"I only really like\", etc. Then you would've come off as much worse. Would you still get downvotes? Yes, you're against the popular opinion, that will always happen regardless of the subject.\n\nI can very easily come off as a hater if I have a different opinion than you, but I am not here to beat you down as a person, just here (in the boards) to have some interesting conversation and call people out on random things. If you have an opinion and you come off as more rude than you have to be you can bet I will be there to say that you sound like one of the most toxic people on planet earth, purely due to your delivery.\n\nI'm not trying to hold you back in anyway, nor trying to discriminate against your opinion, but if you say something that I don't like I will respond (unless it's something that's been said a million times that also comes up about one a day on the boards, something about a queue, not sure)<--kappa. I will respond because I think (as my opinion) that you are wrong. \n\nHere's the reasons I responded to your original post. I didn't like the way you delivered it, coming off as just another hate comment. The way I see it, if a single person values something then that thing has value, it is good for them; it is in someway good. Mainly going off of the majority to decide what something is worth. So saying that all the others are bad is _just false_, as long as someone values them they have value. Saying all the others are bad, and clearly making it an opinion, is fine.\n\nSame to you man, I hope that I could at least deliver some sort of message to you in this post.","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2016-04-13T23:07:17.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah I kinda jumped the gun on my first post :P","replies":[{"poster":"Roar of Legend","date":"2016-04-14T01:35:15.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stop with the \"I have the freedom of speech, therefore I can say whatever I want, where ever I want and when ever I want\" aka. \" international deceleration\" bs . Seriously, those type of right is reserve for people to use against the government and any official authority. It was never meant for you to use as a way to argue with another citizen. You said \"I'm also brutally honest, so many people are afraid to say what they think, but in reality I'm not\", if you are going to put yourself in that environment, then you have no right to response to people with \"Lol that's like saying to a critique can you do better? It's a different line of ability.\" You put yourself in an environment that allow people to barge on you by barging on someone else, why were you expecting people to take you seriously? Now I understand that you try to explain yourself with later comment. But honestly, you just hurt a person feeling. You mention nothing about it was your opinion, you just rush in and said \"Lol only good one is the poppy one\". You could have been a little bit more kind, and state your OPINION as \"I personally did not like them that much other than the Poppy's\", either way it would have come out as negative, the second one is just more reasonable, but it still should only be kept to yourself. What was the point of you destroying someone self esteem in the first place? All of those artwork look very professional, if it was some random guy drawing a stick figure and propose it for an official company, then it is reasonable for them to say back off since they are wasting others people time. But this... this is professional level of illustration, someone is literally doing it for a living. Your comment was very rude and disrespectful, I wouldn't walk up to someone and said \"You are really fat, try to get better diet\" just because I'm skinny. Even though it is an honest truth, why shouldn't anyone ever said it? It's because something is better to be dealt with by using avoidance. I'm not going to chase someone to the end of the world just because they cut me on the road. It isn't worth it for me to look like a complete fool and being reckless just because I cannot handle something such as other people driving. Honesty isn't equivalent to justice, avoiding something might actually make you feels better sometimes as long as you don't use it on anything that is effecting you directly in the long run.\nI want to tell you a story, but I think you should get my point by now.
