A Powerful Mage that needs to travel all around probably doesn't need to do that all on foot, so he learned to teleport around Runeterra to get around quicker.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective rather then lore, Ryze was always a Mage that wanted to get in close and be in the center of the battle rather then on the outskirts so a tool for him to engage made sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Quort","date":"2016-06-28T23:52:23.520+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's sound reasoning!

Earlier champion designs tend to be heavy on either stat boost or huge damage ults.\n\nAlso, I reckon that we're seeing more of a clarification between champions that do burst/fast damage and those that do constant damage. With the later, they tend to be naturally lower on strategic ability use already, so giving them greater \"burst utility\" gives them some additional thought around playing around windows of time while also letting their constant damage feel more impactful without need to worry about some huge burst ability eating into their potential budget there.\n\nAt least that's how I would rationalize it.","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2016-06-28T21:27:16.959+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this hits the nail on the head. Morello said above that since everyone does damage, a champion who only does damage has to do more than everyone else to be viable. I think they're trying to shy away from this into a more sustained damage archetype for most mages, with utility. This makes it easier to balance (because nerfing numbers won't necessarily destroy the champ, because their kit no longer relies solely on dealing damage) and also makes the champion less frustrating to play against (there is counterplay involved that isn't static \"do I have enough HP to tank his damage and kill him before he kills me?\")","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Arkken","date":"2016-06-28T22:09:17.356+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just feel like this ult doesn't gel well.
