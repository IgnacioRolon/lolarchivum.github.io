Maybe.","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":18,"down_votes":4,"body":"So magic is a weird thing. It has a lot of origin points and comes from a wide array of places. Some of it comes from the world, some from space, some from other realities, but how does it work? Hopefully I can try and explain, in a manner that makes some sense, how I&#039;ve come to understand how magic and the fundamental laws of the universe work in League of Legends, at least from the standpoint of how magic functions.\r\n\r\nSo first off let&#039;s remember what the whole picture looks like. There are multiple planes of existence and each of them intersect with the main one: Runterra&#039;s universe. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Runterra&#039;s Universe: the principle plane of existence in this whole thing.\r\n- The Void: a plane filled with darkness and all consuming, highly intelligent and dangerous organisms.\r\n- The Glade: the origin plane of the Fae; a place filled with strange and peculiar magic.\r\n- Soraka&#039;s Grove: Soraka&#039;s original home which is directly tied in with cosmic power.\r\n- Bard&#039;s home: An as of yet unexplored area of the universe populated with celestial entities.\r\n\r\nIn this whole conversation we could consider the homes of Kayle, Morgana, Malphite and Taric as a additional planes, but their existence is a bit tenuous with this new canon so I&#039;ma leave them out of the equation at this time.\r\n\r\nAll of these planes have magic which takes various forms. This magic is completely natural. Runeterra is the most complex that we&#039;ve seen thus far, with a whole mess of natural magic to call upon. This magic is mostly tied in with the natural world itself, so it&#039;s mostly elemental in origin; ice, fire, water, wind, lightning, earth and life are examples of this and they all have some magical properties. Runeterra is populated with beings who are naturally magical. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\n- Anivia is Freljord&#039;s natural embodiment and literally living ice magic.\r\n- Janna is a naturally magical human with a special connection to wind magic.\r\n- Skarner is of a race of beings who are naturally tied in to crystal magic.\r\n\r\nThis appears in all kinds of different forms from Darkin to Demons but magic doesn&#039;t permeate everything, far from it. For humans in particular, magic can be hard to come by, and if you&#039;re not like Janna or Zilean you need to be more creative when it comes to getting your magic, and this usually requires using some kind of foci, a mediator, or a transformation:\r\n\r\n- Having a physical means of connecting with the magic can allow a person to use magic, as seen with Yasuo who, despite not being naturally magical, can draw upon the wind&#039;s power through his mastery of the windblade technique.\r\n- Having a foci can bridges the gap between the user and the magic. This can be anything really, but some notable examples are wands, tomes, cards, true ice tools and demon ravens. Looking at you Swain.\r\n- Being magically empowered in some way. This is doesn&#039;t always require a foci and sometimes can just happen, for example the Ascended all had the Sun Disc as their means of empowerment, allowing them to access magic, but Volibear got his lightning powers straight from the source of that magic; the scared storm his people revere.\r\n\r\nThis occurs with the other planes too, for instance when we look at the Void we see humans once again need help to access void magic but creatures from the void are more inclined to be naturally magical: Vel&#039;Koz can opens rifts to the Void and has lasers made of void energy, all of which are natural abilities for him, where as Malzahar and Kassadin needed to be void empowered before they could even so much as float. The Fae, Soraka and Bard are all examples of beings with naturally occurring magical powers.\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s a slight problem with reality though; it&#039;s restrictive. Some magic just can&#039;t be easily obtained or utilised in one plane or another, and that can make people sad. However, there is a work around for this, and it is important for understanding how the universe works:\r\n\r\n _**The Magical Friction.**_\r\n---\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Bard_0.jpg\r\n---\r\nThis friction is a phenomenon that occurs in all worlds and is directly tied in with how realities interact with one another. To explain this in the way I understand it, imagine that the five planes we talked about before intersect with one another, or at the very least Runeterra intersect with the other four. Where the boundaries of reality meet the friction occurs. This notably occurs in Icathia, the Yordle Lands (Which are horribly named) and Ionia, which are located in the area where the Void, the Glade and Soraka&#039;s Grove intersect with Runeterra respectively. The friction likely isn&#039;t specifically tied to these places (since Icathia/southern Shurima isn&#039;t the only place voidborn have popped up) but this is where it occurs at its strongest, and is where the lines between reality blur. As a result of this portals and breaches in reality are likely to occur, allowing entities from both planes to cross in to the other.\r\n\r\nThe friction allows for the blending of realities, and in a magical sense allows for one kind of magic to appear in another reality despite it not naturally occurring in that plane. Kassadin and Malzahar are prime examples of this effect, but Lulu and the Ascended are also in this group, but how does their connection work?\r\n\r\nWell for Lulu her connection is simple; she learned to use magic in the Glade and can now interact with the friction to draw upon that power whenever she wants.\r\n\r\nThe Ascended are similar, but rather than going somewhere they were given their powers by another plane. I don&#039;t know where their powers originate from, but it&#039;s clear the Sun Disc doesn&#039;t actually draw energy from the sun to make Ascended, but instead uses the sun&#039;s rays as a catalyst to interact with the friction, thus drawing power from where ever it&#039;s connected to make them.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the Friction likely have long term effects, as evidence by the fact that beings from other realities can exist in Runeterra. Why is this you ask? Well if we consider that magic and living beings can move transcend realities to move from one plane to another via the friction then it stands to reason that when the friction is present it has a sort of naturally leakage effect where magic and energy from each plane bleeds in to other planes it intersects with. \r\n\r\nThis likely has an affect on landscapes, as seen with Baron Nashor&#039;s corruption of Summoner&#039;s Rift, but also has a biological effect, allowing for creatures from each plane to adapt to the energies of one plane over the course of time, thus allowing them to naturally cross over with no complications. This is already seen with the Void, where voidborn are able to inhabit Runeterra with no issues but humans are not so lucky when they come in contact with the void, and are horribly mutated, driven insane, or both. In this example voidborn likely populate the part of the Void that connects via the friction to Runeterra, and are thus naturally exposed to its energies over time, a time which is likely thousands of years. The opposite isn&#039;t true because the voidborn in Runeterra have pretty much driven out any Runeterran life from the areas they inhabit, meaning the native life won&#039;t have a chance to adapt to void energies and will have a bad time. This might also draw back to life on Runeterra not all being naturally magical, but we also see particularly non-void powered up voidborn like Kog&#039;Maw have no problems in Runterra, so I dunno about that.\r\n\r\nOver time the affect the friction has on the planes involved might lead to some pretty big and catastrophic effects. I&#039;m going really far in to the theoretical here, but if the magical friction became such a powerful effect for two planes it might end up blending the two together in to one, which is a frightening, reality destroying prospect if we look at how our universe works. On the one hand, this could be how new realities can potentially form, but on the other, this could be mutually assured destruction. We don&#039;t know how much of the magical friction is nature doing it&#039;s thing or work by outside forces, and if the friction isn&#039;t supposed to be meddled with too much then we could see some pretty catastrophic events occur if there&#039;s ever a point where the flood gates to the void open and millions of the little monsters flood through; we wouldn&#039;t need to worry about the void invasion, we&#039;d need to worry about reality itself collapsing in on itself and obliterating all life!\r\n\r\nYikes.\r\n\r\nBut anyway those are my musings. I have no idea how much of this is right or wrong, but I figured I&#039;d talk about it since Bard&#039;s unique existence has got me thinking a lot recently.\r\n\r\nAlso as a side note: Bard travels between planes that intersect with Runeterra, meaning he&#039;s potentially visited the Void and the Glade before. I feel like that&#039;s pretty cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-09-08T15:42:58.116+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Super interesting!  I love the thought you've put into this, Sharjo (as usual) particularly the idea that the Void intersecting with the 'normal' Runeterra plane of existence creates a frission that results in some of the more dramatic conflicts in the world.  Not sure about the 'end of the universe as we know it' part, but that's not to say that those peeps on the Narrative team don't have a similar theory that they're working to.  (For those not familiar with me, I'm not a Rioter from the Narrative team - so I have little special knowledge there).\n\nI would ask - do you have a way for hextech to fit into this model, or is it considered something else completely?  Does it come under your focus category, or does it operate differently, as it appears to be usable by whomever the user appears to be.\n\nLastly, you've discussed humans with magic, and magical beings (like Soraka, Bard, and Lulu) having magic - but do inanimate objects posses magic?  Are there intrinsically magical rocks out there?  (You mentioned the sacred storm, for example.)\n\nAgain, good stuff, and I too am interested in all the places Bard may have been (and meddled).","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-09-08T16:09:18.295+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Not sure about the 'end of the universe as we know it' part, but that's not to say that those peeps on the Narrative team don't have a similar theory that they're working to.\n\nI'm probably getting carried away with my theories here, but I still wonder what happens when a permanent pathway opens between realities in the League universe. I'd imagine it could be very bad if not maintained properly.\n\n> I would ask - do you have a way for hextech to fit into this model, or is it considered something else completely? Does it come under your focus category, or does it operate differently, as it appears to be usable by whomever the user appears to be.\n\nSince hextech is essentially magic fueled technology I'd say it falls in to the magical foci category, as the tech here acts as the medium between the magic (the fuel in this case) and the user, it just has a different application and effect. I'd say that the main points that hextech has going for it that make it differ from other kinds of foci are that hextech is way easier to use but has far more limited applications than other means.\n\n> Lastly, you've discussed humans with magic, and magical beings (like Soraka, Bard, and Lulu) having magic - but do inanimate objects posses magic? Are there intrinsically magical rocks out there? (You mentioned the sacred storm, for example.)\n\nI think there's definetly natural magic everywhere in Runeterra, it just depends on where the magic focuses. Freljord as an example has enough natural magic that it can have a physical embodiment in Anivia, have a magical storm that can empower people like Volibear and also affect the natural development of organisms in the area that allow them to have natural magical powers, namely the Yeti's, who have their own kind of magic and Trolls, who have been shown with Trundle to be able to use True Ice weapons for much more varied purposes, indicating a stronger natural connection to the magic said weapons draw upon.\n\nWhat I'd say is that worlds in general not just Runeterra have areas of greater magical concentration through natural causes, as we've seen things like the Brackern being created through natural means in the Crystal Scar (Providing that the Brackern still exist and the Crystal Scar is still their home, just in Shurima), and the sacred forest that Maokai originates from. They're probably few and far between but where they exist you can find all kinds of unique beings. They're also probably places you wouldn't want more devious individuals to find, considering what happened with Maokai's forest and the Shadow Isles.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention one thing - I don't think magic in itself naturally comes from worlds. What I assume is that magic all comes as a result of the friction and the natural magic we see in Runeterra is a result of the friction at work, and what you could consider as background magical radiation. Since all worlds have access to the friction it might be that magic is an incredibly important element to the development of life on said worlds. More things to think about!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2015-09-08T17:27:20.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you think the Void might be inspired from the \"cuts between worlds\" from the weird book series with a girl with a compass, a mothafackin' Volibear and Daemon animal thingies who run after everyone?","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-09-08T17:37:39.866+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe the book series you're thinking of his \"His Dark Materials\" and considering I haven't read it I can't offer much more context than that!","replies":[{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2015-09-08T17:39:53.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is!

It could be either or both in my eyes but if the latter is true it brings up an entirely new conversation as to how the realm of death works in the sense of Runeterra and the universe as a whole.\n\n- {{champion:60}} Elise's powers are as a direct result of being empowered by Vilemaw, so she is essentially magically transformed thanks to him. Thus her magic comes from her but wasn't always a part of her.\n\n- {{champion:32}} His power comes directly from his curse, and where the curse draws power from is questionable. It's different from the power of other undead champions in League so I don't know where it comes from, but it might still be related to death magic.\n\n- {{champion:14}} Like the other Shadow Isles champions his power comes from death, but specifically Sion's magical powers are fueled in large part of souls; instead of drawing from a font of magic for his continued existence he consumes the souls of his victims, which then burn to fuel his existence in his soul furnace.\n\n- {{champion:13}} This guy magically transformed himself so his power as it stands comes directly from himself, but he had to draw that power from somewhere initially; where I don't know, but I fee like it's very pure power so it might be directly from the friction as opposed to another world or right from nature.\n\n- {{champion:8}} His powers are related to blood so it's sort of a different form of natural magic. It's the kind of magic that all living things would have and Vlad has the ability to draw upon it thanks to his knowledge of hemomancy arts. It might also have links to water magic since Blood is mostly water, like 92% water. He's not naturally magical so he draws from a foci; specifically blood in this case, which he himself has so he has to use blood to control blood, if that makes sense.\n\n- {{champion:77}} He draws his powers directly from nature but it's a little different because his powers originate from what would be the mediators; he gains power via empowerment from the spirits, which is more of a give and take relationship rather than a traditional magical connection. His power is more of a natural magic in my eyes, and he sits in to the category of guys drawing power from nature via a foci of some kind.\n\n- {{champion:134}} Syndra's a naturally magical human, so her magic is essentially an extension of her own will and power; it's very much a part of her. She's in the Janna Zilean camp to me.\n\n- {{champion:39}} Irelia's power isn't necessarily magic but a magical connection between her blades and herself. Since her hiten blades are tied to her life force there's not really magic involved with the control as much as her extending her will to them like an extra limb. The origin of the magic binding her to the blades is celestial in origin though, and comes directly from Soraka. As a result she's sort empowered but in a different way to other people.\n\n- {{champion:56}} {{champion:35}} are weird because we don't really know what they are, but I personally think they're both demons, and as such rely on innate magic, drawing power from themselves. If Shaco turns out to be an ordinary human then he might just not be magical and use a combination of drugs and poisons to achieve his mysterious powers through deception; he doesn't actually make a clone he covers himself in a nautious gas that makes people hallucinate a second version of him. I perfer the demon angle though.\n\n- {{champion:9}} is even weirder since his existence is basically a complete mystery in the new canon, but given he's the \"Harbinger of Doom\" it stands to reason he draws power from whatever that doom actually is, implying it's another entity or from another plane of existence.\n\nAgain, this is all my musing and hypothesis, so at the very least this hopefully made some sense!","replies":[{"poster":"Chespin2013","date":"2015-09-08T18:20:09.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for the time to put this in!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gentleman Gaston","date":"2015-09-08T17:22:06.693+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really have much to add to the discussion here, but I just wanted to commend you on a fantastic post.

While it could be possible this is simply a natural occurrance, it may also have something to do with the Rune Wars of ancient history; the magical fallout of such cataclysmic wars undoubtably impacted the environment in wholly unexpected ways, perhaps even mutating otherwise mundane wildlife into the fabulous creatures we see on the Summoner's Rift.\n\nThat said, and this is my opinion, I do believe the Voidborn are not magical per se as their abilities might lead us to believe. The Void is an alien realm in every sense of the word. The rules we are familiar with, the natural laws of our world, may not apply to the Void at all! We may see Vel'Koz's ability to tear open portals as fantastic, but perhaps to him and the other residents of the Void, it is nothing more than a natural function. For example, Rek'Sai can create tunnels to travel through, yet on particular occasions she can use them to cross vast distances in the blink of an eye. Kha'Zix's claws exist in both realms at once, forming a sheathe of literal Void around them. His ability to slice through even the hardiest material is by literally displacing them in the Void. The Void is an existence unto itself, and the natural laws it embodies may be substantially different to our own.\n\nContinuing, I would love to learn more about the Glade, and the Fae who call it home. Perhaps it is an entirely separate plane from Runeterra, or maybe it exists as a realm of existence sandwiched between the very dimensions of the world; a place you reach not through a portal but by looking at the world from the right angle.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-09-08T15:57:22.384+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> There are some details that intrigue me though, such as why Runeterra serves as a convenient crossroads for so many planes.

As a result Runeterra, which is a world known for having magic being used extensively across history, connects with way more realities than most other places in its own reality. The friction affects all worlds so I'd say everything's connected in that sense but do those worlds have denizens that can tap in to said friction? That's where Runeterra differs in my book.\n\n> That said, and this is my opinion, I do believe the Voidborn are not magical per se as their abilities might lead us to believe.

In all honesty I'm not sure, but one thing I do confidently think is that the Void and Runeterra's reality were connected via the friction all along and it was work from both side that caused them to become closer; interaction between the Void and the humans (or something else) brought about a stronger connection than before, and because the Voidborn are far more in tune with their home realm naturally, to the point that organisms can embrace that natural energy instinctively, they can force their way in to Runeterra.

In short, I see her as having the potential to become the Anivia of the Kumungu, but has a ways to go and may have to jump through some hoops to get to that state.\n\nSo quick to respond haha!

I mean hell, even Bard's magical journey has magical lettering along its rim. I recon that runes are necessary for certain kinds of magic, but probably not all of them, although it would really depend on the context, I mean would the likes of Anivia, Skarner, Brand and Zyra need runes to use magic? Not really.\n\nRunes are probably more useful for beings that require a foci for their magic, so runes probably fall along the lines of the mediator between user and their magical powers. I'd also recon that runes can be complimentary to other forms of magical foci, but aren't 100% necessary.","replies":[]}]}]}
