World runes and their importance was something Tryndamere hinted at 2 years ago but then was never spoken of again until now. How long has this idea been in development and will it become bigger than just about Ryze's\n\n**His Response:**\nWorld Runes have been in our thoughts for a long time. They're central to Ryze's story, but they're not limited to it. I can't say any more than that.

If Aurelion Sol has created all the stars but not the planets it was unknown just how planets came into being. In our Universe it is believed that the planets form from the same dust stars do and due to the same forces. However now we know that planets like Valoran are formed from runes of creation. This brings up more questions like \"who wielded these runes first?\"\n\nHowever we can look at a few things about Aurelion Sol in a new light\nHis stance towards magical words and how it just muddles it up\nIn his flavor story he used caution as to not damage the planet too badly and seemed remorseful to have scarred it.\n\nSo we know Aurelion thinks little of magical runes, due to his dialogue, and also holds planetary life in contempt because of Targon. So why would he be remorseful about damaging the planet? I don't think it was because he was worried about being punished for it by Targon (or he wouldn't have melted Pantheon).\n\nAs one final set of questions, are all worlds in the Runeterra universe created with the runes of creation, or just the magical ones?
