Bear with me.","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":65,"down_votes":3,"body":"Right so Kled&rsquo;s lore came out, and we were all like &ldquo;sodding hell what&rsquo;s even happening with yordles?!&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s been a couple of weeks, things are a tad calmer and now is the time to analyze what we have learned, but Kled&rsquo;s not the only champion to look at here, since we also have Poppy and even Tahm Kench to look at and extrapolate from when considering where yordles fit in the lore now. So now I&rsquo;m going to take a shot at explaining, based on the limited information we have, how I&rsquo;ve come to understand how yordles work. \n\nOh god if there was ever a time where I worried about screwing up the lore while trying to figure it, this is the time! Well let&rsquo;s give it a crack regardless. Mandatory **&quot;THIS IS SPECULATION ON MY PART BASED ON NEW AND EXISTING LORE&quot;** disclaimer here.\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Kled_0.jpg\n\nSo first off, Yordles are ageless, but they aren&rsquo;t spirits. They&rsquo;re living beings of flesh and blood. They&rsquo;re difficult to come by, but that&rsquo;s not because they&rsquo;re incorporeal beings like Bard, Kindred and Tahm Kench, but because they are a magical people who are difficult for humans to perceive.\n\nYordles aren&rsquo;t easily visible to humans at a first glance, by which I mean if you tried to find one you&rsquo;d probably never do so without magic to help you. Humans have problems in perceiving yordles fully, and as such it&rsquo;s often down to the yordle to make themselves known, by way of them manifesting in a visible way. Yordles are drawn to human cultures and societies (why? We dunno yet), and can manifest themselves in such a way as to embody the ideals of said culture. The most evident examples we have of this are Kled and Poppy, and this is what makes yordles appear for humans, but magic makes things a tad tricky here. A human&rsquo;s own personal perception comes in to play here, not only from a magical stand point where by humans with magic can see yordles more easily, but also because a person&rsquo;s own ideology affects how they see the yordle. Let&rsquo;s look at **Kled&rsquo;s** lore as an example:\n\nIn the colour text that came with Kled&rsquo;s lore, he confronts a battalion of Noxian soldiers who&rsquo;re tresspassin&rsquo; and shit. The one who directly talks to Kled and Skaarl describes them as an old man and a pony. This is that perception thing coming in to play; this soldier is seeing Kled, but not for what he truly is; his ideas about the concepts Kled embodies differ to Kled&rsquo;s own, leading to a flawed perception on the soldier&#039;s part. I&rsquo;d wager a guess that the Noxian thought that the things that our redneck yordle liked are concepts that are old, outdated and a detriment to the empire as a whole. Because of this he sees Kled as just that; old and annoying. Nothing really to concern himself about. If a Noxian like Sion or Riven, who embody the concepts Kled really likes, saw him they&rsquo;d see a being much closer to what we see; his actual appearance, but even then those two wouldn&rsquo;t see Kled the same way as each other, or even 100% correctly.\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Poppy_0.jpg\n\nLet&rsquo;s also take a look at two instances of **Poppy** being perceived by humans. Firstly from her colour text, towards the end a young girl points Poppy out as being the hero depicted in a statue dedicated to a monster slayer. This is actually true; she was the slayer, but no one recalled what the hero looked like, and as such they made a statue of an idealized Demacian hero. The girl&rsquo;s father then essentially says &ldquo;Nah she&rsquo;s too short&rdquo; and they move on. So here we see multiple instances of people not perceiving Poppy as what she truly is, and also not even seeing her as a yordle, considering that the father, and everyone else around, agreed that Poppy looked enough like the statue to be understandably mixed up by the girl, but they didn&rsquo;t seem to be the least bit concerned that the statue depicted a **HUMAN** and the girl pointed out a **YORDLE**, considering that the entirety of the town&#039;s populace would have never seen a yordle in their entire lives.\n\nThis also seems to occur more subversively in her comic &ldquo;A Hero&rsquo;s Calling&rdquo;. In it she walks in to town with no worries, walking among the people. As I&#039;ve said, yordles are hard to perceive for humans, so the likelihood is that most people will never have seen a yordle in the flesh before. Despite this the ENTIRE TOWN basically ignores a live yordle right before their very eyes, even before the chaos sets in. Later she&rsquo;s seen observing the action, and despite being armed no one calls for her to stand and fight. The only time anyone&rsquo;s seen reacting to her is when the knight asks for a weapon and Poppy tosses him the Hammer of Orlon. After that we see children looking upon her as she leaves, enamored by her appearance, but do they see a yordle, or something else?\n\nI want to reiterate this for emphasis: multiple times, dozens of Demacians completely ignored the fact that Poppy was a yordle despite probably having never seen a yordle in their lives. When she appeared before Orlon this didn&rsquo;t happen; he was immediately was taken aback because he&rsquo;d never seen a yordle before, and coulld see that she was one. For those common Demacians they didn&rsquo;t see her properly because of their perception. They didn&rsquo;t see the heroic yordle, they instead saw whatever kind of person they imagined as symbolic of the ideals that Poppy holds dear. Meanwhile Orlon saw her pretty much in her entirety because the ideals she embody are ideals that Orlon effectively inspired, so he sees her for what she truly is since she&rsquo;s a yordle cut from the same cloth as him. The difference comes down to an individual&#039;s views and values.\n\nSo to summarise that section, yordles are very much physical beings, but how people see them depends on one: their own magic and two: how they view the concepts that yordle embodies. \n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Heimerdinger_0.jpg\n\nSo yeah that&rsquo;s all fine and dandy but what about Bandle City? What about yordle society and culture? Well you see yordles can manifest around specific ideals and philosophies, but they don&rsquo;t have too. Like I said the reasons why yordles are drawn to human cultures isn&rsquo;t clear, though given Poppy&rsquo;s admiration of Orlon and his soldiers doing such amazing things without magic, and Kled&rsquo;s ideology about the &ldquo;Noxian Dream&rdquo; so to speak, it seems very much like them wanting to become a part of something that they themselves have come to like and identify with, though that&rsquo;s more my speculation. Yordles have their own culture, their own society, and their own city: Bandle City. But where is it?\n\nWell the question&rsquo;s probably irrelevant to most because it&rsquo;s inaccessible to just about everyone unless you&rsquo;ve got a few magic tricks up your sleeves. Like yordles, Bandle City, and likely anywhere claimed by yordles, is hard to perceive for humans, even harder than before because this shit wouldn&rsquo;t be embodied around anything except yordle ideology and culture. The where isn&rsquo;t important here, but how it exists is, so I&rsquo;m gonna use Harry Potter as an example to explain how I&rsquo;ve come to understand it. \n\nGonna restate for emphasis too: _how I&rsquo;ve come to understand it_. I could be totally wrong. Like the title says, bear with me.\n\nSo you know Platform Nine and Three Quarters? For those who don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s basically a train platform that is hidden via magic, and is only accessed by using magic to effectively warp through a stone pillar to reach it. I&rsquo;m assuming right now that Bandle City is the same; existing in a part of the world that&rsquo;s only accessible with magic, but it&rsquo;s 100% there. You could walk around and be right next to Bandle City, but without the insight to see the way in, you&rsquo;d never even know you missed it. It&rsquo;s been stated in the new loading screen &ldquo;Did you know&rdquo; sections that yordles traverse pathways that aren&rsquo;t perceivable by other beings. This is exactly what I&rsquo;m talking about with the Harry Potter analogy; Bandle City and the ways too it aren&rsquo;t accessible or perceivable to the average person, but still exist fully and physically. It&rsquo;s a strange thing to think about; you could be right next to the entryway to Bandle City, with a bunch of yordles right next to you, watching you, but you&rsquo;d never know. \n\nDunno if that&rsquo;s creepy or mystifying. Guess it can be both.\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Rumble_0.jpg\n\nBut what about the yordles who live in Bandle City? What about them? Have they manifested or what? Well no. Like I said, they can manifest if they want, but they don&rsquo;t have to. Case in point, **Rumble**.\n\nRumble&rsquo;s always been anti-human to the core, as he believed that yordle scientists were &ldquo;selling out&rdquo; to humans. If we extrapolate that yordles can embody human concepts so wholly, then Rumble in the new lore might not just have a beef about science, but about yordle culture as a whole. He might look at Poppy and Kled and examples of yordles who abandoned their home and people, forsaking their own culture and society for the allure of humans and their ways of living. This might&rsquo;ve put a sour taste in his mouth due to his own adoration for his homeland and people, and spurred him on to create Tristy, specifically so that he could one day go to humans and show what yordles are capable of by their own merits. He&rsquo;d prove that yordles can make it on their own, and aren&rsquo;t just little creatures who follow humans around looking for approval. That might all be bollocks as well, but I feel that&rsquo;s at least a sort of decent explanation as to why Rumble might have disdain for humans now, and given this, sod even given Rumble&rsquo;s original lore he&rsquo;s almost certainly a yordle who hasn&rsquo;t manifested and lives very much within the bounds of yordle territory. He fights for Bandle City and Bandle City alone. But what about the other yordle champions?\n\n- Given Rumble&rsquo;s admiration for** Tristana** this implies that she herself is also likely an un-manifested yordle, as I couldn&rsquo;t really see Rumble getting behind a super pro-human yordle, even if he has a crush on them. It also helps that she&rsquo;s part of the whole &ldquo;Bandle Gunners&rdquo; brigade thingy-ma-bobby, so I&rsquo;m almost certain she&rsquo;s gonna be a Bandle City yordle like Rumble.\n\n- **Teemo** I can also see as being Bandle through and through, simply because he doesn&rsquo;t look like he&rsquo;s really about any human cultures. He&rsquo;s the quintessential yordle after all and what we all immediately think of when yordles come to mind.\n\n- **Veigar **I don&rsquo;t see being embodied around a specific culture, but I can see him having manifested specifically to learn human sorcery, and then going mad after the fact to become as he is now. He&rsquo;s weird though and might add an entirely new dynamic to how yordles work considering how distinctly different to every other yordle he is; he&rsquo;s the evil yordle, but with yordles embodying human ideologies that are at least positive on the surface, how does a yordle become like Veigar? Like in the old lore from straight up isolation or is there something more to it? Dunno yet.\n\n- **Heimerdinger and Ziggs** are in an odd spot, and I can see them being either both manifested around Piltover, having never manifested at all, or a combination of the two. Yordles live for a long time, so perhaps Heimerdinger and Ziggs came to embody the ideals of a budding nation called Piltover and its drive for progress, influencing the growth of Hextech via the demonstration and application of their own technology that is fueled by their own innate magic, but later left because Piltover changed in ways that they didn&rsquo;t like. I dunno just speculating on this one. Hard to be concrete here. I suppose Corki can be involved in this too, though I see him as a Bandle City yordle more than anything.\n\n- **Kennen** seems like an easy fit for being manifested around Ionian culture. I feel like he&rsquo;s probably one of the easiest yordles to apply the new lore to in that regard.\n\n- Many have been concerned about **Lulu** and her lore but everything can still work depending on a specific detail; whether yordles can only embody the ideology of human cultures. If not then I can see Lulu finding the Fae and the glade, being enamored by their way of life and embodying around that, becoming the more unorthodox mage we know today. The disappearing for centuries bit probably wouldn&rsquo;t mean much to yordles, being timeless in all.\n\n- I dunno what the sod to think about **Gnar** anymore. If any of you read my giant timeline thingy you&rsquo;ll know that I&rsquo;m right now speculating that Gnar is from pre-historic Runeterra, back when yordles were still developing as a species. This would put him in the tens of thousands to potentially millions of years old, depending on how long that process took. I&rsquo;m gonna leave the speculating of what time period Gnar&rsquo;s from for another day, but either way he&rsquo;s a Freljord yordle (I was skeptical but it&rsquo;s confirmed now) from ancient times and likely originates from an era where yordles began to grasp magic considering his transforming powers that come straight from his genes. Magically empowered genes. How he ends up in the jungles of Runeterra from the Freljord after having been frozen in true ice is anyone&rsquo;s guess.\n\nAnd before anyone asks, I don&rsquo;t know how **Fizz **fits in to this, if at all. I&rsquo;m going to wait on Fizz&rsquo;s lore to be updated before I even attempt to figure him out properly. In any regard. Including potential yordle connections.\n\nOne final point; the reason **Tahm Kench** hates yordles; the most likely reason is diametric opposition. Demons embody the sins of humans where as yordles embody their ideals. It&rsquo;s almost a vices versus virtues kind of deal. They work in opposite and opposing ways since yordles inspire humans by effectively being the things that they aspire to be, while demons use the weaknesses of men to bring them down and sustain themselves.\n\n---\n\nAnd I think I covered everything I wanted to cover. If I missed something I&rsquo;ll come back to this. Hopefully it made some kind of sense to somebody. I&rsquo;ll do my best to answer questions and queries you folks might have but do remember; this is all based on my own observations and conclusions; what I&rsquo;ve said is my own thoughts on the subject, and could be entirely wrong, though some things like being ageless and not spirits are actually confirmed.\n\nAlso if you&rsquo;re still worried about yordles, apparently there&rsquo;ll be more yordle lore to come &ldquo;soon&rdquo;, so be prepared for that stuff!\n\nAnyway, this has been amateur lore chronicler Sharjo, signing out!\n\n_P.S.

That would explain the ambiguity of him, as yordles see the mummy, but even he himself is using his magic now and lost to his thoughts and ways due to him being dead?\n\nAnd if Amumu is able to do that, that would be why the yordles are scared of Lulu, because she too could use her magic against her own kind to warp their perception of her. She can confuse everyone with her unorthodox magic, basically manipulating how we see things and actually MAKING it how she wants to see them.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-08-21T19:40:43.546+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see that; the idea of personal identity might be a super critical element to yordle society and mentality, which in turn might be why they go out and embody human cultures; solidifying themselves within the bounds of a given society could help to keep them structured and content in the knowledge of them knowing who they are and what they're about.

The average yordle has a head that makes up the majority of body mass and is certainly larger than an average human's head. Amumu shares this characteristic.\n\nAs for him being perceived as yordle sized, and looking like one as well, unlike the rest. You said that yordles embody the ideals of a civilization, but what are Shuriman ideals, they changed so quickly in such a short period of time that nobody really knew at the point of him being sealed in a tomb. Think about it, they were very much like the Egyptians, and then Azir changed so much of what Shurima stood for, I believe it would have been this time that Amumu manifested himself in Shurima. Then when Xerath betrayed Azir and Shurima collapsed, the nation made a complete 180 and went from an almost ideal nation to every man for himself, it ceased being his ideal nation, but at the same time he ends up sealed in a tomb for centuries. Sitting in the tomb sad that the nation he once knew was destroying itself. When he was unsealed it had all changed so much, he essentially needs to see the society it once was to stop his magic running rampant, and he thinks a friend to someone like him would mean that the ideals he stood for are still in Shurima.","replies":[{"poster":"Yordleassault","date":"2016-08-22T17:27:19.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amumu was in the first (or one of the first) royal families, this is stated in all 3 of his lore versions I belive, so he couldn't manifest at Azir's time, he was entombed long before that, I would even say long before Nasus and Renekton ascended.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DragonIgnis","date":"2016-08-21T19:37:35.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amumu is considered affiliated with Bandle City on his official character profile at \n\nhttp://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/amumu/\n\nRiot has decided to leave Amumu's species as ambiguous after the Shurima lore update, but, a Shuriman boy would have nothing to do with the seclusive yordles.

Even in ancient days they were, as a rule, shy of 'the Big Folk', as they call us, and now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to find. They are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though they are inclined to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily, they are nonetheless nimble and deft in their movements. They possessed from the first the art of disappearing swiftly and silently, when large folk whom they do not wish to meet come blundering by; and this an they have developed until to Men it may seem magical. But Yordles have never, in fact, studied magic of any kind, and their elusiveness is due solely to a professional skill that heredity and practice, and a close friendship with the earth, have rendered inimitable by bigger and clumsier races.\nFor they are a little people, not much larger than Minions: less stout and stocky, that is, even though they are hardly much taller. Their height is variable, ranging between two and four feet of our measure. They seldom now reach three feet; but they have dwindled, they say, and in ancient days they were taller. According to the Scouts’ Code, Kled Canker, son of Cleg the Second, was four foot five and able to ride a wind lizard. He was surpassed in all Yordle records only by two famous characters of old; but that curious matter is dealt with in this book.\nAs for the Yordles of Bandle City, with whom these tales are concerned, in the days of their peace and prosperity they were a merry folk. They dressed in bright colours, being notably fond of yellow and green; but they seldom wore shoes, since their feet had tough leathery soles and were clad in a thick shaggy fur, much like the fur of their heads, which was commonly brown. Thus, the only craft little practised among them was shoe-making; but they had long and skilful fingers and could make many other useful and comely things. Their faces were as a rule good-natured rather than beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, whisker-cheeked, with mouths apt to laughter, and to eating and drinking. And laugh they did, and eat, and drink, often and heartily, being fond of simple jests at all times, and of six meals a day (when they could get them). They were hospitable and delighted in parties, and in presents, which they gave away freely and eagerly accepted.\nIt is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Yordles are relatives of ours: far nearer to us than the Shadow-Islanders, or even than Minions. Of old they spoke the languages of Men, after their own fashion, and liked and disliked much the same things as Men did. But what exactly our relationship is can no longer be discovered. The beginning of Yordles lies far back in the Elder Days that are now lost and forgotten. Only the Shadow-Islanders still preserve any records of that vanished time, and their traditions are concerned almost entirely with their own history, in which Men appear seldom and Yordles are not mentioned at all. Yet it is clear that Yordles had, in fact, lived quietly in Valoran for many long years before other folk became even aware of them. And the world being after all full of strange creatures beyond count, these little people seemed of very little importance. But in the days of Veigar, and of Teemo his heir, they suddenly became, by no wish of their own, both important and renowned, and troubled the counsels of the Wise and the Great.\nThose days, the Third Age of Valoran, are now long past, and the shape of all lands has been changed; but the regions in which Yordles then lived were doubtless the same as those in which they still linger: the North-East of the Old World, west of the Sea. Of their original home the Yordles in Veigar's time preserved no knowledge. A love of learning (other than hextech tinkering) was far from general among them, but there remained still a few in the older families who studied their own books, and even gathered reports of old times and distant lands from Shadow-Islanders, Minions, and Men. Their own records began only after the settlement of Bandle City, and their most ancient legends hardly looked further back than their Wandering Days. It is clear, nonetheless, from these legends, and from the evidence of their peculiar words and customs, that like many other folk Yordles had in the distant past moved eastward. Their earliest tales seem to glimpse a time when they dwelt in the upper vales of Kumungu, between the Southern Shore and the Great Targon Mountains. Why they later undertook the hard and perilous crossing of the Ironspike mountains into Piltover is no longer certain. Their own accounts speak of the multiplying of Men in the land, and of a shadow that fell on the forest, so that it became darkened and its new name was The Plague Jungle.\nBefore the crossing of the mountains the Yordles had already become divided into three somewhat different breeds: Meglings, Fyrons, and Kumungani. The Meglings were bluer of skin, smaller, and shorter, and they were furless and bootless; their hands and feet were neat and nimble; and they preferred highlands and hillsides. The Fyrons were broader, heavier in build; their feet and hands were larger, and they preferred flat lands and desert. The Kumungani were fairer of skin and thicker of hair, and they were taller and slimmer than the others; they were lovers of trees and of woodlands.\nThe Meglings had much to do with Minions in ancient times, and long lived in the foothills of the mountains. They moved eastward early, and roamed over Valoran as far as the Guardian's Sea while the others were still in the Voodoland. They were the most normal and representative variety of Yordle, and far the most numerous. They were the most inclined to settle in one place, and longest preserved their ancestral habit of living in tunnels and holes.\nThe Fyrons lingered long by the banks of the Great River Kumungu, and were less shy of Men. They came east after the Meglings and followed the course of the Targonian streams southwards; and there many of them long dwelt between Zaun and the borders of Noxus before they moved north again.\nThe Kumungani, the least numerous, were a northerly branch. They were more friendly with the forebears of Shadow-Islanders than the other Yordles were, and had more skill in language and song than in handicrafts; and of old they preferred hunting to tilling. They crossed the mountains north of Noxus and came down the River Serpentine. In the borderlands of Demacia they soon mingled with the other kinds that had preceded them, but being somewhat bolder and more adventurous, they were often found as leaders or chieftains among clans of Meglings or Fyrons. Even in Veigar's time the strong Kumungani strain could still be noted among the greater families, such as the Cankers and the Masters of Bandle.\nIn the eastlands of Kumungu, between the Sablestone Mountains and the Mountains of Shurima, the Yordles found both Men and Shadow-Islanders. Indeed, a remnant still dwelt there of the Demacians, the kings of Men that came over the Conqueror’s Sea out of Western Isles; but they were dwindling fast and the lands of their Avarosans were falling far and wide into waste. There was room and to spare for incomers, and ere long the Yordles began to settle in ordered communities. Most of their earlier settlements had long disappeared and been forgotten in Veigar's time; but one of the first to become important still endured, though reduced in size; this was at Zaun and in the Howling Marsh that lay round about, some forty miles west of Bandle City.\nIt was in these early days, doubtless, that the Yordles learned their letters and began to write after the manner of the Demacians, who had in their turn long before learned the art from the ancient Shadow-Islanders. And in those days also they forgot whatever languages they had used before, and spoke ever after the Common Speech, the Valoranon as it was named, that was current through all the lands of the kings from Freljord to Demacia, and about all the coasts of the Sea from Noxus to Ionia. Yet they kept a few words of their own, as well as their own names of months and days, and a great store of personal names out of the past.\nAbout this time legend among the Yordles first becomes history with a reckoning of years. For it was in the one thousand six hundred and first year of the Third Age that the Kumungani brothers, Marcho and Blanco, set out from Zaun; and having obtained permission from the high king at Demacia, they crossed the brown river Serpentine with a great following of Yordles. They passed over the Bridge of The Howling Abyss, that had been built in the days of the power of the Avarosans, and they took the land beyond to dwell in, between the river and the Guardian’s Sea. All that was demanded of them was that they should keep the Great Bridge in repair, and all other bridges and roads, speed the king's messengers, and acknowledge his lordship.\nThus began Piltover-reckoning, for the year of the crossing of the Serpentine (as the Yordles turned the name) became Year One of Piltover City, and all later dates were reckoned from it. At once the eastern Yordles fell in love with their new land, and they remained there, and soon passed once more out of the history of Men and of Shadow-Islanders. While there was still a king they were in name his subjects, but they were, in fact, ruled by their own chieftains and meddled not at all with events in the world outside. To the last battle at Demacia with the Ice-Witch, Lissandra, they sent some dart-shooters to the aid of the king, or so they maintained, though no tales of Men record it. But in that war the Avarosans ended; and then the Yordles took the land for their own, and they chose from their own chiefs a Thain to hold the authority of the king that was gone. There for a thousand years they were little troubled by wars, and they prospered and multiplied after the Dark Plague (S.R. 37) until the disaster of the Long Winter and the famine that followed it.","replies":[{"poster":"Hemulen Magi","date":"2016-08-22T02:00:07.744+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Many thousands then perished, but the Days of Dearth (1158-60) were at the time of this tale long past and the Yordles had again become accustomed to plenty. The land was rich and kindly, and though it had long been deserted when they entered it, it had before been well tilled, and there the king had once had many farms, cornlands, vineyards, and woods.\nForty leagues it stretched from the Guardian’s Sea to the Serpentine Bridge, and fifty from the northern moors to the marshes in the south. The Yordles named it Piltover City, as the region of the authority of their Thain, and a district of well-ordered business; and there in that pleasant comer of the world they plied their well-ordered business of living, and they heeded less and less the world outside where dark things moved, until they came to think that peace and plenty were the rule in Valoran and the right of all sensible folk. They forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the Guardians, and of the labours of those that made possible the long peace of Piltover City. They were, in fact, sheltered, but they had ceased to remember it.\nAt no time had Yordles of any kind been warlike, and they had never fought among themselves. In olden days they had, of course, been often obliged to fight to maintain themselves in a hard world; but in Veigar's time that was very ancient history. The last battle, before this story opens, and indeed the only one that had ever been fought within the borders of Bandle City, was beyond living memory: the Battle of Greenfields, S.R. 1147, in which Kled Canker routed an invasion of Voidlings. Even the weathers had grown milder, and the wolves that had once come ravening out of the North in bitter white winters were now only a grandfather's tale. So, though there was still some store of weapons in Bandle City, these were used mostly as trophies, hanging above hearths or on walls, or gathered into the museum at Michel Delving. The Mathom-house it was called; for anything that Yordles had no immediate use for, but were unwilling to throw away, they called a mathom. Their dwellings were apt to become rather crowded with mathoms, and many of the presents that passed from hand to hand were of that sort.\nNonetheless, ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough. They were, if it came to it, difficult to daunt or to kill; and they were, perhaps, so unwearyingly fond of good things not least because they could, when put to it, do without them, and could survive rough handling by grief, foe, or weather in a way that astonished those who did not know them well and looked no further than their bellies and their well-fed faces. Though slow to quarrel, and for sport killing nothing that lived, they were doughty at bay, and at need could still handle arms. They shot well with the bow, for they were keen-eyed and sure at the mark. Not only with blowguns and darts. If any Yordle stooped for a stone, it was well to get quickly under cover, as all trespassing beasts knew very well.\nAll Yordles had originally lived in holes in the ground, or so they believed, and in such dwellings they still felt most at home; but in the course of time they had been obliged to adopt other forms of abode. Actually in Bandle City in Veigar's days it was, as a rule, only the richest and the poorest Yordles that maintained the old custom. The poorest went on living in burrows of the most primitive kind, mere holes indeed, with only one window or none; while the well-to-do still constructed more luxurious versions of the simple diggings of old. But suitable sites for these large and ramifying tunnels (or smials as they called them) were not everywhere to be found; and in the flats and the low-lying districts the Yordles, as they multiplied, began to build above ground. Indeed, even in the hilly regions and the older villages, such as Yordleon or Piltover, or in the chief township of Bandle City, there were now many houses of wood, brick, or stone. These were specially favoured by millers, smiths, ropers, and cartwrights, and others of that sort; for even when they had holes to live in. Yordles had long been accustomed to build sheds and workshops.\nThe habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to have begun among the inhabitants of the Howling Marsh down by the Serpentine. The Yordles of that quarter, the Howling Marsh, were rather large and heavy-legged, and they wore minion-boots in muddy weather. But they were well known to be Fyrons in a large part of their blood, as indeed was shown by the down that many grew on their chins. No Megling or Kumungani had any trace of a beard. Indeed, the folk of the Tempest Flats, and of Kaladoun, west of the River, which they afterwards occupied, came for the most part later into Bandle City up from south-away; and they still had many peculiar names and strange words not found elsewhere in Bandle City.\nIt is probable that the craft of building, as many other crafts beside, was derived from the Demacians. But the Yordles may have learned it direct from the ancient Shadow-Islanders, the teachers of Men in their youth. For the Shadow-Islanders of the High Kindred had not yet forsaken Valoran, the fall of the Ruined King had not yet come to pass, and they dwelt still at that time at Kaladoun away to the West, and in other places within reach of Piltover City. Three Shadow-Islander-towers of immemorial age were still to be seen on the Tower Hills beyond the eastern marches. They shone far off in the moonlight. The tallest was furthest away, standing alone upon a green mound. The Yordles of the Kaladoun said that one could see the Sea from the top of that tower; but no Yordle had ever been known to climb it. Indeed, few Yordles had ever seen or sailed upon the Sea, and fewer still had ever returned to report it. Most Yordles regarded even rivers and small boats with deep misgivings, and not many of them could swim. And as the days of Bandle City lengthened they spoke less and less with the Shadow-Islanders, and grew afraid of them, and distrustful of those that had dealings with them; and the Sea became a word of fear among them, and a token of death, and they turned their faces away from the hills in the east.\nThe craft of building may have come from Shadow-Islanders or Men, but the Yordles used it in their own fashion. They did not go in for towers. Their houses were usually long, low, and comfortable. The oldest kind were, indeed, no more than built imitations ofsmials, thatched with dry grass or straw, or roofed with turves, and having walls somewhat bulged. That stage, however, belonged to the early days of Bandle City, and Yordle-building had long since been altered, improved by devices, learned from Minions, or discovered by themselves. A preference for round windows, and even round doors, was the chief remaining peculiarity of Yordle-architecture.\nThe houses and the holes of Bandle-Yordles were often large, and inhabited by large families. (Veigar and Teemo were as bachelors very exceptional, as they were also in many other ways, such as their friendship with the Shadow-Islanders.) Sometimes, as in the case of the Cankers of the wastelands, or the Piltys of Piltover, many generations of relatives lived in (comparative) peace together in one ancestral and many-tunnelled mansion. All Yordles were, in any case, clannish and reckoned up their relationships with great care. They drew long and elaborate family-trees with innumerable branches. In dealing with Yordles it is important to remember who is related to whom, and in what degree. It would be impossible in this book to set out a family-tree that included even the more important members of the more important families at the time which these tales tell of. The genealogical trees at the end of the Scouts’ Code of honor are a small book in themselves, and all but Yordles would find them exceedingly dull. Yordles delighted in such things, if they were accurate: they liked to have books filled with things that they already knew, set out fair and square with no contradictions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-08-21T19:23:40.702+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz is not a yordle as far as we know.\n\nThere is an off chance that fizz and his people came to be from yordles due to possible evolution or other changes.\n\nBut at least for now, i don't think you need to adress him since he is not one, or at least confirmed to be one.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-08-21T19:30:16.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why I said don't ask me about him; a yordle connection was implied but never confirmed, and I don't want any further head ache in figuring out yordles by adding fish people to the mix in case anyone actually wanted me to try it.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-08-21T19:54:08.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Come on you are a theory crafter, you cant let such a theory pass you!!","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-08-21T19:57:46.056+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I DID YORDLES I'M TAKING A BREAK.\n\nhttp://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1551/15516851/2941771-lfs20.png\n\n...I'll probable dabble in Fizz theory tomorrow despite my better judgement.

Hard to be concrete here. **I suppose Corki can be involved in this too, though I see him as a Bandle City yordle more than anything.**","replies":[{"poster":"Hige","date":"2016-08-21T17:05:08.641+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"oooh I missed that part haha, but now on a more serious note, I like your interpretation of what's been given to us in small hints but I think there's too many gaps in this for it to be the most viable truth about yordles.\n\nPersonally I don't think Yordles are all that rare, like people are 100% used to see them and it's not like they change in appearance depending on who's looking but more like midgets irl, they look somewhat different from tall people, yet no one freaks out when they see one (with a few exceptions...).\n\nI think that runeterran society isn't close minded at all, if it's alive and walking, it's welcomed and at times even admired, seeing features of a statue on a yordle doesn't mean... \"muggles!\" it means that she does have a demeanor akin to the statue, namely the way she holds the hammer. \n\nSame thing for Kled, no one sees a yordle and goes: \"BLAHG A YORDLE!\" (except certain ghost...) especially noxians who see people according to their strength, when they see Kled they simply think he's weak because he looks old, they aren't really seeing a pony and an old man, it's simply a arrogant way of referring to what they see.\n\nThis would also explain Amumu's \"race\" confusion, since being a yordle is barely seen as a race in itself, as a matter of fact races in runeterra doesn't seem to exist, in place we got regional demeanor, take Riven for example, her demeanor isn't that of a noxian so she exiled herself and she's barely recognized as a Noxian anymore, she's not black or white haired or middle eastern, she's an exiled noxian, diametrically opposed whe have Karma, whose demeanor shapes Ionia, she's not black or indian or red eyed, she's simply ionian. \n\nYordles should still exist on bandle city as well, and living on bandle city should in fact have its own ideals, being a yordle is probably of utmost importance here but also being used to the jungle and magic and the lack of regular humans as well, for example: Nidalee and Rengar, I'm not saying that they live in bandle city but taking in account that the jungle surrounds the city, they are the closest to a human that co-exists within yordle territory. Bandle city is simply a place where usual sightings revert, Yordles are the norm, humans the exception, though there's no xenophobia anywhere to be seen either, bandle city has a trade port as well so there should be quite a few humans walking around.\n\nThing is that we, human beings, think of yordles as fluffy and cuddly and cute, whilst a runeterran would probably understand that they aren't a living toy, in fact they can be quite scary (Veigar) so whilst inside bandle city most human would probably behave accordingly instead of: \"LOOK AT ALL THESE FLUFFY MIDGETS, I WANNA PINCH ALL YOUR CHEEKS AND CUDDLE WITH YOU ALL NIGHT\"...\n\nAs far as Tahm Kench hating on yordles, I think it's fairly simpler, it's like eating a single french fry! you won't be full until you eat ALL the fries but in this case the fries have weapons and magic that far exceeds that of a burger xD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xScarfy","date":"2016-08-22T13:04:04.984+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really interesting and thought-out thread!
