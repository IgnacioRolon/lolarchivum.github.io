For example, Medarda would see which routes to take on a voyage that would yield him the best profits during current conditions, based on their relative location and approximate travel time.

It just might be strangely too far west or east because the map maker emphasizes different sections of the path through the water.\n\nSo, going by that.  Freljord is West, it just is probably not as directly west as it looks.\n\nAlso, the tech in Runeterra is far and away beyond anything in the medieval world, so, there maps should probably be a bit more accurate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UomoAfide","date":"2016-12-02T00:53:34.865+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn you Sharjo!
