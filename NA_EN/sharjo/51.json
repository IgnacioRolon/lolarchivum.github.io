What&#039;s interesting though is that his clothes and skin tone, which to me seems a tad darker than many other human champions, indicates he&#039;s potentially Shuriman. Couple this with the desert and Shuriman themed architecture in Young Ryze&#039;s splash art and I&#039;m led to believe that Ryze was Shuriman born or visited ancient Shurima in his early days, keeping in mind that he&#039;s now centuries old.\n\nhttps://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xiXGiwVNn8M/V3Loglf3FxI/AAAAAAAAQ-s/EIWsRhfDn7AHLTlj-Tv0QsfToDmrFEpiACKgB/s1600/ryze1turn.jpg\n\nYou can&#039;t look at that building behind the magic around Ryze&#039;s hand and tell me it doesn&#039;t look like the Palace of Ten Thousand Pillars (The building with the Sun Disc above it).\n\nI mean we'll probably get solid information with his new lore, but hey, I saw something interesting and wanted to play detective, so sue me.\n\nEDIT: Reav3 has confirmed that Ryze isn't Shuriman, and really doesn't belong to any one nation, but he has been to Shurima as the splash art suggests.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-06-29T00:54:51.456+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"An ancient powerful magic user that isn't Ionian?
