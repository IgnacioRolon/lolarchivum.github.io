He just wants to end world. It looks totally evil to me, I don't know. I mean, If Brand was existed in our real world, no one would ever see him as a neutral guy.\n\nMalzahar on the other hand, knows what he does. Like literally.

She is now very alone in the world.\nNow she is traveling the land to find answers, having to defend herself with stealth and killing everywhere she goes. As she travels her view of humans isn't exactly helped and she sees little but mistreatment of her kind and thus she slowly becomes the character we see today.\n\nThen we have Rakan, a flamboyant performer who loves attention, dance, and song. He wants to hear the songs of the world and wants the world to hear all of his. One day in a mountain village the 2 cross paths while Rakan is putting on one of his shows. Everyone has fallen under Rakan's spell, except for Xayah. This intrigues him and he follows her, helping her out of an ambush. They spend time together and over time and adventures they grow to truly love each other and have each other's backs. Xayah wants to free her people, not kill all humans in a racist crusade. If killing needs to happen, then it will happen. Rakan is not a spineless yes-man. Rakan is Xayah's emotional support while she in turn gives him focus and purpose in life. If Rakan didn't have Xayah then he would be wandering to this day with no rhyme or reason until he eventually died. If Xayah didn't have Rakan then she would be dead or worse by now.

That&#x27;d be pretty big and confusing, don&#x27;t you think?\n\nnope i still think its pretty narcissistic of him. its pretty narrow minded (of him) to think that everyone should have the same view and fall for the same performance.(take one of our own extremely popular singers for example , 10 million might like them but you might hate them and dont find them charming at all)\n\nalso people only see his performance not his personality which should be enough answer for him.maybe she cares more about who i am than how i dance and look? and that exactly was the case here , she saw him as a buffoon at his performace but when she learned who he was she fell for him!!!!\nbut that leads me to question Xayah's judgement and taste as his personality seems pretty...unappealing , judging by his voicelines!\n\nshe is definitely not the only person who didn't fall for him, he just didn't notice them because they didn't catch his own eyes!","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2017-04-13T17:25:53.527+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, I like Rakan's personality. It's fun, goofy, and yet serious when necessary. He has a lot of depth off hte stage, in my opinion.\n\nOn hte topic of him being \"narrow minded\", think of it this way: you've spent your entire life being told one thing. It might be that god exists, it might be that pluto's a planet, whatever it is. You spend your entire life finding people who agree with you on that that when you eventually find an atheist or someone from a religion that doesn't focus around your god, or people decide that pluto's not a planet, it's going to be confusing. You'll want to figure more out about it. He actually tried to figure out what was going on because people only seemed to be interested in him before (he seems to pick her out not for looks and not noticing him, but just for not being interested), so finding someone who didn't just love him at first sight was new. He wanted to learn more about it. It's sort of like that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
