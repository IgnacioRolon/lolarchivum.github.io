Ex. that arrogant Noxian lord in Kled's story doesn't believe in Kled's ideals of insane courage and pure strength, so he saw Kled as an old man. Similarly with Tristana. The Demacians saw Poppy as a great hero, proving that their ideals are the same; they align. Jinx could see Ziggs in his true form because they embody the same ideal; blow up stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal791","date":"2017-09-15T20:52:51.018+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'd think a Yordle would know  this though, and Ziggs appeared to be pretty confused when Jinx could see him for what he is.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-09-15T20:59:09.658+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We know that Ziggs doesn't know this, and such a phenomenon is probably rare.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-09-15T20:57:43.965+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We learned that Heimer is responsible for the Yordle charms, which makes me wonder how Kled got one, or is the charm innate to them as well.\n\nWe know that Ziggs isn't a killer, and that somehow Jinx hasn't killed either yet.\n\nWe get some context on Ziggs' relationship with Heimer.","replies":[{"poster":"underscores222","date":"2017-09-15T21:48:59.655+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe the charm is somewhat innate, but probably they Yordles have some control over what they look like.

Kled seems to have been able to extend his to Skarl in his story, which implies that Heimer could have extended his to Ziggs at the start of this comic just to ensure the customer doesn't break through it.\n\nThe way Riot's described it in the past is that everyone sees Yordles a bit differently.

Before, it was implied that their appearance to most/all humans was because of their innate magical powers. However, in Tristanna's and Kled's color stories, they both appear to humans as crazy old people without any of this \"glamor\" (for those who argue that they did have them, I highly doubt Kled of all yordles would care about whether or not trespassers knew he was a yordle, as he would just kill them). I personally believe that some Demacians can see Poppy as a yordle because \n\n* 1) no one questions how an old lady is swinging a giant hammer, and \n\n* 2) no one asks why this old lady has been around for hundreds of years, \n\nNow I know these were made before the yordles had their magic appearance retcon their stories. Even so, there are only a couple ways Poppy's lore makes sense.\n\n1. Poppy was much younger looking (teens to 30s maybe) when she approached Orlon, which is why he allows her to join the group and bestows upon her the quest of giving the hammer to the hero. And apparently Demacians are cool with an old lady carrying a massive hammer for hundreds of years and not questioning it.\n\n2. Everyone could see her as a yordle because Demacia and reasons, which would mean that despite hating magic, the people are cool with magical creatures.\n\n3. Only a select few can see Poppy as a yordle, such as Orlon (\"for the first time ever, she would reveal herself to a human\"), the little girl who compares her to the statue (\"Look, Da. It's the slayer! The one from the statue!\" PS, this is a really weird line, as the statue looks nothing like Poppy, but this girl somehow thinks Poppy looks like a 7-foot jacked-up dude, but whatever), and Galio. This would make sense as it is never stated than **no** human can see a yordle, otherwise there wouldn't be a term for their race. However this still suffers from the whole \"chill with cool grandma\" part.\n\nAnyways, the Donger probably didn't make a special \"glamor\" thing for Poppy (it probably wouldn't work anyway, as Ziggs barely caught fire and got revealed, and I'm pretty sure Poppy has been in more scrapes than Ziggs ever has), and Poppy's lore is in need of clarification.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jackom1","date":"2017-09-15T17:42:05.188+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"socially lubricate\"\n\nhue","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rivini","date":"2017-09-15T19:24:26.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm confused.

They showed all the yordles except Gnar cowering in fear to whatever the monster was, so it's implied they didn't have the same power as Gnar. Also keep in mind that Gnar is merely four years old.
