Yes he was made unpopular due to nerfs and hardly buffed, but that's because he was no fun to play against at all. This included him being on free week rotation. Weak or strong, no one liked laning against Yorick. Riot has dished out negative comments about him, but that's just because they viewed him as a mistake, like Vlad pre-rework. \n\nI also argue about your claim on his occupation. Take a look at what people see in other Champs; Garen, an unrelenting servant of Justice, Viktor, a cyborg leader of The Evolution, Lucian, the hunter of Undead. Then we have Yorick the Gravedigger. What's he do? He digs graves and summons ghouls, for some reason. His 'I dig graves' theme is one that is of an extremely small niche. I'm sure the reason most played Yorick was for his necromancy-esk feel in gameplay, not \"Oh man he digs graves\"\n\nEverything else you mention is valid to a point, though it can be compared to the Sion rework argument. Riot has kept the things that people asked. They've kept his shovel, his hunch, a sorrowful backstory, his cloak and ditched the small things that no one had talked about, aka the lantern. \n\nBut arguements aside, I'm curious. What would you say is \"loyal to Yorick\"? The idea with the rework was to make his niche a lot more accessible and not restrained to a very small niche of people, which in turn means they'll have to change things from the original to do so.","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2016-08-23T22:35:55.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dr Mercy,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=JX00ydOm,comment-id=000b0002,timestamp=2016-08-23T20:49:09.116+0000)\n>\n> But arguements aside, I&#x27;m curious. What would you say is &quot;loyal to Yorick&quot;? The idea with the rework was to make his niche a lot more accessible and not restrained to a very small niche of people, which in turn means they&#x27;ll have to change things from the original to do so.\n\nThe idea of the rework was to remake the champion, not completely change it with something else.\n\nEvery other major rework kept as much of the original as possible, from Sion being a huge giant with an axe, to Poppy keeping her hammer to Taric being more like Fabio than ever.  Yes, there were changes made, but they tried to keep everything \n\nOutside of the shovel and the ghouls, what did Riot keep from the original champion?  His story reads like a combination of Varus and Lucian, his VO sounds like Kindred 2.0, his outfit is straight out of the Undertaker, circa the Ministry of Darkness, and his shovel comes from Chinese kung-fu.\n\nNow, maybe this New Yorick will appeal to more players and will allow for a healthier gameplay.  That's fine and all, but Yorick was the champion that made me want to play League and financially support them five long years ago.  Now, I'm left without a champion and the company has abandoned me since I'm not buying RP anymore.\n\nMaybe I'm appealing to emotion, but that's where I am with this... thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2016-08-24T00:20:31.206+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Poppy went from a diplomat for Demacia who saw her father got killed to the oblivious-to-the-fact-that-shes-the-True-Hero. Taric went from a Gem Knight from another dimension who ended up in Runeterra as a Celebrity (dont quote me on that) into an exiled demacian soldier who found purpose and meaning on Targon. Sion went from....whatever he was into an unstoppable machine of war, that even death couldn't put down.\n\nMy point is that Champion updates keep the things that are salvageable. Poppy's hammer, wall slam and hard to kill nature was kept. Taric's CD reducing autos, heal, and armor scaling were kept, and even enhanced with his doubling mechanic. Sion.... he kept his axe? The other champs changed a lot in appearance, lore and gameplay, though Poppy and Taric play arguably the same, while they kept the things that players liked.\n\nLike i said in before, people liked the idea of a shovel weapon, so Riot found and designed a realistic shovel weapon that'd make sense fighting wise and lore wise. People liked Yorick's hunch, and now he's weighed down by thousands of souls. People liked his cloaked attire, and he still has it with his new cowl.\n\nNow, i need to clarify something. A lot of people were not happy with the Sion rework or the Poppy rework. Their main arguement was \"Omg rito they used to act like melee burst mages before but now they're fighter/tanks now wtf\". First of all, those people need to fuck off. Second of all, it's a testament to what we give up to help a character, because what people liked about them wasn't what they should be thematic wise. \n\nPoppy was originally meant to be a fighter but people played and enjoyed her as a literally unkillable burst mage. Sion was originally a fighter as well, but people used and abused his scalings as burst mage. Riot didn't think much of it then because they were still popping out characters every other week or something, but you can notice a trend. People were playing them in roles that clashed in their thematic.\n\nSion, thematic wise, was meant to an unkillable undead soldier. Thematically, that doesn't translate into burst mage. Poppy was meant to be a determined, my way or the highway, Diplomat. That doesn't translate into burst mage either. Yorick, is kinda the opposite in this approach. Yorick's theme was gravedigger who summoned ghosts for.... some reason.  His gameplay matches that summoning aspect, but how did it match \"I'm a gravedigger\"? New Yorick has a reason to dig graves and summon creatures, and use them in a story format. Old Yorick did not.\n\nMaybe you really like Gravediggers, I'm not to judge, but his theme was changed to match his gameplay in different fashion. He is no longer JUST a gravedigger, although he still digs graves for those who have passed. He uses those who have died, like he did before with his ghouls, as a weapon against his enemies, albeit in a slightly different but similar  way.\n\nIn the end to sum it up, yes, Riot has moved his theme a bit to the left, but it's the same in spirit. Yorick is no longer JUST a gravedigger. He still buries the dead, but that isn't his sole thematic anymore. He has a reason now. Old Yorick did not have a reason other than \"I bury the dead lol\". \n\nJesus christ what did i write.\n\nEdit: The female voice is the Ult's voice, The Maiden i believe.
