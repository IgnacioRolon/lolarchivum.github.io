We are not asking for you to include her on the VGU list or to drop everything you are doing to work on her. The Karma community is asking the Riot Game Developers to stop being ignorant about Karma and communicate with us.\n\nThe type of work you are doing on Karma and have done on her since day 1 of her rework, is not right. Every single numbers buff you have given Karma has been nerfed. The rework you have given Karma has ruined what gameplay TRUE Karma mains loved about her. Now Karma is nothing more than an E+R shield bot with no gameplay and a boring theme. Karma goes from being a somewhat decent mage early game, who is probably way too strong early game, to doing absolutely nothing mid to later game . . . . other than shielding your allies.\n\nPlease stop treating Karma mains like a disease and completely ignoring any threads about Karma and not communicating with us at all for 4 years. We don't want excuses as to why you are not working on her. We do not want an answer as to when you are going to work on her.  We don't want comments of you telling us how much you care about Karma.

I was just catching up on some of my old messages. \n\nThe reason I haven't said much personally about Karma is that I haven't talked much with the design team about Karma so I don't want to misrepresent there thoughts on her. She currently isn't a high priority for ChampUp either so she doesn't come up a lot in conversations on out team.\n\nI can tell you my personal thoughts on Karma though. I think Karma is in a pretty good spot right now. Could she be improved? Sure. But there are many champions in a worse spot then Karma at the moment. At this point there are a lot of players that like new Karma just as there are players that preferred her pre-rework. We would really have to do a full VGU on her to make both parties happy. \n\nCurrently she is in much better shape then a lot of other champions that need a VGU. She sees play in mid and support and has some unique things going on in her kit. \n\nThis isn't to say that LGP will or won't do smaller work on her some day as I can't speak for that team. I can say that outside of her upcoming skin splash art update ChampUp doesn't have any plans for Karma in the near future.\n\nProbably not the answer you wanted to hear but I thought a answer was better then no answer.","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2017-01-12T22:06:01.184+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for taking the time!\n\n> I think Karma is in a pretty good spot right now. Could she be improved? Sure. But there are many champions in a worse spot then Karma at the moment.\n\nIf you care about balance and fairness, she probably is.\nIf you care about identity and playstyle, she is in one of the worst spots she has ever been in. I can understand why this isn't any of your concern or high priority, but this needs to be acknowledged.\n\n> We would really have to do a full VGU on her to make both parties happy.\n\nProbably. In the meantime some tweaking to her kit would do the trick.\nLike removing the unnecessary super-root from 5.10 that makes her a Disruptor for no reason.\nOr adressing why shieldbomb was removed. Seeing a Rioter do this would make my day!\n\n> She sees play in mid and support and has some unique things going on in her kit.\n\nShe used to be played mainly in midlane (~60-80%). \nNow she is played mainly as support (75%)\nThat was not her intended role and is indicative of some missjudged changes to her kit.\n\n> Probably not the answer you wanted to hear but I thought a answer was better then no answer.\n\nI appreciate it. This must have taken a considerable chunk out of your day and I don't see this as your job, so thank you again. But also please understand that these are mostly non-answers, that still leave us in the dark about why you removed shieldbomb, why you added a super root, why pushed her into support so hard.
