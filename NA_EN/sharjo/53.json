For instance, his current design is pretty straightforward, i mean his new splash art is amazing, but hes kind of just this werewolf with some armor.\nI guess what i mean is, will his theme change? like going from basic werewolf to hextech werewolf, something more representative to zaun or something else entirely?\n\nAlso i think he needs some thematic hook to really distinguish him from other anthropomorphs like nasus and rengar. Nasus is permanently in his werejackal form, and rengar im sure we can assume is from a race of kittymen (unless he is secretly a housecat ascendant?), at first glance one might assume that warwick isnt even a werewolf but perhaps just part of a race of wolfmen, which i feel completely cuts out the core of what his character is, which is a human who paid a price for power that is slowly consuming him, which we could then see why he wants to so desperately cure himself\n\nPersonally i would like to see him become a gnar-like transforming champ that starts off in human form and transitions into a beastial werewolf form after being in combat for a time, say after he gets 8 stacks of his passive his next attack has X bonus range and causes him to dash while transforming into a werewolf or something badass like that! I mean what better champ than a werewolf character to be a rage based transformer?\nThis would also introduce the players to the human side of warwick so that we can get an idea on what the before and after effects of his transformation are, and what he has had to give up to attain his power. also in lore he was a badass man hunter without the transformation, then afterwards is supposed to be even more badass, so it would be great if his werewolf form truly represented that badassery by being his powermode.\n\nIm sure you guys have a ton of ideas already, but i just really wanted you all to consider this direction before its too late!","replies":[{"poster":"InvadingOreo","date":"2016-05-13T04:14:25.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on current WW lore. he was a human.
