The lore is PART of your game, so it is kinda mind-boggling why I wouldn't get the information about the characters when I have the game open. (That is, by the way, an issue not limited to the lore, there is a number of game-related information that is simply unavailable in the game client that really should be there, i.e. stat-scaling of abilities).\n\nPlus, I'm sorry to say, the site-design is...kinda horrible. Not quite mtv.com-level but we're getting there.

There's no search function, you have no archive and if there is a PM-function I have yet to figure out where it is or how it works...but at least the Tribunal still has a non-functioning link at the bottom of the page, I guess.\n\nAnd again, this is not limited to lore. If I want to point out to other forum users that your company promised a non-draft-version of NCS, I have to do almost journalistic work to find the accomodating article.\n\nAnd if google does a better job at making your content accesible than your own site...well, there's really no nice way of putting that, is there?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-04-04T18:17:48.816+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"His lore will be big and beautiful, but it'll be on the website, not in the client.
