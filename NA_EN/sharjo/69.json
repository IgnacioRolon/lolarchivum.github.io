Although I'm a little upset that rather than wanting to take essence to become human, she does it because she's an addict. And rather than becoming human, she wants to become a civilized person.\n\n* The fortune teller who tells Ahri what these mysterious Sunstone pieces are while trying to thieve a tail off of her. \n\nI like this one, it shows how she interacts with people and gives her a destination or end goal, as well as how she deals with adversity. Charming foes into submission, just like the Ahri we all know and love.\n\n* The Garden, where she tries to forcefully forget how she murdered her love. \n\nThis one has its good and bad to me. It seems so _centralizing_ to her new character. While it does highlight the moral quandary she has between taking life essence or not, it's merely because she's _addicted_ to the euphoric effects and power it gives her, rather than serving a purpose. My own personal _problems_ aside, Ahri never felt like a character to take a lover in the first place. If anything, it always felt like she'd be one for lust over love. In fact, as Sharjo said that \"...there aren't many better ways to teach someone the gravity of their actions than the death of a loved one\", makes me feel as the writer _only_ gave Ahri a former lover as there was no other character who could fulfill a similar role as she has/had no important friends or family.\n\nI feel like this will just make Ahri into this generic \"tragic, mopey heroine\" archetype with how she deals with coping over the murder, rather than her original theme of the moral issues involved with taking life essence for her own machinations. If she ever gets a VO Update, I feel as if it's going to contain lines like \"I can't forget him...\" or how she's still in love with him which isn't what she was about.\n\n**Now on to the important part of this comment**: What you say about how this event will affect Ahri and how it will shape her, sounds like a good thought, seems unresolved. I don't know if there will be future lore additions (Sharjo pls), but right now it seems like her main theme revolves around dealing with the trauma of murdering her lover, rather than the guilt of stealing essence in general which isn't Ahri imo. We also don't know when that event happened in relation to the lore's present time either.\n\nWill we ever get to see her without the weight of the event on her shoulders? Will she ever be able to love another person again? (Don't give her a new lover either >_>). I would have been pretty happy with the lore update if that full story didn't happen and another champion got it.\n\nEdit: After being talked to by a friend about this, he says that The Garden actually shows her accepting what she did which I feel that's what your comment is talking about a little more. Perhaps I didn't put away enough bias or I'm poor at analyzing literature but I personally don't see acceptance here. Maybe with how she chose to live and remember despite the pain, rather than die and forget.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2017-04-26T04:25:52.234+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmaoo\n\nif you ever meet a real girl I hope you don't get hung up on her exs like that","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-04-25T19:40:22.313+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wukong is still Wukong and he's color text is the best for character imo.

They keep nearly everything about the original stories intact, but update them with more implications about the world as a whole.\n\n{{champion:103}}: Love how they kept the theme of an inhuman struggling with humanity, though actually give a little more depth then just \"seductress demon who turned out totally good after feeling guilty\". She still has fangs that she uses, but she uses them with an actual purpose now.\n{{champion:107}}: Really great improvement over just being some random stray cat person that some nameless dude adopted. If anything, I think his backstory might directly parallel with Kha'Zix's; both started their life on Runeterra as weak, feeble creatures, but over time through hunting in the harsh wilderness they became apex predators. Makes their rivalry all the more intense since they're basically reflections of each other.\nI think there was typo though in which the backstory referred to Kha'Zix as the \"wily beast beast\", unless \"beast beast\" is some way his tribe calls strong prey (doubt it though). Also, although the story hammers in the experience of being hunted by Rengar really well, I don't know why that kid in the tent was a thing. The kid was quickly forgotten about and was entirely useless, not even serving as the point of motivation for Rengar to kill the beast. I feel it was just added to try to artificially create sentimental value rather than actually being an integral part of the narrative.\n{{champion:267}}: So glad they finally just confirmed the Marai and the Lunari work in tandem, and I'm also wondering if the abyss has anything to do with the Void (it's constantly described as a _hungry_ darkness, its has proximity to Targon which is another point where the Voidborn are coming through, and we have Kog'Maw whose epithet is still \"the Mouth of the _Abyss_\"). It also makes me wonder why the Aspect of the Moon needs the abyssal pearl. If both sides truly wanted to stop the encroaching darkness you'd think the Lunari would just give the Marai a Moonstone every now and then, but there's a specific trade that has to be there for more than just monetary value. An intriguing dynamic I hope will be expounded upon sooner or later. \nAnyway, I absolutely fell in love with Nami's personality when she was talking to the villagers in the short story. It's endearing without going over the top, and actually kind of makes me want to play her just to listen to her voiceover again.\n{{champion:62}}: Probably my favorite of the vastayan updates so far. I love that we actually see how Wukong and Yi are best bros, as well as the development of Wukong's fighting style. The story really accentuated Wukong's personality through the short story; great job on the writer's part on retaining our bold, mischievous, self-confident, and silly Monkey King. \"The Wacky Adventures of Yi and Kong\" needs to be a serial one day.","replies":[{"poster":"Tattersall","date":"2017-04-25T22:22:11.696+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> “Friend, of cour–”\n“–HERETIC!” the elder shouted.\n“–Fiend!
