For instance, I didn't know that Cassiopeia had a lore piece added until I was debating vigilantism the other day and they called her a Noxian vigilante and linked it. While I won't go into how diametrically opposing it is for a woman who tried to murder her scout to get to a priceless artifact and who once was a puppet master of Noxian aristocracy is now patrolling the streets saving innocents, it would have been nice to be notified of this addition. Perhaps an announcement bubble like you do for the known errors and bugs, except specifically for newly added lore pages and bios, or even some sort of in-client scrolling ticker for lore additions.\n\nThat does lead me to something I'm a bit upset about with the new lore. That would be Zac. Zac has *always* been this upbeat happy character from Zaun, which actually gives him and the city some personality as not being a city that's totally consumed by death, drudgery, and malaise. In your story, you've pushed him away from being an upbeat character, and by killing his parents, you've turned him into this slimy edgelord Batman of Zaun, and that kinda ruins him pretty hard. Could you perhaps rewrite this story so as to preserve his happy go lucky attitude (i.e. not kill everyone he loves), and to give us more diversity in your character development? It's getting a tad old that every single champion is starting to be founded on tragedy and vengeance.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-01-12T20:20:36.530+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not seeing the edgelord part.

If you didn't know better, you'd say MF won't have an impact ever since she's just a walking pair of boobs with guns but she did and even against The Harrowing when literally a touch from a single wraith could burn and kill you.\n\nRyze? Ryze can have stories interacting with any champion as long as it won't be a grand scale event since he's on a solo-quest so i doubt he'd get tangled in some war between Demacia and Noxus.
