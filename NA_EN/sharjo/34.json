However, while I am resigned to confronting Riot's poor decision, there may yet be hope. Viktor's narrative has always involved people stealing something from him and twisting it to their own ends, such as Urgot. I noticed there is no mention of Viktor anywhere despite the fact that his name would be first and foremost associated with the Glorious Evolution.\n\nIt may be possible that Viktor's concept of The Glorious Evolution has been perverted by the population at large within Zaun, especially by the poor and desperate. I can easily see Viktor providing augmentations to those who willingly volunteer to be altered, more than likely not improving their life, while also trying to spread the word that augmentations can not only help but enhance someone's existence. Viktor educates, lectures, but people pick up on the wrong idea, they take what should be objective fact and twist it into salvation.\n\nOnce more, the world spoils Viktor's vision.\n\n> Like, the acolytes are literally copies of the Techpriests from WH40K\n\nI'm not surprised, considering one of member of the narrative team is known for his works in the 40K universe. Unfortunate, I suppose, though I've always suspected something of the sort from the moment Viktor was joined by acolytes. I never thought it was so extreme though.","replies":[{"poster":"333lom","date":"2016-11-29T21:04:18.246+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your idea is my lifeline, but I highly doubt it.

Bundled offerings were wrapped in linen, some of it fine, some of it oily and ragged. A few flies buzzed among the discarded pieces of the congregation. One of the wrapped bundles moved. A little plague rat poked its nose out shortly after, daring me to take away its prize. The gauze of the newfound treasure caught on the edge, and the rest of the bundle tumbled away, revealing a desiccated finger. The rat scampered down, but Brother Zavier shooed it back into the darkness.\n\n>The Glorious Evolved celebrated the old Zaunite tradition of sacrificing something personal for Progress Day in the hopes the next iteration of invention would be better.
