I'm doing a project for school where we have to debunk an initial belief by the general public (in this case, that this animation is 'bad') and show that it is totally NOT the case. I'm always fascinated and amazed by the animations Riot does, from the animation workshop to the music videos (so many different animation styles. . . you people are insane), and I really want to show how difficult and amazing it is to produce an animation of this caliber. Or any animation in general. AND LUX: BINDING LIGHT IS PRODUCED IN FREAKING CELL TOO!!!!

I originally wanted to be an artist and then I got into programming.  I decided programming was a better career path and that art was a better hobby.  As such art is something I do in my free time, so I try very hard to keep it separated from anything work related.\n\nI am also very good at copying styles and don't have one of my own to stick with.  I can replicate pretty much any style if I spend a few hours working with it (other than cartoon for some reason) but I am not a very self motivated artist.  It all adds up to me not being self motivated to make art very often and possessing a preference to building off other people's ideas/works.\n\nFun and all but nothing that would make good content for others to watch, plus attending a programming/animation school and having had art oriented friends around me made me a bit self conscious when it comes to posting anything that isn't just joke art.\n\nSo no, I don't really have a collection of art anywhere, and most of the art that I do keep on is just stuff that I worked on to pick up a new style out of boredom.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIt does make me good at stuff like this though since I have a base to work with and I can quite easily fill in the missing frames with a highly similar art style which is why I kinda want to do it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Splision","date":"2017-05-19T18:18:52.966+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still got chills even though it wasn't a full blown cinematic.","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2017-05-19T18:22:58.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same, even though I didn't like it that much.

That means there is no _\"pattern\"_ among the particulars of the champs depicted or even which champs will be represented next. The fact that they are _\"poster children\"_ is purely coincidental. Plus the previous three videos had a teaser for the next animation and now with Lux's release there isn't one.
