With Warwick though, we don't really have any indicator that he himself has been harmed in any way by the criminal element, beyond Singed who is probably working alone. Were that his motivating factor (revenge), he would just kill Singed and be done with it. Rather, it would seem his good deeds were insufficient in making life better due to the sheer criminal superiority and control. In the wake of his mutation, it's likely he realized that he has the power now to end this kind of activity by fighting fire with fire, viciously murdering criminals, which may be exactly what Singed was hoping for.\n\nI'd say he's more akin to Yagami Light than Punisher. Light had power basically handed to him to make things better, and he did for a bit, but then his ego got the better of him and it spiraled out or control.
