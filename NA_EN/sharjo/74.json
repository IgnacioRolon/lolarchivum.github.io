Maybe a bit disappointed by this whole \"his old soul is dead\" business, but I can see it becoming a good hook for a further plot-line. And well, he's an A-hole for denouncing Leona, but ok, why not. As I said, no strong feelings.\n\nBut on Leona, I have mixed feelings. On one hand, the new write-ups are much more detailed, fleshed-out than before, probably a bit less clichéd too, and that's great. On the other hand, Leona was the compassionate and fierce warrior that arose to fight the zealous tenets of her own Rakkor tribe. Now, the Rakkor are better, but she is the zealot herself among the Solari (at least in the beginning), and I find the story of the \"golden boy\" less striking than her old Judgment piece: in the old piece, she had to actively go against customs and stand out for what she believed was right. In the new one, she was trained to fight warriors and monsters, so when she sees a young scared boy, as a decent human being she helps him. Much less heroic, if you ask me.\n\nSo... good job on the write-ups, they are great, but not sure I really like the new direction taken with Leona's lore.\n\nThank you :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spitemaster","date":"2016-02-25T22:58:04.792+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm rather disappointed with the new Leona lore.  In the old lore, she was selfless and compassionate - the flaws in her character were more aligned with being too compassionate and perhaps lacking the will to kill.  Now, that's all gone.  There's nothing that makes her stand out.\n\nI know that (one of) the stated goal(s) of the lore rewrites is to keep what's core to the character, and that that's not always easy because people disagree on what that is.  But I'm honestly confused as to what parts of her character were (intended to be) kept.  Her old lore was almost entirely centred around protecting the weak, and that doesn't appear at all.  The incident with the golden boy reads more as enchantment than mercy.  Even if it's mercy, it doesn't give any sense that mercy is part of her character.  If you read it as mercy, it's more of 'that one time Leona failed in her duty'.\n\nThe second part of her lore doesn't add that either.  She's not really protecting people at cost to herself, but merely because they are more or less under her authority.\n\nOn the other hand, I like the Diana and Pantheon lore - it definitely makes Diana in particular a much deeper character, and it gives a much better view of Mount Targon overall.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and the splash pictures are weirdly stretched.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2016-02-25T20:38:27.551+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"> The beast had tasted her blood and hissed with predatory hunger.
