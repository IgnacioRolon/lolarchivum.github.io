This is why, whenever there is a lore rewrok/vgu it feels like there is only hate.  People loved DFG, people loved old Yorick, people LOVED it when their champion was broken, and simply having a machine killer for a champion has no place in universe Riot seems to want to build.  An existence that is there only to kill with no goal is unrelatable and does not fit with the location they're tied to.  Orianna being an augmented being is right in line Piltover seems to be taking.  Frankly, the majority of the lore was short, not thought out, and tied to pocket instances in time and space in such a way that many champions would never have met.  Riot's new vision seems to focus HEAVILY on interactions other champions, and I predicted this lore change when the Piltover rework was announced.  Riot likes champions with heart, and well, Orianna had 0 personality, only around 7 voice lines, and somehow, there is still a lot of hate about updating lore.  I enjoy a more fleshed out universe over a champion remaining a machine killer.  While it may be sad to see them go, seeing a future where all the champions actually interact with one another seems a much more attractive proposition.  + most people go for look and gameplay in a champion.  Especially the older ones.  You can tell in those entries that universe building wasn't part of the manifesto at the time.","replies":[{"poster":"deceptopus","date":"2016-12-09T01:20:36.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You mean the old lore that had a central driving force to push the various different characters together that would otherwise have no reason to interact?

It was essentially the player playing god with that world.  Now while there are gods in that world, the human player should not be one of them.  It also makes more sense when they interact now, instead of saying 'Hey I saw you on the rift, we killed each other top lane' now it's 'Hey, I fought with you against the Black mist during the Harrowing.\"  I think the new lore gives a much better opportunity to get characters to give a real interaction without the summoner's interference.  The IoW was such an asspull idea that I'm surprised it didn't exist in like Fairy Tail or something.  Also, Viktor's Shtick wasn't augmentation, that's like saying teemo's shtick was being a Yordle.  His shtick was being a scientist who believed that augmention would cure human weakness, that it would better humanity.  Orianna did not hijack Viktor's area at all; instead, she provides him with confirmation: augmentation is the future of mankind.  Orianna's was born from necessity, Viktor's will be done for the purpose of evolution.  Orianna is still purely mechanical-not a trace is left of the old body she had.  I feel like a former person in  a robot's body is a far more interesting deal than a killer robot made to fulfill a dead girl's dreams.  We don't even know Blitzcrank anymore, he's a Zaunite whose lore is going to change in the Zaun update.  The old lore was very short, full of holes, and didn't give a shit about being a cohesive universe.  The new lore binds the champions together.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MetalGearTeemu","date":"2016-12-08T03:01:36.359+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still wait patiently for Demacia and Noxus to get their focus. \n\nI want to see if Garen's growing disquiet over the path Demacia's nobility is taking the kingdom leads to Rugged Garen becoming his exiled cannon. {{champion:86}}","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2016-12-08T03:16:58.225+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wishful thinking has me wanting a Noxus and Demacia update too. \n\nThe problem however is although Demacia has very little lore for itself and its associated champs.

Spot on Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2016-12-08T02:18:08.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been appreciating the little ways they build up the interconnections of the lore recently, and the way they lay out some interesting teases. they've also been reinventing a lot of little bits of the characters in ways that make a lot of sense (C is no longer a superthief, now much more likely to be Camille, Ezreal no longer was some mage student)\n\nsome thoughts:\n\nOrianna went from replica of a daughter to someone who replaced every bit of herself with machinery. this fits Piltover more but 1) I wont be surprised if its another lore faux pas with diehard orianna lovers, 2) Orianna and her dad can make a new brain but a heart is too complicated? we make new hearts all the time, your machine hands are way more impressive Orianna\n\nCaitlin's lore does a pretty respectable job of marrying her lore status as a sheriff with her look and gameplay, which is much more that of a hunter. \n\nVi's lore has some teases about Jinx but I thought the most interesting thing was that her original gauntlets were basically Blitzcrank hands, and Blitzcrank is probably one of the construction golems mentioned in her bio. the bio skips over a lot though, in the name of telling that story later. \n\nJayce is Iron Man. Also curious what the crystal was. I guess I like the new ties to Viktor\n\nEzreal's bio is a little bit of a reinvention with a nice little arc to it- he no longer has latent mage powers, but hes a smart kid who doesn't need to work hard, until he does, blah blah blah. I liked learning a little about the glove and where it comes from. \n\nOverall I wish more short stories would try to add a few more layers to each character, something I think they did well with Camille. But ezreal and vi, for example, have short stories about them doing very very 'archetypal' ezreal and vi things, where I think a bit of nuance that shows a new side of those characters might've been more interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"Papa Andrei","date":"2016-12-08T06:08:42.197+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Crystal was part of a Dream Crystal from Skarners people, you can see Jayce describe the crystal as \"Singing\" to him, and that it is from Shurima.","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2016-12-08T06:10:09.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh thanks I totally missed the singing thing. still, kinda weird since I thought they figured out hextech like 60 years ago from those crystals. why would they be struggling with it now?","replies":[{"poster":"Papa Andrei","date":"2016-12-08T06:19:58.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well in the league world, Hextech is relatively new, and very very unrefined. Skarner just woke up when the first of his crystals were touched and he is now defending the actual nests. But this isn't a crystal that houses a Skarner thing (Forgot the name) its just a crystal made by the same species, probably a long dead and harvested one that was forgotten and leftover.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2016-12-08T05:13:56.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo, I had the EXACT same thought about Orianna (and even posted about it in another thread). I am expected to believe they made her a new BRAIN but not a heart. That's actually insane. The brain is INCREDIBLY complex, humans are STILL trying to figure out things about the brain.\n\nI dunno, that's the only thing that bothered me, really. Everything else was quite pleasant and not jarring at all. I'm glad the ass-factor was turned way up for Jayce, I literally can't stand him and that is exactly how it should be.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thorgram","date":"2016-12-08T00:24:27.748+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vi and Caitlyn are really great. It's cool that they kept the mystery of \"C\". For Vi, the mystery of her parents and her sister is still obsure, hope they will feed us some of it.\n\nPretty interesting that Jayce heard the Dreamsong. His story is good, just not my cup of tea with Viktor.\n\nEzreal is pretty nice. But what about the second gauntlet ? \n\nOrianna is cool. They took a different stance towards her \"humanity\", but it has some pretty cool moments.","replies":[{"poster":"Papa Andrei","date":"2016-12-08T06:09:55.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I loooooove how now Viktor and Jayce were like friends at a time, and I can easily see a \"Civil War\" Style fight between the two, with so much emotions.
