This didn't happen for me until I updated to 6.19. I can't even do custom games without it popping up with gamesplat. \nTo make sure I have done the following :\n1. checked minimum requirement\n2. updated graphics drivers, DirectX, windows (were all up-to-date)\n3. reinstalled .net framework 3.5 \n4. repaired game files\n5. performed a clean boot\n6. reset my graphics card software\n7. (can't change game settings if i can't enter the game can I?)\n8. Disabled debug version of directX\n9. Also have reinstalled the game 4 times.\n\nnow if theres something else you can think of I'd love to hear. Cause I'm out of options.","replies":[{"poster":"Tox√≠c  Riven","date":"2016-09-28T22:30:03.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I followed the same steps and I still can't load into bot games or regular games. It bugsplats after champion select every time. Very frustrating. After a windows update last night I haven't been able to log in, but all of the settings seem to be the same as before.

I even wiped my computer because I thought there might be a program interfering with it. I installed LoL and it still doesn't work. Does it have something to do with it being windows 10? I believe my computer updated to windows 10 without even asking me because I switched my tv screen from the firestick to use netflix because the firestick wasn 't working and it was updating windows so I couldn't use my computer. Then after it was done LoL was giving me the bug splat error. The night before I was playing LoL just fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QUANTEYES","date":"2016-09-28T07:37:54.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/NAXe6XfY-i-may-have-figured-out-the-crashing-problem-guys\n\nTry that buddy, hope it works !","replies":[]}]}
