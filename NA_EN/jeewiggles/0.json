This is why disconnections are all treated equally and why penalties cannot be modified in any way. \n\nWhile I cannot remove your penalty, if you give me more details on your crash, such as error messages or specific behavior, I can help you resolve that and prevent this from happening again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DANXTHEXNINJY","date":"2016-09-25T13:31:11.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish there was but i know of none.
