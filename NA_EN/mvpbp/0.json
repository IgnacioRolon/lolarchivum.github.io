But I've also seen some Rioters on the boards suggest that you make one attempt to defuse the situation and then mute if it doesn't work.\n\nIt think there is are ways to talk-it-out with toxic individuals without being toxic yourself (and without seeming argumentative and getting reported by teammates). But it's certainly a lot harder than staying mute. I'm pretty sure though, that if even if you get reported for defending yourself, you won't get punished as long as you stay away from insults and chat spamming. There are ways to defuse a situation without just muting.\n\nI don't think the Riot's report system and reform system are all that bad. But there's more they could do on the side of setting a good example. There's plenty of feedback from Riot about what not to do, and why people get punished, but not much help with what you SHOULD do instead. Some people aren't going to be satisfied with just \"If you don't have anything good to say, say nothing at all\" because some people just want to talk things out, one way or another. But we have very little info from Riot regarding the positive ways to talk things out -- It's easier for them to just focus on blocking the obvious negative stuff, and to let the community work out the rest.","replies":[{"poster":"AriCei","date":"2017-09-18T07:24:21.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"you won't get punished as long as you stay away from insults and chat spamming\"\n\nExcept this parameter is community defined via the automated system, and the community is extremely sensitive and vindictive.
