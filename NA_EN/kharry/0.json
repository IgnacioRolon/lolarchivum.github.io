Although I&#039;m still not exactly good with it still. I understand all of kha&#039;s mechanics and I can carry quite well when fed as kha&#039;zix or when I snowball lanes especially when I&#039;ve camped them alot in early game; however I&#039;ve started to notice even if I camp lanes e.g. top or mid either the bot lane or 1 of my camped lanes suddenly ends up int feeding or making simple mistakes over and over resulting into a loss game.\r\n\r\nAs a result I went from S3 50lp to demoted S4 32lp and apparently now have an MMR of bronze 1 when only 2-3 days ago I was S3 MMR.\r\n\r\nTake for example my most recent game my team comp was:\r\n{{champion:86}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:67}} \r\n\r\nVS\r\n{{champion:2}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:99}} \r\n\r\nI was carrying with 13/3/0 and we were trading pretty well, I had shut down mid and gank top however lux would get fed up if ahri would stick around and get greedy on cs at low health so that&#039;s typical and our poppy would often try and push on her own and lead to be inting enemy team due to no vision.\r\n\r\nHowever by mid game we had not taken any turrets and the enemy team had taken 4 plus the 2 drakes. What ended up happening was the enemy lux would carry their team through misplays on my team but I just don&#039;t understand even though I shut down 1 almost two lanes that suddenly a couple of deaths from 2 champs can lead to a reversal of the game situation. \r\n\r\nI notice this alot in many of my games now. We do well in teamfights but then the team doesn&#039;t get any turrets resulting in us being pushed back whilst enemy takes more objectives. \r\n\r\nI know the matchmaking system is meant to work against you to lower your WR to under 50% but I have to ask why does it then decide to push it further to force me into even lower divisions and matches myself with teams that even if I do carry the game still ends up in a throw?","replies":[{"poster":"carcaroff","date":"2018-02-03T00:09:45.041+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because the MMR and matchmaking system rito developed is, like many other systems in real life too, elitist and designed to keep the masses stuck and have only few people enjoying the good games.\n\nThere is a HUGE amount of statistical evidence of how the sytem is designed to make streaks happen, you're not crazy and definitely not alone, numbers and evidence are with you, at least, so you know you're right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-02T23:57:17.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"It does not.\n\nThe number of wins and losses have to be exactly equal - the system is not rigged to favor losses, because that is utterly impossible.","replies":[{"poster":"Kharry","date":"2018-02-03T10:42:08.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Explain then how I can do near perfect on my ganking camping both and mid and top lanes so that my laners are snowballing and yet through a couple of deaths in mid and bot lane to their adc / mid laner suddenly that massive snowball becomes a snowflake? \n\nI can tell you the reason why.

She would constantly stay in lane with low health after just surviving a trade but she had no pots so when she then attempted to zone out the enemy lux who more than 3/4 health. Lux stomped her.

I've tried going back to ranked multiple times but it's always the same. It was never a question of whether I was good enough for the rank I wanted, it was a question of if the people around me are ready to be carried (as smug as that sounds). I skyrocketed to promos from just playing 2 games dozens of times last season (after placements of course) but I just couldn't win promos for anything. Every single time I would get 2+ afks or inters that started from the gate. My mmr tanked and one game I even went 8/0/16 at something like 12 minutes because I managed to gank every single lane twice. Couldn't get my allies to attack a single tower. They would just slow push and leave while going for kills. It was ridiculous. Enemy grouped as 5 and 25 minutes in my allies still hadn't grouped up even though we had the better teamfight. A few games later I quit for the season.\n\nAnother time I was one-tricking Lux and I got to the point where if I wasn't the jungler (This was the time of declaring your roles) I knew my jungler would NEVER take dragon or baron and my support would NEVER ward near it so I watched and learned what times enemies in my elo took them most frequently and began warding there at that time in places that gave me vision of dragon but were not easily swept by red trinket. I learned how to steal those objectives 8/10 times because enemies with smite weren't expecting my full combo's damage. We'd still lose from the same problem. I can give 250% but if my allies are all wet noodles what good does it do solo?","replies":[]}]}
