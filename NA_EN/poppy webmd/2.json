And btw the early damage of q is actually laughable, it has such low damage early that getting hit by it is more annoying than actually something to fear.\n\nIt's unfair to simply state the energy cost of the ability without stating the many parts of it that make the energy cost less important. For a start, her Q is her only energy cost other than her 10 cost E, making it immediately less impressive.\n\nIt's also very noteworthy that her Q would be a fairly powerful ability even if it was on an 8-second cooldown, and you can't simply replace that with an energy cost which takes 8 seconds to get back. Doing so isn't accounting for all the extra energy you get from her passive, the energy regeneration on her W and the quick regeneration of energy to top that, especially when she can stealth for so long in her W to get back energy. An Akali can definitely spam her Q a lot more than the \"high energy cost\" argument would make you believe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2018-09-12T04:21:33.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q->auto in repetition in the laning phase is what makes the low cooldown kinda lame.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-09-10T22:51:03.306+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"otherwise","replies":[]},{"poster":"DearPear","date":"2018-09-11T10:01:20.835+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Frustrating?
