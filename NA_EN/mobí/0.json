Just how long should I have to wait during a \"high volume of support requests\" to get something like this looked at? I really feel like there's some injustice at hand here (and all of my friends had agreed that I was banned for an absolutely absurd reason and seemingly misunderstood reason.) I would really appreciate it if this could get looked at, as I play for a school team, and its hard to play without an account to play on.\r\n\r\nI can provide the \"reason,\" or chat log, for why I was banned, and my support ticket ID if necessary.\r\n\r\nThank you so much","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-12T16:14:59.663+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our PB team has a higher volume right now, but we will definitely get back to you as soon as we can.
