From 300 fps to 30 fps. IT'S UNPLAYABLE. I had it every game since the event came out, and i asked every game in All-chat if it happend to anyone else and they all said it did. Please fix this issue and please do not point me to that FPS-guide. It doesn't work i tried it.","replies":[{"poster":"IRON LP SLAVE","date":"2017-01-24T02:52:27.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same","replies":[]},{"poster":"lucuh","date":"2017-01-22T15:03:14.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im getting the exact same thing, drops from 144 stable cos i lock it to barely hitting 50,\nusually a reconnect fixes it for me but thats not a permanent fix","replies":[{"poster":"RightClickzOnly","date":"2017-01-22T15:07:52.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lucà,realm=EUW,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=1dENLpAm,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-22T15:03:14.524+0000)\n>\n> im getting the exact same thing, drops from 144 stable cos i lock it to barely hitting 50,\n> usually a reconnect fixes it for me but thats not a permanent fix\n\nReconnecting only fixes it for 2 minutes. My fps goes up to 120, and then after 2 minutes back to 30 FPS. It's a joke.","replies":[{"poster":"lucuh","date":"2017-01-22T15:48:41.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yup, just played a game and 3 people on my team were having the same thing, just not gonna play till they fix it","replies":[{"poster":"RightClickzOnly","date":"2017-01-22T16:27:17.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lucà,realm=EUW,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=1dENLpAm,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-22T15:48:41.433+0000)\n>\n> yup, just played a game and 3 people on my team were having the same thing, just not gonna play till they fix it\n\nI am testing around a bit. Did anyone on the game had a warring kingdoms skin, ward or even summoner icon? I think it has something to do with it.","replies":[{"poster":"lucuh","date":"2017-01-22T17:59:28.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i played 2 games and lagged in both of them and in only 1 of the games someone was using the new vi skin so idk about that","replies":[{"poster":"RightClickzOnly","date":"2017-01-22T18:30:01.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lucà,realm=EUW,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=1dENLpAm,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-22T17:59:28.542+0000)\n>\n> well i played 2 games and lagged in both of them and in only 1 of the games someone was using the new vi skin so idk about that\n\nI tried something. I have the azir warring kingdoms skin. But that seems not the problem. However, i also have that new ward skin. Whenever i have that on the map the fps starts dropping. i can confirm this. I did several games without fps drops.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-23T03:00:21.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm seeing reports from other players that they also only experienced this with the *Crest of the Rooster Ward Skin*.
