However after using that like 10 times it will eventually break too . Didnt try to build it into another zhonya to check if you can have 2 separate zhonyas , but i got a replay of it since after noticing this bug i finished the botgame in order to get the replay . Sent that to bug report thing but no response yet tho and cant send replays to them.","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2017-11-30T02:25:11.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for sending us a bug report and for the extra detail here. \n\nSending those reports in through the client bug reporting tool or the \"bug splat\" prompt if you crash is the MOST helpful thing you can do to help us catch bugs.
