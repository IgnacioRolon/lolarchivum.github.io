I found that Sweetheart Annie is missing an RP price below her picture, where all of the other skins have one. I wondered what would happen if I clicked unlock and so I did, but instead of trying to buy the skin, it popped up the window and nothing filled it up. Normally it would show RP cost, current RP and RP after purchase.\r\nI thought that this was weird and so I went to check annie's profile with all of her skins. Oddly enough all other skins are normal but the Sweetheart skin is posted at 0 RP to purchase. Obviously wanting to know what would happen I click purchase and the window does pop up this time, but the cost is 0, and it doesn't show a decrease to my RP, when I clicked unlock it just said that the transaction couldn't take place, so no free skins to anyone (which is a good thing).\r\nI'm just curious, does anyone else get this interesting bug? I logged out and back in, with the result being the same.","replies":[{"poster":"drDevice94","date":"2015-02-18T18:10:33.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I'm actually still getting this error.  I'm kind of nervous because I really wanted to pick up this skin, and I'm assuming it will only be available for a limited time.  Also, this only seems to be a problem on this server (my latin American account had the option available as normal).\n\nAny advice is appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-18T18:14:00.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooops!
