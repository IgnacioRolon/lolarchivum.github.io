I've recently gotten a 5 man team to run games with, and none of us have any real experience in LoL, or MOBAS in general. Right now we're on a pretty bad losing streak and I think I realized why that is. The enemy team goes into 5 man teams before we do, and we just get picked off 1 by 1 and begin feeding as soon as the enemy team leaves lane. None of us really know when to start initiating team fights or to end laning phase, which I believe is the beginning of mid game.\r\n\r\nThis is especially troubling when one of us (generally me) has to go jungle and I never realize when I should stop farming in jungle and instead group up in a certain lane.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated. Characters I generally play are {{champion:81}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:412}} if that helps at all to figure out when to leave lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-02-24T20:53:13.161+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"when your turret is dead and your opponent is roaming\n\nor when you kill their turret and your lane is pushed\n\nthats when you group and help lanes that havent killed their outer yet. or you help your jungler invade for deep wards and buff steals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cullens","date":"2015-02-24T19:58:38.422+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Laning phase ends differently every game, normally its when that first turret falls, because thats when that lane starts to roam the map. Other times lanes can just start roaming due to being denied farm in a lane that is frozen. The biggest thing is make sure you are watching your lane and let your team know if there is movement, and at that point you have to decide push lane and get tower, or follow your lane to get ready for team fight.\n\nLets say both bot laners leave your lane, you can either\n\n1 have your support ward to watch in case anyone comes back to your lane and push for tower\n2 have your support ward and then follow them to mid to help mid lane avoid a tower dive, thus letting the ADC farm/get solo XP/take tower\n3 both of you follow to be there for the ensuing team fight\n\nif you can communicate with your team 1 and 2 are options, if not you may want to follow 3, because then you can at least help when the fight breaks out","replies":[{"poster":"LoveMeSomePenis","date":"2015-02-24T20:04:49.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So lets say, for instance I'm top lane and pushed through to the first tower, I can start roaming and helping other lanes/dragon/etc?

You can also do things like farm golems/gromp depending on what side you are on. and leaving your lane when you are behind does mean you are most likely behind other lanes as well but if you roam mid and get an assist of force the opposing mid laner back, thus allowing your mid lane ahead, plus if you are behind as a team then you should be grouping up and trying to pick off the opposing team","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2015-02-26T03:25:27.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> When to end lane phase?\n\nWhen the tower falls, that lane's lanning phase is over.\n\nWhen 2 lanes have a tower that's fallen, both ended lanes will usually group to push over the remaining tower.\n\n-------\n\nAlso - when you complete your first major item, that's a decent indicator.\n\nAverage game sees ~11k gold per player, which tends to work out to 1k in boots and three 3k items (along with a ramianing 1k being in the bank when you win/loose).\nThe three 3k items you purchase are a good indicator for the shifting phases of early, mid, and late game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ccseancc143","date":"2015-02-25T01:29:08.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simple answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen your team is winning.","replies":[]}]}
