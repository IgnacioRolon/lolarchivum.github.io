Because of the redundancy of CDR and mana it is usually better to get one or the other but not both.  If you want the attack speed reduction aura get {{item:3143}}.  Otherwise a simple {{item:3068}} would do the trick.  Presumably, he's just trying to get as much armor as possible, in which case a second {{item:3075}} is also redundant but cheaper and gives more armor.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-03-17T15:27:55.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but, mana.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"charcharmunro","date":"2016-03-17T20:36:01.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They shall be crushed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2016-03-17T17:34:10.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His passive is one of the my favorite things about his kit.
