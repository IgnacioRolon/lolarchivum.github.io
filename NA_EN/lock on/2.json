Why can't {{summoner:1}} clear such abilities and suppresses? I'd already be sacrificing the usual shields, damage, or extended mobility.\n\nWhy not buff grievous wounds on {{summoner:14}}  or overall? It feels somewhat underwhelming against any decent healer.\nWhy is {{summoner:7}} 's movement speed still so weak when getting hit with even the slightest cc during a gank means certain death anyway? It has its use compared to the fewer used spells but falls off so hard after early game.\n\nThere's no diversity in these. Every class typically takes the same selection of 2 out of 3 typical spells, including flash 99% of the time. So really, 1 out of 2. For example. marksmen ALWAYS take flash and usually heal or (in rarer cases)  teleport. Supports: flash and exhaust/ignite. Mid: flash and ignite/tp/(barrier?) and Top: flash and ignite/tp.\n\nIf the other spells weren't so damn useless, maybe more players would take them.","replies":[{"poster":"CallMeAxel123","date":"2019-08-15T14:12:53.972+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Bring back revive.\nMake QSS able to remove Zed's ult again.","replies":[{"poster":"Hot LeBlanc Yuri","date":"2019-08-15T15:58:03.393+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CallMeAxel123,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dZEdHX7n,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-08-15T14:12:53.972+0000)\n>\n> Bring back revive.\n> Make QSS able to remove Zed's ult again.\n\nAgree on the QSS, because fuck Zed.
