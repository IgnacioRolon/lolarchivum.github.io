Does it also impact game play?","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have noticed that in many of my games there are many toxic players in the loving game League of Legends. To me League of Legends is my favorite game, but the fact that other players abuse me or my teammates whenever we make a mistake or do something bad makes this game not as fun. To me whenever I get flamed I would feels like I&#039;m playing worse and not in my full potential and in the end just lose the game wasting about 30 minutes of my life. I also feel if my teammates didn&#039;t flame me or each other, those games I could of won. Is it the same with you guys? Well if you guys have any idea in stopping toxic players please be free to message.","replies":[{"poster":"Awf Meta","date":"2018-03-03T02:46:32.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't make a mistake and you won't get flamed.
