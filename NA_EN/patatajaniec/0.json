The mastery levels 6 & 7 were created for players who wanted something else to do with their Blue Essence so they were made as a further optional activity.  It gives players who wanted additional mastery levels a goal for playing their champions that they enjoy.\n\nIf you don't care for that, that is your business alone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Patatajaniec","date":"2018-03-07T22:42:53.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks guys for such detailed answers.
