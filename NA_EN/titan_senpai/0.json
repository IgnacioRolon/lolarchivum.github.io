Mind you it's not entirely locked up as I have music or teamspeak going at the time and it's still playing sound fine, but if I try to launch even Task Manager to close league, I just get a busy cursor and it takes until league fixes itself to come up (waaay after I'm kicked from champ select by the way). What can be doing this, because I've been playing since Season 1 and this has never occured? My hardware specs are:\r\n\r\nOS Name\tMicrosoft Windows 10 Pro\r\nProcessor\tAMD FX(tm)-8150 Eight-Core Processor, 3600 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s)\r\nInstalled Physical Memory (RAM)\t16.0 GB\t\r\nTotal Physical Memory\t7.90 GB\t\r\nGraphics        AMD Radeon HD 7700 Series\r\n\r\nI can send the rest of my msinfo if needed as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-01T17:31:34.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What happens if you run the client on [low spec mode](https://i.gyazo.com/a39e12ca76e54359342203c476a0e9c1.png) mode?  This could certainly be a result of pc stress but you could also be having an unstable connection problem that's losing sync and kicking you out.  Just in case, I recommend running through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to be sure.  Run a custom game when done and let me know the results.","replies":[{"poster":"Titan Senpai","date":"2017-08-01T22:20:17.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With low spec mode on it hasn't done it for 3 custom games, so that may have worked. Doesn't make much sense as to why unless one of my memory sticks is dying, so I suppose I'll check that. Thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}
