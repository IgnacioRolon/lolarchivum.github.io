(It's not like my wifi sucks, I have an average of 40-45 ms before the preseason updates and 70 ms last patch. Is this because I have not enough storage, my wifi sucks, my computer hardwares have problem, or is it that I need to re-download my league?\r\n\r\nWould like some help on what to do to reduce ms. Typed this post because it was so laggy that any command I issue (such as 'buy serated dirk' or 'move') would cause the client to say 'attempting to reconnect', and I was only able to flash in fountain after pressing it for like 20 times. can't buy anything, can't walk to red buff. Any fix? Should I redownload?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-03T22:27:12.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd consider restarting your router first to make sure League is getting a clean signal to the servers, but also try running a quick repair to make sure the game files are still intact and run through the steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to cover the rest of your bases.","replies":[]}]}
