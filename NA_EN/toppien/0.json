I really don't get why people have so much trouble LANING vs Zed.

Orianna is good against him as well.\n\nIf you have trouble, try using Exhaust or Barrier. These summoners will almost 100% guarantee you won't die during his first R, and your flash will guarantee you won't die to his second one either. When his third R is back up, you will have Exh or Barrier again. \n\nAlso, the buff  to Seeker's Armguard is substantial enough. Now, you can go back, but your Lost chapter and a Cloth Armour, which you can then turn into Seeker's and basically never die again.\n\nI just watched your op.gg and let me gues, you're complaining about that NORMAL game you played Ryze and went 0/4/0 vs a Zed you got Black Cleaver first? You know you have a problem laning against Zed and you still went on to take Ignite instead of Barrier or Exhaust. Your runes were also atrocious, all of them. Aery does nothing for Ryze, Ultimate Hat and Transcendence are useless on Ryze. You had a huge disadvantage on runes and summoners, so there's one reason. \nAnother reason is that you suck at the game as well. You are in silver 5, which is low elo and you only managed 3.9 cs / min as Ryze, vs a Zed who had no boots and got Black Cleaver first item. \n\nHow about trying to learn how to play the game first, and then complain about certain picks, because the way I see it, you are bitching about Zed because you are genuinely bad at the game.\n\nBy the way, a good tip: Don't play mid lane right now, and even more so, don't play Ryze.","replies":[{"poster":"Bjørnetjenesten","date":"2018-05-28T13:48:56.681+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":4,"body":"According to your own source op.gg, {{champion:238}}  winrate is 54% vs {{champion:61}}  and {{champion:112}}.

And that's a problem stemming from you, the mid laner. You ALLOW him to roam as much or, even worse, you let him solo kill you. In almost all low elo, people just fear Zed, they think he is just magically going to kill them, which makes them play extremely passive and let him have a free laning phase and lose out on xp and gold.\n\nI can't recall the last time I lost a lane vs Zed as Viktor. I always out cs him, out level him and probably even kill him. It's really not that hard, as long as you get out of the bubble that Zed is OP or something.

O WOW, i didn't know that skillshots could be dodged!\n\nThe biggest issue with Zed like people are clearly mentioning is that whilst he goes longsword and 3 fkn pots, you as a mage who rely on mana go dorans and then seekers guard. Not only are you delaying your damage but you will also most likely have mana issues so that if you wanted to poke him (which you have an advantage over) , you will go oom, whilst zed just waits and spams his Q to farm. So automatically one way of punishing a meele champ (range) has been taken away from us. The second way of having a choice over your build is taken away as no matter the circumstances you would have to go zhonyas first item. On the other hand ZED just builds into his usual lethality items. If you were to say to buy seekers guard because ZED got ahead of you then it would make sense and as most Zed's tend to go defensive if they lose early on.\n\nSo the counterplay to zed is to buy zhonyas and zhonyas his ult but guess fkn what? He will W,E,Q + elec to take you down to half health or so and then wait a bit and ult. WOW i must go back to base because it took ZED one rotation of spells that he facerolled and took me to half health without even being in danger himself because of his fkn shadow. Now the second advantage of having burst as a mage is taken away because he can poke you from a distance and if he manages to take you down low enough he'll swap with his shadow and AA you to death. So basically Zed dictates when he wants to end your life.\n\nIf all of this wasn't enough, one other counterplay to zed is to push the wave but guess what? Mages are immobile and are usually vulnerable to ganks but if God forbid if a Zed was to push he'll escape like he was never there or just ult and take a kill and juke the jgler. \n\nPlease construct me more counterplay to Zed? Or are you thinking of counterpicking {{champion:105}} this guy into him? Because he clearly belongs in the same category as him (Cancer assassin) but its the mages that are actually suffering. Lastly its not fkn about AD or AP. This thread is on ZED so we'll speak and talk ZED. I hate Leb for the same reasons._\n\nEdit: Oh FK ME i forgot about ignite. Need i go on more? \nEdit: Also please don't fkn tell me to all in him if he uses his W or call your jgler because he is vulnerable. You think a Jgler would be sitting in wait for Zed to use his W, especially after the new jgl changes? Furthermore, most mages rely on skillshots to cc so how the fk am i suppose to cc him when he is behind minnions, W's to me and E,Q's? Mages do use AA to farm  you know and don't just spam abilities all the tim. so we are now and then within his W's range.\nSome have even mentioned to farm whilst his abilities are on CD, just please throw these fkn suggestions out of the window. When he has poked you and then you use those abilities to farm, he'll then use that opportunity to All-in you whilst your abilities on CD. The moral of story is that there is no counterplay to a ZED who  has a brain in his head.","replies":[{"poster":"Michael Sykes","date":"2018-05-28T21:16:29.625+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"First of all, your problem is that you take all of that way to personal. Being that emotional will cause you to play worse against certain champions, that is a psychological effect.\nAdditionally the AP Assassins that you mentioned have the weakness that they are either melee or have high mana costs/low or offensive waveclear. Let's not talk about them, because they definitely clearly have better counterplay.\nAs the other guy said, Zed's greatest weakness is being a melee. Yes, as a trade-off he has high damage during the whole game, peaking in the mid-game, and yes, he is delaying any mages powerspike. But why rush on duels then? I feel like you are doing exactly that and then you are surprised that you die. If he wants to poke you long-range, he has a 20 seconds timer on that, and it is REALLY easy to dodge. He won't all-in you then unless you push your lane hard. Even a Zed can't towerdive you without dying when you are close to your tower and controlling the waves.\nYou need to pick the right champion of course. One with hard cc, sustain and strong wave control to get him out of the lane.\nIf you play it right you should be able to farm from far out of his q range and deny, you shouldn't allow him to engage you past 6 by staying back and of course you need to care when he disappears to roam. \n\nOne last thing - anyone who is perfect on a decent champion will reduce its counterplay to a minimum. Champions with blinks can just outplay you easier.","replies":[{"poster":"sobi999","date":"2018-05-29T12:02:26.551+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Forget about me being emotional because my frustration is with Zed main's that defend that broken champ with justifications like \" you are ranged and he is melee\".\n\nTherefore i disagree with your statement that \"Zed's greatest weakness is being a melee\". He never has to rely on AA tbh as much as other melee do and he has decent ranged aoe clear.\n\nI never said i rush a duel with him. On the contrary i would love ways not to rush ways to duel with him because i will scale better than him if Zed doesn't snowball. Funnily, one other thing that frustrates me is how contradictory the justification regarding Zed can be. You are telling me not to rush a duel, but another guy said to me \"People are too scared to play aggressive on Zed since lvl 1 and “play safe” only to let him free farm\" and you said \"But why rush on duels then? I feel like you are doing exactly that and then you are surprised that you die\". \n\nLastly, you probably don't have an idea of Zed's powerspike after he gets{{item:3134}} that costs him only 1,100g and of which he has already spent 350 at the beginning of the game. Ignite just makes this worse with all the damage runes such as sudden impact.\n\nLastly, how is his W, spam E'Q combo easy to dodge, when he has W'd right into your face? Maybe throw a spell back at him but that'll be it. Unless that spell is cc, you won't be doing much back to him whilst he'll proc elec and be able to use lethality from sudden impact.\n\nHe is an assassin so yes he should be allowed to burst but what I want to know is the counterplay to a good zed. No mana, ranged ult, ranged aoe waveclear, 4 blinks and easy and cost effective build. He has all the outplay mechanics he requires. Why is it that as a brand main i get fed 10 kills in lane at times but i am still unable to snowball as hard as Zed can? Because there are obvious counters to Brand which you can get around if you play smart but not vice versa for Zed.","replies":[{"poster":"Michael Sykes","date":"2018-05-29T20:25:54.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that, in case we are talking about a matchup against a really experienced Zed Main, there is no point in playing offensively because he will know how to CS. There are enough situations where he has to go melee for last-hits, because either he pokes you or he is tring to one-shot the wave. There is no way he can do both unless you are in the middle of the wave. Those spells ARE dodgeable, and if you are that close, then you were out of position.\nHis powerspikes are strong, but Lethality is not that high on early levels, even with the mastery you mentioned. If your timing is right, you can get your Seeker's when he gets his first Lethality.\nAbout the counter-picking, of course your matchup can be considered lost if you have the wrong champion against him. Pretty unfair right? Totally agree on that, but that happens so often in this game with any champion.\nAs you can see, there is counterplay. I don't want to deny that his strength at the moment is too high and will become higher, especially after Last Whisper is reverted. But hey, then there won't be much counterplay anyway.

What i am trying to get across is that the experience of the mage player is more or less moot as long as Zed is experienced because he outplays you and you can only outplay him when he has allowed you to i.e made mistakes.\n\nEvery spell that is a skill-shot is dodgeable so that's a fact  but that does mean i am out of position to get poked by him. As i mentioned before that mages either have to poke or farm with abilities. Thus seekers guard makes it even more difficult to punish zed as you'll have to use your mana sparingly in laning phase before you can get chapter to either poke him or farm. However, mages do not just farm with abilities, they also use AA. They are even more so likely to rely on aa to farm against zed for above reasons. He'll simply use the same technique you are advising me to use i.e. poke me when i go to AA hence i have to sacrifice between farm and worry about his poke. Once he has poked me obviously he won't be able to farm and will back out until i use my abilities to farm. However, after his first small item {{item:3134}} you can expect him to poke you once and then ult and burst you and that is when you have seekers, without that he can burst you without even poking with ignite.\n\nThen once he gets a kill, you know what happens? He snowballs hard af and roams all lanes especially bot.\n\nAs for counter picking then if you were to lose to Zed even after counter picking then you have yourself to blame but i completely agree that without counterpicking against Zed, it is ever so difficult to stop Zed snowballing. If he had a tons of counter pick options then it would be understandable but considering his playrate, mid laners are forced to main counters to him and if he picks before you in selection then always pick a safe pick that can counter Zed. If he doesn't need damage nerf then he needs a nerf which enables more counter play to him.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Disembark","date":"2018-05-28T18:55:36.725+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Then play Zed?

Um with Katarina you can just trade back or dodge his abilities with E. Not the biggest thing in the world. Sure, for Katarina this isn't an easy match-up, but it is far from the most difficult. \nIf your jungler won't come, that's hardly Zed's fault. Its either yours because you don't know how to ask for help or because he's some dumb idiot who doesn't know what an early lead means for the midlaner. \n\nIt is far more easy bitching about a champ in a forum then learning how to play against him. In low elo there are no competent Zed players btw. The ones you encounter are always around your skill level, doesn't matter in what elo you are in.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
