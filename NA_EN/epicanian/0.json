You have to be good enough at your champion to get S grades, unlike Mastery 4 and 5 that you can get just by grinding out lots of games with a champion. It seems kind of weird, though, that you need blue essence to get it. I know that you can get blue essence with IP now through champion shards, but the whole thing seems kind of unnecessary.\n\n-Blue essence has nothing to do with your skill on a champion, so why should you need it to get to level 7?  \n\n-Riot probably makes barely any money off people buying hextech chests for blue essence, because they implemented the option to get blue essence for IP\n\n-The complicated crafting system confuses newcomers\n\nSo why do we still have this in the game? We already worked hard for the Mastery tokens, don&#039;t make us pay extra.{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2016-11-08T04:04:48.750+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's more that Riot wanted to give the people who have played the game for a long time, something to do with the mass amounts of IP they have.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-08T02:32:51.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't need IP or RP to get blue essence, just build {{item:3508}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-11-08T01:58:43.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you are on to something... \n\nbut its a ploy to get people to buy hextech stuff t (keys/chest) to get essence to unlock lvl 6/7 its all bout that mighty $\n\nbut heres how you beat it... use your ip to get champ shards... use champ shards to help unlock your lvl 6/7s and if you get some you dont need /or more then one for a champ disenchant for essence and you win \n\ni know you need IP for champs / runes etc... well i dont... i have nothing else to spend my IP on","replies":[{"poster":"Epicanian","date":"2016-11-08T02:06:00.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't really read the post did you.\n\n-_**I know**_  that you can get blue essence with IP now through champion shards, but the whole thing seems kind of unnecessary.\n-Riot probably **_makes barely any money off people_** buying hextech chests for blue essence, b_**ecause they implemented the option to easily get blue essence for IP **_","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-11-08T02:07:19.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a company for profit will take a nickle on something if they could think they can get it... \n\nits all income for them regardless the amount... as long as it increases the bottom line","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-11-08T01:50:13.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think people complained about not having uses for their essence, particularly blue, so Riot tried to give them an essence sink.","replies":[]}]}
