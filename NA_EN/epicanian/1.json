Ever since she was nerfed repeatedly by Rito, Kindred has felt pretty bad to play. She seems so weak and squishy, and I couldn&#039;t seem to succeed on her, so I eventually transitioned to other junglers. I still love Kindred gameplay and lore-wise, but she just isn&#039;t viable right now. After the S7 jungle changes, she feels even weaker. I&#039;m not asking for her to return to her super OP state, I just want her to be playable. She has a 0.13% play rate right now. Maybe we could giver her the heal passive back, but slightly weaker, and it only works out combat. or extend the range on her jump. These are just ideas, I'm no balance expert.

Annie/Tibbers or Daisy/Ivern feel like more of dual champions or even just Daisy/Tibbs feel like more of characters than Wolf does. Hell, Yorick's Maiden talks to him (AKA is part of his VO) and again, feels like it does more. \n\nWhy do my Spiderlings on Elise, or my Voidlings on Malzh feel more like their own characters than Wolf? At best, Wolf feels like the little devourer spirit wolf that used to follow you around and nip people's heels when you chased them. At worst, he just feels like some sort of projectile ability. I use \"She\" when talking about them, because c'mon, we all know I'm talking about Lamb. If Elise's spiderlings or Ivern's Daisy don't count as a \"they\" when talking about the champion, I hardly see why Wolf should.\n\nGoing back to Kindred's kit. It is incredibly incoherent and kind of themeless, and lends itself to bland gameplay in the current iteration, unless, of course, it's made incredibly strong. Why doesn't her Q proc her E? Sure, her W and Q are technically synergistic since W lowers Q cooldown, but what do they really DO together? She's got kind of a theme of fighting in one area she marks as her own, but even that is pretty loose. She's got a series of 4 cool abilities that only marginally synergize well with each other and kind of honestly feel slapped together with not a whole real lot of thought to how they work in unison, and then she's got a passive that's either too punishing to her when she's not in a strong state (Right now it's feelsbad because your early is honestly not the best for taking early marks. And the freaking 8 second mark timer.) or feels bad on your opponent's part when she is strong (Not only can this champion duel me level 3 and possibly kill me, she'll inherently scale for lategame by duelling me and counterjungling me.) \n\n\nHonestly I kind of expect her to go the way of someone like Yorick. She'll be forgotten or pushed off for years only to finally receive a rework after she's become a meme. (and I do think she's up for becoming the next \"bad champion meme\" after Aatrox gets updated.) \n\n\nLook, I might sound harsh about Kindred, but it's only because I LOVE the lore of this champion. I LOVED how they teased her, I LOVED the story they put out, I LOVED the idea of the choice between Lamb's Arrow or Wolf's Teeth. I LOVED the idea of a dual champion, AND of a marksman jungler. Not to mention the visual design, and how much personality lamb and wolf both have. I'm so harsh about Kindred's design because I WANT TO LIKE PLAYING THIS CHAMPION. But just... she feels bad to play, and probably felt bad to play against when she was strong. Her kit is trash wrapped in that shiny lore and visual design paper.","replies":[{"poster":"GelsominoKiller","date":"2016-12-25T15:14:08.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are absolutely on point, I feel the same. I really want to like Kindred, but their kit is extremely bland and generic.\n\nThe designer COMPLETELY failed to deliver the \"dual champion\" gameplay. Moreover, wolf and lamb correspond to two different embodiments of death; this duality is nowhere to be seen in their kit. Wolf feels like a particle. Beside that, Lamb is a generic archer.\n\nIn short, a total waste of potential.\n\nRiot is evidently having trouble in champion kits lately. I thought that bad, toxic designs requiring \"olafing\" were a thing of the past, but I was wrong. Champions so recent like Azir, Kalista and Yasuo are suffering the same fate as Urgot, Yorick and Poppy. I bet Camille will join them soon enough, mainly due to her ULT generating extremely binary low counterplay interactions.

In think the biggest reason they're bad is their inability to contest marks. If they can't get their marks, they can't make it anywhere past early game.
