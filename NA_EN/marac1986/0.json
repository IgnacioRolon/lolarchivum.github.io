The drop rate is a curve, so you will receive a lot more from the beginning and begins to slow down until it refreshes in roughly 30 days.  This information is available in our [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide.  I see you've gotten around 12 fragments since the beginning of the month, so the drop rate will be pretty slow until it refreshes again.

This number resets roughly every thirty days after you earn your first key fragment.\n> \n> We wanted to give players who didn't play as frequently a good drop rate for keys, without making it feel like farming was mandatory if you wanted keys.","replies":[]}]}
