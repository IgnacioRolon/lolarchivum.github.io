They spent 40 dollars they went on and tried to spend another 135 dollars at the time I just thought ok they got my card info its all good I already got my money back from chase and I am getting a new debit card in two days so I didn't think anything of it and did not check my account when I got home. The next day I went to go sign in to play and it said that my account had got transfered to a different region so I started trying to log into all the servers and I finally got into my account it was transfered to EUW so i emailed riot support and told them about every thing that happened gave them the names to all the people on the friends list and the rioter that responded to my email said I did not give them enough information to prove that the account is mine I've sent multiple emails even an email including the email I got from chase showing the bank statement and somehow my account get perma banned and now I have no account. I have been playing since season 1 and have spent over 500 dollars on the account and have over 100 days played and to even think that my account is perma banned and league riot support has not done anything about it and it has been a week already is really depressing. I just want something done but as the days go on it is looking more and more like my account will just stay perma banned and I will have wasted 500+ dollars of my money and 100+ days of gameplay of my life it is very sad please fix this problem for me riot I am very concerned right now. I am willing to do anything to fix this matter but it is kinda hard to do when I am being told that my account is not my account  and that there is nothing I can do.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-30T00:01:52.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you have a support ticket open about this issue, I strongly urge you to continue working with the account specialist on this. If you skipped some questions they asked, go back and do your best to provide the best answer you can. I know sometimes details from years ago can get hazy, but a guess is better than skipping a question.\n\nUntil our specialist has enough information to verify you as the account creator, we won't be able to release the account. I hope that clears this up for you. Please let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Y0UNG THUGGER","date":"2016-08-30T01:11:00.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried to answer all the questions to my best ability buy that wasn't enough is there anything else I could do or answer besides those questions?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-30T15:43:28.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since I don't have context on what has been answered and all the details that the specialist is working with, I'm not sure.
