Im an adc main, was platinum 3 in season 4 and then i stopped playing. Now i come back and it feeling that around 8/10 supporter are never played that role. They just sitting around or are extremly aggresive or don´t care enough and get killed over and over again.\n\nMy view is, the most people don´t even try to are able to play every role now, cause they get most times that role they wanna play now. This is rly horrible for the bot lane, for both adc, the own team and enemy team. It just feeling who has more luck to get a real supp or just a jgl that have to autofill. \n\nIn 2014/2015 it feels for me, that much more player have known, its a ranked, it is not sure that i can do my role, i have to known at least all roles at a minimum level for my elo. Just my opinion, so pls Riot do something!\n\nAutofill is nice on one hand for players like me that want improve in every role but focus on 1, but i think there are much more people that want play that 1 role and are extremly fucked up if they have to play other roles. It happen often in my games that someone want to switch or cry allready that they get autofilled. \n\nMaybe you should get us the option to turn that autofill on and off, so if player rly don´t want to autofill then they have to accept a longer waiting time but they can play what they realy want and are able to. And the players who are able or just want to autofill sometimes have shorter que, that their profit.\n\n(Sorry for bad english)","replies":[]},{"poster":"AP Amumu Main","date":"2017-05-14T06:23:01.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I designated to just play OP champions when I get autofilled and usually win based on that even if my role is not the best, aka ADC twitch or cait, support lulu or karma, mid Orianna,syndra,ekko,Yasuo,Ahri, top Karthu, Sej, Mao, Fiora.
