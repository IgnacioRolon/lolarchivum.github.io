Sure Riot has been trying to get the trolls in game but they are forgetting the ones before it even begins. Some people feel as though if they do not get the role they want, they can just troll pick something stupid and let someone else dodge. These people are just as bad as those who troll in game in my opinion. To make things worse, these people may act like the nicest of people in game when they get what they want, so they won't ever get banned.\n\nI was pretty happy to win 3 games in a row and get to 61 lp in G1. Had to dodge 3 games in a row because of similar instances. I was lucky enough to play ranked for the first time in 2-3 months because of bad internet, I do not know when I will get this stable internet to try to climb again.... The first step in fixing a problem is realizing that there is one, people in Riot probably won't see this post but maybe someone will read it and can spread the message.\n\nI do like the idea of this thread but unfortunately people do not understand the difference between trying new things and straight up trolling. I also think that this should only be implemented in Ranked because most people mess around and have fun in normals anyway. I would suggest you implement a report icon during champ select just as you do after game. If someone gets an unusual amount of votes, they can get banned. All of these should be reviewed before any banning, maybe like how we had people review tribunal cases? For this to happen, Riot must save the chat and picks and bans of that champ select just as they do for in game reports. This is where the problem arises which hopefully isn't really a problem for programming. When trolled, more times than not, people tend to dodge which makes it so that game never existed in the first place.
