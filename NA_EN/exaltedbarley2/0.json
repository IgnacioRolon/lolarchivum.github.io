The only reason leavebuster is set to a few minutes is because people can have connection issues or sometimes wait for 20-30 seconds in shop for gold, if the state of the game permits it.\n\nJust do not play league at times when you cannot commit 50-60 minutes of time safely, unless you want to get leavebusted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fovere","date":"2016-05-22T19:19:40.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its based on a percentage of matches left, so if you play little and happen to d/c in one of those, you're more likely to take a hit","replies":[]}]}
