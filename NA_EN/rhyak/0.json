Everything about it is just incredible, so no, I&#039;m not complaining about anything. One of the things that really caught my eye that I liked about the skin was that at the last moments of the recall, the visor pulled back revealing her face. I loved it, but it made me notice something. That skin has some genuine effort in giving her a good face. Her face in that skin is nice, but it&#039;s only revealed for the last few seconds of her recall. \r\n\r\nI think it would be neat if her visor pulled back, revealing her face for both/either her taunt and joke, and/or it was toggable like NH rengar and NS Vi. Just spit balling, and seeing what everyone thinks. I love the skin regardless, and will definitely be instabuying it.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-21T23:16:50.694+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Rhyak,\n\nNone of the PROJECt skins will have a toggle feature.

However, maybe keep this in mind for future PROJECT skins? As small as it may be, having the option to toggle a feature is a wonderful thing. I play with the hood up on NH Rengar. Glasses down on NS Vi. And mostly in Concussive for DJ Sona. Would've probably played visor set away for PROJECT Fiora if it was an option. But back to my point, consider it for future PROJECT skins. Just by showing us that she has a face underneth, leaves us wanting that option even though it is not available. Great skin however, defnitely makes me want to get better with this new Fiora.\n\nBut I do have two questions:\n1. Why was it not implemented to exclude the visor for her emotes like PROJECT Yasuo does?\nand 2. About NS Vi, would it be possible to hook up her taunt lines when she interacts with her glasses? You guys have gone back and edited a skin (mecha kha'zix when released only had that \"beep boop\" joke but later was able to fully have humor) or would that be too much of an effort as you would need to rig not only the taunt lines but also the taunt animation with the toggle?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-22T01:14:29.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's certainly not off the table for future skins for any thematic. \n\n**1.

Maybe sometime in the future should any group at Riot feel the same and have some spare time? Who knows, only time will tell. Again, great job with the skin. Just want to ask one other thing, since me and a friend were trying to figure out who the skin is based off of if anyone from MGS (he thinks someone from the B&B Unit, I think Mistral from Revenegnce)?\n\n2. As I figured. Thank you. Just it's my pet peeve about the skin and not being able to taunt while only being able to interact with the shades. Kinda leaves the skin, unfinished in a feeling? But nevertheless, thank you for you time\n\nAlso, just responded to the Morde skin thread and have some more ideas for you to jot down if you're interested ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Rhyak","date":"2015-08-22T02:10:06.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As for who Fiora looks to be mostly based off of from the MGS series, honestly to me anyways, she looks a lot like a genderbent raiden with \"fiora-like features\" thrown in.
