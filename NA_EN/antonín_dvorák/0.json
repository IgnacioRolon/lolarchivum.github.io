I find the new rework promising, but I&#039;m still slightly worried.\r\n\r\nHis new E seems a lot of fun and adds a lot of needed utility for Gangplank, however I feel it sucked a lot of power out the rest of his kit.\r\nWith the new passive being reliant on his caskets and the old passive gone he lost a lot of his consistent power meaning that without his caskets Gangplank is even weaker than he is now. I understand the need for counterplay in a kit but a large problem for GP was always that a lot of his opponents could outtrade him consistently with more ease due to higher base damage and mobility.\r\n\r\nMoreover I believe that his W got nerfed rather hard. At rank 5 Gangplank needs to have 1400 missing health to heal the same amount as his old w at rank 5. The lowered CD is offset by its larger mana cost. This means he&#039;ll be healing less than he used to for most of the game and especially early where the sustain is most needed. One of the nice things about the flat heal was that Gangplank could more easily itemize for resistance instead of health. On a Crit-based fighter itemization has always been difficult and it&#039;s hard to build additional health.\r\n\r\nI have not yet played the new GP in PBE and this is mostly theorycrafting. But I don&#039;t see the harm in discussing his new kit.\r\nAs for now I think that he has a lot more teamfight potential but at the cost of an even weaker laning phase.\r\n\r\nLastly I don&#039;t really like the new look. In my opinion too cartoony in contrast to his relatively realistic appearance now (Gangplanks weapons are probably the most realistic in the game). To me a simple man facing abominations and monsters with the convential gun and sword is the definition of badass.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-07-11T02:47:56.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rework is great.

The true damage isn't worth the loss of functionality (I'd love to see it changed back to magic damage in exchange for his Q applying it again), and the speed boost is just weak compensation for the loss of his permaslow. His E slow won't make up for his loss of passive+active movement speed on his old E because the barrels will be too easy to defuse, especially by ranged champions— Gangplank's Q will still have a long cast time and mediocre projectile speed after the rework, meaning nearly any enemy champion can autoattack a barrel before Gangplank's Q reaches it.\n\nThe change to Gangplank's E (plus the new ultimate upgrades) might ruin support Gangplank for me, but I'll have to test out how well the barrels function as wards (and whether it's even possible to utilize the slow to help your ADC when would have formerly used your E for speed and damage amplification).","replies":[]},{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2015-07-10T14:22:12.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Depend on how where you playing him.\n\ni before stopping playing months ago was playing critplank. He had too much weakness but some strength. one of his weakness was the he couldn't do anything to tanks. his new passive deals 20+(10 dmg per lvl)+120% bonus AD true damage. this is huge with 200 bonus  AD at lvl 18 it deals 400 true damage.\n\nhis barrels also make him stronger as a carry. Now if greatly done you can have an AOE parrrleys with on hit effect +200 bonus dmg which ignore 60% of armor.\n\nbut i agree on his W. it is a huge nerf that i hope riot will do something. They said they wanted to reduce his sustain, well i don't know why it isn't something like aatrox's W or vladimir's kit.","replies":[]}]}
