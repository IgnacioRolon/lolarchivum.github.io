I think the issue with this weapon is that it has a form of mana recovery, but only after it is fully completed, which at that point it seems kind of pointless to even have the passive. The 10% CD reduction is great for AD Casters, however it just doesn't compete with BT in terms of value. For the same build path and slightly higher recipe you simply get a much better item. My proposed change is that first of all you could make a more early lane-phase friendly build path. Maybe make an item such as this.\r\n\r\n-Essence Scepter\r\n+15 attack damage\r\n+10% life steal\r\n+10% cooldown reduction\r\nUnique Passive: Your basic attacks restore mana equal to 2% of physical damage dealt.\r\n\r\nYou could make the build path B.F. Sword(1550g) + Essence Scepter(1200g) + Recipe(650) = Essence Reaver(3400g)\r\n\r\nI also suggest maybe adding a bit more to the finished product to make it more useful in the late game while also adding 200g to the total cost to compensate. I was thinking Maybe something like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n+80 attack damage\r\n+10% life steal\r\n+10% cooldown reduction\r\nUnique Passive: Your basic attacks restore mana equal to between 2% and 8% of the physical damage dealt, based on your missing mana.\r\nUnique Passive: Your basic attacks cause your next damaging ability to deal 15% additional damage(3 second duration)\r\n\r\nI feel that with these changes it would encourage the item to be build on AD casters while also giving it a definitive edge as an offensive item over BT. I don't feel as if it will create a terrible amount of imbalance due to the fact that most carries never built the item to begin with and the actual damage of the item in the late game would be somewhat comparable to that of IE.","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-03-11T19:41:33.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"esence reaver is perfect the way it is D: dont ask rito to \"buff\" this perfect item.","replies":[]}]}
