Currently my ign is: Corgi Dreams and my desired name is: Grool(last game: October 03, 2013), which is a name that believe it or not appeared in my dreams. I was wondering if its possible for that summoner to forfeit that name giving a free name change? I remember seeing a post about how an account stays \"Active\" for about 6 months, but please share your thoughts about name changes!\n\nHere is what rito posted:\n> * Each Summoner Name will have 6 months of inactivity protection upon creation.\n* Each Summoner Name will earn an additional month of inactivity protection for each Summoner level above 6\n* Inactivity is defined to be a period in which no games of any kind have been played on the account.\n* When inactivity protection expires, your name will be available to be claimed through the Summoner Name Change service in the store.\n\nSource: https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/25523524-Summoner-Name-Clean-Up-#q5","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2014-07-16T19:32:08.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The name change must be purchased from the store with the Summoner Name Change item, under the account section of the store.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2014-07-16T16:12:15.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As that summoner's account is summoner level 7, that means they have 7 months of inactivity protection.\nSince October is beyond 7 months, then you should be able to just change your name to that on demand.","replies":[]}]}
