So by me KILLING ALL JUNGLE CAMPS ON RESPAWN, my teammates dont even have the chance to lose 50% of their health taking gromp, meaning they will always be forced to go in lane for farm, and because they didnt lose half their health taking a gromp on their way to lane, they usually always end up winning the lane because they arrive to lane at full health\n\n\ni literally ONLY farm the jungle for 20 minutes, no ganks, with the goal of ACTIVELY STOPPING MY TEAMMATES FROM BEING ABLE to take a SINGLE jungle camp after 4 minutes.

On top of that, these were games with friends, one or two of whom are not even level 30 and who I don't really expect to go even against higher level opponents (usually Silver-Gold).  I understand why they're losing, they know that I don't expect them to own their lane, and nobody's going to be complaining and pointing fingers at each other since we're all talking and communicating and are comfortable.  It's still stressful when ever lane gives up a kill before you can get your back in though (with zero enemy jungle presence) and it's really hard to have to pick who to save and who to leave because you simply CANNOT be everywhere at once.\n\nI've also had ranked games where this happens and now I'm not with friends in a call.  I buy mobility boots.  I run around the map with upgraded yellow trinket and drop wards to protect my laners.  I buy and drop strategic pinks.  I gank two lanes and try to get them snowballing or, if I'm lucky and getting fed, gank all three.  And sometimes it's still not enough.  As with all team games, you're not going to be able to carry 1v5 every time and those sorts of games are very frustrating as a jungler, especially when team members are expecting you to save them from THEIR own mistakes.\n\nLet me come up with another imaginary scenario to counter yours: top lane gives up a level 2 first blood to the enemy laner, no junglers involved.  Mid dives too aggressively a few seconds later, dies to the enemy laner.  Bottom trades ADC for support.  Since top's facing a Hecarim, someone difficult for me to gank, I focus on mid and bottom, scoring a flash mid and a kill for my ADC bot.  The enemy jungler ganks top, gives a kill over to the enemy top laner.  I donate my blue to mid, leave a pink in the area, gank bot again and get a kill for myself and one for my ADC at the cost of my ADC's life.  Top dies again, mid gets ganked by the jungler (who went around the other side of my pink) and dies to their lane opponent.  I go up top to put down a ward just as my top laner gets back to lane, Hecarim goes in on him, I gank because I'm there, my top laner dies and I'm unable to catch Hecarim to kill him.  Bot lane both die to the enemy ADC.  Mid lane wants to surrender at 20, top lane begs for \"an actual gank,\" the ADC is ragging on the top lane, support, and me for having let him die.  All of them want me to gank for them since I'm one of the only ones on the team with gold.  In a situation like this, I did everything I could to enable my lanes, but it's a pretty good bet that this is lost (yes, it's early and will depend on the team comp but a lot of folks will simply give up here).  So what was my mistake?  Where should I take responsibility?\n\nI'll take it as a favor if you don't assume that I'm a newbie jungler who's never bought a green ward, dies constantly, and doesn't know how to enable their team.  I mained support in S1 and S2.  I've played jungle in every season.  I know when something is my fault, I know what my responsibilities are, and I know when a laner has dug themselves into a hole and it had nothing to do with me.  I'm not omnipresent, I can't save everyone.

I lost lane from enemy jungler- I beat the bajeezus out of the enemy mid laner, but the Sejunai camped my lane and bot while our jungler (politely nameless) farmed his chickens when I got ganked. Every time I got ganked, he was less than 10 seconds away (wolves, blue, or chickens- every time) and he never came to help. If I can wreck the enemy mid laner AND fend off the enemy jungler solo, then my jungler coming in from his camps immediately gives us an easy double kill.\n\n\ntl:dr- I didn't lose lane 1v1. I lost lane from getting ganked 4 times. Top was aggrivated as well. Only bot was happy- even though he showed up very few times. The enemy Sej jungle was ripping bot to shreds and camping me with the occassional top lane dip. Our jungler was farming camps on a tank.","replies":[{"poster":"LOL Spammer","date":"2015-03-22T20:43:59.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting ganked 4 times is not getting camped dude. Getting ganked like 10 times is being camped. E.g. My last 4 games in lane. Plus if you think you are getting camped then play really far back near your turret, let the lane push to you.

It was a comparison of my junglers to enemy jungler.\nIn correction exchange (I mean this politely, I have grammar correction addiction) e.g. is ergo and i.e. is in example. So ergo is when you want to say \"this thing happened, and so this happened also\". I.e. is what you did. =) Thanks for the correction, hate misusing terms. If I may ask, seeing as I'm heavily in the wrong it seems and I've learned that I will never be right in the jungler world (ignore my Rek'Sai game) can you explain what I seem to be missing?\n\nThe things that happened:\nOur jungler: Stayed in jungle (tank, cc heavy, no need to farm?) and just ate camps all day with the occassional assist to bot. Never showed mid or top. Joined 2 teamfights out of I believe 6 or 7. Both fights, he stayed behind me (the squishy, utility mid mage) and didn't engage at all. I got blown up both times because I thought he'd go in.\nEnemy jungler: Hit my lane and bot lane repeatedly (tank, cc heavy, no need to farm? too) and managed to snowball bot lane really heavily. I died once in the 4 hits.\nI: Decided to take chickens and wolves (blue when it spawned because I was a mage) since I saw myself putting it to better use as I was assisting my team and he was not.\n\n\nWhy am I wrong?

Said jungler was the initiator for teamfights, and had been unable to keep up because he had not ganked (kills are 300, assists are 100 to 150 during laning). So when we fought, I had to initiate with my utility, which resulted in one of the squishiest back liners being obliterated instantly. I had a huge utility kit that decided team fights IF I WASN'T focused, but the jungler hadn't gotten fed enough to do initiations and was unable to be anywhere in the front line.","replies":[{"poster":"LOL Spammer","date":"2015-03-22T20:49:35.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What champion was he?","replies":[{"poster":"EvilRabbitt","date":"2015-03-23T02:03:23.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to say, but since its an accusation I'm not sure if I can.

You'll notice that, as opposed to some tanks who have multiple CC abilities, Amumu has only his Q and ult, both abilities that are on long cooldowns and relying more on the AoE damage from his W and E in addition to his CC (therefore needing durability, AP, and CDR on a jungler's income).  Amumu also cannot disengage, once he's in a fight, he's in it until he dies or until he can waddle away, likely with the whole team on his tail.  It sounded like you had either an unfortunate case of a timid Amumu or one who was waiting too much for a time to engage.  \n\nAmumu should have been ganking more than he did (or farming more efficiently, the jungle for a jungler is almost worth a laner's income when farmed correctly) and it's saddening to hear that you got stuck with a champion you didn't want to take mid, but Amumu's situation is starting to sound a lot more understandable.  Against a more gank spam type jungler like Sejuani or Zac, Amumu's ganking power (especially sustained ganking when he doesn't have blue due to mana issues) is generally weaker, which his farming power and scaling are a lot stronger.  If his lanes were behind enough, trying to farm up and scale into a monster tank while keeping control of crabs, warding, and counterganking when he can.\n\nAgain, not saying he played the situation the right way (because I didn't get to watch the game and see for myself), but it's entirely possible that he chose the right strategy and didn't pull it off well, his laners didn't play defensively enough, or the enemy jungler was just really, really good.  Too many variables.\n\nAnd from Match History it looks like it was an enemy Sejuani jungle and that your Amumu teammate had plenty of gold to his name (more than Sejuani), but wasted it by itemizing pure armor with his only health items being Cinderhulk and Banshee's, which wasted his Cinderhulk's potential.  Given how far behind you were, you were probably alright with taking the wolf camp at least.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilRabbitt","date":"2015-03-24T01:35:15.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really?
