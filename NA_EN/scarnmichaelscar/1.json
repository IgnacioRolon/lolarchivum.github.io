Do you expect them to repent or something?\n\nyeah im the problem when teemo and jax give up 12 kills in the first 10 minutes. right buddy. accountability no longer exists. i didn't curse them out. i didn't call them trash or r%%%%%s. i called them out for obvious troll picks, and then asked the enemy team to report them when they denied 3 straight surrenders.\n\nyoure right though. even though this shit happens every game i should just sit through it with a forced smile on my face and pat them on the back for \"trying\" \n\nthis is the problem with league. you can't say anything to anyone anymore. all you can do is watch as one to two people sabotage every attempt at having fun.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2019-11-23T04:38:47.895+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ScarnMichaelScar,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=dpihtpbP,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-11-23T04:14:47.722+0000)\n>\n> yeah im the problem\n\nWho's talking about \"the\" problem? You're **a** problem. This is not some sort of reverse competition, where only the person who was the biggest dick gets a punishment. \n\n>i didn't curse them out. i didn't call them trash or r%%%%%s.\n\nCare to share your chat logs? You wouldn't be the first to claim such things only to be found lying.\nThat said, there are plenty of ways to harass others without using curses or those two specific words.\n\n>i called them out for obvious troll picks\n\nSeen weirder things work out well. Teemo ADC used to be quite a thing for a while. Never saw the appeal, but also wouldn't call it a troll pick.\n\n\n> even though this shit happens every game \n\nThat right there is proof enough for me that your definition of \"troll\" is extremely loose. And that serves as a perfect example why even if you are convinced that somebody is trolling you **still** have no right to harass them. Because you're not the judge here. You don't decide who is trolling or who isn't, and you most definitely don't get to decide who deserves to be flamed and who doesn't.\n\n>i should just sit through it with a forced smile on my face and pat them on the back for \"trying\" \n\nOr, hear me out on this, you could just not say anything.\nJust because your negativity is not tolerated doesn't mean you need to fake positivity. Being neutral is just fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-23T04:29:17.936+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"So your ideal solution is to make their day and encourage them by showing them how mad you are over their antics?\n\nI thought they taught kids not to act like this in fucking preschool.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-11-25T22:45:17.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im glad you love it because maybe you've realized that \"calling them out\" will do no good. You've probably realized that lots of players try lots of combinations of champs on bottom lane and theyre usually not trolling, theyre just trying something new. So having teammates go to chat bitching about them and calling them trolls only makes the person whining about it look like an asshole, and annoys the shit out of everyone else who is playing a video game on their free time because its fun, not serious. So yeah, just take it. Its a team game. Its not about other people picking the shit YOU want. Always glad to see another person actually learn the rules. \n\nAlso, you do realize if they are actual trolls (and this is why i think you KNOW they arent) they would do this to get exactly the reaction that you seem to so badly want to give them. You think trolls get upset when people get salty at them? You cant be that ignorant of trolls.
