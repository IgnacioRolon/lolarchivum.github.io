That randomness is the nature of receiving a mystery gift though, and isn't something that can be refunded per the[ refund guidelines](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ).  If your account hasn't hit the daily limit for receiving gifts, your friend could give you a more specific one if that's possible.  Despite all that, I hope you have a happy birthday!","replies":[{"poster":"iTheAzs","date":"2016-11-04T13:38:42.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for responding! its fine that i can't get a refund, i just wanted to know if i could have gotten something a little better but its ok, good luck on your games!","replies":[]}]}]}
