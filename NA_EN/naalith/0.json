I really hate ranked and think it is by far the least fun thing about this game, but I usually place in gold 5 and just sit there for the rest of the season with no desire to climb. I see that once you hit platinum you need to play a game every 28 days to not decay, and because decaying would put me back into gold, I have some questions to make sure I stay plat when the season ends.\r\n\r\n1) On the website it says you decay after 28 days of inactivity in a queue. I remember when golds used to decay you had to win a game to stop that from happening, is this no longer the case? Can a losing game reset the decay timer?\r\n\r\n2) Since the season ends on the 7th, does that mean I can play a game on the 10th and be safe, or will I decay out of plat mere hours before the season ends?\r\n\r\n3) If you DO have to win to reset the timer, it's just one game right?\r\n\r\nThanks for the input, I think it is pretty straightforward but I want to make absolutely 100% sure I don't decay out of plat.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-08T22:17:25.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh glob I just love numbered lists of questions!!!\n\n1) You simply have the *play* a match in the designated queue in order to stop decay from happening. You do not have to win said match, only play from beginning to end\n\n2) As long as you're not in Master/Challenger, decay takes 28 to start. Ergo, if you play on the 10th I believe decay would *start* on the 7th, meaning your LP would drop based on tier. \n\n3) Nope! No wins required to stop decay. Of course, losing will make you lose LP as usual.","replies":[]}]}
