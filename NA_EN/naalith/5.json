He was the one who changed her body into machinery as it became sick, with her help when she could.\n\nAlso, not sure if you're referencing old lore, but new lore Orianna didn't do it for a child's sake but for her own, though she gave her heart to her sick father.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-01-25T01:52:14.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She did most of it on her own.\n\nAnd actually her lore has her go down to Zaun to help after an really bad gas leak by handing out masks.  She ran out and found one last child without one.  She immediately took hers off and put it on the kid, the gas destroyed her lungs necessitating the first replacement done by her father.  She kept replacing more and more until she only had her original heart left, which also held her humanity.  She gave it to her ailing father and replaced it with a hextech core, simultaneously freeing herself from needing to be wound up by him and saving his life.\nShe also made hundreds of little figurines for him to sell and retire one.\n\nAnd you're right, her father helped with some of it but she did large parts too.","replies":[{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2018-01-25T02:26:03.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd have to re-read it, but i do believe her father did most of the work. Cutting yourself open and prying out your own lungs to then replace them with a very complex mechanism seems like something that would take a long time, and something that would have killed her had she tried. For limbs, sure why not. The heart, as it was basically the last piece of her human body, sure. Her brains? I don't think it's doable alone.\n\nI'll make the bet she was unconscious for most of the major changes.\n\nI did forget how she'd gotten sick in the first place though, good catch.\n\nBack to the initial point though, while Orianna's fabrication counts as one of the more outstanding Champion origin stories, her short story about the monkey left me a bit perplex. Was this all a clockwork machine powered by a hextech core could do? Struggling against two circus guards doesn't seem very... champion-y.\n\nThe story was nice and the interaction between Orianna and the monkey was neat as well as doing a good job of showcasing her mindset, but i'd have written Orianna dispatching those guards with ease, unlike what they did.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-01-25T04:42:18.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well she's not a combatant.  She was never trained in battle, she has no tactical knowledge, and her body isn't made for combat.  She has perfect command over her robot yes, but it was built for  defense, and to search for survivors in wreckage.  The reason she doesn't dispatch the gaurds is because it's not in her nature.  Orianna is a supporter, who's first action after losing her humanity was giving this man she no longer even seed as her father a retirement plan and a momento of the daughter he had lost.  And again her robot is designed simply to defend her not kill, she wouldn't even know how to use it as a proper weapon.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fairyfleur","date":"2018-01-23T05:34:08.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never realized I needed that until you pointed that out; it’d be really neat to see what she can do in an actually dangerous situation.","replies":[{"poster":"SzGamer227","date":"2018-01-23T15:59:00.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_R A V A G E_\n\n_T H R O W_","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-01-23T10:10:44.670+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"On another note:\nHow comes that {{champion:136}} lists \"Runeterra\" as his faction,but is still part of the champions section on the targon page.\n\nSo he is the only champ who lists one faction,while being counted as part of another faction(ok Eve does this too,but this was an oversight).\n\nShouldn't Aurelion list Targon as his faction and not Runeterra?I mean sure,Aurelion isn't loyal to targon and wasn't born as part of their empire,but the same could be said about Kassadin and the void.","replies":[{"poster":"Fairyfleur","date":"2018-01-23T16:01:29.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's probably Runeterra because him and the influence of his stars reach all of Runeterra, and not just Targon, maybe?","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-01-23T16:29:05.125+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"But space doggo got a crown leash and has to be a good boy at Mount Targon now, no?","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-01-23T16:27:59.951+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think thats still kinda odd.\n\nAfter all {{champion:60}} lives in Noxus,yet she is still considered to be a shadow isles champ.\nSo by that logic she should be counted towards both factions in a similar way.\n\nAnd technically Aurelions stars not just reach runeterra,but others in the universe as well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"XxDRAGONsAK47xX","date":"2018-01-23T15:36:32.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you also fix the thing in the client that says Fizz is an amphibious yordle when on his lore page he isn't.\n\n\nI don't want my fish boi to be a yordle...","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-01-23T15:48:09.238+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually the other way around.\nThey changed his lore to be a Yordle now and have to update his lore page to reflect that.","replies":[{"poster":"XxDRAGONsAK47xX","date":"2018-01-23T16:25:40.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wat.\n\nNo. \n\nPlease no","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Garentheon","date":"2018-01-23T12:09:45.738+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, Woukong’s title is still ”monkey king”. \n\nCan we change the to “The Wuju Disciple”","replies":[]},{"poster":"Inphernal","date":"2018-01-23T19:00:19.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Haha, the new Swain update prank is hilarious.\nSo when can we expect the real rework?","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-01-24T15:24:56.993+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Someone's salty.","replies":[{"poster":"Inphernal","date":"2018-01-24T21:58:53.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"haha saying salty is just so funny isnt it xD","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-01-25T01:53:42.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not trying to be funny it's a observation.
