Kayle's helmet might be the most iconic piece of armor that any character has in the entire game, and that might just be me ranting to a wall because I've been playing since season 1 but come on. If you want to give her the bodysuit because she's supposed to look like a more lightly armored person due to her status as a flying person I kinda get it, and the wings are honestly awesome, but her new helmet just looks so damn generic and boring compared to her old feather warrior helmet.\r\n\r\nI do think that final form Kayle looks completely badass on the new VGU, but the fact that (I'm guessing) you have to get to level 16 to evolve to form 3 is kinda lame. Yes she is supposed to look less cool early game than she does late game and that's the whole fantasy of ascending, but her new armor just looks extremely stupid I'm sorry to say. I'd rather we go from current Kayle (a VGU art style version not literally the shitcan model from season 1) and maybe slowly level up to the level 16 version we see in the trailer. \r\n\r\nI am interested to see how her skins are though, I didn't think they'd make another character who requires as much work to make skins as my boy Kayn but here we are. I'm sure the skins are super cool, I just wish base Kayle was more of the iconic armored angel and her helmet is a massive part of that identity, she just looks like a normal soldier with wings who forgot to put on her full armor set right now.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I'm glad to see that Kayle finished the Benhart of Jugo side quest. Such an underrated NPC.  http://i.imgur.com/2z4lJe5h.png","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-02-18T23:08:23.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the general artwork is finalized long ago, and they are about to hit the PBE.

I can totally see them going from her heavy armor to a more light alternative because she flies, but the skintight bodysuit thing just does not work whatsoever.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fear the Kayn","date":"2019-02-19T15:28:54.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dark Souls 2 was easily the best dark souls game and Dark Souls 3 was a linear, boring piece of fan service garbage.
