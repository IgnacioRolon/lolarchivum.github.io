I just listened to the full 6 part Legends of Bilgewater series. I&#039;m honestly surprised it took Riot this long to try something out, I genuinely thought that short of sending League players on a real life easter egg hunt across the globe or going crazy with ARGs like Sombra in Overwatch, Riot had done everything (and impressively.)\n\nI hope that this experiment becomes a regular thing Riot. Maybe next time a demigod like Ornn is added to the game or a celestial god like Aurelion or Bard, something like this can be done. A normal dude telling all these stories painting champions who walk up to you and hit you on the head with an anchor like ancient legends who are super mysterious is just so satisfying. I&#039;m a fan of virtually everything pertaining to the lore and art that Riot ever does but this was honestly just as entertaining as some of the other methods.\n\nKeep it up as always lore team. Looking forward to the Darkin backstory that&#039;s probably up next. There&#039;s nothing like killing a horrifying Dark Souls boss then feeling really bad after you read the item description, I&#039;m anticipating something similar with Aatrox. Or maybe he&#039;ll just be one of the flat out badass Dark Souls characters who you still feel bad for killing because they were so cool. Either way works.\n\nAnywho, you should definitely start up the video I linked and put autoplay on, either that or I&#039;m sure someone made a playlist. Even if you&#039;re not a big lore reader it&#039;s super accessible and super interesting and you can listen to it as you watch your teammates feed on Pyke.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-06-01T15:53:03.054+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad you enjoyed them :-)\n\nAs I'm saying to everyone online - if you would like to see more, please give Riot that feedback directly.

We are a discipline (we have meetings together, learn from each other, drink together, give each other feedback), but we are all embedded on different product teams (i.e. Champions, Skins, Worldbuilding). We aren't sitting on a pile of lore and stories and deliberately not shipping them until a certain date. We do ideate, brainstorm, and then write toward a goal. Ship dates are filled with more moving pieces than just words. \n\nThe product teams have a shipping cadence, Narrative writers support whatever that shipping cadence is for their teams. We do not have one on our own for a myriad of reasons, some of which Scathelocke touched upon. We would all love this to be different. I would LOVE to make the Sona animation I wrote 2 years ago, ship the story sketches that informed character creation, etc... but sadly that probably won't happen due to the reality of budgets, production cycles, resources, product needs, and other elements of creating and maintaining a game like League, the most successful windows are around releases of content. Additionally, just because a write is passionate about a character/champ/story, does not always mean we could or should be able to tell that story. Sometimes it justifies the product, but even in the entertainment industry at large, having a good story does not always mean it's going to get told. \n\nNarrative in games has always been a hot topic and sometimes highly controversial one. Does story matter in a game like League? I think it does. I think a lot of people agree. Narrative in Riot is trending toward a much better and healthier place, but there's still more work to be done. We have lots of stories we want to tell.","replies":[{"poster":"Star Guardían","date":"2018-06-03T22:20:17.030+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Does story matter in a game like League?

Plus lots of champions, even more recent ones, have enough ambiguity in their stories that it crosses over from mysterious open ended stuff in a cool way to frustrating \"we just need to know the basics\" feelings.\n\nThat being said, that doesn't mean they can't do this kind of stuff too. It's reminiscent of the Bard, Ornn, Aurelion, and other more ancient and mysterious champions. It certainly wouldn't work for every or even most champions in this exact format, but the fact that they were doing four sea legends at once probably was too good of an opportunity to pass up. Plus a lot of the fun of these more ancient champions is the fact that we know quite a bit when they launch but have so many mysteries, then later we find out more and more. Juxtaposed to what characters in the real world of League of Legends know, it's really fascinating to me.\n\nTo bring up Dark Souls again, there's lots of open ended areas and lots of gaps to fill, but the basics are there even for the most mysterious of enemies.
