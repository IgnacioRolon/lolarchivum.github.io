With Aatrox and Rhaast making it seem likely lots of darkin have the double A in their name, I was wondering if Riot was planning or had considered and shot down the idea of changing Varus&#039; name to match his fellow darkin.\r\n\r\nI know that in the past Riot have said that not every darkin has the double A in their name but let&#039;s be real, that&#039;s how a lot of people identify the darkin and there&#039;s only 5 of them still alive in total. It might be cheesy but I honestly think having all 5 of the living ones have the double A in their name could be kind of a cool thing that they all share once they are all released in the year 2334. If there are lore only darkin characters they wouldn&#039;t need this obviously but I think just for the sake of identifying our champs and maybe making non-lore people go &quot;hmmmmmm, interesting&quot; it could be cool.\r\n\r\nThis would also make Varus the first champion whose name was changed, which I never ever think Riot should do under any circumstances... except this one. Maybe this one wouldn&#039;t be so bad and it would also make my friends who say Varus like V-ARRRRRRRR-us shut the hell up because he&#039;s not a pirate and intellectuals pronounce the name V-Air-us.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-06-08T01:12:46.108+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":5,"body":"In all my time at Riot, I have honestly never heard anyone say VAIR-uss or VARR-uss...\n\nIt's usually VAH-russ, like \"paris\" or \"embarrass\".

Arena is pronouced 'Ah-ree-na'. Banana is pretty much how it's spelt, we don't put an 'er' on the end. Or at least not an obvious 'er' sounds at least.\n\nBetter examples of regional 'a' pronunciation is grass. I'm from the south, to me it's pronounced 'grarss' (like car), for those higher, it's 'grahss' (think in 'bang')...I pronounce mass as with the mahss sound so it's not exactly consistant.\n\nSaying Warwick's name is a difficult one for us. :-P","replies":[{"poster":"Smithy2Q","date":"2018-06-08T15:03:22.709+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is a sub-type of British accent that freely adds R sounds after A's at the end of a word, though I don't know the name of it.\n\nIf anyone has played Dragon Quest VIII on the PS2, there is maid named Emma in the castle of Ascantha.  She introduces herself as \"Emmer, from the castle Ascanter.\"  I thought I was hearing things or there was a bug in the audio, but no, that's just her accent.
