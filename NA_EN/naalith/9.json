He has probably top 10 most badass themes to work with and a newer version of Children of the Grave could be an insane mechanic which Riot loves these days. \n\nMordekaiser could've been one of the very first VGUs. I wouldn't have been shocked if he was chosen first instead of Sion or Poppy years and years ago, yet somehow 4 years after they started going into overdrive on VGUs he still exists. They keep adding tier 1 champions to the VGU pool when really Mordekaiser deserves to be tier 0. He's so, SO outdated and has so many bugs. He should've been right there with Sion and Poppy yet he continues to be shafted and ignored.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FyreWall","date":"2018-08-06T21:32:33.977+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No other champion has a \"feature\" that DCs the whole game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-08-06T18:09:28.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rickrolling?
