Plus, Kassadin also uses a breathing apparatus like you would see in Zaun, and it fits in well with his lore description of seeking forbidden knowledge and being good with technology (That last bit is in his new lore summary on the client, in case you didn't know).","replies":[{"poster":"XxKezzxX","date":"2018-02-22T13:29:35.927+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add fuel to this fire, in the lore, found via http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/The_Journal_of_Justice:_Volume_1,_Issue_14 under \"Kassadin Attacks Malzahar in Attempt to Prevent Sacrifice\" Kassadin appeared in Zaun, as Malzahar said he would, because Malzahar was indeed threatening to sacrifice Kassadin's Daughter, who is presumably Kai'Sa. To back up the theory, and near-fact that this was Kai'Sa is her special interaction on kill with Malzahar, being \"I forgive you Malzahar, but I do not forget.\"\n\nNow, to bring up another detail to further add fire to this; In Kassadin's lore, it is stated, and I quote, \"Though once a notorious adventurer, he had chosen to live anonymously and raise a family among the nomad tribes of Shurima—until the day his daughter was claimed by the Void.\" It was never specified HOW Kassadin lost her to the void, only that he had. In the Journal of Justice, Malzahar opened a portal and the woman was taken inside by a shadowy hand. In this, she was taken by the void.\n\nSo, now that we've pretty much confirmed Kai'Sa was the one Malzahar sacrificed, in Zaun, and that Kassadin and his family lived in Shurima, on the same continent as Zaun, let us continue with a few questions. The first; what happened to their mother? As far as I know, we don't know. The second; Did Malzahar kidnap Kai'Sa from Shurima, or was Kai'Sa in Zaun when Malzahar attacked, taking Kai'Sa hostage in the process and then sacrificing her to the void? The third, and final question; Who's to say Kai'Sa didn't have a sister that was in Zaun with her at the time Malzahar did this (or followed the group to Zaun if they did kidnap Kai'Sa from Shurima)?\n\nThis moves us on to Jinx. In Jinx's lore, it specifically states; \"No one knows for sure exactly where Jinx came from, but many urban legends and folktales have sprung up around her. Some have her as a young gang member who fell in with the wrong crowd and was either traumatized by one too many killings, suffered too much at the hands of an enemy, or was simply driven insane by sump fumes. A few of the old timers in Zaun remember a young girl who might fit Jinx's description, but the girl they speak of is a far cry from the one who became Piltover's bane. This girl was sweet and innocent, a tinkerer with big ideas, who never quite fit in and came to a bad end.\"\n\nLook closely at a few key points, specifically, \"... was either traumatized by one too many killings, suffered too much at the hands of an enemy...\" and \"...This girl was sweet and innocent, a tinkerer with big ideas...\" If Kassadin is indeed Jinx's father, and it was a \"like father like son ( or in this case like daughter) moment, and where Kassadin has been proven to be an inventor via his void-suit, maybe Jinx picked up after her father in becoming a tinkerer, and if this is indeed the case, maybe seeing her sister sacrificed like this, as well as being practically abandoned by her father, due to Kassadin having his own mental break down, and focusing everything on trying to get Kai'Sa back, drove her insane to the point she became what she is now.\n\nKeep in mind, this is all speculation, and me merely trying to make ties where there might not be any. This is merely a \"what if\" post, and should be taken as nothing more. However, it is an interesting thing to think on.\n\nHave a good day, fellow summoners, and keep speculating!! {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"arob","date":"2019-07-03T14:12:23.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or what if Jinx was driven crazy because she was attacked by Malzahar in Zaun but was freed. But Kai’Sa was the one he sent to the void in the desert. Just more ‘what if’ speculation. Malzahar torturing her with void power could be the torment that made Jinx crazy, and this would allow for Malzahar to attack Kassadin’s daughter in Zaun and the desert, because it’s 2 daughters.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Naalith","date":"2018-02-21T22:30:27.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what I thought too, I threw a perhaps in there but it's still interesting either way.
