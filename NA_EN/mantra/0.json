We don't want you to get a Lunar Revel sale only to see it in a regular sale over the next few days, so we have replaced those sales in the Lunar Revel Shop with different offers.\n\nThey'll still be available in the normal store soon - you can grab the full list of sales [here](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/february-sales-schedule).","replies":[{"poster":"Fimora","date":"2016-01-29T23:09:11.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My shop changed as well... I bought 3 skins (Mafia Jinx, Dragon Fist Lee Sin, and High Noon Yasuo), and then the next day two new slots were open with new skins - Forsaken Jayce and Wood Kind Darius. They replaced the slots for High Noon Yasuo and Mafia Jinx. This happened with my friend too. Oh by the way Riot, if you're reading this I found a bug with Fiora's passive. I was against a Fiora top and when she popped her passive on me, my status affect says \"not available - fiora passive -p.___lunge\". Check in PBE again idk or fix it in the next patch.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Grimlust","date":"2016-01-29T09:59:16.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why did i lose dragonblade riven i don't see her listed there","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mantra","date":"2016-01-29T08:25:57.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thaaank you for clarification!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Epheamenne","date":"2016-01-29T02:10:34.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm leaving this post here for Riot staff as it has to do with this issue and the _**RP Purchase Error**_ that came with it.\n___\nI had a very similar issue with Jinx just now. I was going to buy Mafia Jinx/Jinx at 70% off only to find it updated with Firecracker Jinx/Jinx. I believe ( but am not sure that ) the resets are intentional. When I tried to buy the updated Jinx set though I found the shop had an error with the Jinx skin and other skins were still able to be purchased.
