Probably the most fun champion I&#039;ve played in a long time. But I do have a concern about his game play and that is his audio. He talks A LOT, and it&#039;s great to listen to, but sometimes he talks at the wrong moments... such as when he&#039;s warding. He&#039;ll say things like &quot;I&#039;ll just put that here... that&#039;s a good place... right?.. yeah...&quot; and &quot;Rakan, doing his job&quot;. And all of his quotes are heard by the enemy team. Doesn&#039;t that give the enemy some advantage? If the enemy bot lane knows that there&#039;s a ward in the bush closer to their turret, due to the audible evidence,  and they know exactly how long that ward will last, doesn&#039;t that defeat the purpose of a &#039;stealth ward&#039;? Now they know not to push for 1-3 minutes because the enemy top laner can teleport in. \r\n\r\nLike I said, Rakan is fun, he&#039;s well designed and a very interesting character.

Why are you lying?\n\nYou like the idea of it, sure, talking - listening to someone talking can be fun to some extent. But -NOT ALL THE TIME- You wouldn't last half a day without going insane. LoL is no different. A bit of chit chat is fine, 24/7 audio harassment is not, especially not when it also affects the gameplay like the op suggested.","replies":[{"poster":"PhoenixOfHeaven","date":"2017-04-29T23:31:22.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually, yeah it IS Immersive. The more people talking, the more 'in the moment' you are. Immersion is about atmosphere, which can be set up via scenery, music, or dialogue. Since the game's music and scenery are limited, they have to rely on dialogue.Also, if your mom is monologueing for 4 hours something needs to be done. \n\nIf you don't like it, isn't muting Champion voices a thing?","replies":[{"poster":"cocacolalips","date":"2017-04-30T05:34:25.721+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"People are so dense, It's funny.

Harassment is not cool. Harassment is against the law. Riot developers need to find a better balance between a bit of chit chat and harassment.\n\n> if your mom is monologueing for 4 hours something needs to be done.\n\nThank you!

If I'm forced to mute the sound, then your sound isn't good, there is something wrong with it and that should be addressed.
