I was regretting the slew of programs I was going to have to re-download, how ever I knew the only one I really wanted was league. So I googled league and went straight to the download link, finished it and tried to open it. It stalled for a few seconds then AVG relays a wonderful message \"Threat detected Win32/Heri\" from the freshly finished league download. I don't know if this is a recent issue or maybe a fluke, but I just thought I would bring this to everyones attention.","replies":[{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2017-01-14T00:55:33.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would rather have a trojan on my computer than AVG","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-14T00:06:48.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be a few reasons for this, the first is your current antivirus  updates.  Double check and make sure that it's up to date with the most recent definitions.  Also be sure that you're downloading league directly from our official site, and not anywhere else.  You can find that link [here](https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/redownload).
