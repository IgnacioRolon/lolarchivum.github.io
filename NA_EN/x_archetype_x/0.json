I can log on fine and play the game perfectly fine, but for some reason the League client icon in my dock is this paper, pencil, ruler, and paintbrush icon. It's not a huge deal, but it bugs me and I was hoping someone could help me fix it. Thank you in advance","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-28T02:26:29.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try unpinning this specific shortcut from the dock, then go into your **Applications** folder and drag a new shortcut to your dock. That should fix this situation right up.\n\nLet me know if you weren't able to get that to work for you.","replies":[]}]}
