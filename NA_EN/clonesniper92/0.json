Most of them are mac users but for some reason after I move Lol to my Applications folder after downloading the .dmg file, the icon will appear and load all the way and then disappear without doing anything else. I get no error message of any sorts and every time I try to reload the installer it just ask me if I want to terminate to previous installer... I've tried the following:\r\n\r\n-Reinstalling and downloading a new .dmg file.\r\n\r\n-Moving Userkernel(s) over.\r\n\r\n-Copying over Userkernel from friends WORKING LoL file.\r\n\r\n-Copying over project files.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far its to no avail. Has anyone else had or having this issue and can offer advice to solve it? Thanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-05T22:35:36.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your mac might be having an issue reaching our patching servers so nothing is coming up.
