The first time I called them I got something like a message to put my Order Number but my phone automatically closed... Then I called again and it said that I had insufficient funds to make that call... (I didn't get the RP). I wanna ask something... Do I lose my cash if I don't put the Order Code? Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-22T18:34:27.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not totally familiar with this method of payment, but we should be able to help figure out what happened.
