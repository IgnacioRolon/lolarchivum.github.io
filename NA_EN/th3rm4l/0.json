Looks like Riot poorly added character inking to it when they increased its length on PBE. Also, the lamp and shurikens from his recall have some weird lighting around them (probably caused by the lack of character inking too).\r\nPicture: https://i.imgur.com/H1aCisl.png\r\n\r\nPlease fix, it&#039;s my favourite skin in the game, and it makes me sad to see it bugged.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-01-12T18:01:02.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nCharacter inking in our game is finicky, and we don't have a ton of control over it. It's all or nothing, we can't select or deselect bits and pieces of the model that we'd like it to cover, unfortunately. To 'fix' something like this - it's more of a workaround - you'd need to turn off character inking entirely. \n\nOther skins, like Dawnbringer Riven, also suffer from this:\nhttp://imgur.com/m4Rd3YG\n\nIt's certainly a known issue on our end, but not something that would be a quick fix.","replies":[{"poster":"TH3RM4L","date":"2018-01-13T01:04:24.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for your response. It's unfortunate that it's not easily fixable, but I'll just hope that you guys will eventually find a way to do it.","replies":[]}]}]}
