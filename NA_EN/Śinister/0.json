We got emails and announcements about the \"1 month to redeem rewards before the new version\" like 3 months ago, and I didn't know if it WAS done and is just waiting to get deployed now or if its still being built and the email was just a future heads up?\n\nShanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Hollymonster","date":"2014-12-30T18:20:00.120+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The email was just a future heads up.  We didn't set a hard date because things on the backend were still being QA'ed and we weren't sure if there were going to be any outstanding issues (which there ended up being.)  We figured it would be fine to say \"30 days\" even if we couldn't hit that 30 days because it gives people more time to earn rewards in the 2.0 system.\n\nAll players old referrals transfer over to the new system, so even though it's been over 30 days it's not really a problem because players are still going to get all the rewards from the old system AND the new system when it comes out.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LowkeyQB","date":"2015-01-24T07:06:00.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any update at all many people are looking forward to this!","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeavensAfterNoon","date":"2015-01-22T00:14:11.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when will this be implemented","replies":[]},{"poster":"bigben1989","date":"2015-01-20T06:12:15.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah id like to know too.
