I forgot what my 5th item is because the game is usually over at this point.\n\nStart e and autoattack, repeat a few times and they probably die. Skip w at lvl 3, that ability is OP but it sucks compared to rank 2 e.\n\nSplitpush top until you get 2nd tier turret then go mid until the game is won. ~25 min game tops. When you hit level 6 you can 1v3 because your ult hits 3 people. If you're fed enough you can 1v4 or 1v5 because your e and q will kill 1 person each and your ult will continue to get the other 3.\n\npic related: Me sorting out Caristinn before WookieeCookie dropped the hammer.","replies":[]}
