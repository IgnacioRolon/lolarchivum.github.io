I&#039;m trying to better myself at the game and get into ranked more.\r\n\r\nEverytime I get into any sort of ranked game I end up getting flamed for not being great. I get it, people want to win, as do I, but thats no reason to start going off at people. \r\n\r\nPlaying normals just seems like a less serious atmosphere which is why i&#039;m trying to get back into ranked.\r\n\r\nAny tips for ragers? It&#039;s not helping at all, and the mute button seems as though I would be missing something if they were actually saying something useful. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance;\r\n\r\nSomeone who just got flamed in game.","replies":[{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-04-06T20:49:29.701+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on why they rage. I had a Lee sin jungler afk ragequit because he failed to secure a kill in bot lane and he left saying \"cya nerds.\" That kind of behavior is unavoidable and you just have to play it out without him. If it's a bot lane issue between support and adc, as a support or adc, you just need to suck it up and say yea, it was my fault and things get better. If you're a jungler and a laner starts getting tilted, pay him a visit to stop him from letting the enemy snowball IF it looks like he will rage. Otherwise snowball the winning lane like you're supposed to. If the mid laner rages, tell that person to roam and get fed off of other lanes. Some ragers are easier to reason with than others.\nEdit: Reread the post and now realize this sounds like I'm blaming you for getting raged at. Sorry, I was addressing how to deal with ragers in general. Usually mute report works, but always consider what you're being raged at for as a way to grow. If it's your cs, you know to work on last hitting minions. If they rage at you for putting no wards down as a support, then you know to focus on that. (It's not right that they rage at you, but it's a way to find out how to play better if you can ignore the selfish mentality of the people telling you.)","replies":[{"poster":"Upgrade Imminent","date":"2017-04-06T22:55:15.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely, the last game (the reason I posted this) was because the enemy adc was a twitch and kept murdering us in team fights. I couldn't get to him as I was playing MF and getting zoned super hard by gragas. I know for sure I was out of place in one of the fights and apologized. But honestly, I think the other times were just them looking to blame people (me and the support) as he was trying to peel for me.\n\nI appreciate the insight. I absolutely hone up to making mistakes (because I definitely make them) that's why I'm trying to learn :) \n\nThanks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-06T20:30:17.643+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked is a landfill (especially this season), just dont waste your time unless you dont care about trash.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-04-06T20:01:19.959+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mute them, if you feel someone is about to rage just mute and ignore them","replies":[]},{"poster":"Astrovert","date":"2017-04-07T18:37:30.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First don't respond to ragers, there is no point.\nSecond always report them at the end of the game.\n\nFunny how the people who tend to rage the most also tend to cycle through the most accounts.

I played so many bot games, then mained soraka support in normals before season 4. Then, after they changed supp items, I only played ARAM. Finally, I played in ranked. It is a bit more stressful than normals. Aside from muting and reporting, you might be better off alternating the ranked games you play. Maybe play 1 normal : 1 ranked, or change the ratio as you like.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Upgrade Imminent","date":"2017-04-06T22:52:28.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the answer all.","replies":[]}]}
