It is a refutation of this post imo. While he's certainly not top tier, he lies on the edge of viability  top lane. Full tank is not ideal so you still typically want at least one AP item. AP Ekko top is also a thing as we saw from C9 at Worlds.

Either the bases are high and it's easy to get a lead. Or the scalings are high and you never get a lead to use said scalings.\n\nEntire game is over at 10 minutes these days.\n\nLook at bot lane and compare Kai'sa to Vayne. Both or \"meh\" early but Kai'sa is still much stronger in early lane before first back thus can get her foot in the door. Vayne rarely does. Sure at 40 minutes Vayne is hella good... but Kai'sa ended the game with Stormrazor/Rageblade at 22 minutes.\n\nFizz/Ekko were great when they had base damage... now you almost never see them because they don't make it out of lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Sujiren","date":"2018-10-31T14:38:03.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Bad Touch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mfWOf8jF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-10-31T08:19:02.447+0000)\n>\n> Simple.
