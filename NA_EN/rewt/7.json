So lets say you que for ADC. and you get it. Then someone dodges. you accept the next que pop and you are guaranteed ADC. It gets really annoying that you get autofilled because someone dodged. This would also apply to being autofilled. If you get filled to support. you will be support as long as you are in that que","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-22T19:54:58.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually the other way around, if you stay in queue after a dodge you are actually more likely to get autofilled, or to get somebody autofilled in your team. The way the system works is that it tries to balance the time you stay in queue with mmr parity and getting everyone their desired roles. Because the timer isn't reset after a dodge, the queue time continues from when the first lobby was formed, so the system will start loosening up the other two parameters (mmr parity and roles) so prevent the queue time from being too long. The result is an increase in autofills (and/or unbalanced matchups).\n\nIf you don't like autofill the best strategy is definitely to close the queue for a few seconds then restart it to reset the timer.","replies":[{"poster":"Juicy √êoge","date":"2017-06-05T20:18:45.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not like that.
