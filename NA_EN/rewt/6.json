He would change stance in a Kindred mark selection style. Stance changing would be on a medium cooldown. (something like 30/25/20/15 (1/6/11/16) Seconds so you can only change once in a fight and it would work so you could initiate as one element and fight as another) \n\nI think he should honestly have 3 stances. Any more and it might be too much. Fire (damage) Stone (tank) Air (mobility) \nEach one would have its own abilities but they would be very similar. \n\nQ- Damage ability.\nW- Unique concept for each Element\nE- Mobility\nR- Unique \n\nFire- base 3% damage increase\nQ- is gonna be a boring In line damage skillshot that stops at first target hit and then sprays fire in a cone behind the target dealing 70% damage (2nd part cannot hit the primary target)\nW- will Increase Attack Speed and will give additional damage \nE- Short range dash that leaves a trail of fire that deals damage while inside of it (cannot go over walls)\nR- boost damage by 50%\n\nStone- Base 5% resists increase\nQ- AOE slam around the elemental dealing damage and then after a short duration pull enemies still within the field Towards the center and deal damage again (The pull will be pretty short, just a little tug)\nW- Gain a shield that absorbs damage over a short duration while giving 70% damage reduction (im thinking like 1 second duration so you have to time it to tank a powerful ability) and then heal for 20/25/30/35/40% of the damage taken\nE- leap a short distance and slow enemies inside of an AOE when you land. (this one CAN go over walls)\nR- Charge forward. If you hit a target Stun them and anyone within a medium sized AOE.\n\nWind- 5% base MS increase\nQ- Fire a skillshot that damages everything in a line and applying a light slow (emphasis on Light. like 5/7/9/11/13% slow)\nW- Fly to a target and give them a shield if they are an ally\nE- Dash a medium distance and give a speed boost in the aoe behind it.\nR- fly into the sky. From here you can choose within a large distance where to fly to. upon landing you will Apply a massive slow field in an AOE.\n\nEDIT: Ive always wanted there to be a summoner where you primarily use the summon but I cant think of a good way logistically to do it without the champion feeling super stale or really awkward to play","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-04T03:12:21.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been playing with the idea of a season-based support/mage jungler for about a year, that would steadily change stances, opening windows for various interactions. \nJust a neat idea riot will likely not ever do, due to how complicated it would be.","replies":[]}]}
