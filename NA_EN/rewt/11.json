A great example of this is something like Master Yi.\r\n\r\nYi is god in bronze, because players have no idea what to do. In silver he falls back a bit because people have figured out what to do. In gold The yi player has figured out how to dodge things with his Q and that makes him good again. And in plat + people know how to deal with him.\r\n\r\nThis change in the power of a champion SIMPLY because of player skill makes the game difficult to balance. As you dont want to completely ruin an elo by making a champion who is weak in 1 place completely busted in another.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is with the sheer amount of items and build diversity it makes it so that tweaking 1 item can change an entire meta. (Im looking at you Deaths Dance buffs)\r\n\r\nRiot does their best to test things but PBE will never be as good of a testing ground as live so they can only be so sure when testing on the PBE.\r\n\r\nThankfully Riot patches every week or every other week generally on Tuesdays so they are at least making an attempt to fix what is broken in the game. \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSecond is the Statement of being money grabby.\r\n\r\nThe biggest parts of this are \r\nA: Runes\r\nB: Expensive champions.\r\n\r\nFirst Im going to put this out there. The you cant buy runes. you have to grind for them. (I do understand IP boosts are a thing, but just because its faster still doesnt mean you can buy them outright with money)\r\n\r\nSecond Champions are priced in a way to try and make you pay real money to buy them. Why? because riot is a business. They need to keep the lights on.\r\n\r\nSo let me break down what it&#039;s like to be Riot Games Inc.\r\n\r\nI was working with a guy looking at server costs for approx 2K concurrent players. It was going to cost between 4-5K Per month. Riot Hosts servers that have over 1 million players at any given point. Think about how much that costs.\r\n\r\nAnother part is that they employ a large amount of people. Artists, Coders, Balance Team, Concept Design team, LCS Crew, LCS Staff. Accountants, Managers, etc. And I highly doubt any of them are making Minimum wage. Entry level for software engineers can be around 50K. And they employ a lot of them. And a lot of them are definately not entry level so we are looking at over 100K per year for some of them.\r\n\r\nThey have SO much overhead that its ridiculous. So understand that they need you to keep buying things so they can keep the servers running.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-11T01:34:56.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just let the lazy kids complain without understanding what they're talking about.\n\nI need my laughs.\n\n\n\nBut you may as well add in how people just copy what Lcs/Challenger players play and go with that meta and cry if anything outside that meta is used.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2017-07-11T02:13:53.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't imagine how much money it takes to host an eSports event. They need to rent out the venue, which I'm guessing is extremely expensive, then send all their crew there and set up the stage, the cameras, the vendor stands, the computers, the analyst desk, possibly the Riftwalk, and so much more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"silvertoof","date":"2017-07-11T01:34:59.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is A  LOT OF LEGITIMATE criticisms of Riot, specifically the current moderation team,  but Riot making money is not one of them.
