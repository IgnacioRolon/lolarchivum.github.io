I can&#039;t see how they could possibly do this without pushing out marksmen.\r\n\r\nThink about it this way. Marksmen are late game hyper carries who as long as they are peeled for can essentially 1v5. The problem is that they are super vulnerable (except when janna is in the game..... but riot is releasing a shield busting item so it wont be that way forever)  So if we nerf their damage output they just become sacks of gold for assassins and tanks. As a tank main I can say already im not all that scared of ADCs. I just hop on them and kill them 90% of the time. and thats in their current damage state. Imagine if we reduced that. Tanks could face roll adcs even harder.\r\n\r\nSo what im saying is that Bot lane is a touchy subject. to Introduce Fighters and Mages to the bot lane they would need distinct changes to the way the role operates. And they said they dont want to push Marksmen out of the role. This leads to the question. How. \r\n\r\nRight now there is a reason you dont play things that arent ADCs in the bot carry role. Cause you get rolled. You get poked out and lose. Mages are great in mid lane; but in bot lane where you can get locked down by a support, the ADC&#039;s consistent damage will beat out your burst unless you 1 shot them. \r\n\r\nWhat are the changes that could be made. \r\n\r\nYou could buff mages....... but then they would just be even better in mid. and thats not what riot is trying to do. so thats not the way.\r\n\r\nYou could nerf ADC damage output...... but then we will probably see a hard push meta where games end even faster because why run an ADC if they take even longer to become truly relevant. so yea... fuck that.\r\n\r\nThen there is the option that makes the most sense.... but it still has some hefty drawbacks. You can nerf supports and their itemization. Now this seems great in theory, but practically....... nah its a shit idea. Lets look at it this way. we have traditional supports like {{champion:267}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:40}} and yea. nerfing them would definately make ADCs more vulnerable to the playstyle of mages. So this seems like a great idea. But lets look at this a little deeper. when supports start to be shit we see the rise of &quot;lemme quick just 1 shot this ADC&quot; supports Featuring {{champion:161}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:63}} . So we could say. shit... gotta nerf them too. But here in lies the problem. only 2 of those champs actually are primarily played in support. {{champion:63}} &amp; {{champion:143}} . So if we nerf all of them then RIP Those actual mid laners. but if you dont nerf them..... RIP ADCs.\r\n\r\nThis is why its a slippery slope and in the end im ok with bot lane just staying Marksmanville.
