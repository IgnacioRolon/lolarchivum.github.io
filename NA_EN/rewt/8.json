This is just a problem I see a lot)\n\nWhere players on the enemy team do everything in their power to bait you into flaming them and then report you?\n\nCause like. You can mute Mastery if they are spamming it every time they get a kill. You can mute them when they chat things that are purposely designed to bait you into flaming them. But you know what you can't do? Mute the emotes of the champions.\n\nPeople will Spam laugh and emotes while playing to try and tilt you and get you to flame them. Then report you.\n\nSure the \"solution\" is \"Just don't flame them 4Head\" but like...... has this ever been addressed.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuthillick","date":"2020-01-08T00:32:58.086+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's this brand new behavioral theory out there that may be helpful.
