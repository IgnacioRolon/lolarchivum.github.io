I dropped out of my last two years of school at 17 now i'm 26 and decided to finish my education so i can go to university and i'm class with 16-19 year olds and by god they can't form a single sentence in english. Neither written nor spoken. It's disgraceful at this point how bad their english actually is in a country like germany. When i went to london earlier this year everyone i met complimented me on my english and asked if i was german with the usual reply that most germans speak english so well. Idk if it was just the british polite thing but my english teacher says the same while trashing the rest of my class so i guess my spoken english can't be too bad but what i wanted to say was that i can't confirm that germans are generally good at english. Even our headteacher made fun of them \"if you can't speak proper english in todays age better go shoot yourself\" LMAO. So i hope maybe some of them try to catch up. I was very disappointed to see such young people unable to speak atleast a somewhat fluent english but maybe it's a regional thing.

Of course people will talk in their own language, but mostly about stuff unrelated to the game. I find it rather nice to be honest, because after a while you start picking up their language and you will actually understand them. Usually in the EUNE it is mostly the polish people, who prefer their own language over english, but it's not even close to be that bad as in the case of the french. Also polish is easier to pick up than french. Furthermore most of the languages are slavic, so e.g if you start picking up czech you also get to understand slovakian, because of the similarity. Same is true for the balkans. The only problematic languages are romanian, hungarian and finnish etc., which don't really have any similar pair and are relatively harder to pick up.
