Riot keeps forcing It on us and wont grant takebacks, what a garbage system, But hey, atleast skt is gonna win a 4th time, iNsAnE mEcHaNiCs FaKeR wOw.","replies":[{"poster":"TryAndKickMe","date":"2017-11-04T07:44:38.975+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The client needing to Repair has nothing to do with your internet. It has to do with your computer. Something with the installation files isn't working properly.\n\nAlso, do you just disconnect while in game? While in champ select? When do you have connection issues? All of these can point to what the problem is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-05T21:46:17.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As TryAndKickMe mentioned, repairing doesn't typically involve a connection issue but rather the client ran into some missing or corrupted files on your pc. Without a working installation of League, these crashes can happen more often which is why the repair started, to try and prevent this from happening more and more. Were you able to get the game running smoothly after that repair?","replies":[]}]}
