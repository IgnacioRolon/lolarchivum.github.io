We then laned as two and lost the game. Every time this happens I will post on boards to keep you guys posted, I did report him in the after game screen but again I want to take it one step further and let this person get what he deserves.","replies":[{"poster":"Delete Aakali","date":"2017-07-09T17:19:08.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi\nwhat im experiencing is in every single game there is 2 or 3 trols and all of them are sivir ahri anivia with same abilities and they going under turrets and do nothing when getting attacked and just feed with no reason without saying which lane they want theyr just troling they are fucking my every game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-09T01:07:28.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, I'm proud of you for reporting them in the post game and not becoming toxic when they took your lane! Taking the higher road is always the best option, for both getting action taken on them and for keeping your own account safe!\n\nThanks for bringing this to our attention, but again reporting them is going to be your best method for getting something done. We can absolutely review the match, but there's not a lot I can do on my own. The best way to help would be to give us more ammo by sending reports!","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Am No 0ne","date":"2017-07-09T00:12:29.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Id also like to add how toxic I used to be last season, I didn't even say a word this game. #REFORMED.","replies":[]}]}
