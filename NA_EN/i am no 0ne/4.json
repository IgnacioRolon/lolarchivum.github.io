I asked who was on the other but he never responded. The fizz did not say a single word the entire game and the yasuo spoke but never said much. I was in my promotions to platinum 4 and was 1-1, I tried to be as positive as I could have given the circumstances, I went to the riot support website and they said that we should not report people there, and I know that riot is not going to look into the matter on their own hands so I'm bring it up in here in hopes that riot can review the game after reading this. I usually do not get this mad but the trolls in ranked are getting out of hand. The youtube link above is the fizz.","replies":[{"poster":"I Am No 0ne","date":"2017-06-26T22:57:35.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I 100 definitely did lol, But I wanted to take it one step further.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-26T22:55:58.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope you made sure to report them in the post game, as that's the best method of making sure they get noticed.","replies":[]}]}
