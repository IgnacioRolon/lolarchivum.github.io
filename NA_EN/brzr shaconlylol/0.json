I alt-F4'd to kill the app and get back in, and when I log in I don't rejoin the same game.  Super rough, is this a known bug right now? \r\n\r\nI received no bug splat, no errors, no match history.  Maybe i'll take a loss once the game actually ends?  Super aggravating.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-27T22:21:08.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that match isn't showing up in match history and you can't get any reconnect attempts, it's most likely that the game crashed entirely from the servers. It's pretty rare, but in these cases everyone else is booted from the game as well and nobody will get any penalties for that match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"P3NANC3","date":"2017-08-26T20:59:48.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I just experienced the same issue. I just started a match, was doing fairly well. I want to recall, nothing happens and the D/C bar appears... of course LOL's \"attempt\" never does anything, so after waiting a few seconds I ALT-F4, and get booted back to the client without the normal \"reconnect\" & \"quit\" button. Thought maybe it was a glitch. Restarted the client, nothing... \nIt also doesn't appear in Match History, nor do the players appear in recently played with.\n\nThe worst part is that my team mates might think I left them hanging, and report me for leaving... at which point I wouldn't be surprised if Riot slaps me with a penalty such as stripping honors or whatever, even though there is absolutely nothing I could do about it, and I really want to get back into the game.\n\nI suppose the only positive side to view this from is that it wasn't a ranked match... during the final promo match or something like that.","replies":[]}]}
