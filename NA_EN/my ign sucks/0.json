They have sophisticated bots that are programed to imitate real people. They dedicate about half their NA servers to maintaining this facade, which is why they're always so laggy.\nYou can actually test this.\n- Bacon Hawk always shows up when Bacon is mentioned.\n- Stashu responds to all topics about Cassiopia, but always uses a near cookie-cutter response about how great she is now.\n- Scarizard only comments about how much he regrets the Skarma Rework.\n- Phreak's posts all contain \"TONS OF DAMAGE!\".\n- Morello only talks about nerfs.\n- Pwyff is the dedicated patch bot. You never see it anywhere else.\n\nOf course, they also have some bots that appear as normal forum users to defend them and help throw off the scent.\nLike me for example.\n\nSigned,\n~ Reverse-psychology bot conspiracy inc.","replies":[{"poster":"Alleo","date":"2014-12-09T01:26:21.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> - Bacon Hawk always shows up when Bacon is mentioned.\n\n\nLets test this,\nOne of my friends had a Bacon stuffed turkey covered in layers of Bacon for thanksgiving.\nno joke...he loves Bacon that much","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abracadaba","date":"2014-12-09T06:37:31.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"and Rioters shouldn't be allowed to have alt accounts.
