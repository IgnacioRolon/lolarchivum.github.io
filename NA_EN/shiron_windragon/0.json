I got used to play ARAM and kept forget locking in resulting me getting blocked from queues...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-13T04:38:12.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't need to lock-in for ARAMs since your champion is automatically chosen for you. Pretty sure the other game modes require you to lock-in so people can't join lobbies and immediately AFK as soon and champion select starts. Make sure you're ready to play when entering a queue and ready to chose and ban your champions!","replies":[{"poster":"Yordlechortle","date":"2017-12-13T22:20:40.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something is causing it. I submitted a bug. Same thing has happened to me 3 times in the last 2 days.  I enter game. Choose my intended champ. Ban a champ. Select masteries and wait for it to count down and launch game and when it gets to 0 it says I dodged the game and gives me a lockout time.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-13T22:34:59.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do need to lock-in, and not doing so can end up resulting in LPQ's or punishments for multiple 'left/afk' game lobbies. Make sure you're locking in when you've decided on a champion, then you can still adjust your masteries and such. Even moreso, better to be safe than sorry ^_^!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
