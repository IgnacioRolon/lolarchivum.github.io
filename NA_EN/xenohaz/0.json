It&#039;s been mentioned before that only Iceborn can use True Ice weapons, but how does Trundle fit into that?  He&#039;s a troll, and isn&#039;t stated to be part-human or anything like that, so I&#039;m guessing he&#039;s not descended from Avarosa/Serylda/Lissandra, as that would raise a lot of questions.  Can trolls just bypass that requirement?  Or can Iceborn like Lissandra bestow the capability?  Just a random thought.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-08-21T17:19:55.977+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trolls are already magical creatures connected to the land.\n\nIceborn is a term for a type of magically gifted **human**.","replies":[{"poster":"Xenohaz","date":"2018-08-22T15:20:49.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha, thanks for the clarification!

We know plain humans can't use true ice weapons mainly due to the fact that in the lore story about the descent into the Abyss, the Iceborn guy states that there's an insane, bone freezing chill radiating off the weapons that hurts him, and would pretty much kill anyone who's not Iceborn. So clearly, Iceborn have some kind of innate resistance to the cold that allows them more fortitude to wield those weapons.\nSo then we turn to Frost Trolls, magical humanoids inhabiting the Freljord, who clearly have this super high resistance to the cold due to how Trundle dresses with next to no clothing covering his naked torso. The trolls clearly don't care about the cold, so it's understandable that it'd be nothing for them to wield true ice with ease.\n\nAnd as a note - this revelation that the Iceborn are resistant to the cold is ugly in that it's a justification for Ashe's miniskirt and exposed arms.
