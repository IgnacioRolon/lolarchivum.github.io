Just to keep you updated, I have found a cause of this issue (what I found is my best guess for why it is occurring for most people. If you still have the issue after this update please let me know). We had an incompatibility with some Samsung devices :( I am fixing the issue now, but it will take until next week for it to release. I appreciate your patience and will let you guys know when an update is ready.

No changes had been made and i never had any real problems before.\nThis is what happend:\nThe same account as i use here.\nThursday i received a message on the mobile app in one of my clubs, i wanted to respond, but my answers never made it into the chat, they kept pending. Usually when it's pending a bit longer than usual, i close the app and open it again, but that didn't work this time. Even after i logged in on the client and played a couple games, the messages i send on the mobile app never entered. In the evening i decided to try to re-log, and ever since it is stuck on initializing. I tried force stop, soft and hard reset on my phone and even de-installing and re-installing the app. None of this worked. it's  initializing for a week now. \n\nYet on my bf's phone it is working without problems and he has a samsung galaxy s4 Lite. \nAs far as i know, i didn't had an update, nor any changes in my settings. \nI did try to send this report through the mobile app bug reports also, but i'm not sure if that worked.\nThe only other thing i can say is, that i did had a similar kind of issue in the first couple days this mobile app was released, this was solved pretty fast though.","replies":[{"poster":"SandAuror","date":"2017-03-16T15:53:10.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem here, using Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini (GT-I9195) on Android (4.4.2), was working fine until I relogged due to messages never sending and since then been suck on initializing.
