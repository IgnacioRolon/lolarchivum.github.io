I wish I could do something to make things easier, but we don't have control over ISPs.  We've been checking for updates, and have posted pinned threads [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/uxE7avEp-622-connection-issues-on-eu) as well as [EU boards](https://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements-en/9aupEmoP-23-06-17-issues-with-bulgaria-and-surrounding-regions) on this issue and wanting to get this fixed and get you back in game.\n\nPlayers in Bulgaria and sorrounding regions have been impacted the hardest.  Currently, we believe that trying a VPN or configuring DNS per the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide could help by re-routing how you get to the game server.  The culprit appears to be a bad node when your network travels to get to us.  If you're still having an issue, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) as well.  Our tech team can take another look with you and try to find more options specific to your case.  Hang tight!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shtit","date":"2017-06-30T18:33:01.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK tnx, i can play only aram but everything is so hard to be maked.
