I have a few skin shards sitting in my account that I really want to turn into permanents and with the release of the championship chests I figured now was as good a time as any to buy chests to get skin shards so I could turn them into orange essence and unlock the skins i have. \r\n\r\nSo I bought 5 chests, all 5 contained skin shards, this left me just shy of what I needed so I ended up just going \r\n\"screw it\" and bought the 11chest/key bundle. \r\n\r\nI only needed a SINGLE 750 value skin to turn into essence. \r\n\r\nSo what happens? 11 chests, open the first one \"champion shard\" (I have like 200k IP  and all champions so these are virtually useless to me), open the next one \"another champion shard.\" Crap....next one HAS to be a skin shard! Open the next one and its! you guessed it, another champion shard, next one....the same , another useless champion shard. \r\n\r\nI'm down to my 6th chest and I came here to see, are the chests in bundles all ONE type of loot? That's freaking absurd if so. \r\n\r\nI feel like I literally just pissed away 10 dollars for nothing, I have zero use for champion shards at all, really really frustrated at this, I thought the opening of chest was random for what you would get in them , be it a skin shard, champion, icon, etc. \r\n\r\nReally really wish I had a way to refund this now :(, I would have spent that RP on just straight up buying skins instead if I know this.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-29T18:18:19.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hextech loot is completely random, with the only modifier being that it prioritizes content you don't already own.

I was hoping to stash the Epic Capsules and open them next week for a better chance at getting Star Guardian.\n\nThanks","replies":[]}]}]}
