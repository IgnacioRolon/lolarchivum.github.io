The laptop&#039;s screen is 120GHz and I am running Windows 10. I should be able to easily keep the game at 120 FPS, without it never getting lower, I should actually get way more than 120 FPS, but for some reason, the FPS are always going up and down between 50-115... I have to say that Alt-Tabbing in and out of the game takes a considerable amount of time, with me getting a black screen with only LoL&#039;s cursor for about 10 seconds when Tabbing in the game again. Before purchasing this laptop I had another one, without a dedicated graphics card, 8gb of ram and 3.2 GHz and it could run the game smoothly at about 140 stable FPS, no problems with alt tabbing, but it ran Windows 8.1. Could the OS be the problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2019-01-10T07:03:26.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey NovaStriker v2,\n\nThose are some hefty specs, do you know if your laptop uses switchable graphics? For Nvidia, it's called Optimus and it helps the system decide when to use the integrated (Intel) graphics and discrete (Nvidia) video cards. Sometime the settings cause it to use the integrated card for certain games. We have instructions here to properly set that: \nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002840248#h1q3\n\nNote if it's a G-SYNC screen, it's unlikely due to this because Optimus and G-SYNC aren't compatible. Besides that, it's always a good idea to update the video card drivers: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684#wq1 \n\nIf you continue running into issues, please reach out to us through the [Support Site](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and one of my colleagues can continue looking into this weird performance behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HopeStartsWithU","date":"2019-01-10T09:39:06.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe heat issues?
