BASED IN EDDIE, OF IRON MAIDEN SOMEWHERE IN TIME. \r\n[&quot;IMAGE OF THE CONCEPT HERE&quot;](http://i67.tinypic.com/359id74.jpg)\r\nI LIKE A LOT THIS CONCEPT OF JHIN, IF YOU LIKE THIS LET ME NOW.\r\n\r\nSECOND, I LOVE BREAKING BAD. AND I SEE THAT SINGED PROBABLY HAS POTENCIAL.\r\nSINGED AND HEISENBER ARE PHYSICALLY SEEMED, AND I SAY, WOW, WHY NOT MAN.\r\n[ONE IMAGE HERE BRO](http://i66.tinypic.com/20hvdch.jpg) \r\nIF YOU LIKE THIS LET ME NOW.\r\n\r\nTHIRD, I HAVE RENCOR TO RIOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT RELEASED MANY SKINS, WITH GREAT POTENTIAL FOR GRAGAS. RIOT HAS BEEN ABANDONED HIM IN THE CREATIVE AREA AND THE SKINS THAT HE HAS ARE NOT SO SO GOOD. THEN I HAVE THOUGHT IN CERTAIN CONCEPTS. IN THIS CASE I SPEAK OF A POSSIBLE GRAGAS DUNKMASTER. I DO NOT HAVE A RELEVANT IMAGE BECAUSE I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO DRAW A CONCEPT, BUT IT SEEMS INTERESTING AND I WANTED TO POST THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT MAY HAVE POTENTIAL. \r\nI KNOW THAT THESE TWO BEFORE MENTIONED DO NOT PLAY A LOT CURRENTLY, BUT A BUFF AND AN APPROXIMATE REWORK WILL BRING OUT THE LIGHT AGAIN. \r\n\r\nTHANK FOR READING, SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH. AND IF I&#039;M INFRINGING ANY NORMS OF THE FORUM, DO WHAT IS NECESSARY WITH THIS POST. AGAIN THANKS.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-05T21:55:33.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your capslock seems to be broken.","replies":[{"poster":"LokxTar","date":"2017-01-05T22:03:34.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha sorry for that bro.
