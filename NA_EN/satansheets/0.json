Why have a skin, and not change the ability looks much. Kind of annoying to me. The Icon process doesn&#039;t take a lot of thought/process to fix. \r\n\r\nCould be perfect with a manatee emblem. Or a different Icon all together. I feel even though he looks different, it&#039;s the same skin as the other. _\r\n\r\nI feel the creators are getting lazy at this point~_","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-30T17:14:55.201+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey XZmbeJetX! \n\nThanks for taking the time to leave feedback! \n\nFor a bit of context here, like AvantelWings pointed out, this is a 750 RP skin. Generally, 750 RP skins don't receive new particles, unless it's what we consider to be quality of life. Ex. Changing Warden Nautilus' shields to match the new thematic.  In this case, we actually used Master Chef Tahm Kench's decal, as opposed to the base because we felt it worked better with the thematic (and matched his bib :3).","replies":[{"poster":"Insanity Song","date":"2016-04-04T07:25:47.917+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"credit to you for actually responding","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-03-30T05:02:17.382+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a 750 skin -- they don't get new particles.
