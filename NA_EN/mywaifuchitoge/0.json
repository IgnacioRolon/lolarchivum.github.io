I tried to delete a lot of my games i have on my computer like fallout 3 and fallout new Vegas along with few other high memory games and still didn't work. I also lowered my graphic settings from high to low but not even a slight change, it still drops all over the place. Then i got the idea to repair lol files and that just got done and still no change. I have ran out of ideas on what it could be so it took to the board. This has never happened before and i don't know anything else that could be wrong with my computer alone cause i can play all my other games fine. If i could get some solutions or help i would very much appreciate it cause i suck at league and i want to play and get better cause its one of my favorite games to play \r\n\r\nWhat happens \r\n-When i join game it always start at 01fps and then will go to 60fps\r\n-when i move 60 fps with a hiccup to 45fps \r\n-When more then 4 items moving on screen drops around 40fps and trys to go to 60 and goes up and down \r\n-Whenever i use ability it drops to and jumps back up","replies":[{"poster":"Hammoth","date":"2015-10-09T02:18:34.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been having the same issue today.

I messed with settings in nvidia control panel and forced it to run league without v-sync.  I don't -think- I changed anything else that time, but I'm not 100% sure because I was frustrated and facerolling my keyboard..","replies":[{"poster":"Rkoturdo Ndo","date":"2015-10-09T07:55:20.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya\nWell glad to hear, i guess you dont need help anymore then^^\n\nRegards Rkoturdo","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-08T18:08:47.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would suggest you check out the FPS guide since you already have the issue figured out.
