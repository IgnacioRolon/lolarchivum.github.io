I repetitively stop playing League for about a month then always come back and I always start my games saying &quot;Hi! How is everyone?&quot; and the responses are astounding... all I ever get is harassment and hate speech. I was even trying to give tips at the end of a game to my team and the enemy team just kept saying &quot;F**cking noobs lol&quot;, I used to like League but now I wish I could have all my money back because the gameplay is dissatisfying and the community are all extremely rude, Ive maybe met about 1% that are nice.","replies":[]}
