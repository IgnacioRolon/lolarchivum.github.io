I honestly think im one of the older veterans in this game, so many memories. Im only posting here and my last hoorah to a game that i have put over 50,000 hours into, i have to have.\n\ni just about got 1,000,000 mastery points on malzahar, and almost got his Hextech skin, was two gemstones away. I got AN ultimate icon form the odessy event, met some close league friends that ill always remember, and was working on mastering every champ in the game.\n\ngot a sweet diamond border that i worked SO hard to get and celebrated hard that day when i got it\n\ni had a ton of skins that i dotn even use from chests lol just saving legendary ones and over rmonths finally getting them with orange esense, not to mention the money i spent.\n\nOH and i played with nightblue3 in diamond elo last season! I fangirled so hard and honestly think i creeped him out because he wanted to play yasuo mid, and i said he could have jungle and he wen tjugnle and just wanted to surrender XD \n\ni was gonna go hard and truely belived i could of got near master this seaon by takign every game seriously, then i was gonan take a breka from league because i am looking into the United States Air Force.\n\nI slipped up today though, i went a few months without getting in trouble,didnt play  much here and there, but i just wasnt focused enough to not be toxic today. i was stressed over tickets, leaving for the military, my friend was depresing the livign hell out out of me. \nAnd i played a ranked 3v3 game where i got my diamond, and the enemy team just made fun on it, and said i was a gold player, even though i earn mid plat every solo qeue season. I love my diamond border, and idk why players woudl reference it if they are also playing 3v3. If my profile shows it, then i am going to say i am ranked diamond, It makes me really happy to see.\n\nanyways i doubt anyone read this entire thing lol, i obviously emailed riot and asked if the system made an error, but i know it is probabyl false hope. \n\nI am not gonna google it or somthign, but isnt there like some greek mythology or somthgin that says hoep is the strongest thing humans can have?\nWho knows maybe a miracle can happen, but if not, i think this is it for league. I had so many Ups and so many lows and even though its just a dumb game, its honestly a part of my life and the sole reason i call myself a gamer.\n\nIts gonna be strange watching youtube vids on league or streamers, or lcs knowign that i cant get on and join in anymore, and idk where it leaves me now. I wrote this all out of a deep saddness, but know its my fault to blame, and maybe im just weak minded, and thats why i failed in not being toxic today. It just hurts more knowing the many days i went these last couple months not touchign my account cause i was scared i woudltn be abel to control myself. guess those fears turned out to be right. \n\nthanks to anyoen i played with and thanks for the good time, and for letting me post a final time. &lt;3","replies":[]}
