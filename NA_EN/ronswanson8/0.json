If any player is marked as *inactive* for 90+ seconds within the first 3 minutes of the match, a remake will become available at 3:00. If a player is inactive shorter than that, or if they disconnect **after** 3:00 has rolled by, the match will **not** qualify for a remake. \n\nCheck out our [/Remake FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) for more details.
