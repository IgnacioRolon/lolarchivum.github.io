Vi had never mana issues in the jungle, esp. after tier 2 jungle item.\r\n3. losing 15% attack speed early game slows down your clear A LOT.\r\n\r\nin conclusion: she got nerfed in the early game, cause noone maxes W first. well played.\r\n\r\nDear Riot, we Vi mains know, that you completly forgot our champion after you released Camille aka Vi 2.0, who has the bigger plays, the better utulity the better stats. Camille is legit better than Vi in everything (Top and Jungle) but jungle clear speed. \r\n\r\nWhen you really nerf her last strength against Camille, you can put her on top of your GU list.","replies":[{"poster":"playtestpenguin","date":"2018-04-04T00:33:58.813+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":4,"body":"these are experimental changes designed to test if she can function in top lane that are separate from regular gameplay changes (read: standard buffs/nerfs to numbers)","replies":[{"poster":"Twin TaiIs","date":"2018-04-04T02:08:21.991+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"if u want to buff lane vi, how about u give her tools to actually survive top. her shield is absolute garbage compared to 99% of top laners and their ways to win top.

Her shield is not on demand, and in fact requires her to not use an ability in the minion wave, making it even worse if u wanna use it strategically. She has no defense steroids, like poppy or garen's W passives. She will never survive top lane even if she could push well, simply because any poke is immediately denied. Just look at camille. Shield is only physical or magical, but most top laners stick to 1 damage source. Also, only procs when she goes in, aka, when it matters, and she even has a heal still. \n\nAnd as for jax, the champ that has no defense steroid (until R), he has a dodge, which is very good in top, and he is very busted right now simply due to his dueling power.

However Riven has her shield up much more quickly, and easily, and it flows in her kit very well. The issue with Vi top is she doesn't have access to her shield on demand, and as such can't sustain well in top lane.

It would help keeping her damage more relevant in the late without overbuffing the early, and most off all it would make Steraks more viable for her.\nNon juggernaut fighters currently lack their own itemisation, they rely on Trinity, juggernaut items and in somecases assasin items, but the most important juggernaut item(steraks) is not that great on them as they usually have bonus ad ratios rather than total.\nIt feels like Steraks is mandatory for fighters to be viable in teamfights, it prevents them from beeing burst down while also helpping vs the CC chain(though not that great as there is to much cc that isn't affected by tenacitiy and the overall cc-uptime is to damn high even with tenacity)\n\n\nWhile i really appriciate that you want to help out toplane VI, please make sure that it doesn#t come at the cost of jungle VI. As others said, 15% as from the rank 1 W is quite a hit to her early clear times.\n\n_Edit: just saw the base stat change, the base AS might actually keep her early clears close to live._\n\n-------------\n\nIn this Context, are there any plans on getting other champs viable for more roles like that? I miss toplane shyvana, and with some small buffs to his mana, nocturn could work top aswell(mana refund on succesfull spellblock?).\nAlso, maybe consider changeing steraks a bit. Imo it's an item ment to enable teamfigting on champs that naturally do well 1v1 but struggle in temifghts(so fighters), but right now it's also really powerfull 1v1 and they still are a bit lacking in teamfights.\nSo how about haveing the shield and tenacity scale in some way with the number of nearby enemies?\nAlso, is it really neccesary to have steraks and maw shar thier passive? It really limits fighter itemisation and the main abusers of that combo were adc, but steraks is now melee only.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-04-04T06:20:01.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly as someone who likes playing Vi top I'm really hoping these changes go through, it would make her a lot more viable and fun in lane!","replies":[]},{"poster":"WarWork","date":"2018-04-04T03:06:02.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just a pleb with no balance degree, But how about giving her Q a small refund for hitting champs?
