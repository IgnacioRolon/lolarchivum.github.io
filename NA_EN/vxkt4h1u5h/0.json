I have contacted my ISP and checked if there was anything wrong.. They said I was good to go but they would send someone out to check anyway. They came out replaced my modem, tested everything(replaced modem just incase port issue), everything was good to go.. But I still have packet loss.. This is very frustrating as I created a new account and have lost 2 of my placement games do-to this issue. I have contacted Riot Support via https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/ and received some help, I have done all that the person has suggested yet nothing has worked. Saying so, this has to be something related to Riots server etc because after doing some research today, I have noticed A LOT of people complaining about \"Packet loss\", \"Invisible lag\" and \"teleportation?\". I see something was released about 4 hours ago related to a company changing a optic fiber cord and people may experience disconnects/higher ping. I would like to know if this has anything to do with the packet loss/lagging that has affected many since 6.10 and if it has nothing to do with it, I would like Riot to look in-depth into this packet loss/lagging that is happening for players on the NA server across the west side of the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-04T00:04:18.439+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"The thread posted earlier today about the fiber optic cut hasn't happened yet.

I personally have Comcast and ran through all the suggestion solutions on Riot's support page, and am still experiencing games with 10-15% packet loss.
