Around 7 games ago my computer had a blue screen in the middle of the game and as I tried my hardest to reconnect I could not come back (The game lasted 22 mins and my team won without me.(In a normal queue)) so I received 5 games in the low priority queue of a 20 min wait time. I attempted to email riot to get this injustice resolved but I ended up playing 5 games in low priority before they could respond which is 100 minutes of wait time and each game being around 30 minutes as well. So after finally being freed from my unfair low priority prison I played a bunch more games. All of the games I had played up until this point were perfectly fine and I had no issues, until that one match happened. During this one game I got 13000+ ping and could not move, after a long attempt of trying to fix this problem (Shutting down EVERY other thing on my computer but league of legends, restarting computer and restarting my internet.) I eventually gave up and sat at spawn waiting for this ping to go down so I could communicate what was happening to my team with little luck. I never stopped trying but my team had ended the game and won their team was salty and all the usual league of legends community stuff. I still got put in another Low Priority Queue for another (to what I assume is 5 games of 20 minutes each.) I know a lot of you are gonna say stuff like \"Don't play ranked if you have a toaster and bad internet\" but this was a 1 time thing, people will also probably say \"But there is so much toxic feeders and trolls so this way is good even if innocent get punished.\" I also know that there is no way to really figure out if someone had really disconnected or is just a troll but there has to be a better version than \"Hey look they disconnected and didn't move for 3 minutes lets give them 20 minutes of wait time before every game even if they reconnect so they learn their lesson of not playing unless directly connected to the server. In conclusion I know that Riot is not gonna help me or remove this low priority because why should they for all they know I just decided to afk to try to make my teammates lives just a little bit harder so I am not hoping for that, What I am hoping for is that this post reaches out to the group of people who have felt this and have been banned for something beyond their power. I really just want this to go to somewhere where someone will consider this and try to make a way to make this problem better (If you have any ideas share them!) and help out all wrongfully banned summoners in the future!\r\n\r\nTL:DR : I got put in low priority for something that I couldn't control and now I'm bitching about it and trying to get something done for myself and others in the future (Share your ideas for a better afk punishing system so we can get somewhere with this!\r\n\r\n_{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} \r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Oblivion09","date":"2017-11-06T05:16:06.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have not played League in a while and recently i have playing with my friends leveling their accounts up because they are new. The last game i queued up for with my friends crashed during the loading screen. When i logged back in i was put into a low priority queue. I feel that i have been wrongfully banned because i haven't played in a very long time and the first game that crashes for me, gets me banned. This system needs to be more accurate because i shouldn't get put into a low priority queue after not playing for so long, playing games consecutively as a good player, than my first technical problem gets me punished. Please help","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-11T16:35:36.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Leaving or idling in game can mark you by [leaverbuster ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)with a lower priority queue, regardless of the intent because it still causes everyone else a negative experience.   You will only be marked by leaverbuster after multiple games and not just one, so there may have been more situations than just a blue screen error.  The best way to overcome this is by continuing to play without any further interruptions, and test out any issues in a custom game.  If you have any technical issues I'm happy to help; otherwise, I hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyRobot","date":"2016-08-11T20:21:43.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing without interruptions is not an option in some peoples cases because they may happen on the fly like in my game. For the past 3 games before this one game I had no ping issues no lag or anything but then for whatever reason I get 13,000 ping. If this is the only reason why someone would disconnect and they could do nothing to stop it and this happens to them over a course of a month and they still get the low priority queue punishment and then right after they play 5 games no problem and get out of the queue and then play their next game and get suspicious lag issues out of nowhere. Now I don't know about other people but league of legends is the ONLY game I get ping issues with and it is a shame because of the  effects that it has on a team when someone has to leave. So inc conclusion if I went to go test these issues in the game then there would be no problem but there is always going to be that one time when something messes up and I get banned again\n\n.{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Hillnor","date":"2017-04-19T22:01:06.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I've had that same problem, the annoying part was that I used the cmd on my other screen to make a ping test to different pages while having no connection in the game. The funniest part is that I had 50 ping to Riot servers in the cmd while the game would say I had over 10 000 ping to the game server, so it obviously was their fault. It was just once and I didn't get punished for it, but I got a warning for something they had caused.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"sskkrreeeeeee","date":"2017-03-31T15:51:45.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way the bust system works right now is crippling this game.
