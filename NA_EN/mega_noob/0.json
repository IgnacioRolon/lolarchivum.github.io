The mana regen we have now was balanced for slow SR games, not for this under 15 minutes spamfest fiesta, come on. \r\nNone plays AP champions for a reason, i tried to play orianna, anivia and etc and it was awful, my skills did jack sht and i have been oom for majority of the game. \r\nPLS at least increase the mana regen.","replies":[{"poster":"wolf jade","date":"2018-12-26T09:54:51.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do not agree with you AT ALL if you play mages and do not do damage on nexus blitz its something wrong with your play style","replies":[{"poster":"Mega Noob","date":"2018-12-26T09:58:53.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=wolf jade,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=m2vAt8A9,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-12-26T09:54:51.880+0000)\n>\n> Do not agree with you AT ALL if you play mages and do not do damage on nexus blitz its something wrong with your play style\n\nShow me yourself winning games on it with for example {{champion:103}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:4}} \nNone is playing these champions. \nAll i can see is you losing the mode playing lux, orianna and syndra","replies":[{"poster":"wolf jade","date":"2018-12-26T10:08:12.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all the games i played in this gamemode are {{champion:99}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:8}} \n\ni have 60% win rate in this gamemode \n\n(i would have more if it idnt put the games before they changed it more in to the system there 2) and i played 120 matches or so of this gamemode","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moonscourge","date":"2018-12-26T10:01:57.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen tons of Karthus and Lux, a bunch of Viktors and Ziggs and a lot of Zyra.
