Keep in mind this icon was the same icon as the Snowdown 2013 one for wearing a Snowdown skin. We were offering it again this year in case players didn't earn it last year. However, you earned it last year already!\n\nIf you scroll down in your icon inventory you should be able to see it as it likely isn't at the top.","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2014-12-28T19:36:37.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, I was wondering about that when I first saw it.

I was wondering where there are less Harrowing/Snowdown icons to earn this year than last years. I think there was 5 or 6 icons to earn last year. This time, it was just 2 for Harrowing, 2 new ones for this year with a returning icon. So why is there less?? I was thinking of trying to get all types this time around.","replies":[{"poster":"Hollymonster","date":"2014-12-30T19:18:52.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, that's not my department so I'm not sure!","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-01-05T18:57:32.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/HaQjbtjr-some-serious-micellaneous-questions-for-riot-please-answer-c Oh, here's a question you might be able to answer. There's 3 of them, and I think you're able to answer the 3rd one. One is about the blade icon. I won one with Earnest Elf Tristana but didn't get the icon. So I was wondering if I needed to use a 2014 Snowdown skin to get it.
