I'm not really a fan of kits that are set up like that (hello, Cassiopeia), because it makes the rest of their abilities feel incredibly lackluster. Almost all of Blitz' gameplay is tied into hitting or missing the grab, with the exception of his ult which he can use to stop champions like Malzahar or Kat. His E and W are not interesting abilities by themselves, because all you use your W for is to get better positioning for a grab or for running away, and your E is near useless except for knocking up grabbed targets. His E doesn't even get any benefits for leveling it except for a reduced cooldown. \n\nBlitzcrank also kinda has the same problem that Nidalee has. That is, you can miss like 90% of your skillshots, but it just takes one lucky hit for you to be a game changer. This applies both in lane and towards the late game, although at least during teamfights you run the risk of initiating for the enemy team by pulling the wrong person.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gin no Nekomata","date":"2015-02-11T07:48:58.846+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Debatable.

The guy's lockdown is pretty ridicoulus; if he lands a grab, he can immediately knock you up and then silence you while you get murderded.

Not every champion with a skillshot has to seriously consider hitting the wrong champion with it.\n\nWhile not the only solution, the simplest solution IS \"just dodge it\". Another great solution is, as I mentioned, walk away. You'll position Blitz and his marksman next to your minions after the chase and successful grab, which means they take damage from minions during the fight, whereas you don't. If your support is tanky, advise them to always stand in front of you while you both run back. That successful grab isn't so successful if it hits a tank and causes a 2v2 that's in your favor because only your minions respond to the aggro.\n\nConsider that if Blitz's marksman is following then he's not farming either, so should Blitz miss his grab, you haven't actually lost anything. If Blitz's marksman isn't following him, which will happen from time to time with more passively inclined marksman players, then beat the stuffing out of Blitz until his marksman comes to the party, if they even do come to the party.","replies":[{"poster":"Sirsir","date":"2015-02-11T03:32:25.877+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"All of those are much easier to dodge.
