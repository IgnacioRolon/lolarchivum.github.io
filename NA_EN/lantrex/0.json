Why? That makes zero sense to me. There has been nothing to validate that I'm the account owner yet (besides login and hitting \"submit ticket\").\r\n\r\n   It's been 3 days and I feel there hasn't been any leeway made on recovering the account. So far all that's been done is I had to create a new email address. Why can't this be handled in house through the support tickets?\r\n\r\nTicket #31372892","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-16T20:48:36.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a possibility in some cases than the unauthorized user also has access to your email, so it's a security check.
