The champ himself is great.\n\nA good Nasus will solo carry a game easily. He just needs to know how to play early game is all. How hard he is camped and how he reacts to the enemy laner.\n\nA passive Nasus isn't a great Nasus, but an aggressive Nasus isn't either since he wants those stacks. One that can trade well while also stacking well is the best kind. You would be surprised with Nasus's dueling potential pre6, I'd even go as far to say he has one of the strongest lvl6 all ins, between wither and stormraiders you have 0 chance to escape and Ult Q is like 1 second cd. He beats just about anyone if he isn't an idiot.\n\nAs someone said, he HAS to be kept under control which causes problems for the enemy. They now have to focus Nasus's lane to slow him down which means the other 2 lanes are at your whims, also ganks become predictable and you can countergank. Ignore him and the entire team will suffer when it takes 4 people to take him down and he can still take half your team with him. Even if you successfully camp Nasus, as I said before you just merely slow him down, you can't stop a Nasus from stacking. Regardless if he is 1/10 or 10/1, once late game comes around, he will be a monster. Difference merely is does he have 700 stacks or 400 stacks, he still is killing whoever he is targeting in 3 hits regardless with his 1 second ult Qs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rick Yiordan","date":"2017-11-02T05:25:01.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just got carried by a draven top in ranked so i cant say i would be suprised at anything at this point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-02T05:16:28.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it because I did not have to ban it and the enemy does not have it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nanuk Pihoqahiak","date":"2017-11-02T05:01:36.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.  Assuming they play decently, he's a threat that HAS to be dealt with, allowing the enemy to potentially make mistakes in doing so.  If you can intercept the ganks he's likely to receive, not only will he come out ahead, but now the enemy top lane has a very serious splitpush threat knocking on their door.","replies":[]}]}
