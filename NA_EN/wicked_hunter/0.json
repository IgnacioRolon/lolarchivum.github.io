These problems are important not the lack of limited skins and stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Sozan5","date":"2017-09-04T02:31:57.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are people upvoting this? It reeks of ignorance.\n\n1. Different teams are handling balance, player behaviour and skins. Just because they work in the same company doesn't mean they can do everything.\n2. Riot can do very little about players being assholes. It's like this in nearly every online game (especially visible in team-based competetive ones). \n\nI understand what you are trying to say, but it just doesn't work like this. The problems listed by you are real, but slowing down on skins etc. would not hasten solving those problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-09-03T10:43:16.350+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You do realize there are different teams in riot that do different things.\n\nWhat does the skin making team have anything to do with the balance team, and why would riot as a whole stop their skins team from doing their job when that's how the company makes money? \n\n\n\nAnd as far as the 12 year old constantly flaming you, stop being thin skinned, if you're actually getting your feelings hurt because some kid is talking random stuff out his ass then you honestly don't need to be on any multiplayer games anyways lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"hhaavviikk","date":"2017-09-03T16:31:44.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ah but there you are mistaken, this is riot, financed by tencent, they could wipe their ass with 1000 dollar bills and not notice a difference in money","replies":[]},{"poster":"wei270","date":"2017-09-03T13:11:37.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"well yes there are different teams but there is a total budget limit, resources spend on one team will mean that resources is not going in to another team.","replies":[]}]}
