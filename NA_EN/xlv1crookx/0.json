The toxicity didn't even come from me being too competitive but instead my teammate (and their premade) who were just non-stop flaming me the whole game even though i was playing just fine. \r\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to get out of posting this is for you to revise the punishment for someone who is toxic in chat. Clearly a good way to deal with someone who can't help themselves from being toxic in chat is to perma ban them from chat instead of the game itself. I had loads of fun playing league and loved matches when my whole team got along and everyone was really friendly and I'm never the one to start being extremely toxic to another player, it is only ever out of frustration that they have created in me. \r\n\r\nOn my account i had spent lots of money and many hours playing. I was currently grinding games saving up for the awesome new Prestige Riven skin but then this one game happened and it's all taken a turn for the worst in just 30 mins. All those hours of game time and money spent just gone from a single match in which I had never felt to frustrated before. \r\n\r\nTo conclude I just really hope you consider changing the punishment for a chat offence to a perma mute and/or even just removing the ability to see chat for that player instead of perma banning.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-10-08T22:02:31.364+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"The punishment system is not zero-sum. Meaning, just because one person was breaking the rules doesn't mean that the system will ignore them just because a different person was breaking the rules.\n\nFor you to receive a permanent ban for chat related behavior you would need to have received at least one punishment at minimum (and it was an escalated punishment) or typically several chat restrictions then a 14-day ban. The permanent ban isn't for this one individual case of poor behavior, but for continuing poor behavior despite being punished several times. The 14-day ban prior to the permanent ban makes it pretty clear that the next punishment could be a permanent one. Though if you haven't received a 14-day ban prior to this one then it would be worth it to contact support and see if something went wrong.\n\nThe number of hours you've played nor the amount of money you spent gives you any special consideration when it comes to whether or not your account deserves the punishment.\n\nLastly, this is the boards. The best people here can do is explain your situation and give their opinion. No one here can directly access your logs so you'll have to provide those yourself if you want people to give an opinion on those specifically.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-10-08T22:05:49.888+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your opinion of the rules is of zero relevance. When a cop stops you for going 40 in a 25 zone, you can claim \"I think the limit should be 45 here\" all you want. You're still getting a ticket. If a librarian asks you to keep your voice down while you use the facilities, shouting that libraries should be loud will simply get you escorted out. If you go to a friend's house who insists that you remove your shoes while you're in their home, \"that's a stupid rule and I do what I want\" will lose you a friend. If you are using someone else's services, facilities, equipment, etc., you abide by their rules or you deal with the consequences. If you think the rules should change, that is a completely different conversation (and I wouldn't give a plugged nickel for your chances at convincing Riot to change their rules to allow behavior like yours).\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024051193-Understanding-Different-Ban-Types-FAQs):\n\n> We work with the overall community and within our own company guidelines to identify what disruptive behavior is and what the consequences for those behaviors should be. We understand that it can be difficult to know where the line is, which is why we provide chat logs and we have a few tiers in the ban process in order to allow for you to learn and grow.\n\nRiot's punishment system used to hand out stacking chat restrictions, such that consistently toxic players basically had a permanent chat restriction. Unfortunately, it turns out that such players used their few chat opportunities to be toxic, and, when they couldn't be as toxic as they wanted to, they resorted to committing non-chat offenses such as griefing (following someone around and taking their farm, using wall abilities to interfere with their play, etc.) or inting. The purpose of the punishment system is to eliminate rule-breaking, not make it worse. Thus, if a couple chat restrictions don't make any difference in a player's misbehavior, the system ramps up the punishments until the player is permabanned and thus unable to use that account to break any more rules ever again.\n\nDid you find something in Riot's store [allowing you to break the ToS](https://i.imgur.com/AvDSnZF.png)? No, because such a service is not offered. Regardless of how much money you spend, you are required to follow the same rules as everyone else. If the IFS determines that you've been validly reported in violation of those rules, you'll be punished according to those rules. If you wanted to avoid a punishment, you should've followed the rules.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2019-10-08T21:56:52.817+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"If your team was flaming you, why not just mute them instead of being toxic at them?\nIf you can't help yourself from being toxic in cases like those, but you aren't going to mute them either, just disable the whole chat\nOn your 14 day ban reform card it CLEARLY says that the next offense would lead to a permanent ban\nIf you constantly break the rules, of course riot doesn't want you to play their game anymore, so you get perma banned\nSure they could perma mute you, but them some people would start trolling games etc which is worse and harder to detect.

You can't tell a person whom already left the game, \"Come back and verbally abuse me instead of leaving the team to a 4v5.\" and expect it to happen.\n\nHow punishable something is dependent on how malicious the action was and how provable is the maliciousness. Not just how unenjoyable it was for the other players in the game.\n\nFor example, both feeding and intentionally feeding can ruin your game. But only intentionally feeding is punishable and it's only caught when the intent is beyond reasonable doubt so as to avoid falsely punishing someone.","replies":[{"poster":"I Like Teemo","date":"2019-10-09T00:03:32.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"this is an opinion post, im sharing my opinion.. no need to fact check an opinion","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-10-08T22:39:55.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know theres a lot of deep psychology that varies from person to person, but I think Riots reasoning is kind of like the same people who are toxic in chat enough to get PERMABANNED, are the same type of people who will resort to gameplay behaviors to spite others, instead of just chat. So they remove them from the community. I think they have some data if I remember correctly, to support that idea. Not that I've seen the data, but I think I saw at one point they said statistically the people who were permanently muted essentially (back when chat restricts stacked up to thousands of games), also would resort to trolling to spite people. So they stopped doing that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gargle Manjuice","date":"2019-10-08T22:30:33.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-10-08T22:40:58.493+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gargle Manjuice,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Fp0WlX0g,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-10-08T22:30:33.876+0000)\n>\n> Basically, Riot is Communist China.
