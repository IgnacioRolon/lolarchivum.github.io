Bug splat, the game has to repair and take 10 minutes, obviously my team /remake the game. But for me it's counter as a lost in my  promo, I've lost tons of LP because of that and I've also failed my promos.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to have this fixed so I regain the LP I've lost?\r\nAs much as I'd love to take the blame for a defeat, there's just nothing I could do to prevent a random bug splat, especially since I had played like 10 games prior to that bug splat.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, does someone know if Riot has ever done anything to fix such events or they just tell us ''Sorry we can't do anything'' a.k.a. ''Go fuck yourself''.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-08T23:06:08.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really frustrating and i've been there before for sure! I can't return your LP, but I can help to make sure you don't lose anymore. Bugsplats are usually a sign something isn't updating correctly to keep the game running smoothly. Thankfully our [Crash Guide ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974)has a list of steps for you to run through to make sure everything is up to date so that you don't have any more issues or LP loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Jester of Quebec","date":"2017-08-09T18:55:58.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After cooling off, I realize I was rude to you and I apologize, in no way are you at fault for not being able to help as you are only the social media specialist.
