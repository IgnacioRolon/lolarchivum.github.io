Including offending the remaining players for noobishly losing, not giving any challenge and being so stupid that their only communication is &quot;UHH AHHH UHHH AHHH&quot;. \n\nI know that this is rather the exception, but the fact that it happens, and that the player I talked about above has 250 masterys shows me, that the success in getting rid of these jerks is insufficient. So, these jerks apperently do some harm to the motivation to play the game of plenty of other players. \n\nTherefore these jerks impose a drawback on the fun everyone else experiences playing the game. It would be sign for Riot to acknowledge this deficit and offer players who need to deal with jearks small compensations. Like 50 IP, 1 Extra Chest or Key Fragment.\n\nThe implementation could be as easy as the punishment system. Everytime a player is convicted in the punishment system the reporter(s) gets benefit on top. This would simultanously also compensate players for wasting their time with matches rigged from the start due to team-mates being AFK.\n\nIt would be an easy way to give some motivation back to players who just experienced an injustice and therefore lost some motivation for the game. Along the line: Not just penalizing the offender but also compensating the victim of the injustice. The actual amount of the compensation is up for discussion but in my view some compensation is justified.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2017-02-08T16:13:36.408+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So would this also go towards the other people that have reported the person, or just the last one? A system like this could work, but can backfire when people abuse it. This is like the case of the old Tribunal. People abused it because if majority of the votes got that person punished or pardon people would get IP. This caused people to just spam punish and left it easily abused!\n\nLike another person said would there be consequences for abusing the system? Like false reports, or if someone does get punished but appeals their punishment and gets unban, would the person who got a reward for that get said reward taken away because that person was unban?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-02-08T15:04:17.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chests and keys are out of the question for such system.\n\nSo.. a small amount of IP upon a valid report that eventually punished someone?\n\nIf you falsely report, would you loose IP instead then?\n\nThis would be OK if they had a report card system.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-08T15:29:50.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Such a system would cause people to not report in fear of losing their IP if others do not think like them. If it did not take anything away from you then everyone would just report everyone on the off chance that one of them might be punished and they get a reward.","replies":[]}]}]}
