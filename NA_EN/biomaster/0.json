I&#039;m happy to see it and I think it&#039;s great for a 750 skin. I have a few questions regarding the skin however\r\n1. Is that what Shaco&#039;s face it like with out the mask or is this strictly a reimagining of our jester?\r\n2. I noticed that although the shiv is red when he uses 2 shiv poison it is still white, I know you had a similar thing with nautilus&#039; anchor, but surely a single colour change from white to red wouldn&#039;t be enough to warrant the skin be upped to 975 right?\r\n3.  Is his hair inspired from that villain from 101 dalmations? Cause that&#039;s what it reminds me of\r\nAnyways thankyou again for the great Shaco skin, with this soul reaper vlad and marauder ww you made a new skin for all my mains\r\nTY","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-30T18:30:05.359+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya! \n\n> 2.

You're absolutely right, this wouldn't warrant the skin being bumped up to 975 RP. It's a quality of life change, similar to Naut's anchor, as you've mentioned. :]","replies":[{"poster":"biomaster","date":"2015-04-30T20:36:01.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad to know, No comment for the other questions eh?\n","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-30T22:53:00.204+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry, not ignoring you on these, was just asking the artists to get the proper information! \n\nHis face is painted in this particular skin, as opposed to a mask, and his hair wasn't inspired by Cruelle Deville. ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"biomaster","date":"2015-04-30T23:02:19.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty very much katey you work hard and have already integrated yourself deeply within the community despite being relatively new.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Eyrgos","date":"2015-05-01T00:46:31.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=A3YLbdJE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-04-30T18:30:05.359+0000)\n>\n> Heya! \n> \n> It's a model change that just hasn't been completed yet.
