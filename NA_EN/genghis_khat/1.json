It took me ~8 months to learn him to the point where I had ~60% win rate in mid plat (his overall win rate was ~47% at the time). Zed does have some obtuse weaknesses that I’m sure get exploited more in high elo, but everyone can’t be Riven and have little to no counter play when mastered (I joke riven mains... kind of). He can easily take over games and I think that he is in a perfectly viable position as an objective stance on the character. He definitely doesn’t need any damage buffs, if he were to get something for high elo play I would recommend slightly more energy refund or allowing r to place Zed within a 100-150 unit circle instead of directly behind the opposing champion.","replies":[{"poster":"IP Masquerena","date":"2018-12-27T14:25:35.164+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":6,"body":"I wouldn't mind that ult buff or energy refund, but then he will have to lose the effect of his passive working on creeps.\n\nI know it helps him farm, but 30 extra damage to creeps level 1 is too much \"help\" when Riot needed a lot of \"decision time\" to add 5 damage to Doran's Ring","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-12-27T17:07:33.863+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":4,"body":"The problem with Zed mains that people think he is weak is simple.

Darius isn't nearly as tanky as other juggernauts such as Garen, Sion, or Urgot are and does good only in long trades where he can get those stacks in or once he already has Noxian might unlocked (Darius is ONLY an immediate threat when he has Noxian might unlocked). He does terrible against characters he can't hit (such as Yi and of course Zed who is so braindead you can press R and take out most squishes with the next hit which follows).\n\nI see you're a Zed player from the single Zed match on your account and the forums are filled with one tricks trying to defend their mains. It isn't even uncommon to see a Zed run by with Dusk blade + Ghost blade + Edge of might + Mortal Reminder rush in and start ripping apart tanks like armor meant nothing. If you think having 500 AP was strong you should see the other Zed players who rush in with all that armor pen with 500+ AD late game only to be untargetable due to how safe his abilities make him out to be.\n\nI've seldom struggled against Zed in the laning phase (I play Katarina mid lane and it's a skill matchup) but it's after the laning phase where he gets really annoying and starts to two shot people from the safety of his shadow.

This number is then penetrated by LDR so 172.52 times 0.65 = 112.138. Assuming Zed is level 18, 21 Lethality from Dusk + 18 Lethality from Youmuu's + 7 from Sudden Impact = 66.138 effective armor. That's about a 40% damage reduction, give or take a small percent. The funny thing is you're so fucking _wrong_ small percents like that don't even matter.\n\nZed's bonus AD with the build above is 409.8 - 120.8 = 289. \n\nZed landing 3 shurikens: 220 base damage + 270% bonus AD = 1443.3 Damage\n\nZed landing a shadow slash = 170 base damage + 80% bonus AD = 401.2\n\nZed landing an autoattack for duskblade proc = 100% total AD = 409.8 + 150 true damage\n\n(1143.3 + 401.2 + 409.8 + 150) * 1.55 for Zed's Death Mark + another 409.8 bonus AD from the ult pop. Times all that by 0.6 for Darius armor and bone plating, and Zed's full, 3 shuriken combo has done 2052.879 damage, add about 50 because I can't be arsed to calculate the true damage separately. \n\nNot only have you failed to one-combo Darius, you've failed to even get him below 50% health for Zed's passive to do anything. Electrocute, Zed's passive, and whatever AD you've scrounged up from Zed's ultimate would have to do 2154 damage through armor on their own just to get through the rest of Darius's health.

That means would have to kill someone with _600_ AD with his ultimate to make it to 500 AD.\n> \n> Aside from the obvious idiocy of stating flat armor pen trumping someone who builds tanky armor items, let's do the math here.\n> \n> https://champion.gg/champion/Darius/Top?\n> \n> Darius Base Health = 2282.2 + Sterak's 450 + DMP 425 + Spirit Visage 450 + Randuins 400 = 4207 Health total. Throw in Sterak's bonus health shield and you have a 1443 damage shield on top of that. And then bone plating for a flat 150 damage reduction _on top of that_\n> \n> Darius Base Armor = 102 + DMP 60 + Randuin's 60 + Shard 5 for 227 total armor.\n> \n> I'll be nice to you and assume that Zed magically applied maximum Black Cleaver Stacks before he even started his combo.\n> \n> 227 times 0.76 Black Cleaver Armor Shred: 172.52 Armor. This number is then penetrated by LDR so 172.52 times 0.65 = 112.138. Assuming Zed is level 18, 21 Lethality from Dusk + 18 Lethality from Youmuu's + 7 from Sudden Impact = 66.138 effective armor. That's about a 40% damage reduction, give or take a small percent. The funny thing is you're so fucking _wrong_ small percents like that don't even matter.\n> \n> Zed's bonus AD with the build above is 409.8 - 120.8 = 289. \n> \n> Zed landing 3 shurikens: 220 base damage + 270% bonus AD = 1443.3 Damage\n> \n> Zed landing a shadow slash = 170 base damage + 80% bonus AD = 401.2\n> \n> Zed landing an autoattack for duskblade proc = 100% total AD = 409.8 + 150 true damage\n> \n> (1143.3 + 401.2 + 409.8 + 150) * 1.55 for Zed's Death Mark + another 409.8 bonus AD from the ult pop. Times all that by 0.6 for Darius armor and bone plating, and Zed's full, 3 shuriken combo has done 2052.879 damage, add about 50 because I can't be arsed to calculate the true damage separately. \n> \n> Not only have you failed to one-combo Darius, you've failed to even get him below 50% health for Zed's passive to do anything. Electrocute, Zed's passive, and whatever AD you've scrounged up from Zed's ultimate would have to do 2154 damage through armor on their own just to get through the rest of Darius's health. On top of that, they'd have to get through another 1443 damage to get through Sterak's shield, again through armor. Unless you plan to try and engage a Darius in an auto attack duel and count that as \"part of a combo\".\n> \n> TL;DR You're wrong. Entertainingly, astonishingly wrong. Anyone who can do grade-school level of math can see how wrong you are. Anyone who'd played this game for more than 6 minutes can see how wrong you are. And yet your comment, stating that a Zed can _ONE COMBO A LATE GAME DARIUS_, has several upvotes. I hope to God Riot never, ever takes these boards seriously.\n\nYou're either terrible at math, using Google, or both.\n\nZed can, and definitely hits that level of AD.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6QnNjq53Sjc\nhttps://youtu.be/2UA1T2PGekY ion","replies":[{"poster":"AceBlack","date":"2018-12-28T20:37:08.684+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Blackfin97","date":"2018-12-28T21:07:26.207+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AceBlack,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NKJYbOEH,comment-id=001500000000000200010000,timestamp=2018-12-28T20:37:08.684+0000)\n>\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6QnNjq53Sjc\n\nFebruary, 2018.\n\nDid you check the dates or did you just start writing a novel out of sheer will?\n\nHere's another one within the last year where his steroid works just fine i taking his ad ery close to 500.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHywj-mYios","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"l love Ahri","date":"2018-12-27T22:53:30.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Blackfin97,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NKJYbOEH,comment-id=001500000000,timestamp=2018-12-27T21:57:13.430+0000)\n>\n> Do you play Darius or are you only a low elo Zed player?\n\nYes, I do. Darius is my pick when I go top lane.\n\n Low elo? Either your account is a smurf or you're just being ridiculous because I checked your OP.GG and you're also technically low elo\n> \n> No, with full lethality he stands a very good chance at beating these tanks 1v1. \n\nNo he cant. I say this because I am a Zed main. I play Zed a lot and it frustrates me whenever I tried to kill a Garen with my ult and landed all my shurikens and he took no fucking damage. \n\nI play Zed top ~~sometimes~~ rarely. Garen is so easy to abuse until he hits somewhere around level 6-7 and until he gets {{item:3071}} {{item:3047}}. He suddenly becomes invincible\n\nTahm Kench with armor is also bad, and he gets a free shield? Bummer.\n\nMaokai? Constant healing that even its still annoying after I get mortal reminder because he's so tanky and CCs you all day long\n\nI dont encounter tanks that much. Tanks are dead. Not because of Zed but because of Conqueror and true damage (something which Zed doesnt take and doesnt have)\n\n> Darius isn&#x27;t nearly as tanky as other juggernauts such as Garen, Sion, or Urgot and does good only in long trades or once he has Noxian might unlocked. He does terrible against characters he can&#x27;t hit (such as Yi and of course Zed who is so braindead you can press R and take out most squishes with the next hit which follows).\n\n I tried to kill Darius with {{item:3147}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3036}}  once. He had Deadman's plate and a tabi and he barely took damage. Only lost like 40% HP. Guess what happened after? He grabbed me with his E and proceeded to lube me up. Oh and he got his HP back from Q.\n\nAs I tried to escape, I was bleeding. I just realized he W'd me. Oh god! What's he gonna do? AHHHH!!! He's AAing me! HIS PASSIVE!!! It hurts! Oh god... His Q... Its up again... Good thing I have my W for escape! But wait... Why is he so fast??? Oh right... He has Ghost.\n\nDUNK!\n\n\"You have been slain\"\n\n> Zed who is so braindead you can press R and take out most squishes with the next hit which follows).\n\nOnly when low health. To take out a full health ADC, I have to land at least an E and 2 Q. Or E > AA > Q. I can only take out with a single E only when I am very fed.\n\nTaking out ADC also doesnt always go successful. Sometimes they get good support and distrupt my kill session. Some ADC like Ezreal also have a blink and Lucian who can dash which makes it harder to land my abilities.\n\n> \n> I see you&#x27;re a Zed player from the single Zed match on your account \n\nThis is not my main account. I am from another region and this is just my boards account. I havent been playing Zed recently. Too busy with Nexus Blitz.\n\n> and the forums are filled with one tricks trying to defend their mains.\n\nYes, anyone would try to defend their mains from bullshittery. I checked your account and you play quite a lot of Darius. Are you a Darius main? Why are you trying to defend Darius?\n\n\n\n > It isn&#x27;t even uncommon to see a Zed run by with Dusk blade + Ghost blade + Edge of might + Mortal Reminder rush in and start ripping apart tanks like armor meant nothing.\n\nEdge of night is a situational item same with Mortal reminder. Even with {{item:3147}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3814}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3033}} {{item:3071}}, you cant kill a full armor build. I say this from my experience, being dumb and trying to solo a tank myself. \n\nAlso, it depends what tank. A tank like Maokai, I'll be dead since he has so much CC and his allies will arrive and kill me\n\n> If you think having 500 AP was strong you should see the other Zed players who rush in with all that armor pen with 500+ AD late game only to be untargetable due to how safe his abilities make him out to be.\n\n...Uh... AP is superior though. I'd be glad if Zed was AP ANYTIME! Make him a mana champion too because that would be a fucking huge buff. His energy is just there as a handcuffs to restraint him. Energy only helps laning at early game..\n\nI play Vlad with {{item:3916}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3907}} {{item:3152}} and he's superior than Zed. He can 1v5 easily. Makes me wonder why I still main Zed instead of Vlad. Oh right, because its satisfying to kill a single target as Zed than 1v5 as Vlad.\n\nUntargetable? only for like 1 second and he literally appears BEHIND YOU. Some Zed put W down before ulting to switch places, and its so predictable. His ult also actually has a cooldown and cant be used constantly in a fight unlike Master Yi\n\n> \n> I&#x27;ve seldom struggled against Zed in the laning phase (I play Katarina mid lane and it&#x27;s a skill matchup) but it&#x27;s after the laning phase where he gets really annoying\n\nLiterally every champion. We all love terrorizing bot lane, brother.\n\n> and starts to two shot people from the safety of his shadow. \n\nYeah, Zed is safe and that's what's good about him. If he wasnt so safe, I wonder how bad he would be. \n\n I remember roaming bot as Ahri and landed a charm on ADC and he died before I knew it. ADCs are so bad. Maybe because I'm a midlaner so I see them as inferior creatures.","replies":[{"poster":"Blackfin97","date":"2018-12-28T01:13:32.034+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=l love Ahri,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NKJYbOEH,comment-id=0015000000000000,timestamp=2018-12-27T22:53:30.716+0000)\n>\n> Yes, I do.

Check the URL I posted in the last one, Zed clearly wins lane against Darius most of the time.\n\nI'd like to see statistics if you disagree.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BLIGHTBRINGER","date":"2018-12-27T19:39:22.833+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/6/62/Skarner_Render.png/revision/latest?cb=20181110204111\n\n**_\"The Crystal Scar is weeping.\"_** {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"THE RlVER KlNG","date":"2018-12-27T15:56:55.835+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"tahm kench is dead","replies":[]},{"poster":"14daysuspensionk","date":"2018-12-27T18:08:47.826+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"I get downvoted for complaining about Zed lul.","replies":[]}]}
