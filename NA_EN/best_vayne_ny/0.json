Your network might be having an with the authentication server, but simplying restarting the client should fix that.  [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) prioritizes games played more than elapsed time.  So if you are are away while having a poor standing with Leaverbuster, then it's possible to get another if you return a few months later as an example.  Let me know if that clears things up, if you run into any issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Vayne NY","date":"2017-05-22T21:03:22.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol that's bs... there's nothing wrong with my internet and 3 other people had the same problem they all have network connection problems??
