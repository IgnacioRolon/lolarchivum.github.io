Normally a [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) would lose 3 LP but your account has been rapidly dodging (6 in a day) which has escalated your timer and LP loss.  You may want to take a break from dodging friend, that's quite a bit!","replies":[{"poster":"MrAkcel","date":"2017-12-17T14:57:14.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks you, and i have a other question, do dodging make my MMR lower ?","replies":[]}]}]}
