No.\nFeel like {{champion:131}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:38}}  and {{item:3157}} just don&#039;t belong in it.\nAnd maybe a few champs that aren&#039;t normally assassin type could have been ok.\n({{champion:54}} maybe? Pure AP malp is basically an assassin anyway, and without being able to buy armor/hp, I don&#039;t think he would have gotten too tanky to ruin it, could be wrong though.)\nAlso feel like maybe some of the Black Market items couldn&#039;t hurt, or throw in some modified/new items specific for the mode.\n\nBut it&#039;s the most silly fun I&#039;ve had with a game mode in a while. There&#039;s still ragers, and 4v5&#039;s REALLY feel bad. But those end in 10mins anyway.\n\nMy 1st 3 games were kind of stressful, cause I was trying to play too &#039;normal,&#039; and spent too much time looking at the score worrying about being ahead or behind. But after I got over that and just started running around stabbing stuff, it&#039;s been loads of fun. Rarely even know who&#039;s winning till it ends. And feel like that&#039;s how FGM&#039;s should be. Just silly fun for 10-15mins and not worry about winning or losing.\nSure I&#039;m still trying my best, don&#039;t want to let my team down, but this mode basically removed all thought of &#039;must win&#039; from it. Also somehow feels less &#039;stale,&#039; maybe because it&#039;s new, or maybe because you can&#039;t just pick OP champs or worry about banning OP champs, cause they all feel a little OP? Lack of bans feels kind of good too. Bans always seem to bog down FGM&#039;s anyway. Adds a serious element and starts some people off on a bad foot.\n&quot;WHY DIDN&#039;T YOU BAN XX? u SUK! GG we loss&quot; - SomeTryHard\n-right from the start of 70% of other FGM.\n\nSo yeh, thank you Riot. This amuses me. ^_^\n\nEveryone else having fun?\nAnything you&#039;d change/add/remove from it?\n\n\nEdit: Also, yes, I know, \"Diana **NOT** in Blood **MOON** FGM? U R DUM?!\"\nI know thematically this is basically *her game mode*. But really, best play pattern for her is kinda frontline TANK, and she can still get tankier than anyone should be able to here.

Just hyper 5:30am rambling on my day off. Feel free to just ignore:\n;)\n\nYeh, I did think about yas/malp ulti combo. That might be strong enough to guarantee there's always a malp/yas on both teams, which would suck. Maybe they did internal testing of that and found that to be the case.\nWu wouldn't fit purely cause of his passive. There's so many full 5v5's going on, he's nearly always going to get full use out of it, therefor be tankier than the gamemode should allow.\nGotta be some 'tanks' in there that would be acceptable in the game mode with alternative build path though. {{champion:32}} {{champion:89}}? Sure they're tanky AF in normal games, but I've seen some AP mid leona's rockin the assassin style, and without {{item:3110}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3068}} etc...how tanky could she get? Maybe I'm just misjudging how much their tankyness comes from items and how much comes from their own steroids. Never actually played against a Leona that **didn't** get at least 2 huge tank items by endgame. Even YOLO mode, 'pure ap' leona mids still eventually gets some major tank items by endgame. So I guess I don't really know exactly how tanky she'd be without that.\nOr maybe the amount of hard CC they bring is enough to warp the game away from pure slaughterfest, therefor- less 'fun.'\n\nGotta be SOME champs out there that aren't normally assassins that would be 'ok' in the mode purely because of forced non-tank build path though? Right?\nOr maybe some of the short ranged/less 'safe' adcs? {{champion:133}} {{champion:429}} (or....dare I say it....{{champion:67}}...she's probably broken purely for being the anti-assassin assassin though.)\nOr like..{{champion:240}} {{champion:56}}{{champion:2}}? Nothing says 'go ham' like those guys without a single defensive item. :p\n\nOh well, maybe this leaves hope for next loop around for the mode. New champs/items to keep it from getting stale. Would LOVE to see some BlackMarket items in **any** FMG. Especially Mirage Blade (one that gave you a 350 range flash *away* from the last target you AA'd). That thing was **so** fun.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-02-12T17:57:44.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well what i think their main criteria for champ select was how fast the champ could burst and what outplay potential they had.  can the champ burst down a squishy? check.  can the champ outplay all the others? check.  is said champ a squishy? check.  can all the other champs outplay said champ? check.  from the feel of the mode they were going with their safest choices for apl those questions.  maby next weekend or next rotation they will add in more.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Proxy345","date":"2017-02-12T10:22:38.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol it was made for CoD players.","replies":[]}]}
