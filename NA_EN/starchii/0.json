Look at my icon. I didn't pay a single dollar for it. The 3 chests that you can buy (Edit : WITH IP), you get 3 components from - PROJECT : Ekko/Ashe/Katarina First Strike Icon Blueprint. When you craft that icon, and if/when you buy the PROJECT skins, you will get a border. Please read the FAQ next time before complaining.

The cores you receive from the chests are random.  After opening all I only have 5 cores, not 7.
