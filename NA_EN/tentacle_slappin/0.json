It's an error that simply won't let you open up even the launcher, making it impossible to play League. I have just now run into this problem, and have tried all the options provided. I have tried the permissions page, I have tried the Hextech Repair Tool, and I have also checked the computer for corrupt files and what not. The error message is titled \"LeagueClient.exe - Bad Image\" and the message reads, \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\libnghttp2.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support\". I have also noticed that most people getting this error have also tried out all their options from the permissions page and the Hextech Repair Tool. So, if any Riot peeps now know what the deal is...it would be wonderful to know as plenty of people have been getting this message in the past month and I have just gotten it recently.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \r\n-LambSauceLost","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-13T15:33:19.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely make sure your OS is up to date so it has necessary products to proceed with the install.
