That's rough on people that enjoy solo Morde, we did feel this was the right approach to take though to get Morde into a spot where he could be made effective without having to massively change him overall.

This may prevent Mordekaiser from using W in solo-lanes or to farm jungle camps. \n\nIn addition, E lost 35/50/65/80/95 damage without any reduction to it's health cost  in exchange for a 0.6 AD ratio.  Since it provides a percentage of shield per target hit independent of the damage dealt, this will likely be left at rank one and used solely to generate shield.\n\nAlso, his Q lost the AoE damage.  It will deal significantly more damage if you can land three successive autoattacks against enemy champions, but it won't be that useful for harass and will often require your opponent be locked in place to use.","replies":[{"poster":"ArcticSirius","date":"2015-08-05T00:51:47.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So we Morde players have been asking for a more improved version, and while we did, we also got sent to a lane we don't play?

Level Q starts at a 2x multiplier. If he still has his base damage thats 80+160+320 = 560 damage at level 1 before you factor in masteries, runes, and his AA reset with his +5 AD per level. That's like level 1 morde startinng the jungle at Q Rank 5 with items. I only picked W as a starting ability when I jungle Morde because it had the most overall damage done  per hp ratio compared to spamming Qs and killing myself faster. This change could mean Morde's clear speed is far faster than it already was and jungle timers already have a hard time keeping up past level 3.\n\nSolo lane is also probably being blown out of proportion. W was never the reason solo lane was won or lost. No one competent would have stayed in W range long enough to make it worthwhile outside of a handful of fighters like Darius and Trundle who have to be in your face. Flinging W on minions to harass is also gimmicky and only works vs poor laners. It was always properly aimed Es ( best at an angle so you don't hit the entire lane) that got you within the kill zone.\n\nMorde synergizes with a lot of tank and fighter that could open up entirely new comps bottom lane. His W alone is like activating Ghost every 20 seconds. That a lot of initiation power before boots and more after.","replies":[{"poster":"ArcticSirius","date":"2015-08-05T02:27:16.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never said he's not usable. Just said he's been basically banished to the bot lane.\n\nYou're forgetting that W provided a small boost to armour and MR. However, while the change is somewhat good for his W, it's not what we wanted. The damage can only be done when an ally champion is in range. The heal can only be done when an ally champion is in range. The MS can only be done while an ally champion is in range.\n\nAll the while his base MS has been gutted to 325 from 340, a pretty good nod to the fact they want him mostly in bot lane as he'll need to rely on ally champions for bonus MS. This leaves solo Morde in worse shape in the solo lane for ganks unless his jungler comes to counter-gank before he himself is shredded.\n\nThe E's base damage has been reduced to 70/115/160/205/250 >>> 35/65/95/125/155 and while it does have a 60% total AD scaling. An AD Morde down on bot compared to an AP Morde elsewhere will have a better early game advantage in scoring creep.\n\nThe R, while cool, has been nerfed slightly in the initial damage (from level 6 it is 10% inital and 10% over 10s comapred to the 12% and 12% we've had before). As well as this only enforces \"bot lane\" Morde more. What about top Morde? Gone. He's too far from dragon to make the impact that teams will want.","replies":[{"poster":"ExiledTyrant","date":"2015-08-05T02:51:15.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The armor is like 4% extra damage reduction at level 1 and wasn't leveled up till last after the fact. It will mean little if his Q produces DPS high enough to more than double his kill speed in the jungle. The whole reason for W has changed. It has real potential now to enable champions without initiation to initiate and  allows initiators to initiate even better. W never won a lane or a duel. The damage Morde is gaining is going to far outshine whatever a potential 6 ticks of W ever did. \n\nSolo morde also relied heavily on jungle ganks to kill competent laners so I don't see how this is such a big adjustment.\n\nI've also read E is 71 damage apparently because of how the total AD adds up with his base so no change there. You also have to weigh in that his base damage at 18 will be around  148 without items. This is combined with the fact that he has one of the best if not the best combination of base attack speed and scaling in the game. What we got in return was much higher Q damage and an E that outright tramples the old E late game for the loss of W. \n\n\nThe loss of damage from R is regrettable but the added functionality of summoning dragon looks to more than make up for it. It even has the added side effect of solving the age old question: \"What happens when the enemy stops me from getting a ghost?\" I'm sure we are all to familiar with the banes of Morde existence such as: {{champion:26}} {{champion:266}} {{item:3026}} {{item:2003}} {{item:3140}} \n\nBasically any revive or cleansing mechanic. Dragon won't do any of that and is sure to always be useful unlike a support ghost.","replies":[{"poster":"ArcticSirius","date":"2015-08-05T03:27:57.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not the damage on W I'm upset about, it's that it's champion only. No heal, no damage, nothing useful for solo Morde unless a jungler comes by to gank. And considering how hard Mordekaiser pushes, that leaves little to few chances if left solo.\n\nWhile the nerf to the E can help stop an early game AP Morde from pushing so hard, he'll still be a hard pusher.\n\nThe Q is a nice change to a solo duelist without the aid of minions, and with the AS buff he'll be able to pump out that nice shield change. Tthough part of me wishes the shield was an AP scaling than an HP, but it does help balance it out.\n\nAnd I've seen comments on the PBE about not being able to cast the R with dragon out. Have a dragon? Can't nuke ult a target for some damage and free healing. The dragon's AS and damage to me isn't worth being out an ultimate. I'd be perfectly fine having the ability to only have one ghost at a time where the older one takes prioty so that you can't just chain ghosts but still able to cast it for the damage and healing.\n\nAgain, the W change that upsets me is that it's champion only. It can't do that damage or the healing for a solo Morde unless a jungler comes by which we know won't be that often considering how hard he pushes.","replies":[{"poster":"ExiledTyrant","date":"2015-08-05T03:37:40.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How many time did you actually get someone to stand in the W for full duration for it to ever really matter during laning though?

Most times W could be used to troll a Fizz or  a Darius and did absolutely nothing vs a Leblanc or an Orianna etc. Even melee lane opponents were more worried about E than taking 1 or 2 ticks from W while CSing.\n\nI can understand it feeling like Mord lost something when only 3 out of his 4 abilities work without a team mate but I have a feeling the actual scaling and damage multiplier will more than make up for it. In the next few days hopefully we'll both have more insight into the overall impact of the changes.\n\nMe personally I am very interested in Morde's item interactions and if AS Morde will out DPS CDR Morde. His durability with his new shield and healing due to increased damage output are also concerning. Gunblade doesn't have the pure spell vamp that WOTA does and Life steal may or may not be more valuable now.

The new one would be much better if able to cast on minion, then recast back for a quick heal. That's what I'm trying to get at. The prospect of not allowing this onto minions kinda forces him to play with an ally on the bot lane.\n\nNo ally, no heal. That's what I'm trying to get at. Even if it is just a small heal, it'd be better than nothing. And damage is damage, all is welcome. Ever bit helps, ever heal of that? To push them closer to needing that health pot, or to back, or even a kill, it's all welcome. Or even just self cast would be nice so as long as I can obtain the heal or even some damage.\n\nI'm interested too, but I've already seen the feedback page for him on the PBE. Most if not all that have played him feel like this is a bad change. That will only worsen should it make it to live. The Morde I have played for the past 3 years is a solo laner, not a duo. You will have to build a team even more niche around him than ever before.\n\nA great reply to CertainlyT on the official feedback:\n\n> I'm going to echo the sentiment that this is total garbage. I will be refunding my Mordekaiser skin--the new King of Clubs skin that I really enjoyed--if this goes live.\n> \n> You're absolutely right that Mordekaiser could not be a marquee example of a healthy solo lane champion in his current live state. I imagine that's why you were tasked with working on him. Instead of actually working to fix the issues, however, you decided to 180 the champ.\n> \n> You want to know how you compromise Mordekaiser? By making him dependent on other champions! This is THE absolute WORST and I mean WORST abandonment of champion identity I have ever seen, and I've been supporting Riot since before Season 1. You took the metal-clad shade that rips people's souls out and decided he would be healthier if he worked with a buddy.\n> \n> What were you thinking? I don't think anyone can argue that Morde didn't need a lot of work, but honestly, even knowing you were the one responsible I'd never have even conceived of this kind of change.\n> \n> If you want to experiment with variations on the way the game can be played, that's a stellar undertaking and one I wholeheartedly endorse. Having different kinds of team compositions and lane setups is fresh, innovative, and a direction I'm totally willing to explore.\n> \n> You should design some new champs with that in mind. What you should not do is take champions that have established identities and roles and force them into your experimental mold---a mold, might I add, that based on your admitted track record with champs like Yasuo, does not sell. The champs that end up being embraced in multiple positions are universally the ones that the community determines can go there--not the ones you assign. Tahm Kench despite being an awesome character design is a mechanical train wreck with no successful role, and Yasuo is a hard and fast solo assassin. No exceptions. He's more successful in a duo lane bot? How often is he in a duo lane bot among all games played?\n> \n> I'm willing to be wrong on that point. After all, if you're designing a champ you can jolly well force it into whatever role you want. Just give it abilities that are absolutely useless without another champ present. But when you shoehorn champs like that you're doing work that's better left undone. You're enforcing a meta contrary to the company's oft-stated intentions, and more importantly, in this instance, you're annihilating the trust of players who have put their faith in the company's willingness to preserve player sentiment towards its assets.\n> \n> Forcing Morde to be played in a duo lane (or else lose 1/5 of his kit) means that I will no longer get to play Morde in a competitive environment--even if I wanted to--because when I play with my friends I play solo top. That's absolutely the first and only time that's ever happened to me. Even with the support reworks and the changes to Lulu that made her much harder to function top (I didn't play her then anyway, so it's a moot point for me personally, but a valid one nonetheless), it was still possible to take her top without making her abilities non-functional--unlike champs like Kalista, who are designed and released from the outset to have ally dependencies in their kits.\n> \n> This is a long post, but this is my feedback. It is 100% unacceptable to use established champions as a way to experiment with the meta. What kind of response would you expect if someday one of your co-workers announced that because of his reliance on abilities Lucian was to be given good AP ratios, have his auto-attack functionality slashed, and expected to be played as a mage mid? --and let's face it, Lucian's a tough champ to balance; maybe that's what he needs to be healthy. or maybe someone realizes Anivia has good auto-attack range, so her damage should be cut down, her attack speed should be buffed, and she can be a marksman? Do either of those sound absurd to you? Well that's exactly what you've done to Mordekaiser. You've taken a champion and bolted mechanics on him to force him into a new role that is thematically antithetical to him and offensive to his fans.\n> \n> Even conceding that his solo lane potential might still exist in a heavily nerfed form, you've by design made it suboptimal. If you decided that you couldn't handle the backlash from making the necessary changes to make Mordekaiser viable to the players who already play him, you should have offered to give the project to someone who could stomach doing what needed to be done instead of taking him from us and giving him to a completely different set of players.\n> \n> Thanks for your time.\n\nI agree with all points here.

That's rough on people that enjoy solo Morde, we did feel this was the right approach to take though to get Morde into a spot where he could be made effective without having to massively change him overall. We believe Morde's strengths and weaknesses can be preserved, or even amplified, in a way that's a lot more functional/healthy when he's got an ally to fill in some of his gaps.\n\n\"People that enjoy solo Morde\" being literally everyone that enjoyed Morde. Live Morde is played exclusively Top or (rarely) Mid. I'm sure there are plenty of people who have picked him botlane as a troll pick, but I would be very surprised to find out even one person mained him as a support, let alone as a botlane carry.\n\nSo you said to your collective selves \"Hmmm, should we preserve the FEEL of Morde while keeping him in the hands of the people who love him, or change him very minorly but just enough so that all the people who currently play him have to either change role and position, or never play the champ again?\". And then you went with the second fucking option! I mean what the actual hell Riot? No, I take that back.

Why should such a monster and lord be so reliant on his allies to be able to function that he can't even use his W unless they are nearby?  I always viewed him as fiercely independent, a champion capable of trading blows with the strongest of fighters and shaking off their damage as he wears them down.  \n\nMetal is far stronger than flesh.  Most resilient to damage, capable of tearing about and crushing the body without incurring significant damage.  Rather than a burst mage or a DPS carry, it seems like he would be more suited as a brawler who wears down his enemies over time while shrugging off damage.\n\nPreviously, he could excel in this area.  Spellvamp, his shield, and his ultimate would prevent damage and restore health during combat while his Creeping Death and Children of the Grave would wear down his enemies health.  This approach seemed to suit him quite well thematically: while he was immobile and lacked CC, he would wear your down and killing you while shrugging off any attempts are retaliation if you couldn't escape; a looming scepter of ruin unflinchingly following you.\n----------------------------------  \nWhile the ability to control Dragon after killing it seems novel, it seems like an unreliable source of power (if your team is losing you are weaker, if your team is winning you win harder) and gimmicky.   However, the changes made to force him into a duo-lane seem rather forced; it limits his ability to farm jungle camps or fight when away from his allies, hindering his farming and dueling potential for conditional bonuses.  \n\nIt also seems that you are attempting to force him to become a hybrid champion by adding AD ratios to his E (while severely reducing the base damage).  His poke be much reduced and that E will be primarily used to generate shield (leaving it at rank 1 to minimize health costs without noticeably affecting shield generation during laning).\n\nThe change to his W seems to be the worst though.  If it can now only be cast on ally champions, then that leaves Mordekaiser without one of his basic abilities when solo-laning or clearing side-camps.  In addition, he won't be able to cast the ability on minions to generate shield, gain movement speed, or harass the enemy during laning phase.  This alone would remove his ability to lane solo, even without considering his reduced E damage or the loss of AoE damage on Q.\n---------------------------\nRIP Bruiser Mordekaiser. \n\n{{item:3020}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3151}} \n\n You are no longer a lumbering Juggernaut, wading through the battlefield, laughing at the mortal's pathetic attempts to bring you harm and leaving naught by ruin in your wake.\n\nYou are now a gimmicky melee carry incapable of solo-laning with an unreliable pet dragon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaghatai","date":"2015-08-07T08:36:03.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So just a big flipping middle finger to everyone who plays and loves Mord ... thanks Riot ...\n\n> to get Morde into a spot where he could be made effective without having to massively change him overall\n\nExcept that you massively changed him.
