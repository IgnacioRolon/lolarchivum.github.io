I like their playstyle their drawbacks and strengths. But, when I play other classes I find that the itemizations are very unflexible. While ADCs have bork, or IE. Toplaners have hydra or cleaver. A normal mage core build is almost locked into place with no flexibility. As saying, its a huge ball of AP on top of AP without unique stats aside from mana regen.\nThe largest culprits are.\n\n{{item:3165}} {{item:3135}} \n\nAnother problem is that there is WAY too much cooldown reduction, that it is now a spamfest on top of spamfests. (Like how the hell leblanc can Q and Q and proc mark around 35% cdr? ) Cooldowns were a large factor of actually exploiting an enemys opening and now it is not much of a thing anymore. Actually there is so much CDR that there can even be a option of a item of REDUCING cdr at this point.\n\nAnother thing that needs to be looked at is the hextech items. They were supposed to fill up playstyles and niches. Which was a clever idea. was supposed to be amp item like RFC, ruunans, shiv, PD for adcs.\n...the problem was that they were TOO niche. I cant recall anyone buying GLP, gunblade is used to exploit damage coverage rather than sustain. Had to admit protobelt is nice though. This has been said on this board several times, please consider creating hextech items for sheen users, mage assassins, and battle mages.\n\nEdit:\nI hear a lot of players complaining about mages these days. And I also believe that it is valid. Since the builds offer no actual drawback and it is the best of the best of statballiness snowball. We can change this, you know but a few factors must be changed, tweaked and revised and open up new bridges for variety here.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2017-05-20T11:18:22.952+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":2,"body":"I just wanna start by saying I applaud you for actually being well reasoned with your post and position.  Far too long do i constantly have to dismantle the incessant claims that \"mages are weak\" and that\" AP and mage champions suck right now\" or that \"AD is better than AP, AP itemisation is weak\" , but you had the maturity to not fall to these trappings and instead address a legitimate issue instead.\n\nIts not that AP is weak, far from it. The stat is freakishly potent. The problem is that it is _Stale_. As it is just a \"ball of stats\" contest in most cases.\n\nI also admire you maturity in admiting the power of Void Staff and saying there is too much free access to CDR.\n\n---\n\nTo try and discuss the issue tho:.\n\nThe problem with Hextech items i feel  is they provide to much varying stats. The items are too different. As you said, too niche from one another.\nThe Zeal items all provide the same stats, just with different numbers and effects, so it really was a choice based on what you wanted.\n\nThe Hextech items are all too different from one another, with the only thing in common being an offensive actives.\nMost Champions aren't really gonna choose between the 3. They are gonna find one that they like and ignore the others.\n{{item:3030}} is only ever considered on champions who normally rush {{item:3027}}\n{{item:3146}} is only ever bought champions that have hybrid scalings, or have abusable single target spell damage. (and recently, now being used as a pseudo DFG burst proc.\n\nOnly {{item:3152}} do i feel is actually bought for its sake, but even it is mostly only gotten on AP bruisers and mobile champions like Fizz, Ekko, Ahri and Rumble, Kennen, etc, as most AP champions like Lux, Xertah, Ziggs , Brand, have basically 0 incentive to get it ever.\n\nI guess Annie and Malzahar for ulti? \n\nPersonally, I am of the opinion that Gunblade should be made more of the Phantom Dance of the group , and an actual Thunder hextech item be introduced to \"take its place\". \n\n---\n\nThe active could be a point and click mark that when popped via a spell would then deal bonus damage.\nI also feel that Grievous wounds should be moved to this item instead or {{item:3165}} , or rather, Morelonomicon should be reworked and a new item take its place.\n\nI understand the history of why Morelonomican is the AP Grevious wounds item, but given its current role in AP itemization, it simply is tacked on power and doesn't make sense.\n\nGrievous wounds should be something you itemize for specifically, not get as a byproduct of getting an item that you get for Mana and CDR.\n\nI've contemplated perhaps tying it to the {{item:3136}} line, as it would make more sense on that item, and perhaps even make it less unappealing on none dot champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Who is Taliyah","date":"2017-05-20T12:02:44.427+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like liandry for the extra magic penetration and HP.

There's a bunch of problems, and part of the problem isn't items themselves but the archetype as a whole being problematic. (Ex: how many mages out there are built around the idea of dumping their entire spell rotation immediately for maximum burst? Answer: A lot of them.)\n{{item:3165}} has been a 1-stop shop for everything mages want from a 1st item for a long time, before it, in season 3, we had {{item:3174}} before they reworked that into a support item and decided mages aren't allowed to have good mana regeneration and must rely on having a deep mana pool if they experience significant mana costs (not really a bad change, also not one that really helps either, though it does make engineering non-abusable component items a bit easier if that pattern is in place). Some mages that don't need CDR and really want some tank stats because they're short range or do damage over time may pick up {{item:3027}} first instead (ex: {{champion:1}}, {{champion:30}}, {{champion:50}} etc.) But if you value CDR, then, {{item:3165}} is a no-brainer. If it's AP was 80, and there was a different {{item:3802}} derived item that was more built around the idea of lane dominance and aggressive play which actually gives 100 AP, but isn't a 20% CDR item (maybe 10% or none at all), it would probably help alleviate {{item:3165}}'s prevalence.\n\nVoid Staff could probably use the the {{item:3035}} treatment, and this would also allow {{item:3165}} to lose Grevious Wounds, but still allow AP to appropriately counter-build powerful sustain champs (this is why {{item:3033}} exists for AD in addition to {{item:3036}}). There isn't enough flat magic penetration items in the game {{item:3020}} and {{item:3151}} (I don't count {{item:3136}} separately because it's just a component, that builds into {{item:3151}}), especially now that ranged champs actually get .5 MR/level, and things like {{item:3139}}, and {{item:3814}} are actually decently common buys on squishy AD champs. I think having an AP component similar to {{item:3134}} that builds into 2-3 different magic pen items would go a LONG way towards solving this problem (note that I think no one item should give more than 15 flat magic pen, no more than 10 from the proposed component, since MR values are usually still lower than armor, and people need armor to tank tower shots/jungle monsters).","replies":[]},{"poster":"ForgiveColour","date":"2017-05-21T00:47:51.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except mage itemization right now is way better than just raw ap back in the days","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2017-05-21T05:57:25.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ybuR,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jfLPQtYh,comment-id=001e,timestamp=2017-05-21T00:47:51.267+0000)\n>\n> Except mage itemization right now is way better than just raw ap back in the days\n\nthis is true, but ti still kinda leans towards just stacking AP.\nIt's more a core issue with the stat really.\nIts main draws are that it scales way harder an higher than AP and is harder to mitigate than AD.\nSo in most situations, its just a statcheck game.\n\nThis is why Mana stacking was better introduced, to give you something else to itemize around than just AP.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkSunSovereign","date":"2017-05-21T10:57:44.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"How {{item:3156}} is {{item:3155}} magic {{item:3139}}  damage{{item:3814}} harder {{item:3111}} to {{item:3211}}  mitigate {{item:3194}} than {{item:3065}} physical {{item:3001}} damage?{{item:3102}}","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2017-05-21T12:01:04.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WingedWinter,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jfLPQtYh,comment-id=001e00000000,timestamp=2017-05-21T10:57:44.028+0000)\n>\n> How {{item:3156}} is {{item:3155}} magic {{item:3139}}  damage{{item:3814}} harder {{item:3111}} to {{item:3211}}  mitigate {{item:3194}} than {{item:3065}} physical {{item:3001}} damage?{{item:3102}}\n\nbe {{item:2053}} cause {{item:1031}} there  {{item:3068}} is {{item:3082}} more {{item:3047}} armor {{item:3075}} in {{item:3191}} the {{item:3024}}  game {{item:3025}} than {{item:3110}} there {{item:3069}} is {{item:3026}} MR {{item:3742}} despite {{item:3143}} having {{item:3157}} more {{item:3056}}  AP  {{item:1029}} than {{item:3050}}  AD.\n\n\nMR is also far easier to mitigate because Voidstaff works on Total MR while last whisper only works on bonus Armor.\n Armor is cheaper than MR, meaning it requires far less itemisation and works on on any target regardless as opposed to either needing multiple items dedicated to ti or having to sacrifice to pick which type of targets you wanna take out. \nChampions have higher scaling Armor and much less scaling MR.\n\nDo the math.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkSunSovereign","date":"2017-05-21T14:39:22.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AD champions have more dps however, a couple auto attacks more than makes up for the difference.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
