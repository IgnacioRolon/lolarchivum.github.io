Trying to force one onto every team composition is the cause of most of the whining on here.  They are not right for every game so stop trying to make them work every game.

That's your issue... you don't understand your window of opportunity with them.  They are not supposed to be \"breaching defenses\" try juggernauts for that.   They get shut out by defenses.
