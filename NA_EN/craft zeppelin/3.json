The problem is that new Malz brings a whole lot of new problems because of his W's and his passive's power budget.\n\nWhat we're getting, however, is somewhat of a partial revert. The new W is mechanically closer to Malz's old passive (kind of like a middleground between the new and the old), and some of its power is being taken away in favor of his other spells, which used to be stronger pre-rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Beacon Academy","date":"2017-05-07T16:33:53.396+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Old Malz had a lot of problems\"\n\nI love how this statement comes up as a justification for why he was changed only after he got reworked when prior to the rework he got **one outright nerf in 5-6 years** and only buffs or tweaks before that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Craft Zeppelin","date":"2017-05-07T05:25:07.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5etkz0Nw,comment-id=001b,timestamp=2017-05-07T02:33:45.630+0000)\n>\n> I believe (not 100% sure, but these are some of the things we&#x27;ve been talking about) in an upcoming PBE update there are buffs along the lines of E AP ratio increase and R having the beam have a flat damage component that occupies most of the AP ratio of the spell.

So great, you get to spawn a pair of Voidling at melee range while the enemy ADC just kills them.\n\nNow, I can see what they were trying to do with making them so easy to kill because they dropped the cost and cooldown to just 40/60 and 8 seconds.

As i've said, Rioters aren't going to run from board to board, copy-pasting the discussions so that everyone can see them. If it's a discussion on reddit, it's gonna be on reddit.

But it isn't a priority as there are other alternatives who do a very good job at that. And that means Riot doesn't have to rush to fix this because they sure as hell have more pressing matters to attend to - like making sure the new client is stable and working for everyone and delivering new features for it.

Hell warwick and poppy werent even normal reworks for riot; They actually RESPECTED the original designs intents, unlike almost ALL other reworks riot has been doing ever since sion.  \n\nWhich brings me to another problem. Riots lack of respect for their previous designs and choices. We should have traditional sion, traditional poppy, traditional warwick. But because riot doesnt respect their past and bumble along within their own \"yes space\" of people who have worked together for so long and therefore agree with each other they dont even acknowledge their own mistakes most of the time and scramble to fix massive problems by creating EVEN MORE MASSIVE problems.\nCase and point; malzahar. More nerfs since his rework than he had changes since release pre-rework. Thats more nerfs in a YEAR or so than he had IN THREE. Swain was much the same way, but thankfully didnt get hit to hard. \n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAlso to clarify about traditional skins; traditional skins are homages to what relaunched champions were in the past. Theyre skins that look similar to their past self, and have their old VO when applicable. \nTraditional sion right now is a custom skin which uses a default skin edit someone made in about an hour, and the old sion voice files for example. Riot could probably bang out a legitimate traditional sion in a couple days, or even a month if they make it someones pet project. The same applies to almost every other relaunched champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-05-06T10:30:33.910+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poppy was a complete Re-do from the ground up, and Warwick just needed his theme solidified, thematically. Neither of them can be compared to Malzahar's gameplay update, because both of them had separate intents. If you're saying that Malz needs a Warwick level update, most certainly, but not the other way around. \n\nMoving on to the rest, I don't care what people complained about. Even as someone who played Malzahar, he had some design problems. Little to no room for outplay, his first back for some AP let him easily push waves with E, and pretty much stopped an entire class of Champion with a click and point nuke. The most fun for myself, and sometimes my opponent, was when I accidentally summoned a Voidling that saved my life, a \"Get down Mr President\" ~~though yes, nuking people with click and point was fun for me~~\n\nNow, let's move on to \"original design intent\". Just because something was there first, doesn't mean it's the immediate right choice, especially when it has problems. Riot has made plenty mistakes in \"Original design\" like Vlad before his Mage update, which ended up creating a champion that was either over oppressive or just dreadful. \n\nYou also specify two different notions of \"original design\" when you talk about the champions reworks, while still using two separate comparisons one shouldn't make. Poppy's original design was kept from a Thematic standpoint, which fit into her gameplay. You then use that as a comparison as it should be with Malzahar, who stayed the same thematically, and only got changed in a gameplay sense. Two very different things being compared here, with unfair standards applied to one. \n\nI'm gonna say this, and I know this is gonna be hard to hear, but that's absolute bullshit. Riot doesn't have a respect for previous design choices, because they have *grown* in the quality of their content, and see the older things they made a long time ago as a stepping stone, but one that has not aged well at all. They are perfectly fine ditching what they once made, in favor for a newer better version of the same thing, something they can say \"I'm proud of this\" instead of \"Oh, well that was a long time ago\". \n\nTraditional skins for Poppy, Sion, and Warwick is one of the dumbest requests I've heard from people, because there is absolutely nothing worth keeping from those older versions. Old Sion was a meme, Old Poppy was a nightmare AND a meme, and Old Warwick **IS THE EXACT SAME AS NEW WARWICK**. They respect the past, but they don't oogle at it and put it up on a stand. They take it off the shelf, put it in Storage, and put out the newer version of it that they put more work into than the old one. (Ex. Lollipoppy original face on the Lollipop). \n\nAside from the Rant of that... you talk about a \"yes space\", which irks me for two reasons. One being, you act like just because people agree with Riot, they are somehow linked to an inherent bias, so their opinions should be worth less. Second being, that the people who are in the \"No group\" are inherently right, and can no way be wrong. Yes, Riot ignores what people wants, but sometimes what people want is not what Riot has in planned. \n\nRiot did not want Malzahar to be so click and point nukey, yet people argue that's what they want. I've seen this a lot, like people complaining about Leblanc's delay times, when Riot's specific mentions are about giving people more time to react. This is Riot ignoring people who want to keep the unhealthy aspects of a champion, because that is what they are accustomed too, and have assigned to be the original design for the champion. \n\nRiot ignoring people is not wrong. People play what they want, and like what they play for a reason, and they don't want to see that changed. But those are people we shouldn't listen to, the people who want insta-gib Leblanc, insta-gib Rengar and for no reason other than \"This is how the champion has always been!\". It's not an objective look on their own champions and the problems that plague them. \n\nSo yes, Malzahar has gotten more nerfs in one year than he has three years prior, but that doesn't mean that Old Malzahar was spotless. He had problems, and the rework has been trying to tackle those problems, but it's been a trial. There is no reason to stop doing something because it's challenging, especially when it's on a good path from intentions.\n\n/midnight rant over","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2017-05-06T21:26:01.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dr Mercy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5etkz0Nw,comment-id=00060000000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-06T10:30:33.910+0000)\n>\n> Snip\n> /midnight rant over\n\nOkay so a couple things. \n\"Relaunch\" is a VGU - a visual and gameplay update. It still includes a rework, but yes youre right that they ARE very different. for clarity however i use \"rework\". \n\nMalzahar, in the first place, didnt need the scope of the changes he got. He was FAR more balanced PRE-REWORK. His niche was anti-assassin; he was the ONLY successful anti-assassin in the game. Now hes a support because its very hard for him to kill people on his own. \nHis problems pre-rework were a relatively useless W, which could have been replaced with a skill shot or an active voiding on a charge system, and very little incentive to interact. Hint hint by the way, AHRI also has that same problem. Little reason to interact except to get a kill. \n\nOriginal design intent and respect for past concepts refers to \"Do we modernize or bastardize a champion.\" Poppy? She functions the SAME WAY as she did pre-rework; dash in, smack someone, kill them or walk out. She was modernized, and her new kit heavily respected her past kit. POPPY WAS GIVEN CHANGES THAT SHE NEEDED. Warwick is the same; he was modernized. Thats why those reworks turned out so good. THEY DIDNT ALIENATE THE EXISTING PLAYERBASE. \nA prime example of \"modernize or bastardize\" is shen. Shen needed actual scalings and a visual update. However, instead of modernizing, the person in charge of his rework \"bastardized\" him. He turned shen into WHAT HE WANTED without respecting the original vision; this alienated the existing playerbase and proved very difficult to balance. Shen is still getting severe nerfs NOW.\n\nTraditional skins are homages to the past; theyre quick, easy, and ALL they do is tell players \"there used to be something different here, but we made it into something else.\" Trundle, karma, and sejauni -all VGUS, proto relaunches - HAVE traditional skins. Sion was the first who didnt, and riots excuse was \"its to hard\" when a myriad of lunchbreak custom skins for it were released in the following weeks. \nRiot SHOULD respect the past, because its THOSE decisions that made them what they are. For people that were there, people who had fun, people who devoted time and money to something in the past that object of their focus BEING FLAT REMOVED is a slap in the face. \nI say this as a once-sion main, the pain of losing a champion i enjoyed tremendously would have been greatly asauged is riot even acknowledged the existence of him pre-rework. \nIts the work of an hour to put together a skin with the old VO. Its the work of a couple days to made a good skin based on the old default. Its the work of maybe a week - a month in a professionals off-time - to put together a traditional skin. And that month is being generous; highschoolers put together traditional sion in a lunch break or two. \n\n>Traditional skins for Poppy, Sion, and Warwick is one of the dumbest requests I've heard from people, because there is absolutely nothing worth keeping from those older versions. \n\nThe old VO. Some people are very attatched to a champions personality and it feels terrible to lose it, especially if you dont like the new one. \nYou know what traditional sion is? A color swap and some extra armor elements. His old VO. \nYou know what traditional poppy is? A battle dress. Would take more effort to do, but eh. Also her old VO. \nYou know what traditional warwick is? His old VO and his fur being a brighter blue.  \nIt takes a little extra work, but for people who put in time and effort to what they were, that little nod of riot to them feels so nice. \n\n>Aside from the Rant of that... you talk about a \"yes space\",\nA \"yes space\" is a workplace full of tightly knit co-workers who worked together for long enough that every idea sounds like a good idea. Its something that happens in MANY groups; after enough time, they naturally agree with each other.\nIts not refering to the playerbase and white knights or apologists. It has nothing to do with anything BUT riot and their LONG STRING of bad decisions and blatant favoritism.\n\n>Riot did not want Malzahar to be so click and point nukey, yet people argue that's what they \nThat isnt what malzahars rework was intended to do. It was intended to make him interact more, and what it did was exacerbate his surface playstyle while destroying his actual playstyle. Malzahar, since his rework, HAS HAD NO REASON TO INTERACT WITH HIS LANER. The subsequent nerfs have only made that problem worse, to the point where malzahar is incapable in the jungle, the midlane, topelane, AND support.\nIve said this before, but the reason malzahar is such a good support is almost entirely due to his non-lethal kit. It takes a LOT of effort for malzahar to kill someone of the same skill level - lots of mana, lots of poking, and your voidlings are practically useless now. The changes will make that even worse. \nHe needs damage. He needs ACTUAL burst. He needs to hurt, not tickle. If laindries wasnt in the game, malzahar wouldnt even be useful as an ult bot. \n\n>So yes, Malzahar has gotten more nerfs in one year than he has three years prior, but that doesn't mean that Old Malzahar was spotless. He had problems, and the rework has been trying to tackle those problems,\n\nIf the new proves to be more problamatic than the old, yes the new is worse health wise than the old. Pre-rework malzahar fit a specific niche; anti assassin. He was an IMMOBILE ASSASSIN, something so many people cant seem to wrap their heads around. He NEEDED people to engage on him in order to assassinate them; its one of the things that made malzahar who he was. \nFurther, malzahars rework was not intended to change that. Anti-assassin was his \"below the surface\" playstyle - the one  generally reserved for  people who spent time and effort on him actually realized. You could play malzahar as a farmer, but if you did, you failed fairly often. Thats a win-lane lose-game kinda thing. \nMalzahars rework was intended to \"fix\" his surface playstyle. It was meant to make him interact more, but it didnt. IT LITERALLY FAILED AT ITS STATED GOAL. \n\nTL:DR: \n1) Traditional skins help asauge an alienated playerbase and are cool homages to the past.\n2) Malzahars rework was intended to make his surface playstyle interact more, it ended up making him a champion who finds it very hard to kill on his own and therefore a good support.\n3) A yes space in the work enviornment is a close-knit group of coworkers who, due to having worked together for long enough, naturally agree with each other.\n4) Malzahar has recieved more nerfs post-rework than his entire lifetime pre-rework, which means that the rework is an obscene failure. \n5) Malzahar has many more problems now than he did before.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-05-06T22:52:31.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Shen was an issue of brickwall gameplay. They kept the things that player wanted, his dash and taunt, and they kept the same gameplay as well. He dashes at people, hits 'em with his Q, and then repeatedly wacks them to death, using his shield (and now Dodge) to delay death. They took out the things that they didn't like, as in his Q, passive, and mini-shield and morphed them into his new passive and his Q. \n\nHe plays very much the same, and he has the same aspects of what players wanted. The only real issue is the lack of a thematic connect due to the Floaty Sword, but that's all. Other than LCS balance, that's really what was the only issue of the rework, a unmatched thematic. \n\nAnd the reason they don't do traditional skins is not because it's too hard. That's never been the reason. The reason behind it, is that there is nothing from the old version that needs be kept. It's not worth the effort to appeal to the few people whose ONLY reason for playing Sion was for cheesy one-liners, especially when it means pushing back other projects that appeal to more players. \n\nThe fact that you think it's that easy to just do something shows you have no actual knowledge in how 3D animation and modeling works. It's not as simple to \"throw on some armor elements, tint him green and boom done\". No, than you just have a shitty chroma. If you're going to make a Traditional skin, you're going to **need** to go all the way, and that takes up a lot of time and effort from projects that appeal to more people than a small niche. \n\nIf you're so caught up on an old champions VO, go modify some files if you want to, but there isn't any reason for Riot to appeal to such a small majority, for the amount of effort. They're not quick or easy, stop being delusional. \n\nNo, the new Malz is not worse health wise. Being click and pointed Aids doesn't chunk me for half my health without some additional effort on Malz's part. It takes longer for him to get to \"Use E to ez clear wave\". Though he still has his Q-E-W-R combo, it takes a while to ramp up to get to result in death, which in teamfights, allows for teammates to save you. \n\nOld Malz did it with much more damage, and much faster, as his ult alone had a 130% scaling with 550 base damage. With Aids serving 330 base and 80% damage scaling, and his Q having an 80% scaling with 300 base. Even being Ulted for 1 second with a full combo, that's a massive amount of damage being done on top of an instant interrupt. That's a lot for the actual amount of effort put into accomplishing that. \n\nNo it did not fail. If you want maximum damage on Malzahar, as opposed to what it was before, you need to be able to land multiple Q's, get out a lot of Voidlings, get your E off of course, and use your Ult as a focusing tool. The fact alone that his Ult, his instant disable, doesn't have a huge nuke attached and that he needs to hit multiple Q's means his gameplay has become more interactive. I can dodge a Q,  I can kill a voidling before he spawns more. \n\nThat's called being interactable. Xerath is interactive because you can dodge all his stuff, but has long range uninteractivity to half-make up for that. Malz is interactive because you can kill his voidlings and you can deny his E more damage by dodging his Q, but in return, Malz get's lower cooldowns on both.","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2017-05-06T23:19:45.847+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dr Mercy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5etkz0Nw,comment-id=0006000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-06T22:52:31.211+0000)\n>\n>Snip\n\nShen was a space marine type hyper tank. \nHis entire thing was \"farm from range or poke from the wave and look for places to ult. When behind, simply split\". \nHis rework made his E worse and less reliable, fixed NONE of his problems, and introduced more problems. The visual update was needed and wanted, the rework was not. \n\nThe reason they dont do traditional skins is because, and i remember the hoopla this caused because a rioter literally said it, \"traditional skins require to many resources\". Riot was proven wrong the following weeks when AMATEURS CREATED TRADITIONAL SION IN LESS THAN THREE HOURS.\nYou seem to have this odd idea in your head that a traditional skin needs to have the same animations as they had before and thats simply not the case. a traditional skin is the old VO and maybe 450 skin. They have small visual tweaks and color changes to make them look more like the previous iteration. \nIt takes hours to make a traditional skin. Its at most a day of work or a week of off-work, a month tops if everyone is super busy. \n\n>No, the new Malz is not worse health wise. Being click and pointed Aids doesn't chunk me for half my health without some additional effort on Malz's part. \n\nYes, the new malzahar IS WORSE GAME HEALTH WISE. We know this because of THE SHEER AMOUNT OF NERFS HES HAD. \nAnd you know what \"doesnt chunk part\" actually is?  Malzahar is incapable of chunking you unless ahead. He lost over 500+2.0AP base damage. His voidlings are unreliable damage at best, and the nerfs to both their swarm - what made them viable originally in the first place - and their damage output have made them even worse. \nIt takes malzahar A GREAT DEAL MORE SKILL, TIME, AND COMMITMENT TO DO WHAT OTHER CHAMPIONS CAN DO FROM DOUBLE HIS RANGE. \nYou seem to not know what the concept of \"an assassin\" is or does. Malzahar WAS, PRE REWORK, an immobile assassin. You know what that made him? _An anti-assassin_. A champion who was a powerful counterpick against vayne, lucian, zed, talon, lee-sin, riven, Leblanc, tryndamere, etc. He had a clearly defined niche, but that niche was below the surface. On the surface he was \"a braindead farmer\". \n\n_**People simply could not wrap their heads around the fact pre-rework malzahar was an AP assassin**_, which leads us to his current situation where riot has created a support champion who is, with the PBE changes, unable to do ANYTHING in ANY lane against ANY meta champion. His damage is to low, his lethality is to low, his commitment is higher than any other mage, his \"counterplay\" is higher than every other champion in the game, and his ratios are some of the lowest for any \"midlane mage\".\nHe cant even jungle because riot, after nerfing his voidlings, refuses to un-nerf them. Compound nerfs are riots specialty, they dont look at whats been done in the past and change it when needed to work in the present. They refuse the past even exists and that it has always been this way.\n\n\n>. Xerath is interactive because you can dodge all his stuff, but has long range uninteractivity to half-make up for that. \nXerath is an artillery mage and also has fairly low damage compared to assassins and control mages. Control mages can clear waves with one ability or two; 100 or so mana. It takes artillery mages 150+ to clear a wave, and they have lower damage and lower scalings to boot. \nListen to yourself. Youre comparing an ASSASSIN to an ARTILLERY MAGE. Apples. To. Oranges. \n\nFurther, most other mages either have \"sustained damage\" (cass, ryze) or \"burst damage\" (everyone else). Damage over time effects are actually effected by MR per tick and are heavily countered by HP recovery. You ever wonder why that ADC with deaths dance never seems to die? Its because they have lifesteal and crit, so they have what is essentially 30% damage reduction.  \nDoT abilities used to be very strong for that reason; they werent burst, and therefore needed to be much stronger to compete with burst.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-05-06T23:57:23.088+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you described as Shen is play style, not gameplay.
