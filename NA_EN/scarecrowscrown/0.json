This items are insane together on Senna. She procs Cleaver twice with every auto, and hitting a bunch of targets with autos reduces your Q cooldown by a ton)\n\n{{item:3147}} + {{item:3508}} for squishy comps.\n\n{{item:3147}} + {{item:3174}} if your team really needs strong heals.\n\nIn general, you want to build raw AD, CDR, and armor penetration. Attack speed and crit items don't give her a lot of value due to how her passive works, but as long as you like the other stuff on it (ER gives mana and CDR, Runaan's lets you apply lots of on-hits), they're not bad buys. Just don't focus on those stats. I generally buy at least one crit item to make sure my crit chance overflows into lifesteal. \n\nSupport items are... Okay? Her AP ratios are pretty poor, but she makes use of them, and sometimes your team really needs the extra utility. Definitely wait until the second or third item to get one. The mana regen is much-appreciated. An early {{item:1004}} isn't a bad idea.\n\nTake a rune that solves your mana issues, especially if you don't plan on picking up Essence Reaver or a support item. Manaflow Band, Presence of Mind, or Biscuits are pretty essential IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"ScareCrowsCrown","date":"2019-11-19T07:26:06.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THANKS ^_^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ScareCrowsCrown","date":"2019-11-19T07:05:42.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive been building blucian style","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-11-19T06:26:07.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it's bad.

Crit and AS pale in comparison to AD and CDR\n\nAlso her kit is just wild, she has the ability to heal/hide/shield the whole team and cc/damage the whole enemy team (hence why cdr is so good)","replies":[]}]}
