Hes in a perfectly balanced place...not joking. Garen has glaring weaknesses to his kit, which any players gold & above know how to easily use against him. He has no CC except for the minor silence, which only makes him a good pick in certain situations. He has no gap closer, and he can be kited for days. Use these things against him to keep him under control. Garen has always been a strong laner, but becomes less useful later in the game. Its just a matter of knowing how to stop him from mattering. Hes allowed to have his strong points b/c of his glaring weaknesses. Same exact premise as Nasus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pentarina Only","date":"2015-12-17T17:59:23.542+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please!

Also, jungle camp top bc of quinn for easy kills?  I understand most of you are silver and lower. But he is not viable for the game if he can dish out that much damage, have 30% DR and run 40% cd on a champion that has no resources.  His Ultimate is fantastic and I like it, but true damage was way too much on a villain.  Also, the Villain takes more damage than the notes states because it incorporates the bonus damage.\n\nGaren is a problem.  When he can out damage the current broken champion Mundo in a tank battle, something is wrong.\n\nI think increasing his cd is the best option.  At 40% cdr, his Q should be at 8 seconds, not 5 seconds.  He basically has no weakness.\n\nAlso, I just did a blind test on him and his Q is still going through.  So quinn wont work as she needs the q to be blinded or he just craps on her like he does to any range champion that doesn't have a long range stun or something to keep him off.\n\nThe point of the post is to balance him, not gut him.  Simple changes to increase his CDR or make it so CDR does not lower his cd of his abilities is the best result for him.\n\nJust to let you know, a max rank W is 6 seconds.  That is 30% DR from all sources beside true damage.  With 40% cdr that makes that ability a 12 second cd.  That means he has a 30% DR ability off cd for only 6 seconds.  He basically can get a black shield from morgana or ult from kayle, run into people, spin to win, Ult someone low and that is all folks.  There is 0 skill required to play the champion, which is fine.  He is low skilled champion, but his current state is not functional, especially if he is going through blinds with his Q to land a 1.5 second silence that allows for half his E to do damage before you could even flash or use an ability.","replies":[{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2015-12-17T18:29:47.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> He basically has no weakness.\n\nLMFAO best thing i have heard all day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xenomancers","date":"2015-12-17T20:06:07.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FizzUseSplashAtt,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ox62yqqs,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-12-17T18:13:55.692+0000)\n>\n> Quinn top results in a team situation.

If you pick garen into quin and the jungler doesn't camp top - garen CAN NOT farm. Being a ranged champion it is also easy for quinn to take his passive away from him - It is that simple. Then once quinn is 6 she is also immune to ganks.\n\nThere are plenty of tank options that beat him too. {{champion:48}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:102}}\n\nAlso...Garens ult really isn't that great. Darius ult about 10 5 times better because it can execute 5 champions and it better at doing it too with true damage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Social Justice 1","date":"2015-12-17T21:55:32.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen doesn't \"outdamage\" ADCs.\n\nWhat happens is that Garen can do more damage to an ADC than an ADC can do to Garen when they're both smacking each other. This is because Garen is a tank, and ADCs tend to have base armor at all times. ADCs can do more damage to other member's of Garen's team than Garen can do to other members of the ADC's team. And ADCs can attack Garen in situations where Garen cannot attack the ADC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"khorney","date":"2015-12-17T21:50:49.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno any one halfway decent with vayne kills garen , Cass works well enough I use taric that works","replies":[]}]}
