Now with that being said I'll begin.\r\n\r\nI have consistently responded, in the past 5 years, to Riot Games' request to either respond to surveys, invited new players into the game and have even taken my own time to construct guides to make other players better.  I.E. https://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/9-11-in-depth-karthus-mid-guide-63-winrate-551291 Are these behaviors typically aligned with being a genuinely toxic presence in the community?\r\n\r\nWhen discussing permabans one should acknowledge the different \"ways\" you could get banned: verbal abuse, throwing games, and elo-boosting. These are all very different grievances with different impacts on the gameplay aspect of League. One could argue that inters and elo-boosters necessarily have a heavier impact on gameplay itself (one thrower could ruin an entire game so could a pair of elo-boosters to a lesser extent) than toxic players. Despite being drastically different offenses, there is only one singular ultimate punishment, a permanent ban. \r\n\r\nBanning people for elo-boosting and inting relatively makes more sense because that account is gone, and the players would have to buy or level up a new account if they want to keep doing it in ranked and this may be, at the current time, be the best way to deal with those players. Punishing verbally abusive players, on the other hand, is a different story.\r\n\r\nTake into consideration that a great percentage of \"mean\" players are act this way out of whatever love or passion (desire to win) they still have for the game (which in past years less players have retained and most players retain less of). A permanent ban will have no result other than said player creating or purchasing a new account to continue playing this game that they have invested time to either play with friends or to get good at. \r\n\r\nFor a diamond player like myself, creating a new account and playing ranked on it is intrinsically unfair to the dozens of players at lower elo that will have to play against me- who is of higher caliber in skill and consequently be mad that they didn't get a fair game. Having no choice but to smurf, I will necessarily be an even more toxic presence on the summoner's rift than I previously was because my actions, which weigh much heavier than my words, will inevitably be toxic to other players. \r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/NXf5gqV\r\n\r\nTake the famous elo-booster Apdo/Dopa for example (though I am in no way as good as him). A few years back Riot was chasing him all over the game and banning him on sight. And what happens? Whenever he made a new account he would rush through gold, plat, diamond, masters, challengers and be rank 1 again. In most of his games people that could never dream of beating him have to face off against him in a game in which the odds are in no way equal. And every time he gets banned, more people suffer because of it.\r\n\r\nTake Tyler1 for a different example. There's no arguing that at one time he was toxic in more than one way. He would flame his supports if they didn't pick Janna on demand and would intentionally feed by running it down mid. He was ID banned the same way as Apdo and had to make many new accounts to climb back to around diamond/masters, unintentionally ruining many games he had to play vs silvers, golds, plats just by being that much better. \r\n\r\n0.006% of the tens of millions of League of Legends players have been permabanned. How many of those hundreds of thousands of \"permabanned\" players stopped player altogether? Has the community gotten better since? Can the tribunal confidently say that yes, today's community is better than the community from five years ago?\r\n\r\nThese are all displays of why a one size fit all punishment simply circumvents one problem by introducing a new problem. But, for verbally toxic players, there can be a much more effective punishment- permanent chat restriction. Compare the damage unlimited chats can do in contrast to 10 sentences a game on an interval of 1 sentence every 4 minutes. If the problem with verbal abuse is the frequency of abuse in game, this would go about tackling that issue at its core. I wholeheartly agree with the notion that continuously toxic players should be harshly punished, but as a member of the community that genuinely wants to see the playerbase flourish I must promote a functional punishment.\r\n\r\nPermanent chat restrictions over permanent bans may not necessarily be an immediate solution to years of verbal toxicity that has plagued the game, but it will both demonstrate to the playerbase that Riot Games is actively working towards a solution, and be a first step towards eliminating verbal abuse in League of Legends alltogether.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nMichelængelo - https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Michel%C3%A6ngelo","replies":[{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2019-08-25T18:14:41.744+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":10,"body":"We basicly had perma chat restrictions with infinetly stacking ones.

Because we're afraid they will do a completely different behavior than what we're punishing them for we shouldn't remove their ability to chat but remove them from the game. Except it's a free game so there's nothing stopping them from making another account and continuing to now chat in game with no consequences. So you have done nothing to solve the problem. \n\nWhat is the more likely scenario:\n\nA: A permanently chat restricted player suddenly stops caring about winning and trolls/ints every game. \n\nB: A permanently banned player makes a new account and continues flaming his teammates or begins trolling games.\n\nPlayer B has an easier path to continue his behavior. He has no attachment to his previous account because it is banned. Riot needs to start handling player behavior uniquely. You can't handle one behavior a certain way because you're afraid another behavior will emerge. That's completely illogical and doesn't work. If Riot is going to act in this way they need to start instituting actual permanent bans with hardware bans or something similar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Divin1ty","date":"2019-08-25T18:21:46.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Timethief49,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7RTLWEuK,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-08-25T18:14:41.744+0000)\n>\n> We basicly had perma chat restrictions with infinetly stacking ones.

Thank god you guys aren't held to a higher standard playing on riot sponsored throw away accounts not giving a shit about ruining pleb players games because you are mad for getting beaten by a diamond player\" and similar stuff along those lines while a dozen games before i was on a mad streak of calling people the n word and way worse stuff but no no that's not the problem flaming the pro player was the problem. \n\nSo from one permaban to another i learned my lesson getting out of my teen years i got calmer and calmer to a point where literally arguing about the game without any insults whatsoever i get permabanned for saying \"nice s8 plats hanging around in high diamond. Riot doesn't even realize the dmg they've done to this game in their stupidity\".\n\n\nFast forward to the present day, we'Ve never had as many ragequits, inters and trolls than this season. Everyone sees and notices it how bad it has gotten and you are telling me permanently restricting chat leads to more trolls and inters? When streamers get target inted and trolled every third game? \n\nNo, being biased as shit and baiting people into using the chat at all other than for GG WP and similar lines to get you permabanned while ignoring people repeatedly running it down, going afk goes unpunished is what leads to more trolls and \"other forms of toxicity\". \n\nYou can't get lower than to ban people for arguing about the game. I mean riot support said it themselves \"CAN BE CONSIDERED TOXIC\" which translates to basically any arguing can lead to punishment because in our modern society everyone is offended over literally everything. \n\n\nAnd guess what i tried it myself. Going afk in 5 games in a row hasn't even given me a leaverbuster. Two games of arguing with people=instant chat restrict, honor loss, reward lock. Yeeeeeee i'm sure the current system is working as intented. And i'm really not telling this to argue about my banned accounts, what's done is done after losing my 8 years old main account i'm glad i stopped spending money since s5 on this shit company and just make new accounts. I'm just sick of how this community has become that legit every three or four games someone goes afk, runs it down whatever because NOTHING HAPPENS and riot and this community goes around calling everything toxic and hope the problem goes away APPARENTLY IT DOES NOT. \n\nThere must be a solution to trolling and afking. When i started playing overwatch people were trolling and ragequitting left and right (a game u pay for btw) i've been back for a week now after two years break and haven't had a single ragequit or troll after playing like 5-7 games a day in ranked.

Now people are punished harder than they should for verbal toxicity because they might become more toxic instead of actually becoming more toxic. It's all based on assuming and it's not fair towards players who wouldn't start inting or trolling after getting permanent chat restriction or removed access to chat. They are basically saying that because some people become more toxic, everyone becomes more toxic and should be treated the same way. THAT is toxic by riot, generalizing players like that. It's literally like saying some people of certain skin color commit crimes so everyone from that skin color will commit crimes and they all should be punished like they would commit a crime that they haven't committed yet.\n\nTL:DR, Currently Riot is punishing people for crimes they didn't commit just because they expect them to commit them.

I enjoy seeing posts talking about actual issues with the game, such as unfair bans, sometimes, players get banned for things they clearly didn't do and sometimes they post about it on here, and they show how their ticket was responded to with an automatic message saying that the ban WAS ''fair'' when the ban was something of a hacker hacking them and making them get banned with no way to get it back, or anything similar even if their story might be made up, who knows. I feel like THAT is something that needs to be talked about more because it's honestly disgusting to see Riot treat some of their banned players this way, even if it might be a small percentage of the already banned percentage of players.

It's there as a last resort, and something that should be explained to folks that have a 2-week suspension.\n\n> -------------\n> My honest experience, is that most people who get upset in ranked games especially are the ones who really care the most about it. Getting on the case of a jungler who is failing everything, refusing to work or gank with the team, and people trolling, inting, and or deciding to throw the game by trying an off meta build with an off meta champ in a lane it doesn't belong is not the problem. \n\nYou should make your own discussion regarding your permaban and see if others agree that you cared about winning. Show your chat logs and see if others agree that you were working toward objectives and trying to build teamwork. The community can also weigh in on whether or not you were unfairly punished.","replies":[{"poster":"1SPIRIT","date":"2019-09-12T16:40:42.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The community here is several biased towards Riot being in the right.

I see two issues here. \n\n1. Either for the community - The Perma Ban tribunal is too aggressive and needs to be more forgiving. - (unlikely) \n2. We need to address our own personal issues and accept personal responsibility for our actions. \n\n\nSomething I would actually like to see would be an option - by default - to turn off friendly chat. That way I don't have to start off a game by muting people it's just already done. I can see pings and that's it. \n\nI've honestly gone entire games without reading the chat box because it's gotten to the point now where I just ignore it. It's really rare that I will type anything above and beyond an announcement that someone is AFK, or asking if someone is AFK. \n\nWe collectively - as a player base - allow the chat box to dictate too much of our behavior. Just because you see someone DO something dumb in the game doesn't mean you HAVE to call it out and complain about it. There is no obligation to chat in that chat box. None. Hell, I've managed to do entire dungeons in other games (MMO) without typing in the chat box, or talking outloud - dungeons I've NEVER done with people I've NEVER played with. There are lots of tools using Pings, or other tools to communicate. \n\nMoral of the story, we as a player base need to just stop using the text box so much regardless of how much we want to be keyboard warriors.","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2019-08-26T04:54:04.083+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=logrusmaster,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7RTLWEuK,comment-id=0017,timestamp=2019-08-26T02:18:55.822+0000)\n>\n> Something I would actually like to see would be an option - by default - to turn off friendly chat.

It's static text on the ban screen, and has been there even back as far as the old client. What's worse, is given Riot's difficulty in handing out bans for anything that are not blatant chat offenses, it cannot be used as a proxy for how much toxicity is out there.\n\n>But, for verbally toxic players, there can be a much more effective punishment- permanent chat restriction. \n\nThey used to do this. They stopped doing that when people with permanent chat restrictions would begin trolling games instead.\n\nThe real solution here is fourfold:\n\n1. Duplicate account detection. It doesn't need to be perfect, but even bars that ants couldn't limbo under would be a good start. Someone who wants to come back after a permaban should be required to take some iota of effort; right now, they don't even have to use a different email address on their dupe account. \n\n2. Getting smurfs out of low elo. Not in an \"accelerated\" way, not \"provsionally\", but in a \"you are a smurf, your account is now set to the rank you actually belong at, now play at your own skill level you pathetic nigh-cheater.\" This ties into 1 for obvious reasons.\n\n3. Dropping the hammer for ingame behavior trolling a lot faster. It shouldn't take a \"pattern of behavior\" for someone to get drummed out of the game for intentionally feeding. It should be a one and done. You do it, and you lose your account, just like that.\n\n4. Better anti-botting measures. If you play VS AI matches or TT, you understand how annoying bots are and how many of them there are. These feed the account selling that allows for the smurf/perma revolving door to occur. Botted accounts need to be banned *quickly*, before they have a chance to ruin games and change hands. \"Ban waves\" allow for too many blown games and allow for too many botted acounts to be sold successfully.\n\nSadly, all of these things amount to QoL changes that benefit players and only players, cannot be monetized, and would require substantial effort and development time, so the chances of these changes being made with Riot 2019 are nonexistent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PzyXo","date":"2019-08-25T19:16:27.095+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, yes.
