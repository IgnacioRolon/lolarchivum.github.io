I have filled out a ticket about it earlier this month but nothing was done. I have this smurf account that I have had to be playing on but my main account is Revaltions. I looked up the account and it has been being played on almost daily. They have renamed my mastery and rune pages and also don't even use the champions I main. I have spent well over a couple hundred on this account so it sucks that it was hacked. Please anything you can do to get my account back will be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"YouStoleMyAcc","date":"2017-01-14T22:17:34.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How can you be so sure who is the owner? Is there any way to verify if the hacker is the owner? cause for all i know, the hacker is playing and nobody asks him for account owner validation uh. That is pretty much giving the hackers a free account ? If someone claims his account has been hacked, and  the hacker claims its his, Do a validation test, see who has the most good results, and you have your truthful owner. Easy, simple, efficient.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-14T21:30:55.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see any recent tickets or submissions that went unresolved.
