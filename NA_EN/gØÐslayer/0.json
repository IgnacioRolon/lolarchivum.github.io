If YOU cant carry your teammates, regardless of how they&#039;re playing, YOU don&#039;t deserve to climb. If you go on a loss streak, its YOUR OWN fault and no one else&#039;s, regardless of how you play. If YOU want to make a play to help your team come back in the game, and your team doesn&#039;t want to follow, its YOUR fault. If YOU can&#039;t constantly help your other lanes out before the enemy snowballs, its YOUR fault. If you can&#039;t help your botlane that is losing 2v2, its YOUR fault. And lastly, if YOU cant make up for the skill disparity between your own laners and enemy laners, then its YOUR fault and you don&#039;t deserve to climb at all because your play lacks quality. Riot&#039;s matchmaking algorithm is carefully designed and is perfect the way it is. I hope it never changes &lt;3. Go Riot!\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Vhan8765","date":"2018-06-05T19:36:29.901+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What kind of logic is that?\nI don't even know how to properly reply to this; I don't even know if it deserves one.","replies":[{"poster":"GØÐSLAYER","date":"2018-06-05T19:40:51.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fanboy, complacent logic.

Good example are games with full AD comps; those are the best unwinnable games!","replies":[{"poster":"GØÐSLAYER","date":"2018-06-05T19:54:23.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL i agree with you bro, this whole post is /sarcasm. I'm super frustrated with all the complacent people that are fine with the current state of matchmaking and the current state of the game in general. It feels like I only have a balanced 2v2 botlane every 1 in 5 games, and even that's a stretch. If botlane loses you're just forced to roll your eyes cuz suggesting any changes in gameplay is toxic: me: \"bot go top please, there's tower protection\", adc: \"lol dont tell me what to do\", duo support: \"lol tell me why we should listen to you again?\", me: /fullmute all, /ff 15. If botlane wins its a miracle but you still roll your eyes because the fight wasn't balanced at all with your ADC hardsmurfing and enemy ADC in first ranked game ever picking Kog'maw into Kai'sa/Leona.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nine Realms","date":"2018-06-05T19:35:18.318+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice win streak btw.","replies":[{"poster":"GØÐSLAYER","date":"2018-06-05T19:36:22.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't take my play into account.

Yes you who are 1 piece on a board of 10 can decide this... Unless you are playing something absurdly broken you can only do so much. I will give props where it is due, at least the balance is that good. You don't see one man carries able to 1v5 the enemy team, they need at least a little help/team work to do it. Even master/challengers only win about 60 percent of the time. The real problem with solo duo is how little control you actually have. It is a joke of a queue. The matchmaking is even more of a joke, and smurfs do not help. Because yes a skilled player can really do a lot, but if their teams are literal trolls/people not trying not even they can carry it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GØÐSLAYER","date":"2018-06-05T20:00:08.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let's see how many downvotes I can get on a sarcastic post asking for change.
