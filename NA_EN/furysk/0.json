Could not maintain connection to the riot server at fairly equal intervals throughout the game.\r\n\r\nCharter itself was not having any issues during the disconnections i had (could load up a competitors game and stream video while LoL suggested i didn't have a connection).  In the STL area.\r\n\r\nhappened at 2 minutes, at about 15 minutes, at about 28 minutes, and about 40 minutes into the game. (12-15 minutes).  Ping would start at 30, go fine for 10 minutes, then climb to 60, then climb to 120, then i would get 'attempting to reconnect' before hitting 500 ping and full stop.  I was able to watch people freely move and kill me between the tier 1 and tier 2 tower at 15 minutes while at 120-150 ping, and getting an attempting to reconnect notification.  \r\n\r\nThe first time i disconnected and reconnected locally thinking it was me.  then waited for about a minute and quit and rejoined to perfect ping.  every time it happened thereafter i could exit the game and re-enter to no connection issues whatsoever for a 10 minute span.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time it has happened in this way, and was not an issue in either of the two previous nights in which i had played.  Not going to risk playing through these issues further, but in case it's not an isolated incident to just me I thought i would give a heads up.","replies":[{"poster":"73139178DEL1","date":"2016-08-25T22:08:02.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Live in St.Charles and have the same problem please help.

It seems our entire internet connection just shuts off (web browser takes hours to load a page, etc..) but as soon as the game ends it all starts to work again, so my guess is that it's something on the last patch that interferes with some ISP.
