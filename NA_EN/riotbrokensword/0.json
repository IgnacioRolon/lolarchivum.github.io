Some of you might have seen this through the ticker, where you suddenly get a message saying “Disconnected from PvP.net.” Or possibly when you’re on your way into a game, and you’re disconnected from Champ Select and have close down and relog, potentially ruining a promotion series. It’s a frustrating experience that we’re working to resolve. To be clear on one thing, these disconnects don’t seem to occur in-game.\r\n\r\nWe don’t have an answer for you yet, but we’ll update this thread when we have new information. One working theory is that our client behaves oddly with [Window’s IP Helper ](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366073(v=vs.85).aspx)(or vice versa), but we’re not sold on that theory yet. We’re combing through recent changes to both LoL and Windows to look for other more likely suspects.\r\n\r\nWhile we’re investigating the root cause of the issues, we’ve seen players have some luck solving the problem themselves. We’ve documented this work around, and wanted to share it to relieve you all of some pain while we find a long-term fix. \r\n\r\nHere are the instructions: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq11\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience, everyone.\r\nRBS","replies":[{"poster":"HappilyZerg","date":"2015-05-21T13:35:22.768+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just lost my series because of this.

I have patiently tried using the simple workarounds (which DO NOT work) that riot just auto responds with. At this point, im sick of it. I hadnt checked for a few days hoping that this is issue had at least been addressed again. Unsurprisingly, there hasnt been an official word from a rioter anywhere since two weeks ago.\n\nThis issue will not just go away.

I was disconnected shortly after jungle camps spawned and it took a few tries to get back in, but when I finally was reconnected, I couldn't buy at shop, use abilities or switch the camera position, but I could move and type to chat.  We were losing pretty badly by then, so one of my teammates suggested dying, so I clicked on the mini map to move blindly to the enemy champions, got killed, and when I revived, I could do things with double click and use my abilities, but I still couldn't reposition the camera with the arrow keys or by moving my mouse to the edge of the map (I could double click the mini map, though).  Shortly after that we surrendered.\n\nI got leaver buster because of this.  My connection is always good and I never leave intentionally, so this was the first time this had happened to me, and I only got the warning.\n\nI have some screen shots, but they can't show anything about my lack of controls.  I do have one of my Champion Amumu doing the crying animation and loosing mana without the pool animation.  This was after I reconnected, And I'm guessing part of the affects carried over from when I had w activated when I first got disconnected.  Let me know if I can provide any information from my case which can help you solve this.\n\nThanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"NCT Taeyong","date":"2015-05-08T01:19:57.454+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Waiting for your solution..This is getting mad _annoying_","replies":[]},{"poster":"RiotBrokenSword","date":"2015-05-12T22:33:37.144+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nUpdate for today: \nWe're working to find a consistent reproduction of the issue.
