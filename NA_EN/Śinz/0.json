The problem persisted now for about 12 hours -- the whole day -- and not once was loss prevention enabled. Where is the compensation for those of us who had our time and efforts wasted and lost a lot of ranked game progress due to an error on your end?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MicRoBacter","date":"2017-03-13T18:21:43.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here.\nI cannot connect to games.
