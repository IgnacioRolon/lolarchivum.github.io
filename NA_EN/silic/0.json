When I started the patcher ( I have completely updated right when the patch came out and been playing for days ) and clicked launch, the patcher closed and the client opened as usual. But the client was nothing but a black screen and disappeared after 2 seconds. I have tried restarting my laptop but it's still not working. I tracked the processes through Task Manager after clicking launch and I saw that the usage (RAM, CPU, Disk,..) of the patcher quickly decreased as it opened and closed right after 2-3 seconds. Only LolClient remained in the processes tab of task manager but it disappeared right after that (at first there were 3 or 4 LolPatcher in the processes tab).\r\n\r\nI hope someone could help me with this problem because I'm just a newbie to this game and know barely nothing about this problem. (I'm really sorry for my bad English)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-17T18:12:52.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm here to help!  The black screen is usually caused by a network problem that's failing to establish a connection to the server.

I really appreciate it.\n\nI have tried all the step mentioned in that link but it seems like it doesn't work in my case so I had to re-install. And now the client has worked again :D","replies":[]}]}]}
