You have to be in a premade party with that teammate in order to get a chest.\n\nAlso, you can only earn one chest per champion per season. Once you earn a chest on a champion, you will be unable to earn another chest while playing as that champion until next season. If you want more chests, you will need to play different champions.\n\nIf you have anymore questions, feel free to ask.","replies":[]}]}
