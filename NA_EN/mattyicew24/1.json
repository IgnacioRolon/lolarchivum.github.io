You try to reconnect but it keeps crashing until everyone is in the game except you. \nSeems to have appeared with Lissandra Patch.\n\n\nKNOWN FIX : You might have a logitech or microsoft profile that changes automatically when launching LoL. It has been the culprit for 2 members here, please try to disable it and feedback. Thanks.\n\n\n Hello,\n\n There is currently a recurring problem for many people that occured since a couple of patches. \n\n First things first :\n\n - I have the latest drivers for my GPU.\n - I repaired the game, to no avail.\n - I reinstalled the game, to no avail.\n\n What happens is the following :\n\n What is going great :\n - Launch the client without problem.\n - Navigate in the client without problem.\n - Go to champion select, pick a champion without problem.\n\n THEN instead of showing all the champions, the names, the % complete and these kind of things, one of these 3 things will happen :\n\n 1. Outright crash. \n - Screen goes black (normal)\n - I can see the cursor of my mouse going to 'busy' mode (normal)\n - Then, the cursor blinks quickly, and LoL crashes. \n - No bugsplat or anything, just the whole software shutting down.\n\n 2. Crash after a while.\n - Screen goes black (normal)\n - See the cursor of my mouse going to 'busy' mode (normal)\n - Cursor stays in 'busy' mode, but the champions don't appear, nor the loading screen. It hangs like this for a while (10sec) and then similar crash as 1.\n\n 3. Manage to go in game, but can't see any champion, and can't buy\n\n The game often needs to be restarted more than 10 times before the game can be joined and played.\n\n You'll find some of my logs attached, as well as my dxdiag.\n\n I hope you can help me, I can send some more logs if you wish. These are the latest after my full reinstall.\n\n Thank you very much in advance for everyone who has this problem.\n\n Alex\"","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AliFox15","date":"2016-08-16T02:55:41.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if reinstall your windows won't help,then you need a better computer","replies":[]}]}
