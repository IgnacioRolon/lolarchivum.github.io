The ranked matches have been shut down however, its not making any change at all. I have been trying the normal 5 v 5 with a friend and always one of us is endlessly  stuck on the finding match screen and one on the match has been accepted menu.\r\nArams seem to work as the only game mode in the game that is playable.
