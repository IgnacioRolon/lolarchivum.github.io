It happened after I alt+f4'd to trick our adc into believing I went afk. (He stole my scuttlecrab), but anyways it kept on happeing at least two more times. \n\nIs this because someone else is trying to log into my account or does it have something to do with the fact that I alt+f4'd?\nI'm like literally freaking out right now. I do not want to loose my account to some stupid hackers!\n\n\n**Please respond if you know something about the issue!**","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-26T22:24:17.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I don't suggest alt+f4ing in the middle of a game, it sounds like doing that might be causing some connection issues between your network and our game servers preventing you from reconnecting. \n\nTake a look through our [Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure you're able to keep a stable connection throughout the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Okuma","date":"2017-03-27T04:56:33.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fully aware that alt+f4ing in the middle of a game puts my team in a disadvantage.
