Should this be a priority so that future Viktor skins don&#039;t have this problem? If an unprocessed VO is made in the future, will the Death Sworn skin be able to receive a non-robotic voice?\n\nI get that the Death Sworn skin won&#039;t have a non-robotic VO right now because it just isn&#039;t available, but the more I watch the videos the more disappointing and sad I am because the voice just doesn&#039;t fit the Death Sworn theme *at all*. And it is such a good skin otherwise! The eerie bluish green particles, the runes in the W. The visuals of his model are just gorgeous with the eyeball over his shoulder. But the voice is just so off that it just leaves all this beautiful work feeling flat. The voice takes me out of this skin and makes me just think about playing Creator Viktor.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} \n\n(Signed) A dejected Viktor main","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-10-13T19:43:04.126+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Nefas - \n\nWe don't have plans to re-record VO for Viktor for his Death Sworn skin.  I can't speak for the future, to be honest with you. I don't know what Viktor would have in store for him down the road. If I had to guess, I would say he would end up with whatever the new VO was that came with his VGU, and wouldn't be processed - that's only basing it off how updates have gone in the past, iirc.","replies":[{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2017-10-13T20:26:01.667+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"What VGU? That isnâ€™t something that has been mentioned as far as I know of.\n\nEDIT: If you are talking about VGU from his previous update, how does that square with what you said on the PBE Forums?\n\n> We had unprocessed VO in some locales but we didn't have unprocessed Viktor VO in all regions. We tried some tests of processing his base VO and it proved impossible to reduce the robot processing without ruining the quality.\n\nSo all future skins will be stuck with the existing robot VO, whether or not it makes a lick of sense? That's just a slap in the face to Viktor players - clearly the quality of the skin doesn't matter. Riot talks such a big game about providing \"alternate fantasies\" through skins but providing a basic level of separation from normal robotic Viktor with a non-robotic VO is not even planned for in the future? The only thing that matters was checking off the box that Viktor got a skin. If that's how Skins is going to treat him I won't buy a single one.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-10-19T16:39:37.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may have misworded this. I'm not talking about a previous update, I'm talking about a hypothetical update in the future. \n\nI cannot say with any sort of certainty what is in store for Viktor, in terms of skins, or any updates, really. I'm not sure to what extent the current VO *can* be processed - maybe it has potential for other tweaks, but not something ethereal. If we're talking entirely new recording, that'd be something we'd take on with a legendary skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-10-13T21:14:08.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i think he means the vgu they did to him in season 4","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-10-11T23:24:48.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure it's kind of like Syndra, they just don't have an unprocessed voice for the champion.

He among numerous champs that only got model updates or something smaller like texture updates are due for a Voice over update. Specially since Viktor has a in-depth background that is not reflect that much in his lines. Would be great if he had something with Jayce and Blitzcrank in his quotes.\n\nA Legendary skin would be a great excuse to voice his classic lines as well, just how Elementalist Lux paved the way for classic Lux to get new VO.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shatter the Sun","date":"2017-10-12T00:13:33.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP3Gd8tBEkdb_kXdyrISE3Q/featured?disable_polymer=1 this guy makes voice overs and I wouldnt be surprised if he could do one for DS Viktor.","replies":[]}]}
