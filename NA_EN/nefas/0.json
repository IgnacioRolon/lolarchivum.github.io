I have been placed top 12 of those 15 games (including my last game where I just went top Malzahar out of sheer frustration with having to play tops). This does not count 3+ other matches were someone dodged and I was also top. Can you tell me if I'm in some sort of low priority queue or is the position placement system just not doing a good job? Given that I've been in multiple sets of promos in the past 15 games this is really getting annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T03:31:28.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No LPQ on this account currently!
