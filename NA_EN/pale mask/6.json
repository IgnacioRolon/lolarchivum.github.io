From his fiery interactions with his mother, to his love for Zvanna and his vengeance against Rygann and the village.\n\nKegan's successfully been turned into something more than a mere vessel for Brand's fury.\n\nHis final interaction with Ryze was very good.\n\nKegan's a barbarian who managed to frighten the archmage teaching him with a simple question. He's both wise and ignorant. A child, the son of a reaver, and a genius who outwitted his master with pure logic. Their dialogue was the best part of the story, personally. This type of writing needs to continue.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-07-17T18:41:27.572+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait.\n\nKegan is an actual character now, beyond backstabbing his friends and taking a liking to touching fires?\n\nHoly shit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-07-18T15:48:22.313+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you like this, you should check out Aaron Dembski-Bowden's other work.
