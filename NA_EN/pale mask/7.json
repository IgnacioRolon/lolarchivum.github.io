In other words, the Shadow Isles offer you such magnificent creations as:\n\n* **the shark chariot**\nhttps://i.imgur.com/v0YfW64.png[/img]\n\n* **the ghost octopus**\nhttps://i.imgur.com/UWEmqEl.png[/img]\n\n* **Kalista's ex-boyfriend**\nhttps://i.imgur.com/r3nxNUd.png[/img]\n\n* **giant, undead Scuttlecrab**\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3CqpZFs.png[/img]\n\n* **this beautiful specimen**\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3ehGGVV.png[/img]\n\n...and many more!\n\nNext time you wish to pledge yourself to a faction, consider the Shadow Islesâ€”consider how trifling and limited mortal comprehension isâ€”and consider how wonderful the myriad mysteries of the spectral world are compared to those worthless living people and their meaningless struggling against their inevitable mortality.\n\nAnd also, consider\n#the Spider God.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/qXdKWjG.png[/img]","replies":[{"poster":"GenoXx","date":"2019-10-16T03:36:40.326+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"I...I can't remain calm anymore.

(possibly) depending where this is thought to be it could be before kalista freakin impales then hell out of him.\n\nTo those wondering why I would state this its because those who are grabbed by the mists yet come back dont look the same if they go by lore they change abit ( like hecarim did) with each \"death\" So we may see Ledros look different say if he was ever a champ : D\n\n(Again this might not be fully the case.
