This isn't a joke or rant, I at least enjoyed playing the game when I was ranking up, but I can't stand the players where I am and would love a way to play in a less obnoxious setting.. Does anyone know if Riot can directly demote you?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-21T02:33:34.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Eeeeehhhhhh unfortunately no we cannot directly demote you whatsoever. I understand (oooooh trust me I understand XD) that playing in the tier you placed in may not always be fun, but it would not be very fair of us to alter anyone's rank. If we were to demote a Plat player, for instance, it would greatly affect the outcome of lower ranked games.","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2017-04-21T02:53:39.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I'm understanding this wrong, but as someone who was gold in S5, who later quit and didn't do ranked in season 6, or 7 yet,  having effectively gone through two soft resets, doesn't that mean I'm closer to as if I've never played ranked, or is the first soft reset still affecting me? \n\n I noticed in norms I went from silvers when I first got back to seeing golds and plats with a few diamonds again like I used to, and that didn't take long - was wondering since ranked operates on a different level if it was going to be harsher when I finish placements.","replies":[{"poster":"D4RT3R","date":"2017-07-17T20:05:04.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish i could reset my rank, i was gold 2 in season 5, but after season ended i stopped playing for quite a while actually, then i just came back and guess what, im in bronze","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fallstock","date":"2017-04-22T01:16:23.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I appreciate the response. It is unfortunate and I can see it impacting a game, I just long for a slightly more competitive match than casual but good lord the toxicity as you get higher gets worse and worse. Thanks anyways.","replies":[]}]}
