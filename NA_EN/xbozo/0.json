To start off and help rule out possibilities, I suggest using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to configure your network.  This can help in cases of your connection becoming unresponsive at some point.  Hopefully, that will do the trick!","replies":[]}]}
