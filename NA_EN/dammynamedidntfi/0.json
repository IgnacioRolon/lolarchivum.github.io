Q base is going up but more sparkles is going away which nets in Q doing slightly less. the 20% hit to splash damage is to keep the Q damage on AoE doing roughly as much as it does now on live.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-28T00:15:11.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Still fine, learn to use more than Q.","replies":[{"poster":"vgamedude","date":"2018-02-28T01:01:35.333+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Literally last place in winrate by a 3 percent or so margin \n\n\"totally fine!\"","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-28T01:40:17.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=vgamedude,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0dP4Z6Ju,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-02-28T01:01:35.333+0000)\n>\n> Literally last place in winrate by a 3 percent or so margin \n> \n> &quot;totally fine!&quot;\n\nAlmost like every other champion who got a big rebalance.\n\nAll the trash people who are just on the FoTM OP abuse bandwagon will leave, the actually good players will adapt to the changes, and winrate will level off.","replies":[{"poster":"vgamedude","date":"2018-02-28T03:45:19.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya totally dude even swain the day of his rework didnt have that low of a winrate.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bodhwell","date":"2018-02-28T02:12:34.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The Q and W changes on the PBE currently should net to a buff on both wave clear (from Q) and more consistent team fight damage (from W missiles).","replies":[{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2018-02-28T13:13:07.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bodhwell,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0dP4Z6Ju,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-02-28T02:12:34.464+0000)\n>\n> The Q and W changes on the PBE currently should net to a buff on both wave clear (from Q) and more consistent team fight damage (from W missiles).\n\nNot really, more sparkles is being removed from Q which is huge. It nets a small nerf to Q damage. The buff to the scaling could improve things but with how much less AP you get now(example: {{item:3285}} used to give 100 AP at 3200 gold now 90 AP at 3300 gold)  and her weak wave clear, she may still struggle to get the gold early to do anything meaningful.","replies":[{"poster":"Bodhwell","date":"2018-03-01T18:43:18.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll have to see, but the context I read recently said that this change was intended to make wave clear easier. \n\nI was unsure of the passive removal, too. But my intuition is that the combination of changes will help a lot.\n\nThe scalings do matter though, regardless of how the AP items have changed. A 40% buff in AP scaling is significant. You also have to consider that the base damage of Q has been buffed by a good amount _and_ there's a new level-based scaling _and_ they increased the range (which means you can make it travel farther and get more distance-based damage).\n\nI'm optimistic.\n\n**EDIT** Okay, decided to try her on the PBE a bit. Waveclear is about the same in the early game, but it does feel a LOT better later. Also, that W damage packs a punch now. It could end up feeling different on live, of course.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2018-02-28T13:01:50.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you said \"entertainment\", are you referring to just the Zoe players or her victims who got one-shotted from full HP?","replies":[]},{"poster":"vodrio12","date":"2018-02-28T04:01:18.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vAWuag6ABgI/VJRJbxJz2yI/AAAAAAAAAPo/WVA0SaocM0c/s1600/reporte_20.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colton147","date":"2018-02-28T01:49:15.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:142}} is {{champion:164}} 2.0. {{item:3070}}\n\nGutted into no longer being viable and is pretty much a troll pick/auto-loss.","replies":[]}]}
