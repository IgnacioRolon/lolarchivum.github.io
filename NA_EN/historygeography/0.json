This issue is likely caused by an unstable connection to those servers, so I suggest working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure this isn't caused by bad local network settings.\n\nLet me know if this worked.
