Eventually it DID start loading again, and finally i got in the game. The game had started without me. I bought my items, went mid - even Q'd a minion - and THEN botlane got 2/0'd, they started a remake vote, and it went through 4/0 before i could vote against it.\r\n\r\nI connected to the game with zero foul play and still got punished, in a norm, for something i had zero control over and that had relatively minimal impact on the game (my opponent, yasuo, had just farmed mid while our jungler cleared red). Why was my team able to start a remake vote after i reconnected?","replies":[{"poster":"Noodle","date":"2016-08-05T03:15:51.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thts me hi","replies":[{"poster":"jr deputy meow","date":"2016-08-05T03:20:01.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Listen, Dad, like I said, I can stop any time I want.

I remember why i stopped in the first place... just want to say a big fk you RIOT. thanks for wasting my time, I really appreciate it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-05T21:49:45.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Your account can be marked by [leaverbuster ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)after leaving multiple games, even if you reconnect and return the game.  It may have been early in the game, but the period until minions are released is to help prepare for battle and not resolving technical issues.  \n\nThe best way to recover from this is by playing consistently without issues.  If you're continuously having problems, let me know and I'd be happy to try and help resolve it.   Otherwise, I hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"jr deputy meow","date":"2016-08-06T03:16:06.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for the timely reply. I would like to reiterate that the \"leaver\" status i was referring to was specifically the result of the remake vote going through AFTER i reconnected.\nThat is to say: What really mystified me was that my team was able to start a remake vote and surrender the game well after i had successfully reconnected. All of my previous experiences with the remake function seemed to indicate that starting a remake vote was no longer possible once the player had reconnected. Is this functioning as intended?\nIt is interesting to note that, contrary to my expectations, i was not struck with any queue penalties at all when i attempted to queue up again after the game ended. I do not know how leaverbuster or remake penalties work - i have a strict policy of never quitting games early, so i cannot recall /any/ time when i have been struck with queue penalties - but is \"leaver(remake)\" treated the same as, say, a mid-game ragequit?\nthanks again for the reply.\n\nedit: i did not know that you could be hit with leaverbuster even after reconnecting. I actually have connection/crashing issues just like the ones i experienced in that game quite frequently, but i haven't yet been struck with leaverbuster to my knowledge. I would assume that leaverbuster penalties are at least slightly mitigated by reconnect attempts (otherwise i see little personal incentive for players to attempt to reconnect to a game after experiencing issues, which - i feel - would be a problematic design), but is this actually the case?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jr deputy meow","date":"2016-08-05T03:13:15.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"im playing pokemon also maokai support is fun\" - noodle","replies":[]}]}
