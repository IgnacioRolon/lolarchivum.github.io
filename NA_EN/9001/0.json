As it is right now on the forums, General Discussion is the main forum and becomes overloaded with threads. It makes it difficult to find the content that is interesting to you. We need tags to search by to find threads or maybe just more sub-communities such as:\n\n* **Discussions by Champion**\n * *Great for discussions on their current state, build strategies, and viability. Especially useful for those of us looking for players opinions before purchasing a champion.*\n\n* **Threads by lane or role**\n * *As a Support main I would really love to have a sub-community specifically for talk about Supporting. A place to discuss strategy, builds, and experience.*\n\n* **Riot Pls**\n * *These could be threads specifically directed at Riot employees with questions or comments about the game.*\n\n* **New Content**\n * *A place to discuss new skins, champion releases, login screens, icons, ect.*\n\n\n\nThese are just a few ideas. Feel free to add some more if you guys think of any!  ","replies":[{"poster":"Montag","date":"2013-09-18T05:14:04.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're considering them! We want to see what you guys post about, how people interact with it, and from there decide which communities we might need. Our current structure is very early and very beta, and we expect it to shift with your interaction as a LoL community.","replies":[{"poster":"9001","date":"2013-09-19T21:34:57.302+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think for sure more communities/tags are a key idea. It would really allow the players to focus in on topics that mean a lot to them. As it is right now General Discussion is a joke. It's a huge forum that is fast moving and has the most random threads inside. The casual reader is forced into sifting through multiple threads just to find something they are passionate about (all while the threads keep moving because more are created or commented on.)\n\nMore communities and tags to search by will really help to organize threads and discussions and help casual readers connect with the topics they are passionate about.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"cawtalis","date":"2013-09-17T22:45:58.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"additionally, the main reason i ever used the original forums was to browse map specific stuff...so yeah i would really like a dominion sub community\n\nanother thing to think about would be having an \"all\" tab were we can see the highest rated comments at that time across all sub communities(like reddits /r/all)","replies":[{"poster":"Montag","date":"2013-09-18T05:14:33.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're thinking very much about ways to get players to the specific topics they're interested in.

I think it would work wonders here too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cawtalis","date":"2013-09-18T17:36:55.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well as heydon says having tags would probably work out really well, though i would at least like to see some broad forum communities that then have tags delegating what they are talking about.  the example i will use would go like this, you have a sub community for maps/modes, and then have a tag section of supported maps/modes (ex: D, TT, SR, HA), then you could go a step farther into the tags and have tags relating to certain topics ex: within the D tag(it stands for dominion if you didn't figure it out) there could be a DD(dominate dominion), Balance, How to, Guides, List.  As well as this for a starting point we would also need to be able to put in tags are selves for anything that comes up and we just don't know how to put it there otherwise ex: arab, or hide n seek. \n\nanother thing to potentially think about would be having sub communities having sub communities, I'll admit that that seems somewhat counter intuitive, but just going from the old forums there are some topics that need to be able to be brought over(maps, I'd personally prefer off topic instead of \"memes and games\", a general testing sub community, then broken into tags of pbe, mac, client, community; and any others that pop up","replies":[]}]}]}]}
