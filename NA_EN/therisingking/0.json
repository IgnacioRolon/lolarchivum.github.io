I normally never dodge. Even with a troll on my team I still play out the game for fun but this glitch/bug/problem is forcing me to dodge. My dodge penalty timer is now up to 15 minutes and I'm worried it will get so high I will not be able to play anymore. \r\n\r\nI have strong wifi and a fast computer and usually run at about 130- 180 fps with 25- 40 ping.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help whatsoever,\r\n\r\nTheRisingKing","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-19T02:51:25.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crashes in champ select are typically caused by the client disconnecting from the game platform service enough to drop connection entirely.
