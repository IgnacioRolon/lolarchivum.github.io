Normally my ping is about 5-15 but lately it's been bottoming at about 40 and jumping to 100-200 whenever anything happens in game. I have run speed tests several times and I do not believe the problem is on my end. I also know that other people have recently had more issues with ping and lagging but I cannot prove it.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-21T04:15:02.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this high ping happens in every game you try to play, it could be a sign that your network connection is taking a less than adequate route on it's way to our game servers.
