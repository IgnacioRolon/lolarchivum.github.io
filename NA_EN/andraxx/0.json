In the days following, I was banned for MMR Boosting, (or rather my account being compromised and accessed back in February). I promptly went to submit a ticket on this not only because I felt it was a wrongly placed ban, but it happened to kick me out of the match I currently was playing. What timing! \r\nSo, they banned my account for activity on my account back in February, claiming it was used for mmr boosting even though I was the only one playing ranked matches at that point and climbing out of bronze and into silver. I didn&#039;t get to gold until March. The person who helped my case was understanding and couldn&#039;t exactly point out what my account was being used for at that time, so because of a lack of evidence and probable cause, they lifted my ban and allowed my account to receive rewards again, and I know this because I promptly went into a match and got an S token for Jayce, which I needed to get level 6 Mastery. \r\nFoward two weeks and after not being on for when they sent out the rewards, because I was at an anime convention, I come back to find I didn&#039;t get my season rewards. Again, I submitted a trouble ticket and get my case re-examined, by a different person of course, and they concluded that since the person who helped me in my original case wasn&#039;t a &quot;player behavior specialist&quot; that they were not qualified to look at my account for the MMR Boosting case and tell me that my account was compromised. This person also explained to me that they are going to re-ban my account for this claim that was already decided to be inconclusive and that I won&#039;t be getting my season rewards. I feel I&#039;ve been wronged and that not only has my effort to get gold for the season felt completely wasted, but I feel that the claim was completely and utterly unjustifiable given that the only thing they could tell, was that my account was compromised in febuary and that there is no solid evidence of foul play on my account. I&#039;m not sure what I&#039;m hoping will happen by posting here, but hopefully someone can read my experience with all this useful or something. Idk. I am open to some feedback and maybe get a better understanding of all this, because the player support sure hasn&#039;t helped me a while lot in making me understand all of this.","replies":[{"poster":"mirageofpenguins","date":"2016-11-16T19:58:00.196+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya Andraxx,\n\nJust jumping in here to confirm that your account was boosted voluntarily, you definitely weren't compromised.   Roughly 65% of your ranked games came from a separate location earlier this season (just a few thousand miles away), and because you were simultaneously teleporting home to play a few normals (or to check the status of your boost), it starts to look more than a little obvious. Your booster took you from Bronze II to Gold III, and was ultimately responsible for all of your MMR gains this season (the games you played afterwards to avoid decay resulted in a demotion to Gold IV).  Now even if you had been compromised (and your attacker decided to give the account back after achieving that fresh border), I'm sure you can see how awkward it would be to award you for someone else's efforts.\n\nDeep Terror Nami is correct: your case was assigned to the inappropriate queue (account recovery instead of player behavior), and while I'm not going to resuspend you or anything, it wouldn't really be fair to give you rewards this season.  I wish you the best of luck in your future ranked endeavors, but remember that if you try this again, the result will be a league-based vacation [lasting approximately one century](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204168430-MMR-Boosting-Detection#h3).","replies":[{"poster":"Andraxx","date":"2016-11-16T20:28:22.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":13,"body":"Voluntarily?

Players are required to keep their account information secure, so when their account is compromised they are usually held responsible for what's done with the account.\n\nYou will need to respond to your ticket and continue discussing it with your player behavior specialist if you still have concerns, but if the account was being boosted (whether with your knowledge or without) it's unlikely they'll change the decision.\n\nYou said you were the only one playing the account, but I'm seeing a dramatic change in performance coinciding with an uncharacteristic champion pool change; for the most part you play Darius top with an average win rate, but it switches to Caitlyn and a few others for a couple days with an astronomical win rate, then goes right back to average Darius games. At a glance, this is highly indicative of boosting. While there's no way I could prove it, Riot has the raw game data and IP information that would.","replies":[{"poster":"Andraxx","date":"2016-11-16T19:05:41.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"So let me get this straight, because I switched up where I played and the champions I picked and my win rates with them i my account was flagged as MMR Boosting and thus banned for it? \n\nI will say, yes I main Darius top. He's extrmely fun to play, but I do have a wide range of champions and roles I have played, seeing as how I was a mid main for a good portion of the previous season, and taking up adc and jungle throughout playing normals, I tried my hand at those roles in a ranked environment. Luck so happened to be in my favor for the win rates and team coordination to pull off the wins. So I kept going until I got to Gold, I then went back and played Darius to get through gold 5 and into gold 3, which I was advanced to due to my perormance, skipping gold 4 and ending in gold 3. So I stopped there, felt happy with what I achieved, and stopped playing ranked until I tried playing someone new.\n\nI would like to see more evidence for the claim, but no one is willing to show me anything other than saying that they can't divulge information. Which throws up a red flag in my mind that maybe there isn't any real evidence. I'm not sure how I can truly prove something like all this other than my match history and my compliance through all this.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-11-16T19:08:04.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't tell me, tell player support.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
