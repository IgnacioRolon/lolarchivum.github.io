When I click on LoL, the only thing that happens is that the LoL icon pops up, if i click on the icon, its background turns dark and I get a message saying \"PVP.net kernel has stopped working.\" And if I let it load instead of clicking over the popped up icon, after a certain time it shows me a message with a title that says \"RADS error\"\r\nI have been looking for a solution for this for 2 days, tried everything I saw in internet, those worked for me earlier though, but this time its not working for me. I tried admin mode, tried changing my dns server address, tried changing compatibility mode, edited system.cfg file. But my client keeps crashing. \r\nPlease, help me. {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2016-10-26T16:02:08.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi I had this issue and the red who replied is probably wrong.\n\nTry:\n\n1) Resetting your router\n\nOr if that doesn't work:\n\n2) Connect to a different WiFi, patch your game, then connect back to your normal internet.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/czvzZ1Y8-patcher-not-working-rads-error-cannot-connect-to-http-server","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-26T15:51:31.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like some setting in your OS has changed, and is blocking the client from launching.
