This move, along with other components of the [NA Server Roadmap](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/WH8doH76-na-servers-and-the-future), should improve connection quality for the vast majority of NA players.","url":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/U0M1AVfO-na-server-roadmap-update-na-server-move-on-825?comment=00d40000","image":"http://i.imgur.com/X1sSlr5.jpg"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any chance we can get update on ISP partnering?  I have AT&amp;T and know that you mentioned that Riot was in talks with them back in August.  I have not noticed any improvements in my connection since the 50 ping drop after the server moved (thank you from KY for that btw) but I still see frequent spikes and packet loss, players in my area also seem to be having issues with Suddenlink which has better ping than ATT but sees so much variance that it is only playing can be a pain .  Any update would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-11-06T22:02:48.238+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We actually are trying to be as pro-active as possible with updates including AT&T.

This is exactly what I was looking for, I have been periodically looking at the forums here checking for an update to the post telling which providers are peered, and had began to fear the talks with ATT had fallen through.  Im a bit embarrassed to admit i didnt even think about looking at the support page for the update.  Thanks again!","replies":[]}]}]}
