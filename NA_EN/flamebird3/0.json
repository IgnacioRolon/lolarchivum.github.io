I usually run Leona jungle these days, as her ganks are SO SCARY! Get Challenging Smite with Cinderhulk and you can actually kill squishies surprisingly easily with the true damage.\n\nThe thing that gives Leona jungle an advantage over Sejuani or Nautilus is that Solar Flare has a much shorter cooldown than Glacial Prison or Depth Charge. This means Leona can ult-gank a lot more often than the other two main jungle tanks. Also, her Sunlight passive in ganks adds unexpected damage to the ganks that opponents won't usually take into account, resulting in them dying because they took more than they were expecting.\n\nI also run Ohmwrecker on her when I jungle. For one, 40% CDR on Leona is a must (Ohmwrecker, Frozen Heart, Locket of the Iron Solari). Second, Ohmwrecker gives her good ability to disengage via Point Runner if she's near a turret (she lacks disengage, so this can be really important). Lastly, Ohmwrecker is godly for tower dives, which Leona excels at already.","replies":[{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2015-04-09T09:55:50.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I basically run smite on every tank champion i own, regardless of position.

This also doesn't factor in how strong Crowstorm is as an engage ability.\n\nThe problem with Fiddlesticks as a tank is that he is relatively squishy compared to other tanks that use Cinderhulk (especially with his lack of scaling MR), and a lot of his engage potential and sustain both need ability power to make really strong, but I think these problems are small enough that the strengths of the idea would work, but work so well that there aren't clear weaknesses.","replies":[{"poster":"flamebird3","date":"2015-04-10T00:55:47.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a hybrid build would work best.

They also have amazing synergy with one another. Twisted Fate's ultimate gives sight of all enemy champions. Nocturne can only ult onto champions he can see. Nocturne's ultimate decreases the sight range of all enemy champions which helps Pantheon \"man leap\" onto enemy's without alerting them with the big giant circle that usually pops up. And Shen just shields them all and makes map presence really strong on your team.","replies":[{"poster":"flamebird3","date":"2015-04-08T02:08:06.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if a Shen/Pantheon/Twisted Fate/Nocturne and maybe a Jinx comp would work?

Shen top, Nocturne Jungle, TF mid, Pantheon support, Jinx ADC... the backdoors would be hilarious! Thanks, this is exactly what I was looking for.\n\nNot a problem. You can also substitute Jinx with either Ezreal, Ashe or Draven since they all have global ultimates. And Shen also functions in the support role as can twisted fate. And Shen and pantheon can jungle as well, so the team is pretty versatile in who goes where. And the setup fills most every role too: Shen is a tank, Pantheon is a bruiser, Twisted Fate is a mage and Nocturne is an assassin.\n\nAnother comp to run is a disengage/peel composition. This is pretty much a keep away setup where it screws over anyone with a gap closer and makes assassins cry. They can't stay around long enough to kill anyone so you can take objectives with relative safety. Xin Zhao, Janna, Tristana, Alistar and Azir are some of the better ones. Lee Sin, Syndra, Anivia, Gnar, Vayne, Thresh, Volibear and Singed also function in being able to do this effectively.\n\nOr one thing that used to work is stealth bombing. It requires Zilean and any champions that can go invisible. Twitch and Shaco are generally the preferred targets since they can get up close without ever getting detected. Great way to screw with your enemy opponents.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJXKUXax17U\n\nEdit: Calbel, the guy who made the video, has some interesting stuff on his channel if you want to try some crazy stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"flamebird3","date":"2015-04-08T20:01:04.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for this!

I think it does, because of the whole Rengar/Orianna thing, but I'm not sure.\n\nIn theory it will work, but Orianna has to be within range of her ball in order for it to stay where you placed it. When you exceed the range the ball appears back on you. So that's kind of why Orianna is so hard, she has to be very excelled at positioning herself and knowing the range of her ball. I've had it happen where I send the ball on someone, they run off ahead and just when I want to use my ult the ball appears back on me. So it will work if Orianna is close enough, but because she has to be a set distance from the ball to keep it in place she broadcasts her plan a little bit. With the stealth bombing there is no range. Idk if you saw one of the pieces of the video but there is a part where you see Twitch turn invisible without any bombs on him. Shen then ults him and when he appears there is a time bomb with 1 second on it and it instantly explodes killing the target. Shen could have been anywhere on the map to make that happen (another reason Shen is a great champion) Zilean can then kill his targets through those means. I thought that was the best play of the video. I never would have thought of that on my own.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hocker","date":"2015-04-09T15:51:26.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"with the heavy bruiser meta right now, there is a curve-ball choice for mid: AP Nasus\nit's hard to figure out...and there needs to be more of an exploration into the match-ups...but AP Nasus could be exactly what you are looking for.\nHe has a long range aoe poke that bursts and then burns anyone in it (equal to the amount of the burst if they are in it the whole time)...AND it shreds armor. \n\nNow envision a team fight.
