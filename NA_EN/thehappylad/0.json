That game my entire team was doing well, we got a ton of early advantages and we had a sizable lead. Everyone on the other team was hard feeding except Vayne. We&#039;re seiging down mid and Vayne isn&#039;t there. We get a pick on Jarvan and its looking great. SUDDENLY, A VAYNE APPEARS BEHIND US. I red smite her, jump on her using rengar ult, I get condemned and 3 shot. Rumble ults her, she tumbles to the side and 5 shots him. Sivir can&#039;t get close cuz of their frontline, but vayne dives right into our team with her stealth that&#039;s up every 2 seconds. And there it is, the ace. Our entire team, completely cucked by a 30 minute Vayne. A champion that cannot be countered by assassins because she beats them at their own game, a champion that cannot be tanked due to her ridiculous true damage, a champion that cannot be locked down due to her constant stealth, and a champion that cannot be kited due to her ridiculous amount of MS towards champs. Where is the counterplay? &quot;Beat her early&quot;. But what if I&#039;m not bot lane? Do I sit there and take it up the ass as I&#039;m unable to carry vs her with any other role despite how far ahead I am? A simple revert to her buffs isn&#039;t enough Riot. With the fall of Lucian and cucking of early game ADCs that used to shit on Vayne due to Ghostblade, Vayne&#039;s early game is difficult to punish, and her late game is UNSTOPPABLE. Maybe you should look into actually making her early game weak again when she&#039;s facing champs that build Infinity Edge instead of Ghostblade. Because as it stands now, the only champ that actually shits on Vayne early is Caitlyn, who literally shits on everybody early game. I've literally never felt so helpless and useless versus ONE CHAMPION.

Sorting out exactly what needs a nerf/tweak (and how that will affect other things) takes time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2016-12-18T01:42:27.325+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dont understand. You said a Vayne appeared ***behind you*** but then Sivir got zoned away from her because of their frontline? How is their frontline going to zone Sivir from Vayne when theyre in the complete opposite direction? Also, why on earth would Rumble drop his ult on a single mobile champion? How is Rumble being an idiot have anything to do with Vayne? Sounds to me like Vayne played well and you guys played it poorly","replies":[]},{"poster":"fuffychan","date":"2016-12-18T01:22:36.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheHappyLad,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=01duHK52,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-12-18T01:18:27.603+0000)\n>\n> Tl;dr im bad\n\nwe know","replies":[]}]}
