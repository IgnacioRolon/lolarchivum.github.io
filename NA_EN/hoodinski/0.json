There is a formula that determines when you earn or lose ribbons that takes in account how many games played vs how often/consistently you are honored.  If you are under this threshold, then you will either not earn a ribbon or be in in risk of losing it.\n\nWhile I cannot give you a hard and fast rule, continue being an upstanding Summoner!  The more you play and get honored, the higher chance you will have of getting one! :)","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-05-09T23:37:59.189+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crests should be a permanent thing unless you get suspended.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-05-09T22:41:40.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure the algorithm is based on the average among all players, and players below level 30 have a MUCH higher chance if giving an honor at the end of the game. I remember when I was leveling my account I was rotating through banners all over the place for different things, but then the instant I hit 30 the honors stopped and the banners soon went away. I suppose I could have immediately stopped being worthy of honors but it felt more like players at 30 just didn't care about giving honors no matter how well you behaved.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-05-09T19:32:19.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You actually need a combination of honors to get the ribbons (except for Honorable opponent, you only need that honor for that ribbon).

Focus on yourself and your gameplay, and game knowledge.  I have a ridiculous ammount ribbons, and for a time was getting honored in varous ones often, and finally got a ribbon.  Then I guess I got reported for something, never was punished, but just getting reported will take it away.\n\nAfter that I stopped giving a damn about it.","replies":[]}]}
