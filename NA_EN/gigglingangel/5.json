If you adjust to having 120% most of the time, then you get smacked with a GW for 50% because the mage tapped you when you were below 40%, you're going to have to GTFO really quick.\n\nMost who suffer from GW at all are ones who are typically a bit squishy to begin with the exception of Nasus and Mundo who sustain at all times. Swain is super squishy, Voli doesn't proc his passive until he's below the Nomicon threshold for GW, Aatrox is squishy as heck, Olaf's entire kit revolves around him being around the threshold that GW is at, Vlad is easy to burst down to 40% just hard to kill after bursting him because of his enormous amount of sustain, and then there's Fiddle.... He's super squishy and only his drain sustains him which is easy to stop with CC regardless.\n\nThe new GW is pretty much a buff and it's even more-so a buff since before you'd grab ignite to be able to have some kind of kill potential on these monstrosities and their disgustingly high amount of sustain, but now you're only reducing their sustain by 40% compared to 50% with ignite, though you can grab an Executioner's Calling I guess and waste a few hundred gold if you're a bruiser since you won't want the finished item given you're going to become a damage sponge later on.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mathbalnase","date":"2015-11-10T20:48:37.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually (substantially more than) 20% less healing reduction (than was previously applied).\n40 / 50 = 0.8\n1 - 0.8 = 0.2","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-11-10T07:51:48.622+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't see how those are \"hidden\" nerfs, tbh.\n\nGW as a whole is being nerfed, so how are those being secretly nerfed?","replies":[{"poster":"GigglingAngel","date":"2015-11-10T08:22:47.681+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=tombdragon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vWW4kIXU,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-11-10T07:51:48.622+0000)\n>\n> I don't see how those are \"hidden\" nerfs, tbh.\n> \n> GW as a whole is being nerfed, so how are those being secretly nerfed?\n\nBecause this is the entire current assembly of those who use Grievous Wounds, and the only reason GW is being nerfed in the first place is because of Executioner's Calling.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-11-10T08:38:42.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"*shrugs*\n\nI still wouldn't call it hidden, though.\n\nMore like... there's a word I'm looking for... er, collateral?
