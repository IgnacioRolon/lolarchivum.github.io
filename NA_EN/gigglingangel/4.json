The main problem is that they keep looking at each nerf in a singular fashion, even when someone's been nerfed more than 5x.\nAnd they aren't all small nerfs, either.  There's been a couple big ones.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JFRANKSTA","date":"2015-02-04T03:58:03.924+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"IKR SO UNPLAYABLE..... oh wait she has 51.6% win rate...... people really need to get over this, sona is still god tier supp and thats not changing anytime soon QQ harder","replies":[{"poster":"Direwolfiez","date":"2015-02-04T04:41:38.400+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"And a pick rate of 7.5%.
