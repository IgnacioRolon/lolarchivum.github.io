I have had that account for almost 7 years now and over that 7 years I have spent a decent amount of money on that game.  Now its just sitting there, do anyone think Riot will unban people like me at some random time? I read somewhere that riot did some experiment about unbanning perma banned players and see how they have reformed.  I feel like perma baning is such a rough punishment, especially since i wasnt using any racist, homophobic slurs and such. My last game, i told somebody they didnt have any brain cells cuz he kept telling me to die and boom instant perma banned.  Ive been toxic before but the worst ive said was along the lines of calling people stupid and bad at the game, and i feel like perma banning should be reserved for people who use racist or homophobic language.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2019-01-09T22:52:00.990+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot does not unban perma'd accounts.

You were perma banned because you have a extensive history of punishments and still chose to not change your ways. You weren't perma'd for one single incident. You were perma'd for a long history of them","replies":[{"poster":"CustomSupremeVL","date":"2019-01-10T05:39:38.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"i was talking about my LAST game, what I said.

You get permabanned by being consistently unpleasant with no evidence of improving your behavior to the standards outlined in the ToS.","replies":[{"poster":"CustomSupremeVL","date":"2019-01-10T08:01:17.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ok you are completely missing my point. fine ignore that last game part.  my point is yeah i still call people bad and stuff, but ever since my 14 day ban, I have stopped being really toxic.

It doesn't matter who started it. It doesn't matter that your behavior could theoretically have been worse. It wasn't good enough, you were warned multiple times, and Riot put a stop to it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-01-09T22:48:57.258+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you break the rules, you get punished according to those rules. \nSorry mate, but that experiment has already ended.

I read somewhere that riot did some experiment about unbanning perma banned players and see how they have reformed\n\nLikely not. Riot is still analyzing the data from the experiment, but I remember reading about that most toxic players had not reformed, and simply went back to their toxic ways once they got their accounts back for use. We will have to wait for Riot's data on the experiment.\n\n>  I feel like perma baning is such a rough punishment, especially since i wasnt using any racist, homophobic slurs and such\n\nTo be honest, you had plenty of chances to change your behavior between punishments and yet you chose not to.\n\n> My last game, i told somebody they didnt have any brain cells cuz he kept telling me to die and boom instant perma banned\n\nYou likely had a 14-day ban previous to this one? After that you don't even need to say anything extremely toxic, that is kind of like standing on thin ice. 14-day ban is the last warning and after that even milder amounts of toxicity/negativity can warrant a permaban. You should've just muted the dude who was telling you to die etc. And the last game only was the nail in your coffin, but your continuous bad behavior was the reason for your permaban.","replies":[{"poster":"TiltaryClinton","date":"2019-01-11T10:30:23.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's insane to make mild negativity warrant a permaban after the 14-day ban.

The 14-day ban literally states that if you still continue to work against the rules, you will be permabanned. People should realize that their actions aren't tolerable, be it minor **or** harsh toxicity.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
