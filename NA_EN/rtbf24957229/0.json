I like the glowing streaks, but they give the impression of movement - that the pose doesn't support.  Maybe something that the sword and gear can cast that glow onto?

A broken utopia that hurts its own people is the very definition of a dystopia.\n\nCaelondia, on the other hand, is a communist dystopia. Yes, Rucks paints it as a wonderful place, but keep in mind that Rucks also created the superweapon that shattered the world and killed an entire continent worth of people. He's not the finest judge of anything.\n\nAs for gameplay, yeah, they're both played from top-down. Bastion is best compared to Zelda in terms of gameplay flow though, while Transistor is basically Devil May Cry where you execute combos by pausing the game into a tactical overlay and inputting commands instead of mashing button combinations. I feel the latter would be more fitting for Ekko because Red's entire thing is that she uses Turn() to speed up her own time and fast-forwards herself through the motions while the world largely cannot keep up.\n\nAdmittance: I own physical collector's editions of both games. I *may* be moderately obsessed with Supergiants' work. >_>","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-05-14T15:25:54.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I cannot fault you for taking such a heavy interest in them, as both games are very good at delivering an enjoyable gameplay experience and fascinating setting to explore, not to mention a rather poignant narrative. I haven't played either, though dearly wish to, as my current funds are uncomfortably tight. However, I have watched walkthroughs from beginning to end, adore Transistor's setting - I love Art Deco - and the soundtracks are some of the most interesting piece I have ever heard.\n\nI agree Ekko's time-based thematic would be more suitable to the tactical engagements of Transistor, in addition to the science fiction elements that borders on magic. Though with the nature of Cloudbank, magic could be more appropriately called programming and executing functions. Not to mention both Red and Ekko have a large, dull-edged blade with a cyan coloration.\n\nBastion fits in with Ekko's overall aesthetic, that being a dark-skinned character with light hair in a scavenged get-up. Really, that is the only reason I suggested Bastion over Transistor, though Transistor fits more closely from a gameplay perspective.\n\nAlso, Tesla Effect said style, not an exact replica, so I took some liberties with his comment.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2015-05-14T14:20:00.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Superb Villain,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=E6IEaHM6,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-05-14T13:42:47.737+0000)\n>\n> It's called Bastion.\n> \n> http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/bastion/images/3/3c/The_Kid.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110729210206\n\nSame damn creators and type of gameplay.
