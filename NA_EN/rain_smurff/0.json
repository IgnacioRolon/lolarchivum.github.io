I was thinking Fiora, but...she seems really hard.\n\nTake vlad, max Q, Get wota, cdr boots, a visage, with a rylis if you are taking a ton of damage Q farm. However, if you are able to stay fully healed use Q to harass the enemy. 1/2 the time it works to the point where you can get a level or two advantage.  The other half of the time, you just need to use Q to sustain and not have to go b, until the enemy runs out of mana. \n\nI personally prefer scaling hp yellows and per level ap for all of my other runes.  I also take tank masteries with the mastery that gives 300 hp (It also gives alot of hp late game on cannons and ect... that die near you). You should get pretty tanky, and still have quite a bit of damage. To finish off my build I normally take a combination of zhonyas, dcap, ludens, void staff or liandris torment, and any other ap/hp item. \n\nJust a warning, warmogs is sort of a newb trap, I'd also suggest keeping e maxed at your 4 stacks after level 5 or so. The build puts you near 3-4k hp, and 600-800ish ap if you finish it out with a Dcap. BTW if you do take all scaling per level you will have a \"fun\" early game, but your late game is pretty amazing.
