While a set of traceroutes logs are usually required to complete a full investigation, there are some steps that can be taken before that. Often times a number of local settings can influence these changes in latency, and our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) addresses the most common changes that can be made to improve your connection.\n\nIf you continue to high latency after working through the connection guide, hit me up.
