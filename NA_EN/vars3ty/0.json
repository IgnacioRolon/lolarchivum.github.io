When I was out and about I decided to buy a visa card, you might ask... Why didn't you buy a regular league card? Well, I wanted to give $5 of RP to my friend so he would finally have enough $ for the Kayn Bundle. After he got his $5 of RP(yes he got his RP), I used the same card to get another $15 worth of RP(ON MY ACCOUNT, REMEMBER THIS). Next to my surprise my card was \"declined\". I was confused because just a minute ago, my friend purchased from the same card. I was confused, so I decided to make this support thread, https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/30976964?page=1 . As you can see, I provided all of the evidence I had that my account did NOT receive RP(he even said it himself). Not only this, but instead of my account that was supposed to get charged, MY FRIENDS ACCOUNT got charged... Riot? Not only did neither of us recieve RP but there is nothing we can do about it. \r\n\r\nThis should not be happening, yeah, it isn't the end of the world but Riot Support should at least have some sort of requirement to have so I can recieve my RP. Please comment your thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T01:36:48.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm this is a pretty interesting scenario. I went ahead and pulled up your ticket and both of those accounts to see if I could get to the bottom of what happened for you. \n\nFrom what you said here and in your ticket, it sounds like you physically gave the card to your friend so he could get his portion of the RP as opposed to gifting that RP to him. From what we're able to tell, both the $5 for him and $15 for you were charged on his account and subsequently used on his account. You're more than welcome to continue talking with those billing agents to see what could possibly be done, but keep in mind we won't be able to reverse transactions that took place on someone else's account.","replies":[]}]}
