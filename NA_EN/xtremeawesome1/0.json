I have been playing lol since 2013 and have had 40-50ms average each game. Starting last February my ping has been high. It has gotten worse. The last month it is around 250-300ms average but changes a lot and never goes lower than 120. Today my ping was 300-650 and it's very annoying to deal with. I have time warner cable and our internet is really nice. 250 download, 40 upload, 8-12 ping. (I have used Ethernet and wifi) I have reset my router right before games, made sure no devices were even powered on other than my pc. I have used wifi priority programs. The weird thing is that my ping will either be 300ms or 49ms. My games should be around 49 and some of my games have not even hit 50 once. I have tried multiple computers in my house and same results. The thing is that for absolutely no known reason my ping will be high or low. For example, today I played a game with a friend and has 49ms the entire game. We finished and queued up and went into another game within 10 minutes. The next game my ping was 300ms. We can't figure out why my ping is randomly high some games and others it is low. Today I also noticed that when I was in normal blind pick my ping was high, the 3 games in blood moon game mode were at a consistent 49ms. So I'm not sure if normal blind pick games could be the problem. So my question is, does this look like it is my end or riot's end. My friends get this too and it is a high chance of high ping from 7-9pm. Also, I'm a little upset because it seems like you get many complaints about connection all the time yet you seem to refuse or not even consider improving your servers. I know you moved down to Chicago a few years back but riot being a popular company with millions of players yet you can't ensure a good connection with people. And the connection has not really been improved at all for a long time. I may just be overlooking something or this \"improving servers\" thing is much more difficult than I realize. What can I do to fix my connection and what is riot doing in the future and currently to fix their servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-10T18:43:12.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even with a server move, your ping is exceptionally high.  Unless your physical distance is really far away or overseas, some other issue may be causing your network to have trouble reaching our server.  This could even include how your ISP is reaching the game server specifically.  Download [WinmTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a traceroute to 104.160.131.1.  Even if your ISP is solid, you can still have delays by how it gets to us. Run it for a few minutes and let me know what you find.","replies":[{"poster":"XtremeAwesome1","date":"2017-02-13T05:42:48.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for responding.
