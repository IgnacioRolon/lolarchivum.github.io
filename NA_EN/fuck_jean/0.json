The basic breakdown of events is \r\n1.) lost a bet to a friend and had to send a mystery gift to him in order to settle it \r\n2.) opened the gifting center and clicked on his name (420x...) \r\n3.) Clicked on the red \"Purchase RP\" button, purchased $5 worth. \r\n4.) I'm still on the same page for mystery gift, which I had selected for my friend. \r\n5.) I clicked to purchase the mystery gift and confirmed it. \r\n6.) \"Congratulations, you just sent a Rammus skin to 'AsianWes...'\"\r\n\r\nI omitted the endings of their usernames for privacy purposes. Although they were somewhat close on a top-down list, there was still a good 3 friends between them, and I know I clicked on the correct user. What can I do? The support tickets don't have an option for refunds. How likely is it that I will even get a refund if I do submit it under a different category? It's kinda upsetting that I just wasted $5 on a technical error that I had no control over.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-23T03:03:44.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't make any promises, but if you reach out in a [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (first category is fine) and provide a link to this boards post within the ticket, we'll see what we can do.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues submitting your ticket.","replies":[]}]}
