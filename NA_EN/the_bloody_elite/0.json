Seems to be happening when you leave the runes page and then save outside of Runes. To get it to stop playing, go back into Runes, click a page and then exit. It should stop playing! I'm working on getting a fix for this ASAP!\n\nEdit - looks like we can piggyback the fix for this when we do a patch for when we find something else that is inevitably broken with all the new Runes stuff that went out. In the meantime, what I wrote above should be a way to stop the ambience! Really sorry about it :/","replies":[]}]}
