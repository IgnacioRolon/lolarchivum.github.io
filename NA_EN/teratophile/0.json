It doesn&#039;t happen with any other champion I play or any other Zyra skin, only Haunted Zyra.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-02-06T21:51:32.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi hi! \n\nAs Dunkin Darius said, you may need to do a client repair. You can do so by: \n\n* Open the League of Legends Launcher.\n* Click the Gear button to open the Settings menu.\n* Click the \"Repair\" button. The repair process will take about 30-60 minutes.\n\nIf you're still having this issue, lemme know! \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joseph Gladstone","date":"2017-02-03T02:05:00.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"try repairing your game","replies":[]}]}
