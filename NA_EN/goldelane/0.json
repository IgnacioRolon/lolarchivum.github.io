I had this clan for almost a year and no problem with anybody. I recently got banned on my main account for 2 weeks because i was toxic, as i am trying to reform currently, and then i ask a rioter kindly to transfer ownership from the banned account to another account of mine. The rioter then says that he has transferred ownership to an account of mine, and then he temporarily BANNED that account because this name was \"offensive\". I have never ever been told that it was offensive by any riot employee as they have changed the ownership of that clan for me DOZENS OF TIMES! This rioters name is \"sprinklefloof\". I kept telling him what he wanted to change in the clan name. I tried the name League of Fougles because it sounded similar to my old name and then he said that name means lewd! What the hell does that even mean!? He then proceeds to say if i continue to joke around he will close the ticket AND MAKE THAT ACCOUNT REMAINED BANNED. How could someone do this to me? All i asked was to change ownership from one account to another account of mine? I can send pictures or other information for proof if needed.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-26T21:13:27.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would like to take a look into what happened in full here.

The problem that i emailed riot support about was fixed, but i had to change my club name that I've had for more than a year and i had to wait 2 days until they unbanned my temporary banned account unannounced.  The rioter thought i was \"joking\" of some sort, and i could tell that he didn't take anything i said seriously because i was banned before.","replies":[]}]}]}
