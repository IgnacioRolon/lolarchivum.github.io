He probably doesn't have a history of it occurring. Dunkey flaming during the game didn't help his case. You gotta learn to mute idiots and just bit your tongue. :/ \nYou reacting to the troll is just as bad as the troll trolling. You're gonna end up tilting the team even harder and destroy any solidarity you could muster from being positive.

Since you haven;t had a troll team that means that others cant complain that riot basically allows this to happen but as soon as you call someone a retard you get insta banned because its \"toxic\" Even if his morals for this video are whiny it doesnt really matter. The rest of everything else he said is 100 percent true. Nothing in the video minus him whining about being banned and him asking to get unbanned is false. Riot actually cares so little about the fanbase its unreal.\n\nDunkey is ~~an asshole~~ a very toxic person. That's all I can say about him as an individual... And no I didn't say he couldn't complain about a troll team but that wasn't the crux of his video.  This video was about him being salty as hell about being banned. I don't see a full troll team often... it's like every 1 in 100 games maybe. Sure it's a problem but it's no reason to flame during the game. \n","replies":[{"poster":"Archener","date":"2015-09-12T21:51:12.148+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":18,"body":"> Dunkey is an asshole\n\nReported\n\nOn a serious note, I didn't defend dunkey, im just saying, lyte should have tackled the feeder problem FIRST, then done work on toxic people.\n\nAnd no, being toxic will never be equal to trolling a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Loken Stoneheart","date":"2015-09-12T22:02:23.998+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Archener,realm=NA,application-id=EBBIvmVK,discussion-id=3EuXAq9A,comment-id=000d00000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-09-12T21:51:12.148+0000)\n>\n> Reported\n> \n> On a serious note, I didn't defend dunkey, im just saying, lyte should have tackled the feeder problem FIRST, then done work on toxic people.\n> \n> And no, being toxic will never be equal to trolling a game.\n\nToxicity in chat is super easy to punish because it's text based proof.\n\n\"Feeder\" problems are incredibly complex.

In regards to the troll, it's awful people get away with that, but attacking them like that is so wrong it doesn't begin to cover for it. Get pissed, yell, scream, shout, FUCKING BREAK SOMETHING, but don't do something you know you'll get shit for and try to turn it around, toxicity is bad and so is trolling, trolling toxic people and being toxic to trolls is like a dog chasing it's tail; not gonna get anywhere, and you'll end up biting your own ass.\n\nSo much this.\n\nAnd here's the thing: I LOVE playful banter, which some people call \"shit-talking.\" It honestly makes the game more fun for me, because I like to brag a little, and it's OOHH so satisfying to shut down the guy who spams the mastery emote every kill he gets, then play your own mastery emote.\n\nBut you have to do it in a way that's respectful of the fact that not everybody is ok with that. So you want to spam champion mastery emote when you get a kill? OK. Do it when you die, too. It's a funny bit of irony that lightens the tone for everybody. If you want to say say \"outplayed\" in all chat, try this instead: \"Outplayed?\" It does two things:\n\n1. It feels just as good to say, but feels less like gloating to the other team.\n2. It invites a response from the other team that's NOT \"fuck you\" or something. It gives you the chance to observe how they respond. If they respond well, you can keep up the banter. If they don't say anything or are obviously annoyed that you said that, you can stop saying it in all chat.\n\nThe point is, it's possible to have banter that's still friendly. There's no excuse for toxicity.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Archenz","date":"2015-09-12T21:23:22.217+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":10,"body":"I checked the malphite. Hes still feeding!

Hes said the game's no longer fun, he's tired of it. He's tired of the people that play it, and the company that runs it. And frankly I agree with nearly everything he said. I don't play this game because it's fun, I play it out of habit. A habit formed over four long years of watching it deteriorate. And sometimes you just have to drop a bad habit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crate of Cobras","date":"2015-09-12T23:17:17.894+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":6,"body":"Let's break this down real quick, Dunkerz.\n\n1. You say you don't have fun playing the game anymore. That isn't Riot's fault, frankly. Every reason you listed comes down to subjective preference, and many players enjoy the chesslike laning phase. Comebacks happen far more often than you give credit for. While the game is not Street Fighter, the game clearly has enough depth and nuance to let the great players climb - else we wouldn't see the same people in Diamond+ every season.\n\n2. You say you don't deserve the ban. I'm sorry, but the code that YOU agreed to CLEARLY states that verbal abuse is wrong and a bannable offense. What, are you the kind of guy who goes to another country and refuses to respect their rules because \"lol 'Murica?\" Fuck that. Malphite should be banned, obviously, but your ban is still upheld - not to mention you've witchhunted via Twitter and on Youtube, which is also bannable. Sorry, you're in the wrong 100%. \n\n3. You're their number 1 promoter? Possibly, for the young and toxic demographic of this game. Many other successful League Youtubers actually exhibit positive qualities, while you remain one of the only truly toxic ones. I guess it speaks to the quality of the game, if nothing else that you mentioned does, that you've been allowed to be toxic for so long. You get people to play the game - great. But what do you want Riot to do? You go against the summoner code. They CANNOT promote you. They just can't - it's a conflict of interests.\n\n4. You decide after so much work to throw in the towel like a fucking screaming child because you didn't get your way. Tough luck, get some backbone. You're wrong in almost every way in this video, and just leaving doesn't really do much. People are already into League, you've already paid your money. You're like the kid who quits WoW and leaves a teary post in the forums that everyone laughs at. You know, it does kinda suck that you're leaving, but there's more than just you now.\n\nGet off your high horse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bergk","date":"2015-09-12T20:29:25.666+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":9,"body":"RIP Dunkey, your league of legends videos always made me laugh.
