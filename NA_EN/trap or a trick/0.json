In the current system, you can only watch full replays for matches that occurred within your match history, so find the match from there and play it. Once you're actually viewing the replay, you can record just the Pentakill with a *Highlight*, which can then be viewed in most players and will be stored in **C:\\Users\\Documents\\LeagueofLegends\\Highlights**.\n\nI hope this helped.

That said, the first thing I should mention is that we&#x27;re aware Match History only displays the last 20 matches, and are actively exploring ways to make that a better experience.\n> \n> In the meantime, I can shed some light on a super manual &amp; janky way to watch .rofls _(from the current patch(es) only)_ that may work.  The instructions are really long and will require a ton of clicks, but it&#x27;s the best we can do for now.  Longer term, better, solutions are being explored (like the one above), but it&#x27;s too soon to go in depth of those. \n> \n> Ready?\n> \n> Here we go:\n> \n> 1. Locate the .rofl in C:\\Users\\MrBurnaby\\Documents\\League of Legends\\Replays\n> 2. Select the .rofl you want to open from step 1 and hit &#x27;ctrl+c&#x27; (copy)  \n> _[ This should copy something like the following to your clipboard C:\\Users\\MrBurnaby\\Documents\\League of Legends\\Replays\\NA1-2247576397.rofl ]_\n> 3. Navigate to the most recent deploy of the build where the rofl was captured (e.g. C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\solutions\\lol_game_client_sln\\releases\\0.0.1.152\\deploy\n> 4. Find the LoL application and create a shortcut\n> 5. Right-click the shortcut, select properties, then paste the copied rofl to the end of the target name (e.g. C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\solutions\\lol_game_client_sln\\releases\\0.0.1.152\\deploy\\League of Legends.exe&quot; &quot;C:\\Users\\MrBurnaby\\Documents\\League of Legends\\Replays&quot;)\n> 6. Apply and OK\n> 7. Double click the LoL shortcut to launch the replay!\n> \n> _(be **careful** as syntax matters a ton in step 5... the space between &quot;the path of the latest executable&quot; and &quot;the path to the .rofl,&quot; the two sets of &quot;&lt;executable&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;.rofl&gt;&quot;, etc.)_\n> \n> _(also, the location of the .exe will change patch to patch, so this path won&#x27;t work forever)_\n> \n> Hope this helps.","replies":[]}]}]}
