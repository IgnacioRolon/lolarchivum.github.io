I'm level 30 now, I've improved so much, I carry every game, but I still lose a bunch. Its like I'm never good enough in the eyes of my team, everyone blames me for something I've overseen. Like I didn't do this, or I didn't focus that, I could ward the whole damn map and still be told I'm crap, but if I ever complain about my teams hurtful actions, then I just hear ''REPORT HIM FOR VERBAL HARRASMENT!''. Its like every single day, I'm eating the blame, they abuse me and nothing ever eases the pain. Every day I get told that I'm feeding my lane, so don't hate me if I end up leaving the game, Maybe one day, My team will treat me better, Signed sincerely, Your biggest fan ever","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-11-06T19:59:25.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is going to sound somewhat hurtful and maybe even counter intuitive, but hear me out. When you hear someone blame you for something think about what you could have done better. Even if it is just pinging, or maybe having put a ward somewhere a minute earlier, or maybe not putting a ward somewhere so you would have had a charge now.\n\nDo it anything you think may be negative happens to anyone. What could you have done? Winning games isn't about carrying your team, it is about working with your team. One thing I have noticed helps me win games a lot is that when I get ahead early game I try to allow my teammates to get the kills whenever possible. Don't miss kills for your team for it, but try to let others get as much gold as possible, cause if you are ahead all you need is the assist gold to stay ahead. Don't try to get even further ahead, make your team get further ahead.\n\nEven if you think your teammates are bad and it would be a waste of gold giving it to them, it often isn't. I have had people that would do the dumbest stuff, but as soon as I spoon fed them some gold they started pulling off stuff that I never thought they would be capable of. A lot of it is based on morale.\n\nI have been on the other end of that too, where I was in a totally winnable game where we were even or maybe ahead as a team, but I was behind by a lot and felt worthless. I wanted to give up, and my morale was low so I did not perform as well. Then when I grouped with my team and started seeing how well we were as a group (because if I am trying to be a group that makes the chances of my team performing well together higher than my opponents' statistically) it helped me play better.\n\nAnyway, good luck in your future endeavors.","replies":[{"poster":"Trap or a Trick","date":"2016-11-06T20:14:45.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey bro, sorry for the late reply, I was in the I just wanted to send a thank for the advice, ill play another game, tell you how it goes, ill try not to leave aswell!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alpha Samsuni","date":"2016-11-06T19:58:09.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to \nhttp://elitegamingcomputers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/lol.jpg","replies":[]}]}
