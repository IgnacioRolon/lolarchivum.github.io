This is happening since the beginning of this season.\n\nIt does not matter where I am... in the client, in spectator mode, or in the match...Bug Splat window pop out and then shows the Maestro Error message.\nIf I'm in the middle of the game, it continues. But when it's over, I have to open the game again, because the Client is closed.\n\nOne detail that I think is worth mentioning, the open LoL contains 4 .exe processes running: LoLClient.exe, LolLaucher.exe, Lolpatcher.exe and rads_user_kernel.exe.\nI realized that Lolpatcher.exe and LolLaucher.exe closes in the moment that bug splat window appears, and I get Maestro Error about 4 seconds later. \n(If I close them manually, I get the same Maestro Error).\n\nThings I've already tried:\n\nReinstall the game (5 times with cleaning install)\nReinstall Windows 10\nFormatted my PC\nAllow all LoL executables in Windows Firewall\nDisabled the firewall, including the Windows Firewall Service.\nInstall LoL in another folder.\nPut all executables LoL in compatibility mode with Windows Xp, 7 and 8.\nPut to run All LOL .exe in Administrator mode\n\nAnd all things form TROUBLESHOOTING CONNECTION ISSUES\n\n\nThe bug splat log shows this:\n\nLoLPatcher caused ACCESS_VIOLATION in module LoLPatcher\n\nWrite to location 706f0e90 caused an access violation.\n\nUser Information: \nUser Name: ablon \nComputer Name: PC-RENAN\n\nSystem Information: \n6 processor(s), type 586. \n35% of memory in use. \n8189M total physical memory. \n5287M free physical memory. \n12189M total paging file. \n9136M free paging file. \n2047M total virtual memory. \n1896M free virtual memory.\n\nProcess Memory: \n1896M free. \n54M reserved. \n97M commited. \nLargest free block is 1289M.\n\nPageFaultCount: 29267 \nPeakWorkingSetSize: 34M \nWorkingSetSize: 34M \nQuotaPeakPagedPoolUsage: 0M \nQuotaPagedPoolUsage: 0M \nQuotaPeakNonPagedPoolUsage: 0M \nQuotaNonPagedPoolUsage: 0M \nPagefileUsage: 23M \nPeakPagefileUsage: 25M\n\nPlz, help me.\n\nP.S.

BugSplat errors point to some sort of hardware/software problem with League of Legends (a generic crash if you will).  However, a Maestro error is something that PvP.net (the client) uses to make sure that you are properly connected to our servers.  Maestro is primarily used with the client, which is why LoLLauncher.exe (the client), closes when you experience this issue.\n\nIt seems that you have tried a lot of steps already, so make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
