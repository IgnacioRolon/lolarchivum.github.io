I can patch and play on PBE just fine which is odd, and have been told that eventually running the patcher it will just work. However as it's downloading the entire patch every time and I have limited bandwidth, I was hoping there's a prepatched client kicking around somewhere. I'm fairly sure that the issue is having to install the entire game anew and I shouldn't have a problem afterwards, the problem is getting an install of the game at all right now.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-10T00:08:22.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you may find some 3rd party or player-to-player full installations of League, there is no official way to get a pre-patched version downloaded at once.  The only way to download it fully is to let the patcher do its thing.  I know that this isn't the answer you were looking for, but I hope the info helps!","replies":[]}]}
