I&#039;d actually like to use one just to see how it works. I mean i know what they do but I don&#039;t actually know anything about the program&#039;s relationship with the player. Does the program just override what the player is doing because the program is better? Is the player like a backseat driver at that point? I really want to know how it works, not because I intend to cheat personally. I find games with built in cheats and things well cheating. It&#039;s a lot less satisfying to play a game with cheats and it just gets boring. Anyway if anyone can tell me what exactly a program does in relation to the player that&#039;d be great.","replies":[]}
