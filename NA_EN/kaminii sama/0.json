Confused, dazed, and alone, she wandered until she came upon a small village, it's human residence feared her for her pale, almost undead, appearance and black wings which sprouted from her lower back. She became a rumored \"undead demon\", and was only treated with cruelty, making the girl feel more alone and hated. She sobbed and ran away from the town, black feathers being plucked from her wings by children who tried to catch her.  Soon she found herself in another village, tired and hungry, she wandered in despite her fears. In the town, she found Yordles. She found herself close to Bandal City. Despite the residences being wary of her, she was able to stay at an inn for a night. The next day, a band of thieves raided the town, and Usha found herself trying to protect the innocents as they ran. Although she was unable to scare off the thieves and protect everyone, she was able to keep them from running as Teemo and his scouts captured the criminals. The Swift Scout spoke to Usha of the League of Legends, and how her memories may come back to her if she were to go there. \nNow with a new found sense of friendship with the Yordles, she comes to fight in the League with Teemo's recommendation in order to find  her origins. Why does she have an unusual wand? Why does she seem to radiate and manipulate this dark energy that everyone fears? What exactly is this girl who calls herself Usha? With more questions than she can answer, and with her unique and flexible fighting style, summoners help her find her path through the darkness to the dawn.\n\n*\"I may be in darkness now, but if i brave the darkness and follow the path of twilight, I will find my way to dawn.\"* - Usha\n\n**Passive - Wand of the Shadow Isles**\nWith each spell cast, her wand will shape-shift to a different weapon with various effects, which will last for five seconds.

Long, curly black hair, messy as all hell, ripped and worn gothic lolita clothing, and pale skin, almost ghostly in appearance. She is supposed to be young, but still older than Annie, so she would appear to be about 16 or 17, and she wears a single black ring on her right middle finger. Her wand is dark oak and in the shape of a finger, like Bellatrix LaStrange's wand.\n\nFeel free to comment and provide constructive criticism!","replies":[{"poster":"WzqdQsZwQA","date":"2015-01-18T11:49:07.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Kaminii Sama","date":"2015-01-23T06:13:39.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well I would characterize her better was I able to come up with quotes. She's meant to be someone who is often misunderstood, and often willing to fight for those who turn away from her looks and accept her. Her personality is that of a normal teenager, if not a bit more childish.","replies":[{"poster":"WzqdQsZwQA","date":"2015-01-28T19:28:06.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Kaminii Sama","date":"2015-01-29T13:43:03.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ill make a digital image of the champion if i can","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dest√≠num","date":"2015-01-18T11:31:37.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The scalings are kind of a mess to be honest. What kind of items are you meant to buy on this champion, and what role is it supposed to fulfill? What's it's play pattern meant to be like? Right now, I feel like this is just a Sona with a Nautilus Q and kind of a Kayle E.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaminii Sama","date":"2015-01-23T05:52:04.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point is for her to be able to take any and all roles, a jack of all trades. Although she has no role she excels at. Sure she can go support, but then it burns her AOE, keeping it from doing much in a team fight until later levels. Sure she can jungle, but then her inability to chase pre-6 due to her low mobility can destroy her. She can go tanky top, but then lacks the ability to keep pressure in lane. She can go hybrid carry or hybrid mid, but then the low health and low mobility can compromise her early game.\nBuild all health, ap, and ad, well you are good in team fights, but lack potential split pushing and can be focused easily\nShe is meant for hard snowballing late game\n\nHer build is completely Dependant on the role you choose for her.\n\nI would probably play her as jungle, rushing chilling smite with HP enchantment and getting boots of swiftness\nAfterwards I'd rush triforce and get hextech gunblade soon after. Afterwards I'd change the build according to the enemy team, probably focusing on health with a bit of ap and ad if they aren't building resistances, id build penetration if they are going tanky.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaminii Sama","date":"2015-01-23T06:05:04.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, think of her E like Jinx's rockets. They do normal damage, but acts as an AOE, although I decided that it would damage nearby enemies the instant she pulls out the new weapon, it is that that scales off ap. Because I decided to include that effect, the I decided to decrease the AOE damage on her basic attacks. They basic attacks still act as physical damage, but it applies spell effects instead of on hit effects, so spell vamp works with this skill, but life steal doesn't. This can make her a hybrid carry if you increase her attack speed, making it a strong harass tool if your enemy is by minions or tower, despite her range remaining unchanged.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaminii Sama","date":"2015-01-23T06:09:55.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A strong laning combo with her is to hook them, use her E, then ult to chase them. If an enemy comes to gank, shield and hope you have enough CDR to last the next few seconds to either hook the running enemy again, or hook terrain for a quick escape.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
