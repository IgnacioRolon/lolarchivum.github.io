For example, NA currently only support English while EU may have quite a few more.  You can check out our [language ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751594-Changing-Game-Language)guide for a list of supported languages.  We don't support modifying game files to make your own language packs, so trying to do that is at your own risk and may cause problems.

But hey, let's rather have some more skins than full language support so that more players could enjoy this game :^) (Oh, I know there are two different departments, was just a satire as how any other department than the graphic design and sometimes the balance team is doing next to nothing to improve playing experience)","replies":[]}]}]}
