The name should be well available by now (the account is level 13)\n\nI made a ticket about this and this is what a rioter told me to do.\n\n\"I understand you cannot tell me exactly when. But then should you not change the article or something?Because I understand it, and according to it. The name should be available is what i am saying\"\n\n\"Greetings Summoner,\n\nThank you for the suggestion! I completely understand that you were misled by the information on the article. Unfortunately, we don't handle the editing here, nor are we able to pass feedback reports directly to the development team, but I recommend posting to the Boards. The team is always looking at the Boards to get a feel for what parts of the game or website players think could be improved.\"\n\n\n\"MATHS IS NOT MY STRONG POINT. COULD YOU MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW INACTIVITY PROTECTION IS CALCULATED?\nLevels 1-6: 6 months of inactivity immunity\nLevel 12: 1 year of immunity\nLevel 20: 1 year, 8 months of immunity\nLevel 30: 2 years, 6 months of immunity\" Is what it says in the article\n\n\n The article is wrong and needs revision.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2016-05-04T21:47:23.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ill,\n\nThanks for reaching out here. As far as I'm aware, the system should be working properly, but I'm working with a colleague to look into this further in case there's a hiccup in it that we weren't aware of.\n\nJust so I have all the context on this interaction with the Summoner Name Clean Up system; when you gave the Summoner Name, how did you do so? Also, when you tried to reclaim the Summoner Name, did you try to do it by getting a Name Change or by trying to claim it on a new account?\n\nKeep in mind that new accounts cannot claim cleaned up Summoner Names.","replies":[{"poster":"Get out of town","date":"2016-05-04T23:52:56.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I gave it just by changing to another one.
