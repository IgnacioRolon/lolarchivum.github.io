You can take the healing mines and a Censer too, but due to Seeker sometimes making it hard to heal with the mines you're not the primary healer. Or don't take healing at all and go for Refresher instead and more AP. Anyway, you don't have enough room for Morello+Sorc shoes so take a Void Staff instead, I think.\n* 1 tank: improved Satchel for max CC, with max CDR, Abyssal Mask, and generic Tank items. You don't need AP thanks to Daredevil to still deal damage, but it's not your main goal.\n\nIt works super well, is easy to play, and solves both the \"5 same champs\" and the \"Ziggs/Sona only\" missions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sixpewl","date":"2018-09-17T23:01:23.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please add me, I have 3 Aug and sona/ziggs missions","replies":[]},{"poster":"JThunder","date":"2018-09-17T22:56:32.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i added you (Jthunder)","replies":[]},{"poster":"BLÃ–WJOBS","date":"2018-09-17T22:53:12.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you have discord add me: AGGRESSIVE JIZZER#2844","replies":[]}]}
