This is becoming fairly frustrating, and has been going on for a week or two now. I'm hoping this is a temporary issue, and there's a fix that either Riot is working on or one that I can do myself. Any help and/or suggestions are greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-15T17:17:18.679+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"There were some issues with clubs after a recent outage, and a solution has since been found.
