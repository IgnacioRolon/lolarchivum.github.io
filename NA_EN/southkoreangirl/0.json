They've said so.  Players cannot use any software to give them that much of an edge.  As you've said, it's fairly easy for them to detect if they are being used, and as it is a gameplay offense (and not a behavioral/chat offense) the first punishment is at minimum a 14 day suspension.  \n\n[Rioter response #1](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/12keEMzp-are-macros-against-the-summoners-code-andor-tos)\n\n[Rioter response #2](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/OvYEokpp-are-macros-considered-cheating)\n\n[Reference thread on third party program macros](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/5dmkJinG-3rd-party-applicationsmodifications-whats-allowed-and-what-isnt?comment=0053)","replies":[{"poster":"TwinkiePro","date":"2017-06-27T23:57:25.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh cool, thanks for the links.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SIut of AD","date":"2017-06-27T18:21:13.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"They ban you because instead of wasting time playing League as an adult, you should take care of your family.","replies":[{"poster":"SouthKoreanGirl","date":"2017-06-27T22:33:02.135+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SIut of AD,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=N0yPz370,comment-id=0013,timestamp=2017-06-27T18:21:13.298+0000)\n>\n> They ban you because instead of wasting time playing League as an adult, you should take care of your family.\n\nAt least I have a family to take care of instead of  wasting my life flaming strangers online.
