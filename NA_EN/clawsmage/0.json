I clicked and clicked and the timer continued to drain. Eventually it got to zero, froze at zero for a while and then I went back to home screen. I tried to load another game and now I'm stuck in low priority queue, what the hell is that? I need to play 5 games with this low priority queue now because of a server issue?
