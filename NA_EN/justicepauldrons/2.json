I always loved the guy and thought his playstyle, aesthetic and theme were cool and I have usually been content with as much. But quite frankly I losing my hope in this demacian paragon of badassery. I am not sure if I am just having an off day or if how little he can compete in the high moblity, high burst meta is just starting to get to me but I was recently playing a match with my diamond friends and I have never before felt so useless in a match and it really showed me how weak he is competitively. \n\nHe just flat out has nothing he can do if he isn&#039;t fed. In a situation where Garen did not receive early game advantages he has absolutely no power throughout the rest of the game. His E, while powerful early on quickly loses damage as people start dealing more damage each second to compete. Later game you would deal nearly as much damage with an auto. With almost anyone else I can say \"well steamrolling isn&#039;t an option, guess I have to X instead\" but that just isn&#039;t an option with Garen. Usually when playing a bruiser you feel that your secondary role is as an offtank or initiator. As a tank he has no way to protect and peel for his team due to his lack of crowd control, and as an initiator he has no way of getting into a fight without burning flash or attempting to run straight at them. \n\nTo gives you a better idea of what I am talking about I am going to run through what other similar bruisers can do in the situation where they can&#039;t just steamroll a match.  \n\n{{champion:122}} Has hard CC in the form of his pull, allowing him to initiate a fight easily on an enemy out of position. His passive armor shred and potential for burst damage allow him to stay a threat throughout the game even when building tank.\n\n{{champion:92}} Knock aside, shield, aoe stun and gap closers allow riven to be a monster of an initiator when building health. Her ultimate provides a substantial steroid which empowers her auto attacks, abilities and provides the threat of an aoe execution.\n\n{{champion:75}} Huge threat if left alone, built in battle sustain, substantial slow is a powerful chase and escape tool and ultimate makes him a tougher target while providing  % max health damage in a constant aoe. This allows him to succeed easily as a tank even if he still does suffer from his lack of an initate.\n\nSo looking at these common top bruisers kits I seem to always find myself at a disadvantage if I can&#039;t out trade them. Garen&#039;s lack of crowd control make it impossible for him to stay a relevant threat unless he is already steamrolling because he can&#039;t protect his team. All he has going for him is massive damage potential when that potential is taken away he little more than a sponge that can be ignored. \n\nSomething I feel like I should mention here is I realize Garen&#039;s ultimate is powerful on paper, but considering other bruisers have ultimates that are just as useful against nearly dead targets or can be used multiple times like {{champion:122}} or in an aoe like {{champion:92}} it doesn&#039;t seem all that great. Especially when you consider those champions have it readily available on lower cooldowns.\n\nSo help a guy out here, what place do you think Garen is in right now? What do you like/dislike about him and if you could change anything about him what would it be. It seems obvious to me that he need something, but aside from a lower cooldown ult I can&#039;t really place my finger on what else could be added.\n\nEDIT: Suggestion from a friend discussing this with me, he didn't have any ideas on how to help with peeling seeing as Garen being able to stun would be broken but he did have some suggestions for improving his damage late game without breaking him early.\n\n1. Lower the scalings on Garen's E and add in %health damage. Allowing the skill to remain relevant even if not powerful late game, this would allow it to at least be seen as a threat by fed players and provide more damage than autoattacking against high health targets.\n\n2. Allow Garen to auto attack targets while spinning, this would improve his late game damage but require he sacrifice the mobility of spinning ahead of a target constantly to auto them. This would add a bit of extra power to his early game as well though. If Jax can auto people while spinning his Lamppost above his head, than why can't Garen do it with a sword.","replies":[{"poster":"MarshallBananna","date":"2015-03-27T12:39:37.643+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"He just needs lower CD on his ultimate, which is inexplicably high","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-27T19:25:51.254+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Demacian Justice ( R) cooldown lowered to 120/100/80 from 160/120/80\n\nITS HAPPENING","replies":[{"poster":"MarshallBananna","date":"2015-03-27T20:01:50.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"we cared hard enough and it happened!","replies":[{"poster":"Clarkolas","date":"2015-03-28T23:43:30.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually some pro played it and lost, so the community didnt actually do anything","replies":[]},{"poster":"AbsoluteSadman","date":"2015-03-27T20:41:37.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now can we hope for nocturne ult redu-\n180/140/100 seconds ⇒ 150/125/100 seconds\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH","replies":[{"poster":"Robert Smith","date":"2015-03-27T22:49:02.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And Shen too..... still waiting.

A Garen thread.\n\nBut in all seriousness, as a fellow Garen main I have to say your complaints are off the mark. It's true that Garen brings almost zero utility to a team (silence notwithstanding), but he makes up for it with an incredibly good laning phase, even against the most oppressive top lane picks. The thing is that he *is* a steamroller; if you're locking in Garen in champion select, you're not thinking \"Oh, I'm going to bring a lot to a teamfight,\" you're declaring your intention to stomp your lane and then cut through the enemy carries like butter.\n\nI mean really, he has no power late game? What are you on about, m8? He tanks better than most tanks, and can annihilate squishies with just one damage item. If you ask me Garen is in an incredibly good spot right now.\n\ntl;dr Garen is not an initiator, and he's not a peeler.

But the thing is if we are going to use him as an assassin then why not just bring someone who can do the job better.\n\nI am also not quite sure what your definition of an oppressive top laner is. Darius trades with him quite well even when silenced, Nasus can basically just ignore him to farm and most ranged top laners shut him down completely due to his lack of crowd control and gap closers. He is 100% completely reliant on doing well in the laning phase and even then is susceptible to being kited around like a dumb gorilla with the many slows, stuns and dashes the enemy team will inevitably throw his way.","replies":[{"poster":"KING OF MASKS","date":"2015-03-27T10:21:29.475+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you saying he doesn't have the skillset to do so? He has a free cleanse coupled with a considerable movement speed boost, a W that makes him tankier than the vast majority of the champion pool, allowing him to soak tons of damage while he's on his way to the enemy backline, and an E that does considerable damage itself. And then of course his execute increases kill potential tenfold (doubly so when coupled with Ignite). If we're going to compare him with other assassins, then yes, there are probably champions that do the job better or more reliably than the Garebear. But his style is undeniably unique and fun.\n\nWhen it comes to the \"oppressiveness\" of enemy top laners, it obviously depends on the matchup. Against a Garen, there are certainly a number of champions that I would consider oppressive ({{champion:150}}, {{champion:85}}, {{champion:10}}, or a very good {{champion:80}} just to name a few). With regard to the ones you mention:\n\n1) Darius is gated by mana (you're not), has zero sustain (you have oodles of it), has zero mobility (you have some), and isn't even half as tanky as you. It's true that he can easily outdamage you, but those are four huge advantages that are not difficult at all to exploit. I've never had much of an issue with Garen vs. Darius.\n2) Nasus is an interesting case because while you can easily outtrade him, if you're not careful you will push the lane up to his tower, at which point he will happily farm away and ignore you completely (until you get ganked). There are definitely champions that are more effective at dealing with Nasus.\n\nIt's true that he's somewhat more reliant on doing well during the laning phase than other champions due to his lack of utility, but like I said, that's mitigated by his very strong laning phase. You keep complaining about his lack of CC/gapclose; but the fact is he has a very strong silence and a decent gapclose in the form of his Q. I find these are more than enough for the majority of matchups (excluding the hypermobile champions that you'll occasionally face).\n\nYes, he's very vulnerable to being kited. That's something to consider when picking Garen; does the enemy composition have a shitload of CC and peel? Then you might want to pick another top laner. But having a weakness or two is not the same as being weak.","replies":[{"poster":"JusticePauldrons","date":"2015-03-27T10:30:35.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem with his Q is that while it is a considerable movement speed boost it still requires him running straight at the enemy or relying on ambushing them, if used as a movement speed tool it also has a considerable cooldown for a short burst of movement speed. If you wait to use it as a slow cleanse, that is less time you spend chasing down the enemy and if you are fighting multiple targets or ones with spammable slows/roots/stuns then that burst of speed is nulled immediately. Don't get me wrong, if Garen makes it to the enemy back line he can do some serious harm, but that usually requires him to through the rest of the enemy team to do so and likely burn {{summoner:4}} . \n\n1) On the topic of Darius I don't think I have ever had an experience where a Darius oom'd to the point where he could no longer cast due to his relatively low mana costs and again even in that situation he does heaps of damage with his autos + free shred + bleed. His ult is also not restricted to being used an execute and can make a quick burst of damage appear at any time allowing him to easily gain the upper hand in a fight. His slow + pull also allow him to get easy aid from his jungler by keeping you in position. While I wouldn't consider Darius the hardest lane opponent for Garen, he certainly is able to provide more simply due to the crowd control he provides on top of the comparable damage.","replies":[{"poster":"KING OF MASKS","date":"2015-03-27T10:52:57.492+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Would you rather have a Q that lets Garen zigzag around the enemy before finally hitting them? We're not talking about Shaco here, we're discussing the Might of Demacia. Running straight up to the enemy is part of Garen's MO.\n\nJust because the ability is simple and straightforward doesn't mean you can't use it intelligently or in unexpected ways. Why do you think \"Garen in the bush\" is such a prevalent gag? Because using the brush in combination with his Q is so effective. Waiting for the enemy to use their CC before popping Q is just common sense, and you lose nothing for it. The only way you would lose out in such a scenario is if the enemy second guesses your intentions and simply doesn't throw out their CC at all, forcing you to wade in their direction at normal speed* as you wait for an ability that never comes -- in which case you simply got outplayed. That's not an issue with Garen's Q at all.\n\nLikewise, if you're in a situation where you're being bombarded with multiple layers of CC, that's almost certainly not a problem with the skill. The cleanse isn't meant to be a get out of jail free card.\n\nEdit: With regard to getting to the enemy backline, you should be aided in this endeavor by an actual tank with actual initiation. If Garen is the only person on your team capable of tanking/initiating then you have a real problem.\n\nAbout Darius... I dunno what to tell you, I've never found him to be even a moderately difficult opponent. I guess you could argue he's slightly more useful to his team (which of course has nothing to do with matchup itself), but if you really break it down, the only major utility Darius has that Garen doesn't is his pull, and that in and of itself is heavily mitigated by... you guessed it, Darius' lack of mobility.\n\n*By normal speed I mean your base speed modified by the movement speed quints and masteries that you would almost certainly be using, which would automatically make your \"normal\" speed faster than most that of most champions.","replies":[{"poster":"JusticePauldrons","date":"2015-03-27T14:11:51.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am honestly not sure what I would want for him as a replacement for simply running straight at them, a slight dash on his Q maybe? Making it so the cooldown starts once it is cast rather than when it ends (though the thought of that late game with cooldown reduction is terrifying). I am not entirely sure what I would want to give him a little added reliability but I feel like he certainly needs it.\n\nOn the topic of Darius again, the difference between his pull and Garen's gap close isn't simply one of getting TO the enemy but rather the ways it can be used. Forcing the enemy to come to you is perfect for setting up ganks or getting your combo off. With sight or good guesswork you can even pull enemies over walls away from the safety of their teammates.\n\nOn the legend of Bush Garen, I have to say it isn't something you can really rely on in a ranked game, competitive play or even a serious match because ward coverage is essential in those types of games, which really limits his potential to be able to just leap out and eat someone who wanders too close.","replies":[{"poster":"tofutime","date":"2015-03-27T15:27:20.217+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like you don't understand Garen's playstyle from your replies. Garen is an easy to use champ that has a really oppressive laning phase. This sort of thing shouldn't be rewarded with a good teamfight presence. Having CC for ganks isn't the only way to win lane. You can downright dominate the lane with Garen and make it so that the opposition doesn't even want to come near. \n\nRemember there are 3 bushes in top lane. Is the enemy laner really going to buy 3 wards for that? Most likely not. While you sit in one of those bushes using your OP passive the enemy is zoned from that area. They either need to trinket it in which case you can't use that one bush for 60 seconds, facecheck it (which is stupid), or they can try to farm the wave next to the bush hoping that you won't automatically run up to them with Q and start spinning on them. This type of harass is annoying since Garen absorbs damage that you try to give back to him and has the fastest health regeneration in the game. Laning against a good Garen is stupid as hell because Garen can deny so much from the opposing laner from just sitting there. He has so much zone potential.\n\nAnd although I agree his teamfighting is bad it's not something that enemy ADCs can just straight up ignore. His spin plus sunfire damage eats away at squishies when he's on top of them. You might argue that they'll just kite him. Then he's already doing his job in the fight. He's chasing out the enemy DPS while your team is cleaning up the front line. Again, it's all about the zoning potential. If the enemy squishies think they can just run past you they're wrong. Your damage over time chunks away at them since you can just sit in the middle of their AOE and suck up damage with your W. Then when they're low that's the time they really have to worry about your execute.","replies":[{"poster":"JusticePauldrons","date":"2015-03-28T00:39:14.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Trust me I understand how to play Garen.

The thing with Darius is that you have to fight differently against him as he is a fighter who likes long sustained fights because of his bleed stacking ability. You want to get in and get out, you don't want to do the usual spinning on top of the enemy. There are a few timing windows where you can trade against him reliably but overall it's not a hard matchup.\n\nVayne wins against most melee laners so this isn't really something that can be helped. It's obvious that melee champs will always have a disadvantage against a mobile adc and that's just how the game is. \n\nAgain, maybe you're right about Garen needing to win lane but his champ design is to win lane. He isn't exactly hard to play; everything is on hit, he has incredible sustain etc. He's meant to win lane against most matchups. Again you bring the issue of gapclosers. There are many champions without a dash or blink ability. We don't need Garen to be another champ with a free dash. You're not supposed to be the initiator. If your team lacks an initiator then you should not pick Garen. Garen is a zoner. He's supposed to follow up on the initiation.\n\nYou have to realize that many champs are not a 100% pick to fit all comps. What you're asking for is him to do more roles. Well then he has to be nerfed in other areas for example his sustain or his innate tankiness. I'd imagine if Udyr had a dash like Lee sin then his turtle stance would have to be removed. Anyways, this takes away from a champ's unique characteristics and just muddles every champ to be the same.","replies":[{"poster":"GloriousKaiser","date":"2015-03-29T14:46:03.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too bad Garen likes sustained fights too.

You win the matchup eventually not in a prolonged fight where you are hitting each other for a full Darius rotation. You can see that your HP bar goes down further than him in a short trade but guess what Garen has that Darius does not? HP regen and amazing sustain. So in the long run Garen will win the trades you just have to slowly stack up on short trades. Darius will be at less than half health and have to back and Garen will be more than half health due to his regen.\n\nIt's not his usual playstyle but that's how to play in that matchup.","replies":[{"poster":"GloriousKaiser","date":"2015-03-29T14:54:40.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh definitely, I forgot about that!\n\nI've seen Garens do that and yes, Darius runs out of mana and HP way before Garen does forcing recalls.

Garen is one of my favorite champions, but if he isn't getting fed he isn't really doing anything.\n\nI do like the idea on the E effect, but why even make it able to critical hit?  It just isn't really worth buidling the crit items to make that extra damage happen when the champion needs health and defenses just to stay relevant in team fights.  The only reason I can think that would make that effect useful was removed from the game, and that was Atma's Impaler, which was the item that really MADE tank Garen.  Though I get why they removed it.  An idea I had for the E, rather than the afore-mentioned %health based damage, would be to replace the crit damage with applies on-hit effects.  Suddenly Life Steal Garen seems like a sustainable fighter, and Frozen Mallet makes him a little bit better at initiating while acting in the tank fasion.\n\nHis Ult is really weak compared to Darius and Riven.  Darius is much closer range, but he can dunk a whole team.  Riven has to deal with a skill shot, but she gets AoE execute and a steroid on top of that.  I get that Garen's IS a longer range targeted effect, but even then it doesn't compare to the other two.  It needs something.  A lower CD WOULD be nice, but that isn't going to fix the whole problem.  It'd be hard to make it a non-targeted effect.  Given my suggestion with his Spin-To-Win applying on-hit effects, perhaps it could passively give Garen something in the way of an on-hit effect like passive life-steal which would fit well with his powerful survivability.  Fed Garen is already powerful, and the extra survivability would be something to deal with, but things like Ignite would mitigate the effect, and Thornmail would become a very powerful anti-Garen item.\n\n**TLDR notes**\nChanges Suggested:\nE:  Remove Crit Chance and allow hits to apply On-Hit effects 1 time per second\nUlt:  Give Passive Life Steal\n\nPros:  \n- More itemization options other than useless Crit Build no longer aided by Atma's Impaler\n- Fed Garen easily countered by Thornmail\n- Solidifies role as Off-Tank Fighter with good sustain in fights and drawn out engagements\n\nCons:\n- Garen's Early game might be a bit too powerful with his increased sustain, consider scaling back some flat damages","replies":[]}]}
