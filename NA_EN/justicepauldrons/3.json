Targon lore","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":98,"down_votes":4,"body":"{{champion:80}} : \n\n* Whilst human was named &quot;Atreus&quot;\n* Was always second best but hard working and determined (Atreus is now Naruto; BELIEVE IT!)\n* No longer bakes\n* No longer friends with Leona, attempted to rat Leona out for saving a &quot;monster&quot; of the mountain and nearly dueled her to the death\n* Hated the Solari\n* Given the god like powers of the constellation &quot;Pantheon&quot; the aspect of war\n* Personality obliterated and replaced with &quot;Pantheon&quot;\n\n\n{{champion:89}} \n\n* Has no qualms about killing over protecting anymore\n* No longer childhood friends with Pantheon\n* Saved a winged child (Aurelion Sol human form confirmed EDIT: Not actually confirmed, its a joke guys) and dueled Atreus before being inducted into the Solari\n* Complete zealot in her Solari beliefs\n* Seriously, like willing to murder Diana over her Lunari speech, kept herself alive on Mt. Targon using hate fuel.\n* Infused with Aspect of the Sun, personality retained but given ancient knowledge\n* Wants to find Diana to share in their newfound knowledge (and hopefully not murder her).\n \n{{champion:131}} \n\n* Adopted by the Solari as a child when her parents died on Mt. Targon\n* Infused with Aspect of the Moon on the summit; personality retained but given ancient knowledge and memories of past lives\n* No longer totally down for murdering everyone (Leona adopted that I guess)\n* Wants to work WITH the Solari\n* Kills void creatures at night like a badass\n\n\nSo what do you all think? Did I miss anything? Anything to add? Questions, comments and discussion on the changes encouraged.\n\nPersonally I find it strange that Leona was such a Solari zealot, something that was endearing about her personality was how she favored protecting people over harming them and this was not seen in the lore rework. With how open they left her lore entry it could be assumed that after being infused with the aspect of the sun she is no longer trying to hardcore murder Diana but that was left rather open to interpretation.\n\nOn the Pantheon side of things I liked it almost in its entirety, the only thing I found myself worrying about was how the personality of Atreus was apparently completely wiped out to be replaced with \"Pantheon\"\n\nAs for Diana I liked her lore entry in its entirety, it was exactly what I was expecting. Kept the good parts of the old lore and built upon them, making her seem more relatable and good character. The only downside of this is that it doesn't translate as well to her edgy in game persona.

Seems they just took what THEY thought was a \"generic\" stereotype of putting them in the League, and instead stuffed them in a much more generic \"they are all badasses with less personality\" column, as if this were a fighting game, and not a strategic dota like/moba game.\n\nLeona was one of my fav in the lore because she had personality and was one of the few very clear \"good guys\" with no ulterior motives. Now she is just \"rawr I kill people because I'm a zealot\" which is a huge turn off. \n\nI didn't mind Pantheons too much but it wasn't my fav.

While being absolutely deadly, almost refeared as a zealot, she is not like Rakkors and does not kill at all costs. In fact, not only she lets the golden boy live but further decisions enrage Atreus, defining her choice of politics \"weak\", hinting that even if she is not afraid to kill she is not fully committed to it. Even against Diana, one that she hated and hates still, she would probably prefer a pacific resolution rather killing on sight.\n\nRiot has tendencies lately to make lores that sightly contradict each other, because each lore represents the view of that particular character and not the absolute truth. Even for the biggest pacifist ever, it would be unreasonable for leona to not kill who is against her in such an aggressive region.","replies":[{"poster":"Spitemaster","date":"2016-02-26T17:42:27.339+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, Leona's personality was very clear in the old lore.\n\n\"Now they sought only to escape.

You don' t let invaders to pillage who is in your protection, or else no one would survive.\n\nI'm not at all involved with the new stories, so standard Bioluminescence disclaimer applies (not part of Narrative, etc.) but this line turned my stomach and removed a lot of the sympathy I might have had for the raiders:\n\n> The leader raised a callused hand as he saw a lone figure standing athwart the settlementâs street. He grinned as he saw **it was a woman. Finally, something worth plundering**.\n\nThere were 50 of them, all warriors (not a mixed group of warriors, craftspeople, elderly and the young).  Their job was sweeping from settlement to settlement (not military outpost to military outpost) and taking anything they pleased.  The settlements weren't even wealthy, according to the description - they were going after soft targets, and not through need.\n\n> The previous settlements had been easily overcome; little challenge for men weaned on battle. The spoils were few and far between, but in this strange land, a man took what he could get.\n\nIn a more enlightened age (ha!) you might argue you'd capture these people and try them before a jury - maybe attempt rehabilitation.  But I'm not sure how big Runeterra is on that.  Each one was guilty by their leaders own thought process, each one is implied to have murdered (and more) the defenseless, the poor, the innocents.  If in Leona's mind, her options were to either kill these men, or let them rape and pillage again, then her choice would be clear.  Do you think that if she let them run off, they'd all go back home and become goatherds?  Or would they look for soft targets elsewhere.\n\n\n_(Standard disclaimer - I know no more than you guys do.  I only read the stories for the first time yesterday too.  I think part of the issue with the new Targon stories is that Leona isn't so easily and immediately likable now.  She's unpleasant in ways, much as any zealot might be, before her world shattering revelation.)_","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2016-02-26T19:08:07.788+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"Well, nothing says Leona has to KILL them.

A pragmatic person would want to remove their ability to cause more harm with the least collatoral loss possible.\n\nReality check, though - this is us trying to rationalize the actions of a character set in a brutal, very un-modern, setting.

I don't recommend doing what I did, and trying to listen to it while playing a match - unless you are significantly better at multitasking than me (which may not be difficult).\n\nI know it's not an immediate line to the narrative team (and it's no substitute), but I found the extra info useful.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2016-02-29T05:55:26.219+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You rang?\n\nI've been watching the discussion, not really wanting to stick my oar in while folks are debating, particularly as I often feel even when I tip-toe in here it sounds like clogs and I don't want to say anything considered definitive to who the champions are and will be.\n\nI'd also recommend listening to the podcast in full, I think it's telling how Ant is particular in talking about possibility when it comes to Targon and the champs moving forward.

They're raiders. Let alone the fact that they are set up as the villains in this setting, the issue has never been about whether the reader likes the raiders, but about how far the protagonist's values and principles reach.\n\nAlso yes, raiders, mainly male in historical times and the fictional settings they inspire, were getting their rocks off with women of towns they plundered. Not that I expect everyone to withstand the thought of violent rape without feeling the urge to hurl but can we be honest and realize that having a dick inside you is really not the worst thing that can happen to you as a victim of a raid? (take a shot, anyone who had to read that last word twice).\n\n> There were 50 of them, all warriors (not a mixed group of warriors, craftspeople, elderly and the young).  Their job was sweeping from settlement to settlement (not military outpost to military outpost) and taking anything they pleased.  The settlements weren't even wealthy, according to the description - they were going after soft targets, and not through need.\n\nSo basically...raiders? Seriously, raiding tribes had no CEO, there was no calculation of profit margin. And from that perspective you naturally go for targets that have a very little chance of costing you troops.\n> \n> In a more enlightened age (ha!) you might argue you'd capture these people and try them before a jury - maybe attempt rehabilitation.  But I'm not sure how big Runeterra is on that.  Each one was guilty by their leaders own thought process, each one is implied to have murdered (and more) the defenseless, the poor, the innocents.  If in Leona's mind, her options were to either kill these men, or let them rape and pillage again, then her choice would be clear.  Do you think that if she let them run off, they'd all go back home and become goatherds?  Or would they look for soft targets elsewhere.\n\nThing is that this deep focus on the \"innocence\" of a criminal's victim is pretty much a byproduct of our more \"ha\" enlightened age. In a \"Survival of the strongest\"-setting (not fittest), bandits, who garner their power and resources through pillaging and theft, would DEFINITELY go for those \"poor, defenseless people\", because it makes no sense to go up against well-trained, well equipped, battlehardened opponents.\nYou're judging their actions and logic through values and principles that would be idiotic at best and suicidal at worst for people like these.\nGranted, that doesn't make them any more sympathetic and as stated before, they don't have to be. It's just that given the kinds of characters we're facing here and the setting they're supposedly in, that kind of view of them is...funny, to say the least.\n> \n> \n> _(Standard disclaimer - I know no more than you guys do.  I only read the stories for the first time yesterday too.  I think part of the issue with the new Targon stories is that Leona isn't so easily and immediately likable now.  She's unpleasant in ways, much as any zealot might be, before her world shattering revelation.)_\n\nI'd wager that the issue is less her being \"instantly likeable\" but that what characterized Leona so far is pretty much gone. And the fact that her \"character change\" was pretty much delivered with the hammer of the gods doesn't help the least bit.\nThe old Leona held up her values and believes from a position of weakness and against overwhelming opposition. She would've been killed for them, too, if the whole sunbeam thing didn't occur. But that danger is exactly what made her upholding her values so memorable.\n\nUpholding lofty values and beliefs is always easy after you've been blessed with the knowledge and power of a demigod. \n\nAlso, to the whole \"they might kill again, so better kill them\"-point: I think almost every DC- AND Marvel-Superhero likes to have a word with you. ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Terra Booma","date":"2016-02-26T20:18:41.908+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not trying to be rude, but that mentality certainly has its flaws.

In fact, several Batman-stories showcase how Batman could gut the Joker on the street during a sunny day and the people of Gotham (including the police) would not just NOT blame him for it but throw him a parade. And he still doesn't do it, because he swore to never cross that line himself.\n\nThat's exactly the point.

Pantheon wanted a more proactive approach of eliminating threats before they became a problem. Leona was more about strengthening the defenses to repel outsider aggression. It is only natural for Pantheon to dislike the Solari when they clearly sided with Leona's approach of handling matters.\n\nI'm not too upset over Leona's lore changes. There have been many remarks about her reaction to Diana, but it does not take into account the history between the two. Leona took her teachings at face value without any interest in alternate means of power. Diana inherently knew there was more truth and openly pursued it. There's a boundary between questioning a teaching and challenging authority which Diana clearly crossed often enough to cause her isolation from her peers.\n\nDiana disappeared for months and returned a different person. She bore a mark and the color of her hair had been drained. A trouble maker returned with an aura of power. There is a limit to how much trust anyone could possess in such circumstances, and Leona's reaction does not disappoint. She allows a potential threat to have an audience with the elders. Yes, she was angry with Diana's words. This was a child raised in the temple of the sun that decided it would be better to seek power from the moon. How foolish. How naive. A lost lamb had returned but was more lost now than ever before. Even Leona would realize these words would result in execution. How much more interesting things would have been if the two had known each other on a more personal level.\n\nBut she lets Diana speak it all, despite knowing the outcome. She waits for the order in a state of unspecified anger. I don't know if there were rules that dictated her behavior or if there was some prideful assumption that Diana was not a threat and could not escape. It feels contradictory to the evidence before their eyes.\n\nIn my mind, the elders are a counsel. Think of something like a long table with a bunch of old men seated on one side and looking down upon Diana. The rejection of her words would not come all at once. There would be a span of almost a minute where every single one of them would denounce her. One or two rejections would not be nearly as overwhelming as six or more. Diana would be reeling and at a loss. There needs to be a time for fury to build up over this unreasonable denial of the truth. That's plenty of time for Leona to react, but she still waits for an official order from the elders. That window of opportunity closes when Diana impulsively lashes out.\n\nPeople can cry over her murderous rage, but Leona failed thoroughly in defending and protecting her elders. She failed because she allowed Diana too many chances. That's devastating. It doesn't take much to place the deaths of the elders on her own shoulders. Rage is all that can prevent her from breaking entirely down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YuGiHo","date":"2016-02-26T16:13:24.199+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"i dont like the Pantheon lore.
