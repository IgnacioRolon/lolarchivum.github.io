I&#039;ll get to the point:\r\n\r\nChimes are RNG driven, it should make sense that bard attracts them. Caretaker&#039;s shrines should have an additional scaling: chime attraction.\r\n\r\nFor example, at rank 1 W has 10% more chance to have chimes spawn close to it, as long as it lives. -&gt; 20% 30% 40% 50%.\r\n\r\nW can be given a set duration like Teemo Shrooms if this mechanic was feared to be abused, regardless Bard should still max W last unless trying to recover from a poor early game.\r\n\r\nGiving Bard meaningful decisions to his costly spell and more control over his skirmishing capability.\r\n\r\nYeah?\r\n\r\nI&#039;d like to note the reason behind this change: \r\nThis isn&#039;t necessarily about the balance of Bard; this is for the feel of the character and overall enjoyment.","replies":[]}
