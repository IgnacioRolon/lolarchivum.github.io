Every time I look at complaints about mobility I kind of realize that the only time mobility is really brought up is when it's paired with one specific trait: damage. Mobility is brought up as a trait of survivability, though without any upfront tankiness, so when the champion in question also does high damage (old Kassadin, Fizz, LeBlanc, Early-game Lee Sin, Katarina, Kha'zix, Nidalee, etc) that's when it becomes a problem. \n\nIt seems the League community doesn't want anything resembling the trope of \"Fragile Speedster\" in the game, despite the fact that the game is practically made for them, so why wouldn't they be here?","replies":[{"poster":"Cloud Potato","date":"2015-08-01T17:12:26.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mobility is very powerful both offensively and defensively. This makes champions who can both resist ganks and push forward an advantage, meaning that mobile champions who snowball become very hard to stop, and it also makes it very difficult to shut them down through team support. Low counterplay kits are the main source of oppressive snowballing, and mobility makes that worse.\n\nAs for out of lane, mobility lets you get away more easily when caught. Not only is this great for the safety that is so important for competitive play, but it gives you the option to take risks that lower mobility champions would get punished for. Typically champions pay for the mobility somewhere, but the difference between life and death decides games, so safety is just so important.\n\nIt's definitely a complex problem. The keyword is 'compensation'. Not being mobile is a huge disadvantage, and it has to be compensated appropriately. At this point in time, it's easier to give mobility than to withhold it since simpler compensations like more damage or CC don't cut it anymore, and Riot has to get creative.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2015-08-01T19:17:53.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then how the hell do games like dota manage to ddo it?

The duration of Morgana's root is really annoying, yes, but its only a root, not a stun. You can still use your champion's abilities to keep enemies away (depending on who you're playing) and you can easily cleanse it with something like a {{item:3140}} or {{item:3222}}. With Thresh, you have 3 opportunities to flash away from his full combo and avoid getting completely locked down. You can flash the hook, flay, or over the wall of his ult, and his hook does not pull you fully into the center of his team, it just drags you towards him. Plus, if you know you're up against a Thresh you can always take {{summoner:1}}. If you clease the hook as soon as it stuns you, he can't reactivate his q to jump to you. Its actually easier to avoid Thresh then a lot of people realize. But then again Thresh is my absolute favorite champion, so take that bit with a grain of salt. I may be a little biased when it comes to Thresh but I've played as and against him enough to where I understand his mechanics really well. \n\n{{champion:53}} on the other hand, **** THIS CHAMPION. I have hated Blitzcrank since the first time I encountered him in game and I still hate everything about his kit to this day. (I've been playing since the around the end of season 3. My first login screen was Spirit Guard Udyr.) Not only does his grab have a fast projectile speed that pulls you directly on top of him, he also has the means to pretty much guarantee that he can keep you locked down once you get there. He has a significant speed boost that most champions can't outrun so he can easily put himself in range to pull you, and this just gives him the most ridiculously overbearing lane presence out of any champion in the game. Seriously, unless the lane is pushed to your tower, there is nothing stopping him from just running straight past the minion wave to get a grab off.  If he pulls you if the center of your minion wave then his ult usually either kills or at least half healths the whole wave. When he finally gets a pull on you, you get knocked up immediately then silenced. Even if you manage to flash away after he grabs you, if he at least managed to start the animation for his knock up then the attack will follow you and you'll get knocked up anyway. Which is plenty of time for him to catch up and silence you as soon as you land. His ult has a ridiculously short cooldown for what it does too. Getting grabbed by Blitz is the most unforgiving thing in the entire game because you take a ridiculous amount of punishment for just failing to dodge a single skillshot which his kit gives him the movement speed to ensure he can hit. Still though, his current W is much better than his old one because he can't just keep his movement speed boosted almost constantly anymore and now there's a penalty for failing. \n\nBut even after all of that, I don't think Riot should change his grab. That would completely kill Blitzcrank's kit and we'd never see him in play again. Instead, they should change his E to something other than a knockup, just some other form of CC that you can actually reduce the duration of with tenacity. If they gave him a root instead, he might think twice about trying to pull your carry without having the rest of his team be able to back him up because then your carry would still be able to attack back in that time.\n\nAnybody else think that'd be a good idea? Maybe I'm just being biased against Blitz, but I still fail to see how his kit has any counterplay to it whatsoever.","replies":[]}]}
