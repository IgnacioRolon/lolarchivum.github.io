His shield, ult, wind wall, and high early game offensive power are why he's been given so much attention. Hell, his crit steroid is pretty much the only part of his kit that's easy to balance; it gives him incentive to itemize for crit earlier in the game, limiting his possible build paths, and it gives him consistent damage output later in the game, compared to other crit building champs that sometimes hit you for 350 and other times hit you for 1000. The passive gives him sharper powerspikes compared to other champions, but that doesn't mean its harder to balance. The shield, by comparison, is far more problematic, and has gotten nerfed over and over for that reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Siyther","date":"2015-06-01T17:22:02.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i say let him have the shield lotsa champs have shields. screw the passive thats what needs to change it does way to much consistant damage after 2 items","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-06-01T15:51:50.892+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mine would be...\n\n**Oh crap, they are all QQ-ing about X, lets nerf everything about them *except* what is breaking them**\n{{champion:38}} bye-bye silence, damage, wave clear, and assassin power!\n\nand then they come back around with this...\n\n**Oh, you wanted *that* nerfed, ok, we'll nerf it!

His E is a gigantic \"can't fight in this area, especially if you have minion aggro.\" His ult is \"Trying to all-in? Nasus now has bonus HP, your taking more %HP damage than Elise with max CDR can output, and Nasus is gaining bonus AD the longer this fight lasts.\" Not to mention his Q lets him rush a major CDR/defnsive item first, further discouraging you from trying to attack him and further encouraging him to jsut farm away.\n\nIn case anyone missed it, I kinda dislike Nasus as a champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-06-01T23:03:13.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On every point I agree, but I also think he does have some decent lane dynamics at the same time.

In fact he is encouraged not to be as much as possible. As long as he is in melee range of minions Nasus is happy most of the time.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Br4ndon","date":"2015-06-02T00:49:40.209+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The amount of risk and reward some abilities get compared to others. \n\nNidalee can chuck spears that chunk for 1000+ to zero risk of herself.
