The defensive bonus now only applies to the 1st and 4th spawn each wave. What is worse is changing void spawn defensive stats from HP to armor. This is a big nerf because towers ignore targets' armor and so the voidspawns can't attack the inhibitor tier tower without a minion wave anymore. (It was already difficult to pull that off as you usually have to place the portal somewhere visible to let the spawns hit the tower & ADCs kill the gate in about 3 seconds --why can you crit the portal anyway, it should be coded as a tower--)\n\nNot to mention the new AP -> damage on the portal. :(\n\nIt was a lot of fun to use, why kill it out of a sudden? It's not like people learned to play around it's mechanics in this short time from 5.1 -> 5.2 and it's not like there will be games without ADCs to kill the portal.\n\n... Please highly consider reverting this change Riot guys... I loved this item a lot, it doesn't have to be super niche... {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2015-01-29T02:39:40.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is coded as a structure now.
