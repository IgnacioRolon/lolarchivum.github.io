( 120s cooldown )\n\nThis is intended to help slow tanks&fighters deal with mobile champions, as their method of fighting back is usually building tank and hoping the rest of the team can capitalize.\n\nIntended audience: [ {{champion:12}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:32}} ]\n\nImagine an {{champion:77}} trying to chase a late game vayne after she used her condemn, because of the {{item:3153}} + Q shenanigan he will die before reaching in a 1v1 situation. This gives fighters and tanks a narrow window of power and opportunity similar to spellshield champions like {{champion:15}} with clear counterplay opportunities and costs.\n\nWhat do you guys think? :)\n\n-_-\n\n\nEdit: Before inevitably someone says that taunts are extremely powerful forms of CC, keep in mind taunt champions [{{champion:98}} & {{champion:33}} ] have steroids to help them taunt, Shen's taunt reduces the enemy damage to half. Rammus' W serves the same purpose while reducing enemy armor, since it's a single target.\n\nWhen purchasing this item, you figure out how to help yourself with it while using it skillfully as it can potentially taunt the entire enemy team.\n\n\n-_-\n\nFunny thing I just realized is, this item will work as a soft counter to certain \"uncounterable\" previous mechanics like Ziggs' minefield that takes 3 hours to come off, stepping on it will \"pull\" {{champion:115}}  towards you for a second.","replies":[{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2015-04-09T07:57:07.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure I really see this helping against mobility creep. \n\nFor starters, most mobile champions have powerful auto-attacks. Mobility is most often found on assassins and their cousin classes in fighter/assassins and marksman/assassins.\nThey don't really care about auto-attacking an opponent.\nHeavily ability-reliant champions like supports, mages, and tanks don't like getting taunted though - as you're silencing their main damage output and dragging them around.\n\nSecondly - fighter/tanks don't rely on building tank and hoping their team can capitalize on them being tanky. Fighter/tanks build tank so they have a defensive mechanic like mobility or range to allow them to survive long enough to do damage. A lot of fighter/tanks are capable of unloading considerable damage - and playing against them is mostly \"don't let them get within melee range of you, ever\".\nLike, really - look at their QWER burst and AA steroids. Nasus is one of those, and his damage-potential isn't actually that unique.\n\nThird - forcing your opponent to take a certain action and overriding their controls with an AI is kind of a lame way to go about things.\nGreat design for a tank would be forcing players to feel focusing the tank first is in their best interest.\nBad design for a tank is making them not worth focusing, and giving them a skill that forced their opponents to focus them.\nTaunts are more lazy design than a useful tool.\nWhile it's pretty much impossible to have perfect design on every facet of a game and you can generally get away with breaking 1 or 2 design rules: bad design on an item universally avalible to champions is pretty sub-optimal.\n\nFinally - 55 armor and 55 MR has nothing to do with mobility woes, and is a significant level of joint resistances on an item.\nEven if you removed everything else about the item, that would be borderline broken and pretty close to must-buy immediately status for that pairing. Not ideal if items are supposed to support more than 100 choices for different strategic purposes, builds, and build orders.","replies":[]}]}
