Maybe AoE like {{champion:222}} but in a different way?\n\nI know jinx has a \"cannon\" but she doesn&#039;t have the heavy artillery feel to her; more of a shooting maniac than anything.\n\nI want cannons, explosions, slow attack speed and awesome spells. Think {{champion:115}} explosions and {{champion:101}}&#039;s energy repulses; I want to feel the power!\n\nCan we have something like that ?\n\nhttp://wiki.dfo-world.com/images/thumb/a/af/M_gunner_launcher.png/282px-M_gunner_launcher.png","replies":[]}
