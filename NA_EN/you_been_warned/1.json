Give more money to buy potions with, meaning more champions have enough sustain to clear enough camps to get their tier 2 item and some extra pots/wards.\n\nAnd if you manage to figure out a balance where you save some of your starting money to buy the upgrade earlier, then that's good for you and adds more diversity to jungle paths and gank times.\n\nOr maybe they should nix machete and let us have just the smite variant and the enchantment. Just up the cost so that you can't buy any pots with it (without the +40 gold item).\n\nIf we need to kill the scuttler to stay relevant though, they better make it easier to kill, 'cause I can think of a lot of champions I don't want to have chasing it up and down the river while exposing myself at half health. Might make early river wards a solid strategy though, since knowing where the crab is and whether there's someone else around could be important early game.\n\n---\n\nOn another note a couple of the survival tips I picked up around the initial changes were\n\nKrugs/Gromp->Razors/Wolves->Red/Blue\n\nshould get you an extra smite to use on the buff, and just in general, planning your route properly helps.\n\nUtility masteries are good things to have for junglers because of all the random little things it nets you (in particular the 40 extra gold one, and the gold per 10 masteries should give you an extra pot or two for your first back) If only they come to their senses and make the summoner spell CDR mastery interact with Smite's stack gain.\n\nNot sure how apliccable they are, but I'm certain that the utility tree could be interesting if they fix the sillyness their stacking system got us.","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2015-01-24T01:13:14.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NorthernDruid,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=h3pRpPXs,comment-id=0010,timestamp=2015-01-24T00:59:43.211+0000)\n>\n> If only they come to their senses and make the summoner spell CDR mastery interact with Smite's stack gain.\n\nI don't think they read the bug report forums unless they get like +100 upvotes.\n\nAnd considering that most junglers go 21/9/0, and not 21/0/9, I don't think Riot even knows that summoner's insight mastery is broken with smite right now, because the threads only have like 3 upvotes.\n\nIt's kinda sad they don't have a proper way to report bugs due to this new reddit style layout.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spiritflare868","date":"2015-01-24T02:09:58.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NorthernDruid,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=h3pRpPXs,comment-id=0010,timestamp=2015-01-24T00:59:43.211+0000)\n> \n> Krugs/Gromp->Razors/Wolves->Red/Blue\n> \n\nYou almost never want to do raptors until youve cleared almost every other jungle canp at least once. \nWith the junglers I prefer to use, I can do a full clear by going krug>wolves>gromp>blue>raptors>red>krugs again.

I think what riot did was just look at {{champion:64}} and{{champion:59}} and there like. Well they have enough health to continue to clear the jungle  after krugs / red so lets just make it 100 gold more so they are forced to do an extra camp or gank.\n\nYet every other jungler is at like 30 health after doing the same two camps.\n\nTBH with you I dont ever think riot will touch {{champion:64}} they coddle that champion more than any other champion I know of. They just REFUSE to nerf him or admit any faults in him and actually do something useful to make him weaker.\n\nI kinda agree with some dude I heard on youtube who basically claimed riot's motto is IDGAF when it comes to players. They care in very specific scenarios that make the game look bad but other than that they really couldn't care less about what we think or feel.\n\nPPL have been clamoring about lee for months now and all I see from riot is the IDGAF attitude. Btw wasnt last season run by j4 and lee for a good majority of the time too ? strategic diversity my ***. \n\nWhat they are doing to mages and assasins is good but it took them a whole season of us yelling at them from the mountain tops for them to finally realise it was a problem. At 1st they were in the IDGAF position. But now that its having a negative impact on their game they decide to finally do something about it. \n\nPlayers complaints rarely, if ever are heard. if it isnt having a direct impact on the game itself they could care less about our complaints.\n\nMaybe {{champion:64}} will get nerfed NEXT season, when they finally realise hes impacting the game.","replies":[]}]}
