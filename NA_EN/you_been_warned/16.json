That aside:\n\n1. You shouldn't need to worry about being good or bad at a role, as the system will rank you accordingly. You shouldn't be facing opponents who are consistently better than you at a role, if you specifically play that role often.\n\n2. There should always be some challenge to playing a champion. If there isn't, that typically means the champion is either unfun to play against or has a wonky kit. As much as I believe you should enjoy the champion you play, your champion should also not be frustrating to play against. \n\n3. Was Ashe unfun or infuriating before? Not really. She wasn't very interactive, though, and she had a lot of strangely placed or hidden power: her crit passive and her free gold generation were both really weird, the former not benefiting her playstyle, and the latter serving as a weak form of compensation.\n\n3. Ashe's rework, in my opinion, does not at all make her more complex; it simply focuses her playstyle more. Before, Ashe had 1 moment in which she could play non-passively: when her ult was up. Otherwise, her kit gave her no tangible strong moments. Now, she doesn't need the compensation of gold generation, and a built-up crit strike, because she isn't a completely passive champion. The most you ever have to do with her mechanically that you didn't have to do before is time when you hit your Q in a teamfight. She's more interactive with her opponents as a result of this rework, which is better, but also still simple mechanically.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zirket Was","date":"2015-05-23T08:11:04.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, don't play role u can't play?

I'm fine with the idea they shouldn't just go 100-0 at level 1 cause they face check me, but if they put themselves in a postion to get hit by several arrows they should take full damage from one and perhaps a little less with each. Might help fix ashe's problems if she has any. Also for those of you that think this is a bad buff please look at graves buckshot which encourages you to get up in their face.

I was going to say take a high damage mage with sustain damage (karth, cassio, Heimer) bot lane instead of ADC if no one on your team can ADC, since if you play that stuff you'd do better w/ it than trying to switch up to something you don't play often. However, it looks like you only play melee stuff for the most part, so may be go double bruiser bot lane instead. Take like pantheon or something going panth/jarvan or a stupid kill lane like that bot and you both start with targon's so you can split as much CS as possible. You'll end up w/ less farm than a solo lane, but you get more than trying a different way, and your job is to kill the enemy ADC in lane... a lot. It doesn't matter about your cs as much as it does that the enemy ADC doesn't get any and that you get enough kills that your team can win team fights when you group, bc you have to win mid game doing that or you will get out scaled and they win easy since they have an ADC and you don't.\n\nNot sure if that's useful but it's at least different advice. (As a side note why do you keep playing trundle when you have sooo much more success in terms of winning on other champs? I love playing cho bc it's amusing w/ my name, but I don't play to his strengths well and don't win w/ him, so I stopped playing him and focus on playing stuff I enjoy as much and win more with.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Extreme Troller","date":"2015-05-22T15:41:38.578+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"all rework sux, why would you think it was a good rework ?
