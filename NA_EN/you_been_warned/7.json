Anyone who has been here for more than a few months knows e-sports is a huge deal to Riot, and they sure as hell don&#039;t want to lessen the popularity of the finals match.

Repeating words does not make them any more valid; I mean come on,\n\nI feel like I&#039;m browsing within an environment of children, if Halloween mattered to them so much; go out and socialize instead of bitching on a video game platform.","replies":[]}
