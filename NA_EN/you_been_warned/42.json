Current Morde is too reliant on support to function; meanwhile solo Morde entirely loses an ability. Both lose out very hard against kiting.\r\n\r\nWhy not have W be castable on enemy champions instead? Since {{champion:82}} is the master of metal and W&#039;s theme is magnets; and because his Q and R are single target abilities with no meaning to reach the target; give it the {{item:3745}} active with a small damage bonus.\r\n\r\nIf Morde auto attacks a target then Ws that target, it acts as a mini-displacement with minor damage. Sounds like a fair tradeoff since the other usage heals, gives mobility and deals a ton of damage. Wasn&#039;t that your thinking with {{champion:58}} &#039;s usage of Fury? You get 3 powerful options with 50 fury, but you can only execute one.\r\n\r\nThoughts? :)","replies":[{"poster":"Lady Hammerlock","date":"2015-09-14T10:25:15.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"uhm\nscaling on W increased\nbase dmg of overtime increased\ncan cast on self HOWEVER dmg over time does  not occur only activating it again\nnow has a health cost","replies":[{"poster":"LittleBlast","date":"2015-09-14T11:02:46.226+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why put a health cost on a heal is my question","replies":[{"poster":"RocketRelm","date":"2015-09-14T14:43:37.773+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LittleBlast,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uHyvLoGc,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-09-14T11:02:46.226+0000)\n>\n> Why put a health cost on a heal is my question\n\n{{champion:8}} \"Kneel before Vlad.\"","replies":[{"poster":"LittleBlast","date":"2015-09-14T15:57:23.410+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vlads heal doesnt cost hp, his other abilities do tho.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stiv1234","date":"2015-09-14T16:34:28.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:16}} would like to know, too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Biffolo","date":"2015-09-15T07:53:00.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To hamper people who would walk into a minion wave and just heal for obscene amounts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lady Hammerlock","date":"2015-09-15T06:50:10.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well more can 3 shot people and it would be imbalanced if he could sustain in lane like that its to reduce the potency of his early game","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Orangesilk","date":"2015-09-14T09:27:54.687+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"I'd like to remind you duo Morde is by no means weak and is sporting a 62% winrate, if people weren't bothering to try and lose games with solo lane Morde, his winrate would be much, MUCH higher.\n\nHe's slightly support reliant at the beginning of the game, the point where he can make the most out of his level advantage in lane.

Your idea is pretty good! I like it alot, seriously i do but it might be too \"broken\" bot lane. So to nerf it, instead of hitting its healing and damage, they could do something like \"Morde cant choose which target to cast W on, but it prioritizes the nearest ally champion, if none is present it will place it on the nearest enemy champion\" something like that? I would think that better then nerfing its health regain and damage. Any nerf to DuoKaiser is 10x worse on Solokaiser so if we can only nerf Duokaiser i think this would be the way to go.  \n\nGood idea btw!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tails Doll","date":"2015-09-14T03:33:34.600+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like where this is going.
