That is because it is not possible, the range indicator disappears.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmElxX00JZE","replies":[{"poster":"SoundChaosDebug","date":"2015-04-12T06:01:39.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I bought bard as soon as he hit 6300, I tested him on the TT before any other mode. I didn't see any problems in the video for his portal.\n\nWhat time in that video looks like it should of made it? 21 seconds in??\n\nI believe you are confusing traveling through the portal as long as it's lined up with a solid wall for the distance, with the ability to teleport/gap close.\n\nIf you pay attention to the wall on the inside of the base and the wall on the outer that is next to the alter, there is a gap missing that is connected by chains.\n\nOtherwise I don't understand the point you're making.","replies":[{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-04-12T07:27:16.215+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Second 3 and more, it'd be easier if you'd create a custom game and test bard in TT right now. Try to create the longest possible portal and you'll see what I mean. \n\nAs for the \"gap\" you're talking about, you can actually cross the gap from your base towards the altar. Behind your nexus -> Altar.\n\nThis also shows on the topside wall of the Health Relic spawn, there are areas you can't create the portal on.
