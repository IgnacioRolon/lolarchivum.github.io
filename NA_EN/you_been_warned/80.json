( eventually removed from dashes however )\n\nI'll keep it short,\n\nTo aid Zilean in landing bombs and staying relevant while giving opportunity for reaction aka \"counterplay\";\n\n**ACTIVE:** Zilean bends time around a champion, Slow icon slowing an enemy or hastening an ally by an amount for ~~2.5~~ => 2 -> 4.5 seconds\n\n**NEW:** depending on distance travelled, Zilean's time warp effectiveness will be increased to a maximum of 70%. The distance **Slow** builds up with gapclosers as well to help fight mobility creep.","replies":[]}
