His W's damage hits too hard while he heals everything Nasus throws at him with his passive.\r\n\r\nLucian: God tier ADC, everything else is sub-optimal unless you somehow have a fed Tristana, no ADC can 1v1 him neither can you catch him in fights without CC; able to kill entire teams given chance. An extremely mobile kog'maw with waveclear if you will.\r\n\r\nZed: Low risk high reward champion, retarded damage able to even 1v1 bruisers and still get away. Wins most match-ups, every ability is an escape except Q which keeps his farm high no matter what.\r\n\r\nLeona: I have no idea why Riot keeps this creature un-nerfed, every single champion with a huge defense steroid lasting more than 4 sec turns out to be broken [ see history of Annie, Braum and Rammus ]. This thing is immortal, has CC enough for an entire team and is strong throughout the game. Funny enough Leona doesn't need items to be overpowered; hence probably the most OP on this list. [ in my opinion, needing someone else to deal\r\n\r\nRammus: Same reasons as Leona, point click 2 second taunt too strong when the champion's kit is so synergitic and full of free stats. Yes I'm talking about the base damages, the passive and the 120Armor/120MagicRes free shit other than his natural growth as a tank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since these guys became dominant, my rate of playing league dropped significantly. I've hated Maokai since S3's Ancient Golem.\r\n\r\nLucian was allowed to be broken since they fixed Triforce for S3 finals, disgustingly left that way.\r\n\r\nZed always had low risk high reward and had an extremely cowardly playstyle, I was extremely happy that people for a short duration thought that he wasn't worth playing because Zhonyas/QSS solved his ult, in reality however champions are not their ult. Certainly not Zed either.\r\n\r\nBack in S2, I thought leona was badass since I'm an Alistar main and loved physically engaging in saving my allies. This view changed when the Leona nation attacked starting on S3. Leona wiped out all of the squishy supports. All of them, you can't play a squishy support VS leona unless you're a very skilled Janna. From there appeared Morgana and thank god for Morgana; the game would be so damn cancerous if Leona was left the strongest support pick in the game.\r\n\r\nRammus is not ok. Base stats too strong, he's already a strong early game pressure. Why does he get an insane lategame potential too ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose are my thoughts, what do you guys think ? Someone want to add in Fizz and how stomping him early doesn't matter I suppose ? I'm really hating league lately. Been playing Digimon Masters Online / Clash of Clans / Digimon World 3 to compensate as I'm sick of the imbalances tolerated for so darn long.","replies":[{"poster":"dustwind8","date":"2014-11-06T23:12:27.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion, Thresh is worse the Leona... I tend to do better then a Leona in game and i HATE thresh with his 3 forms of CC, Luckily his hook is not the hardest to dodge but if he lands it... you are pretty much gone if he is level 2 or higher... Hook, waits as long as possible then pulls himself forward, Flays... and you will need to base if you are still alive at this point, since his ADC is normally right behind him.\n\nAnother OP choice, is Udyr... His mid-late game is AMAZING! He can single handedly carry an entire team. I've played too many games where an Udyr is struggling in the jungle then by the 13 minute mark he suddenly becomes godlike.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EffectFX","date":"2014-11-06T06:29:14.190+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Maokai - No\nLucian - Just got nerfed\nZed - No\nLeona - No\nRammus - No","replies":[{"poster":"Marthian","date":"2014-11-06T07:13:49.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hardly nerfs at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2014-11-06T11:43:30.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Going from .3 scaling to .00 scaling is pretty hard, not to mention having your ult cooldown nearly doubled.","replies":[{"poster":"Marthian","date":"2014-11-06T16:47:16.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His W loses about 100 damage late game (before resists) and his ult is still strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2014-11-06T22:50:35.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"His ult isn't up nearly as often though.  \nAlso consider, Riot learned from past nerfs (Hello Olaf)\nThey tend to go for lesser number tweaks these days.

Too much tank stats, free root on top of people (he is an extremely effective support), and his ult is a ton of hidden power blocking 20% of incoming damage for everyone.\n\nLucian - Agreed. His early game damage needs reduced. He's too much of a lane bully for how well he scales.\n\nZed - Haven't played against him too much (usually I'm Ahri and that's up to who's better.) his Razor shuriken does a little too much early game for essentially free harrass.\n\nLeona - Mixed. A little too threatening early game. I have mixed opinions, but my big issue is her Ult's cast range (not the sunburst's AoE, the distance you can use her ult.) it's an extremely good engage tool and with the range it has, is very small on risk, but high on reward. I actually have been able to play against Leona as Soraka, you just have to be extremely careful and bait out her E.\n\nRammus - Yeah way too tanky, and way too fast. More of an issue with mobility creep perhaps.\n\nOther mentions\nFizz - Kit is overloaded. Has more than enough tools to secure kills/escape danger.\nMalzahar -  His ult has no counterplay and is a guaranteed kill with a competent Malz. Instantly wins 1v1s. QSS delays your build a lot and feels bad for both players.\nWarwick - Same as Malzahar. In addition, blood scent is extremely difficult to escape, and his AoE Attack Speed buff has too much hidden power.\nMorgana - Q needs scaling duration based on distance traveled, and a slightly reduced max duration. E needs reworked (if you have barely any magic damage to deplete it, they are immune to CC for 5 seconds, which is obscene) My thought is a spell shield for cc you can place on allies, and if it blocks a CC, they/you get a boon for doing so (similar to Sivir's Spell shield, not necessarily giving your ally mana) I think her ult is just fine. The only other change I would suggest is to make DoTs proc Spellthief's once per spell cast, not every damage tick (not exclusive to Morgana.)\nFiddlesticks - Q and E have no counterplay (click cc is unhealthy) and his ult + zhonya's is way too good a combo (lots of damage and can't be targeted)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wehrmacht Bunny","date":"2014-11-06T06:38:09.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Maokai is pretty broken early game. Once he reaches level 6 he can pretty much tank turret hits and player hits.\n\nI never had an issue with Lucian to be honest. He always seemed balanced to me.\n\nZed I have to agree with you on. He is quite a low risk high reward champion. His burst is quite insane, and he has a really easy escape.\n\nLeona is dumb broken if you ask me. All those stuns..............................\n\nRammus is fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frightning","date":"2014-11-06T08:04:11.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Maokai: May indeed be too strong atm, rito recently addressed his formerly horrendous mana costs so now the power that was previous unable to be fully taken advantage of due to mana costs is now at his discretion. Probably not that far off from being balanced.\n\nLucian: Rito knows he's basically the best ADC sans Tristana (who has already been getting nerfs thanks to her dominance in worlds). The question is how best to curb his power without destroying his identity as a champion.\n\nZed: Is quite fine balance wise, he's frankly outclassed by most other assassins until 25+mins in, but he does have better lane safety than most other assassins. He shines in the late game; full-build Zed is a very scary thing. I think a lot of people still tend to fail at properly counterplaying Zed's ult, you need to save you disengage for the exact moment that his gap-closing part of ult ends. Do it right, and he'll get just about 0 damage on you during Death Mark. On that same note, if you're peeling for Zed's target, the same rule applies, dump your CC on him *after* the gap-closer part of his ult finishes.\n\nLeona: Also fine as is, she is strong early game, but scales rather poorly, partly because her CC is mostly single-target (ult stun-radius is very small, you're lucky if you manage to get more than 2 with the stun on it). The biggest thing people do wrong again Leona in lane is they focus her instead of her marksman. This is especially important for supports: don't blow all your CDs on Leona, it's better to CC the enemy carry so they can't take advantage of Leona's passive and the fact that your own carry is CC'd by Leona than to try and peel Leona off of your carry (they will at least win the trade in most cases if not kill your carry, or you, anyways).\n\nRammus: I'm kinda surprised to see him even mentioned here, most people seem to have forgotten how effective Rammus is as a jungle tank. Yes, he's very strong; is he OP? No. Why not? Much like Leona he scales poorly and his CC is mostly single target (Powerball is an AoE but good luck hitting more than 2 w/ it and it's short duration anyways).","replies":[]}]}
