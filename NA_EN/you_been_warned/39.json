And her E is a shield with damage as well? The abilities transition more strongly towards their supportive attributes lategame. Zilean&#039;s kit should provide similar strength to empower his solo laning capability.\r\n\r\nThe idea:\r\n\r\nZilean can now cast E [ Time warp ] on bombs laid on the ground :\r\nThe bomb is rooted, so no minion or champion can carry it.\r\nThe radius of explosion is increased by a value (35%?)\r\nThe bomb explodes 1 second later.\r\n\r\nOther: Time Warp SFX is applied when cast on a bomb, the bomb is visually altered when said combo occurs.\r\n\r\nThis way Zilean has access to safe waveclear and clever, telegraphed harass that is gated by mana.","replies":[{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2015-06-25T12:58:21.325+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's...

It explodes immediately. This way, you can slow an enemy down and cause the bomb on them to erupt. or to clear a minion wave faster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-06-25T15:36:49.947+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"It feels weird how Riot tries to put Zilean as a Support, yet he seems like the type of AP Carry you would want to be fed. High damage AoE bombs with a stun (if you're a Zilean main and can hit them and not on the minions), a huge slow and movement speed buff, a free level 6 Guardian's Angel. He seems like he was designed to be a safe Mid laner like Lux that poke their opponents down before an all-in whereas Lux would followed up with a snare and ult, Zilean would follow up with his stun and two bombs on the same person.\n\nZilean's passive is so useless and random though, I don't think anything else needs to be looked at really aside from his passive. You get level 2 in lane a few seconds before the enemy is all it really does. I see good potential for a quick level 2 all-in, since Zilean doesn't need much besides his bombs and resets, but if you're against someone like Xerath, Lux, Zed, Leblanc, etc who are really safe people to lane with then it's not going to be extremely easy.\n\nI think Zilean's passive should focus on giving him more mana for every time he hits a stun and also make him able to achieve 50% CDR from 40% CDR at max. Not acutally GIVE him the free CDR, but allow it to happen. Since you can't get over 40% CDR, it should let him be able to get 50% if he builds correctly. That way he can spam and spam his bombs so he doesn't fall off so hard as the game progresses if he gets behind.","replies":[{"poster":"Risurin","date":"2015-06-26T00:35:51.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he technically has only 1 damage ability...rest are control spells with no direct damage attached to them. I find it more strange that people want to play him midlane, when literally every other mid lane champion has also a waveclear spammable ability, but also other damage spells/CCs with damage. It like playing bard mid...i mean the game doesnt prevent you from doing it, but there is clearly better choices.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-06-26T00:45:43.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is that if a Zilean gets fed, you can't touch him. If he's getting ganged up on, he just has to speed up or slow an enemy down and even stun him. If he gets turret dove, he ults himself and gets a free kill or so. Don't underestimate Zilean when he goes mid.\n\nPeople want to play him mid because that's the only lane he's really good at. He can poke people as a support, but It's very easy to dodge and against people like Soraka, Sona, Bard, Taric, etc with any form of healing, It's useless since they will do almost no damage. He also has CC, but again if you miss your bombs then you lose your stun and also his slow/speed up isn't enough to make a huge play 99% of the time. The thing that is nice about Zilean support is that he can revive his ADC if he/she is about to die, but then again that's not really the best unless your ADC is fed and otherwise you could put it on a higher priority target, which Zilean mid does anyways.\n\nZilean just doesn't really fit into the support aspect like he should. They want to design him to be a support, and in a simple and short paragraph it can make Zilean sound like a support, but in reality his kit in detail looks more like a mashup of a utility/CC/Cassiopeia machine gun spam abilities to win the game AP Mid laner.","replies":[{"poster":"Risurin","date":"2015-06-26T01:26:45.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just saying, maybe thats why they pushed him further into mid. because he didnt really do plays mid, where as he seem to have more play potential as support. And i dont see how his kit is nearly as identical as Cassiopeia....Again i think it look more liek Bard with a lot of no direct damage utility spells. Like if you just drop aside that people ever played him mid, you look at his kit and he actually sound like a support more then anything else. And in the current version of the game, i dont see why would you play him mid.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-06-25T13:09:22.822+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"And what if it could act like a landmine for 10-20-30s?","replies":[{"poster":"Xenohaz","date":"2015-06-25T16:37:55.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That might go too far from harass and into the realm of non-interactive area denial.
