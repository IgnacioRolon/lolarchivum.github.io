Give them weaknesses in teamfights/1v1s please.\n\nI am sure I&#039;m not the only person who doesn&#039;t play assassins/adcs and has this feeling about this class (and assassins, and burst mages too or at least most of them) thinking the game would be better off ACTUALLY being a team game rather than egotistical toxic cunts single-handedly determining the outcome of games since the beginning of history with \"muh kiting attack move skill\". \n\nI swear to god when playing against a competent ADC, this game goes from \"fun\" to \"torture\" very quickly. Can something be done about this? A while back, Twisted Treeline (3v3) was the go-to place when you want to stay away from this marksman plague, but I feel developers lean much more towards catering to them than not; ignoring a shit ton of people whose joy in the game is entirely removed because of them.\n\nI get Riot wants to keep the game \"objective focused\" and interesting, but can we please, please have some sort of option/place where people like me don&#039;t have to deal with them? They suck the fun out of the game for me, I mean it. \n\nAm I the only one who feels this way ??","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-07-25T11:19:18.441+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":13,"body":"Make them... weaker... in team fights... and in 1v1's? I don't know who the hell you play in games, but nearly every ADC is currently 1v1'able with very, very few exceptions based on incredible skill and who the non-ADC is... 'Cause Varus, Kog, Cait, Lucian, Graves, Draven, Corki, Ashe, MF, Jinx, and pretty much every other AD ranged character that isn't Jayce, Vayne, or Ezreal are pretty easily caught and murdered. Jayce has huge range poke and a personal peeling mechanism on top of having large burst when becoming melee. Vayne has her E and invisibility. Ezreal has a bunch of poke and if he lands a lot of it, his E has a short CD. \n\nOverall, most ADC's are pretty damn easily exploded and very easily caught out. Their damage is not 'ungodly' or even 'HOLY SHIT, THEY HAVE A BF SWORD, GG'. BF Sword makes them do a flat 50 extra damage on AA's with certain ones like Vayne, Draven, Cait, and Corki getting a bit more than that because of passives or their Q. Two of those I mentioned don't even get a BF sword early, nor do they scale well with it comparatively. \n\nPersonally, I think you're just complaining since you seem to main tanks. I won't even mention your rank. Just the fact you play nothing but immobile tanks like Nasus, Trundle, and Sion shows a rather large amount of bias.","replies":[{"poster":"Alljoy","date":"2015-07-25T11:26:33.638+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:40}} / {{champion:223}} + ADC = Tank main tears","replies":[{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2015-07-25T11:59:58.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"and {{champion:201}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"PokladnicaZla","date":"2015-07-25T11:54:10.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That makes assassin mains cry,not tank.","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-07-25T13:44:42.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it makes prettymuch everyone cry who wants to get into melee range","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CatAndBookTails","date":"2015-07-25T23:54:02.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to point out, from a neutral perspective, that ADC is the only role in the game that has never been weak, even in the Assassin meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-07-26T03:41:17.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, but it had a shift in what ADC's were powerful. The ones that shined were the extra safe ones like Ez and Corki and then there was Twitch that's always been known to be an Assassin, but he AA's rather than using abilities. \n\nADC's don't fall out of play because you need a ranged carry that's Magic and one that's AD. ADC's are the only ones that are capable of fitting into the Ranged AD Carry role, which is why they're called ADC's. Think about what champs are ranged and are AD. You'll notice they're all considered to be ADC's, even Urgot. Only ones that aren't considered to be ADC's are Jayce and Quinn, two shape shifters. \n\nYou need a magical and a physical damage kiter as per the META. We of course have Zed, Akali, Fizz, etc. that are Assassins that are the exception to that and they do well because they have the mobility to not be kited or kill their target before they're kited in a 1v1. In a team fight, it changes and becomes any ranged is good because the tanks do the peeling, letting them build loads of damage. Compare ADC's to some of the scariest mid laners like Viktor, Vel'Koz, Ori, and Lux. If they don't die before their damage is thrown, some one is going to be dead or close to dead if they build pure damage, like an ADC does.\n\nADC's are the equivalent of Magic champions. An IE and PD is similar to a Rabadons and Nomicon/Athene's. It'll give you HUUUUUUGE damage that makes every other damage item scale exponentially. Some ADC's have AoE just like some mages have AoE. Varus, Corki, Twitch, Sivir... Some are hugely bursty in single target, like Draven, Vayne, Trist, Ashe, and Twitch (Yes, again. Twitch is the Assassin of the ADC's). Some are capable of doing both, like Twitch, Jinx, Graves, and Kalista. Every ADC has their own niche while every mid has their own. \n\nMid lane Mages are always powerful just like ADC's are always powerful. It's just a matter of which ones. Like in the Assassin META, we had lots of LeBlancs and Ahri's while in ADC, we had tons of Twitch, Vayne, Graves, and Trist. We shifted to champions that can do their damage quick so if they die quick, it wouldn't be nearly as bad since they'd have already served their purpose.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2015-07-25T16:01:08.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zair Umbras,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UnAMwVFm,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-25T11:19:18.441+0000)\n>\n> Personally, I think you're just complaining since you seem to main tanks.

Those are two very different situations you speak of. Every ADC with a dash is an exceptionally strong duelist, others like {{champion:222}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:119}} who have no dashes are also powerful duelists.\n\nThe B.F sword is a giant spike in damage, the majority of ADCs have AD scalings and peel tools aside from their team to lay further auto attacks on the target. This is extremely significant given they have the space to run back and keep kiting which is why I said you need a champion that negates their kiting and in turn create a negative experience for the ADC player. I have yet to see an ADC saying \"boy {{champion:84}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:114}} are full of counterplay, I wish I got to play against them every game!\" \n\nYou should look at the champions played more, you'll find Yasuo, Jax and others frequently played with a high winrate in there. I mentioned that I play everything except marksman/assassin. Besides, {{champion:75}} wither and {{champion:14}} 's R are strong tools to shut down ADCs, I don't see the problem with them.

It gives them an edge because there isn't that smaller item to pick up outside of a Pick Axe and they don't get the option of going slightly defensive itemization-wise to defend themselves because they're the Ranged Attack Damage Carry, AKA Ranged ADCarry or Ranged ADC. They're MEANT to CARRY and their damage isn't tied to any defensive items like Mages have. There's currently no item that gives armor and AD or any GOOD Health and AD items. We have two MR and AD items in the form of Hex/Maw and Mercurial and we have two HP and AD, Cleaver and Frozen Mallet, neither of which scale well for ADC's. Hex and Mercurial protect from magic, which means you're only stopping the support and not the ADC that you're trying to face. Cleaver and Mallet don't scale well for more ADC's since Cleaver only gives 40 AD and 400 health while giving CDR when most ADC's need Crit and Attack Speed since they're AA-reliant and Mallet only gives 30 AD and a slow that's weaker for them. ADC's need BIG items QUICK or they won't do damage. They're a feast or famine roll just like all ADs are because the itemization is just so bad. You won't get a defensive item that also gives tons of damage like a Zhonya's, Rylai's, Guise, Abyssal, or even Seraph's. AD champs don't get tanky stats with their damage, they choose between damage and tankiness and use Life Steal as a form of Tankiness and Damage, which requires you to have damage to make useful. \n\nSo... yeah... I mean, ADC's are fine. They're just the equivalent of Ranged Magic Carrys, AKA Mages. The difference? Itemization. Look at the difference between a Maokai and a J4's build. J4 has to get a Hydra to get damage and some 'slight' tankiness with the Lifesteal while Mao gets to go straight into a RoA that gives him straight damage and tankiness. He can also get a Rylai's, Abyssal, or a Haunting Guise. The tanky items J4 gets to choose from? Cleaver, Mallet (I haven't even seen this poor thing in ages), Hex/Maw, and Mercurial. Mercurial isn't all that great since the tanky stats are 30 MR. Pretty disgusting. Hex/Maw are only actually good if your enemies have LOTS of Magic or a specifically fed Magic damage. Mallet needs some real loving, like making it proc off of Physical Damage, but that would make Zed a little overly strong (I'm fine with him being nerfed... a lot.) Then there's of course Cleaver, which is an item you'll DEFINITELY see the J4 getting. You'll see him and every other Bruiser or AD tank picking that thing up because 20% CDR, AD, and 400 health is WAY too good of a stat combination to give up as a champ that needs lower CDs, needs a little boosted damage, and needs to be able to take a hit. But that's about it. There's 2 of 4 items worth picking up while Mao and many other tanky magic damage champs will love to grab the RoA and the Rylai's is completely worth it for a 40% slow, damage, and 400 health. Liandry's could definitely be worth it and an Abyssal when your team has a lot of magic damage can seriously help since you'll be in the middle of their team anyways. \n\nNeed to fix itemization.

If they get ahead enough, they can snowball to oblivion. Yet they still can be shut down if you coordinate with your team to pick them off when they get out of position. Or they end up being a waste of space because they ended up so far behind that they are finishing IE at 25 min. Very few ADC's are good at 1v1's unless hyper ahead. Mid game can be rather weak for ADC's because they either lack damage for tanks or the attack speed needed for fights. Most ADC's will not have any defensive items until late game and even then some of us forgo that defense item for some extra damage. By hyper late game we sell boots for a second PD and that removes a lot of mobility from us so we have to stay glued to our supports in the hope we don't get blown up. Assassins, hard CC tanks, and fighters with a million sticking tools ({{champion:23}} {{champion:5}} ) are absolute nightmares for some ADCs. Also, a BF sword does not mean that the game is now over. That ADC is still very shut downable. If you let an ADC be free in a teamfight you will probably lose that fight. but with focus put upon them by assassins and fighters. They can be taken out of the fight and made useless while you protect your own ADC and let them cause havoc.","replies":[{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2015-07-25T21:32:35.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why are you even downvoted lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2015-07-25T13:02:30.951+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Tbh ADCs have always felt like damage supports/siegers.  You have to stick behind your team and focus on dealing damage to whoever you can safely.  Its just now there's more divers than ever so you're forced to pick more and more defensive picks in most matchups.   I still snowball and carry on ADC tho most games I end up just being extra damage to set up kills/pushes, tho that's definitely an important role to winning the game.  I think having another defensive AD item in the vein of Mercurial/Bloodthirster would help a lot since those items while nice cut your dps substantially for effects that won't stop divers with several ccs and GA gives you no stats and leaves you as a squishy potentially in the middle of an enemy team, you have to be ahead to justify it.  Other than that the role is mostly where it should be imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-07-25T18:01:44.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Syndra is an unfair burst mage now. PowerOfEvil you really effed up now. You beat ADCs with Armor. The ADCs are major damage dealers of the team. The tank line is to prevent the ADCs from getting damage on everything and locking down the ADC to kill them. Also, Jinx doesn't even have ADC AoE crits all of the time.

The ADC and the APC are heavy damage tools of a team that die rather quick if they are alone while the tank pretty much go where he pleases (mundo :3) even while 2 people are bashing his skull. Its all about being able to fit the different strengths and weaknesses into an undefeatable team... A frontline to take damage and put of CC/Slow/their rather low damage where it is really needed, while the others use the time the tank keeps the rest busy to get out as much damage to the best target they can get to. Bruisers, Junglers and Support (if they are no tanks) often tend to have other means to influence a fight so the enemys damage gets denied and the damage of your carries gets aplied.\nADCs might feel too important in lower divisions, because too many people tend to build damage and there is too less teamplay. Combined with a lack of game mechanics an ADC might have an advantage this way, as he can (rather easily (machanicaly) and undisturbed) aply his damage to one target at a time, while these targets struggle to hit skillshots and position correctly or are simply not meant to deal with an ADC alone (Supports, Teamfight orientated mages, Tanks and Bruisers that lack damage or have abilities that only work good with other teammates) and stumbled into him due to a lack of map awareness....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anotherherolost","date":"2015-07-25T12:57:39.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"This is about no one ever saying \"YOU BEEN WARNED carried us!\" isn't it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"yukonl","date":"2015-07-25T13:06:26.505+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"To be honest, ADCs have been the weakest out of every role excluding supports for obvious reasons. \n\nAlso, buying a B.F. sword does not dictate the balance of the game, rather it dictates the balance of bot lane depending on which ADC gets it first.
