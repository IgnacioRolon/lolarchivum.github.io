Seriously Dominion game mode is much much less popular.\r\n\r\nReasons why:\r\n\r\n1- Tryhards & 5s teams play Summoner's Rift because of the ranking system and relevance to LCS.\r\n\r\n2- Casuals tend to play ARAM because they don't mind the meta and OP picks.\r\n\r\n3- People with teams less than 5 & fans of bruiser metas play 3v3.\r\n\r\nTo me, Dominion's key feature is accelerated game play and less revolution around kills than the other modes.\r\n\r\nHowever Dominion's reason of play is much less significant than the pure fun that URF provides.\r\n\r\nWe should have dominion BE the featured game mode instead of URF. {{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Dusteon","date":"2015-01-15T03:12:19.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, pretty sure the people who like Hide and Seek or just normal Dominion would disagree with you.\n\nSecond, why would Urf not have tryhards or casuals? Urf was literally FILLED with tryhards after the first day; you had everyone picking whatever champion had the least counterplay (why yes, I do love facing the 20th Shaco splitpushing everything again. No, I quite enjoy watching ezreal spam Q and literally do nothing else.

Oh look, Brand perma stunned me because he got a single EQ landed. Oh look, Soraka literally never dies, and no one near her does either. Oh look, Nidalee spams 1200+ range spears constantly while healing and jumping away\". You know who had fun in urf? The first people who messed around, and then the people who played whichever bullshit could stay safe forever while nuking or perma stun you or ignore you. Urf Nasus was funny because he STILL had to stack his Q. It stacked faster, but he still had all the weaknesses of normal Nasus, just with speed injected. Urf Ezreal was not fun (for the other players) because his old weaknesses (low waveclear, mana costs, cooldowns for his escape) were all instantly removed to let him perma poke everything from absolute safety.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
