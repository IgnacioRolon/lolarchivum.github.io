{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-11-11T21:58:59.986+0000","title":"Fine, previous post can be viewed as insulting; but lets view this for shits and giggles.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"[[not a complaining thread!]] \n\nOnce up on a time, I used to go by the name of &quot;wehateteemo&quot;; I had a mordekaiser stomping Teemo with his mace for FEK on GD.\n\nI gate keep&#039;d bronze passionately for a while, and a thread spawned discussing what I do; this thread was deleted because it &quot;witch hunted&quot; me; only today because I referenced it in a previous post for satirical purposes. This was 11 months ago. \n\nThread in question:\n\n&quot;So I&#039;ve been playing ranked and this guy shows up in the lobby with this message &quot;wehateteemo: I am the bronze gate keeper, while you are with me you have a 99% chance of defeat. I will feed and you shall not pass. Dodge if you care about your LP.&quot; So the first time I thought he was kidding. Nope. Feeds entire game. The whole 20 minutes is just miserable as we attempt to play the game. Everyone is dying and we&#039;re getting slaughtered. After 20 minutes we all report him and I join another queue, still pissed off. He joins my game AGAIN with the same message. Everyone else in the game is just as shocked as I was. I learned my lesson and dodged but I am not happy about it. Now I&#039;m waiting until I can finally queue again and I losr some LP. If anyone else has dealt with this guy please help to bring him to justice, thank you.&quot;\n\n\n\nTbh I didn&#039;t really feed that game, he just wanted me banned. It&#039;s not common for me to &quot;feed&quot; out of the blue anyhow, but troll with {{champion:48}}  yes.\n\nBut that's not the point,\n\n\n\nThe hilarious part is that when I found this thread, I already made the name change to &quot;YOU BEEN WARNED&quot; because I wanted people to take the warning seriously. So the comments went as follows:\n\n&lt;&lt;Demonsoldier21&gt;&gt; &quot;I ran into the bronze gate keeper once, but unfortunately he was too strong&quot;\n\n&lt;&lt;me responding as YOU BEEN WARNED&gt;&gt; &quot;Looks like you ran into the Bronze Final Boss&quot;\n\n&lt;&lt;How Do You Meta&gt;&gt; rip witch hunting thread\n\n&lt;&lt;some random&gt;&gt; I looked it up, Does not exist.\n\n&lt;&lt;me responding as YOU BEEN WARNED&gt;&gt; wow he must&#039;ve changed his name so he wouldn&#039;t be caught, that coward!\n\nI thought the whole thing was so damn hilarious.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5DhGxsEK8JA","replies":[]}
