In order to get out of the penalties, you'll need to consistently play without disconnecting from matches.

For this reason, I recommend you work through our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) in order to work towards resolving this and avoiding leaver penalties in the future. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
