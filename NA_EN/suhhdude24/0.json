This is a key reason as to why the system treats all disconnections equally and why we're unable to remove penalties associated with leaving games. You can find out more about this system in our [**Leaverbuster FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2017-01-09T02:30:40.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it sucks that this happened, Leaverbuster does not care about the reason why you left, it treats them all equally. If you could avoid a punishment because your computer/internet shut off, it would rather easy for people to intentionally shut off their computers/routers to make it look like something happened rather then them intentionally leaving. \n\nSomething else worth mentioning is a 20 minute LPQ is not given out for a first punishment by Leaverbuster. You have to go through at least 2 other LPQ's before receiving the 20 minute one, which means that you have left many other matches in the past to get to this point. If the majority of these leaves/disconnects are due to your ccomputer shutting off mid match, or other reasons that are on your end (internet shutting off, unstable connection), it's your responsibility to find a solution to whatever the problem is before queuing up for more matches.","replies":[]}]}
