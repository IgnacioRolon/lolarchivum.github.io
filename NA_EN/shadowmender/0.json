I know there is pressure from &quot;games media&quot; to introduce social justice and racial/sexual persecution via \"diversity\", and your game&#039;s growth is declining but no one who actually plays your game cares about diversity or &quot;sexualization&quot;.\n\nKaisa was a damned fun and cool champion, and that&#039;s what we gamers care about. Not politics. We don&#039;t care if there&#039;s a small mob of perpetually offended people out there who want boobs removed from games, nor that an equally small group thinks games cause violence. We like your game.\n\nPlease reverse your move to implement a diversity staff so you can avoid being the next EA, Marvel (comics), or Crunchyroll (and more, but irrelevant). Please. I love this game. It literally saved my life. Without it, i would not have had the will to live through the bullying at school, home, and everywhere else. I don&#039;t want you to die \"games media\". Please.ï»¿ \n\nFor these other companies, I was happy to see their actions come back to bite them. &quot;Maybe they&#039;d serve as an warning to others who might be suckered in.&quot; But...Please learn from the mistakes of others before they eat you from the inside out. This is one company that I really don&#039;t want to be put on the pyre of social justice. <Removed By Moderation>","replies":[]}
