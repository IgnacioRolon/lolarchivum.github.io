While he use to be better than me, he dropped league for a few whiles I continued playing. Now, without a doubt, I'm pretty much better than him mechanically and instincts wise. I will agree, though, that he still has more knowledge than me matchup wise etc. He has this huge dilemma where he treats every single game as if it's high diamond Elo or something and is expecting his teammates to DO something with sense when he's never even reached higher than silver. He also discredits me for everything. Not once does he tell me I'm right or even when I stat a fact, he always has to argue my point.\n\nIt's REALLY frustrating now having had to deal with this over 10+ months. I wanted to play ranks and climb with him because it's fun to play with him. However, his constantly complaining and bashing of everything I say and do is getting truly frustrating. I'm tired of arguing with him on every decision I make when I can easily point out 100+ more that he's making. And when I tell him to just shut up and listen, he gets really emotional about it.\n\nLike, it irks me that he simply can't treat me as an equal in this game. I've had bad games and he's had just as much, if not more. How do I try to reach out to him so he stops treating every thing as a competition and just PLAY with me like I'm a teammate of equal competence rather than him telling me every decision I make is wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2016-12-28T04:37:49.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have 2 solutions for 2 diffrent possiblitys:\n\n\n1: if you met him online it might be good to just block him, there are more ppl who take the game fun and not diamond elo sht\n\n\n\n2: if you know him in real life, tell him he needs to chill and stop being compedetive, if ur playing ranked, dont blame him everyone had salty moments in ranked except some people do it in every GOD DAMN GAME.\n\n\nhope these help, it might help more to explain your relationship with your friend it makes me tipping way better.","replies":[]}]}
