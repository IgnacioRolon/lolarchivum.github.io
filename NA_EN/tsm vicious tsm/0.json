Did it magically make them see the error of their ways? Did it turn the game around and net you a win?\n\nFlaming accomplishes nothing besides putting you in a position to be punished yourself. It doesn't matter if you think you're justified in flaming them - it literally accomplishes _nothing_.\n\nSo, between that and the fact that getting into a flamewar detracts from the game as a whole - disrupting the game for everyone else, as well as making you play worse for your focus being on the target of your flame rather than on the game - you can see why flaming, regardless of circumstance, warrants punishment.\n\n> There is no logic here other than, \"welp thats just the rules\" and I get that. Just saying they aren't good ones.\n\nThat's only the surface level logic. As explained above, there's more in general that goes into those rules than you care to acknowledge.\n\nAnd, whether you like it or not, and whether you agree with them or not, the rules are good. They're just not good for you.","replies":[{"poster":"TSM Vicious TSM","date":"2019-01-27T21:17:39.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"OK i get!
