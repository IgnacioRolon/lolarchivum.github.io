It was a black screen with that dialog error.\n\nI later searched for solutions, and found this tunnel proxy thing. \nI tried to follow the link from league page posted by a player (After verifying it), and as expected, this BS came up. \nI then came to a quick, quick, VERY ********* QUICK conclusion that league of legends is blocked due to Peer-to-Peer connections.\n\n(I'm only on this ** internet because of my power being turned off for no reason)\nI never knew such an absurd, r%%%%%ed and cancerous act existed, and strongly believe this is infringing on the privacy of the internet.\n{{champion:268}} For Shurima! {{item:3072}} {{champion:69}} {{summoner:11}} \n\nI have tor browser installed and took precautions for r%%%%%ed crap like this. I also saw that even Tor browser was recently blocked (SPECIFI********INGLY) at my school. I could access youtube, etc from college, but not school. R%%%%%ed since they're introducing such a fake representation of \"The Real World\" to everyone based on their stereotypes. Let's use a quick vocabulary word to summarize this situation. I guess you could say, that was extremely \"paradoxical\". ************ cu*** ***** ********* ********* *************\n\nNow it's boring. All I could do right now is stare at 3DS Max, Unity and Gamemaker studio. I worked long enough, I need some fun in my life...\n\nI would try browsing with Tor to the tunnel proxy, but... Eh, not worth the wasted time.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-19T01:28:02.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not entirely uncommon for public internet places like internet cafe's and public libraries to block certain types of internet traffic such as online gaming.
