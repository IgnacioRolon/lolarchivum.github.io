And the skill to remove viruses/hijackers on-sight), and wondered what would happen if someone was hacked. I understand that immediately the Passwords, Email and probably username could be changed, but if you're~~ proficient~~ fast enough and launch those tickets, **what WOULD BE RECOVERED?**\r\nMastery ranks, and skins are probably unchangeable. But what about current IP and RP, previously owned champs, your friends list, loot, and item sets?\r\n\r\nAre they in any way reversible when this occurs? Can you get back gifted RP, and champions?\r\n\r\nThis is hypothetically representing a scenario where someone gets hacked, sends tickets, and succeeds in proving their ownership and getting their account back.\r\n\r\nIf not, are there future plans for implementation of longer passwords (I understand if this can't be done), or full account saves on Riot's side every week or so?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-19T01:30:24.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as we can verify that your account was hacked and that the damage was done 'illegally' perse, we can reverse just about anything a hacker might have done.
