Your two options of bypassing this to use to Beta Client are listed below:\n\n1. Delete the **LeagueClient.exe** file from inside your installation directory (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends), then launch the **lol.launcher.admin.exe** file and complete the upgrade again.\n\n2. If step 1 didn't work for you, you'll have to complete a clean reinstallation of League using [**this guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends). Once the reinstallation goes through, try the Beta upgrade again.\n\nLet me know which step ended up working out for you!","replies":[{"poster":"lxlPandeh","date":"2017-01-09T18:10:50.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i had the same problem but we have  to go through the entire upgrade again targons? cause i deleted leagueclient.exe and launched admin one and it started upgrading again at 0%. hope it doesnt take long thank god its not a 1/2 part thing","replies":[{"poster":"lxlPandeh","date":"2017-01-09T18:49:55.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nvm it worked!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-09T22:33:11.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yay! :D","replies":[{"poster":"lxlPandeh","date":"2017-01-14T13:19:21.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"targons blade can u quickly check out my post here \nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/MhtUFzmi-why-is-teemo-disabled","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yeahnub","date":"2017-01-10T10:29:25.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Targons Blade!
