The main issue comes from this: if you were gifted a chroma and then refunded the skin which the chroma used, you'd be left with an unusable chroma =\\ . \n\nWe're still working on figuring out ways to re-enable chroma gifting, but in the meantime, you could send an RP gift to the person and let them know you'd like them to use it on a chroma ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"Shuichii","date":"2018-03-24T16:23:23.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, instead of birthday presents, here is $243 in cash and a shopping list of things I want you to get yourself.
