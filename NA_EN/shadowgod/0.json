Is there anything on this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-16T22:23:05.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, this is pretty frustrating.  :(  I'm sorry that you're going through all that, and I'd like to help!

I can stay connected to everything else including PUBG, Overwatch, HoTS, Minecraft etc. however my service to the **game client** drops while the out of game client/launcher seems to be fine.  So I'm forced to leave and reconnect which takes all of literally 10 seconds but sometimes that's huge in a game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"William Wallace1","date":"2017-09-15T23:47:41.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its a riot issuse same problem here i never lag","replies":[]},{"poster":"Santosha Anahata","date":"2017-09-15T23:43:51.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same, Riot your new client is garbage always was. please fix T.T","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ragzeal","date":"2017-09-15T23:42:34.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"happening to everyone","replies":[]}]}
