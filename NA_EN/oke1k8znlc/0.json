I am confused as to why I have been banned. I was toxic at one point and I received a 10 game chat restriction. After that I had reformed, but I have a feeling I&#039;ve been wrongfully banned for my last game I played. Let me just make something clear: I fed, hard. I went 1/10/4. It was absolutely not intentional. A basic rundown of the game is, I was in lane as vayne against a varus and a deadly early game sion... with blue buff. It was ugly the harass they were getting. They zoned me off of cs with the Sion Q. After a failed gank with lee and me dying later, the thresh sorta half-flamed, and proceeded to farm the enemy red side  jg (we were blue side) then go mid and stay there as the Olaf begged him to leave and let him get xp. Of course being a vayne that&#039;s behind and alone, I couldn&#039;t farm and I got killed many times. The jungler lee and thresh continued to harass and harass me about my cs. I eventually muted but their harassment made me feel absolutely horrible. It was one of those games where you really just feel like walking away from the computer. One of those games where you feel like you&#039;d be less of a burden if you just left. But, knowing I had previously typed &quot;I Agree&quot; into the chat for afking before, I decided to just tough it out. I was playing terribly, and my teammates treatment of me made it even worse. I reported both after the game, briefly plead my case to the rest of the players to support me, and left after we won due to a diamond nasus smurf carrying us. \n\nI can&#039;t imagine any other game where I would be reported, and no game that I deserve to be banned. Also, I saw on the boards, isn&#039;t it supposed to be 10 game chat restrict, 25 game chat restrict, then 14 day ban to perma ban? Why did I get a 14 day ban out of nowhere? I haven&#039;t received any form of email about why my account was suspended. It says &quot;This account has been suspended until March 7, 2017. Please visit support.leagueoflegends.com for more information&quot;. Going to that address tells me nothing. Because of the huge punishment, I believe that I have been reported for and incorrectly convicted of intentionally feeding when in reality I just got trolled hard and had a bad game. \nCome on guys, help me out.","replies":[{"poster":"OkE1K8zNLc","date":"2017-02-22T07:32:55.216+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just want a redpost so I know what the hell is going on.

I get the feeling they flamed you and you \"defended\" yourself by telling everyone to report them and spending a lot of time talking about how toxic they are, and how they deserve to be reported. That goes against the summoners code. There's no need to plead your case to anyone. Next time just mute sooner, report them, and move on to the next game. No one wants someone with a victim mentality in their game who is gonna go off the second someone insults them. And by go off I mean, spend time chatting about yourself or other players. Use chat for calls and strategy, not pleading a case to get someone reported.","replies":[{"poster":"OkE1K8zNLc","date":"2017-02-22T23:38:14.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't spend much time typing.

I hate it when someone just makes a huge deal out of being accused of feeding. We all feed sometimes. Everyone has bad games. Wasn't trying to accuse you, I've just seen that scenario a thousand times.\n\nHere's the thing though, and you're not gonna like it. It's not my decision, and just because YOU don't see it as being toxic whatsoever, doesn't make it okay to do, according to Riots rules. Asking to report someone, is a punishable offense. Yes, it's unfortunate, but that's their rule. Never ask for reports. Most people get away with it, especially when there's an afk, cuz no one's gonna report you for asking to report an afk. However, people will report you if you tell them \"x was toxic, plz report\". Just letting you know.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Blasteriz","date":"2017-02-22T16:20:42.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah same, I got a 10 games chat ban after being incredibly tilted and I admit to my mistakes and flamed really badly, but the next punishment I got was 14 days arent you supposed to get 25 games chat ban then 14 days or did they change the system??","replies":[{"poster":"Polytra","date":"2017-02-22T17:00:38.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess he got banned for int feeding not being toxic, Int feeding is punished by a 14 days ban.

Not everyone knows that asking for reports is itself reportable, because some people use it as a stick to threaten others with.\n\nWhen a game gets reported, Riot's bots swing into action, and review the game for punishable behaviour.  Whether the game gets reported once, or 10 times, won't change the findings of the bot, because it's reviewing the same data.\n\nso yeah, just report and move on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-22T11:09:54.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make a support ticket requesting the reason for your suspension.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Packun Flower","date":"2017-02-22T08:37:44.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like a lot of people are getting a 14 day ban with this ban wave.
