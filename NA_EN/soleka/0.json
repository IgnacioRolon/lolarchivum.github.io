However the Lore goes blank on what happened to her father after he was killed. Was he laid to rest? Was his body missing? Here is what we do know:\r\n\r\nBlomgrun was the best armorer in both Brandle city and Demacia. (He was trusted enough by a Demacian General to craft a helmet that was more glorious than anything else.)\r\nWe know that he crafted the Helm and Poppy set the central jewel. \r\nNoxian assassins were sent to intercept the package, and kill whoever guarded the package. \r\nBlomgrun died fending off the assassins. \r\n\r\nBeing assassins They would want whoever was guarding the package to not only die, but also disappear. Blomgrun probably was a target by Noxus, even if the fluff didn't explicitly say he was (Why send 2 assassins to take care of a job that one could have done easily). The Assassins probably were not expecting Blomgrun and Poppy to leave with the package instead of couriers coming to pick up the package. Now lets look at the situation that's brewing. Noxian high commend sent two assassins (probably their best), to steal a helm (probably the greatest helm of this time). Blomgrun is an armorer, not a fighter. He's probably tough as nails, and can hit things like a freight train.  He faced two assassins, and still was able to hold them off long enough for Poppy  to hide with the helm. \r\n\r\nI think that would be a man whom Noxus would want, Death is meaningless to them. They would have the area's greatest armorer who would follow their commands without fail, and have no fear of their forges.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-09-24T06:30:19.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New Champ Confirmed","replies":[{"poster":"Soleka","date":"2014-09-24T16:21:51.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"XD. That wasn't my intention, I was just trying to dig into her back story and really get a good idea of her and her convictions. As well as find something out about her dad, and the assassins that killed him. It really feels like there should be more about why Noxus was after that helm, what made it special. Even if her story doesn't talk about why Noxus was after it, we should have had another champ that mentioned that mission. What made her dad special that a Demacia general would want to hire him for that job. I love a good chewy story, and her particular story has a lot of nibbly bits that I want to delve into.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"brusque","date":"2014-09-24T08:52:05.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, Poppy's papa is an interesting one, huh?
