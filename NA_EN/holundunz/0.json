Well i have been playing ranked roughly every day and my decay counter continues. Even when i play it will not reset and it is now down to 3. Will this screw me if it hits 0 or is it just a bug where it reaches 0 but doesnt do anything. I would hate to decay while still playing","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-30T03:57:56.178+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked up on your current ranked leagues and it looks like you've got a high rank in Solo as well as Flex SR. You're currently Diamond 4 in Ranked Solo so that decay warning miiiiight actually be referring to Flex SR. Hop in that queue really quick and let me know if that stops the decay!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Holundunz","date":"2017-08-31T15:21:13.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, you were correct","replies":[]},{"poster":"Holundunz","date":"2017-08-30T23:55:42.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm queueing for a flex now, Ill update tomorrow.","replies":[]}]}
