What's worse is that while in a game every time i press \"enter\" the chat won't open, but i can read everyone else messages and look at the chat pressing \"z\". This has been going on for about 5 matches and it's honestly really concerning me, if anyone could tell me what to do to fix this bug, that would be really great...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T02:05:28.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm I wonder if that chatbox was dragged down a little too far, and now the typing box is hovering offscreen. I know it sounds like a silly fix, but try to drag that chat window up a little bit. If that's not the problem, we can go ahead and reset your config files to make sure something didn't go a little wonky in there.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
