Your buffing her shroud with a decreased 2 seconds? what kind of buff is this?!!??!?! Im in the akali club (official) and no one thinks this is helping at all. no one cares for this buff, what we care about is either her PASSIVE or her Ultimate! \n\nWe would rather you just not even do anything with her W. and just save it for something more important that all of us mains are screaming for. \n\nJust keep your W. We genuinely do not care about this. we dont use W more than once in team fights. it honestly doesnt do shit for us.\n\nYour doing this because you will consider this a &quot;BUFF&quot; for akali so you dont have to do anything else for awhile. Buff her RRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!! her R does the equal amount of a single auto attack not empowered by her passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-07-13T16:12:57.220+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"First they said they weren't nerfing her right before bursting out with laughter. Now they're saying they're buffing her right before bursting out with laughter. \n\nEver since a certain someone reworked her, Akali has become the butt of every joke it seems.","replies":[{"poster":"The 14th Angel","date":"2017-07-13T16:28:07.687+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro, every main knows that the rework was a joke. xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mister Dark","date":"2017-07-13T16:19:44.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's no need to buff her she is one of the most well rounded champions in the game and in my opinion a little overpowered, I mean just look at some professor akali videos then ask yourself if she really needs a buff","replies":[{"poster":"The 14th Angel","date":"2017-07-13T16:27:26.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"not everyone is professor akali dude. you base this off one person that is macro inclined. and looks at their builds and builds correctly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2017-07-13T16:22:16.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The OP is right. Anything with that long of a cooldown isn't going to be used more than once anyway in an engagement. This buff won't do anything for her.\n\nOn a side note, this new akali is not nearly as fun to play as the old one, even if her win rate has improved (not sure if it has). I don't know why all of her power is in autoattacks if she is an AP champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-07-13T15:58:31.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This buff is only intended to nudge her into a slightly more powerful spot. Akali is on the list of Tier 1 champions who are in line for a full VGU so you shouldn't expect Riot to do major work on a champion like that.","replies":[{"poster":"The 14th Angel","date":"2017-07-13T16:02:45.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it helps nothing. its her shroud. it does absolutely nothing in terms of a team fight. i dont expect us to be fighting for more than 18 seconds.\n\nBut i do agree on the VGU, but exactly when will that happen? it honestly might be this year, but the odds are looking to next.","replies":[]}]}]}
