So as any normal league player I created a ticket and wrote to Riot's Support team. I got two responses from two different people saying that they need more information and all that, which I gladly provided. Fast forward a couple of days (until today) and the ticket keeps getting updated but I can't see neither my or their responses. Also I don't recieve any e-mails to the e-mail I've provided. Is there a problem with my ticket or this is something normal? I would really appreciate some help.","replies":[{"poster":"Keyru","date":"2019-02-15T00:59:56.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like you were able to respond back to the ticket that you weren't able to see the responses so they'll get back to you after that. Normally you should be able to see the response through an email but odd that you aren't receiving them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"shakesd33","date":"2019-02-14T21:49:17.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support seems to be having a lot of problems right now. A Riot member has said that they are behind due to a high volume.","replies":[]}]}
