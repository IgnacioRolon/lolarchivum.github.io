My friends all applied at the same time as me and got theirs a couple weeks later at the same time but I was left out. I don't want to sound like I'm whining, but I have really been wanting to get involved with the developmental process of my favorite game, and I feel like I'm just being ignored at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-26T23:11:54.538+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely don't want you to feel ignored at all, but at the same time I can't individually grant acceptance into the PBE :(  Every time there is a new cycle on the PBE, we look at accounts that have applied and accept a certain number of them.  If you haven't been chosen yet, it doesn't mean you've been singled out, just that it hasn't happened yet.  I hope that you get chosen in the future soon though!","replies":[{"poster":"ThePajamaz","date":"2016-05-26T23:16:27.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for replying and letting me know that I'm not just being ignored. I'm really happy that you replied and will just keep on waiting patiently. You are the real MVP!{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}
