I&#039;ve played Dota and HoTS and just recently Smite and I&#039;m reminded repeatedly why I hate them all. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s fucking smurfs. One sided shit stomps that sucks ass and is made horrible by the fact that you get shit on by your own team for not having a plat 2 main and actually being new to the game. And reporting is off the table because it&#039;s just a throw away account that they could make another one of in less than 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nAnd if I ask you a question about a champion or ask you for advice and the only reply I get back from my team or the enemy is &quot;Get good&quot; or &quot;Dont suck&quot; That&#039;s only adding more to the stereotype that the league community is kinda sorta shit. Oh and I guarantee if you were on your main you wouldn&#039;t be acting like a total sack of dicks because that would put you at risk for some sort of ban. So you get on your high horse and come shit on actual new players who barely have any experience in this game just to get your stupid fucking jollies off. \r\n\r\nSeriously done with Moba communities, not everyone is bad but most players are overwhelmingly assholes. So yes I&#039;m salty as fuck and pissed to no end.\r\n\r\n/Rant","replies":[{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2016-11-16T06:16:05.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would urge you to jsut mute everyone at the start of the game till around lvl 25 when everything balances out, yes there are assholes, A LOT of assholes, but you get used to it and on the + side there being a lot of great people.\n\nGive it a chance and you'll get into it :)","replies":[{"poster":"Dildor The Uncut","date":"2016-11-16T06:23:57.352+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I might give it another try, I'm just salty because I have yet to to have a match that I actually enjoyed even the ones I won there were still circumstances that ruined the match for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-11-16T09:03:18.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me, same name in game as here.
