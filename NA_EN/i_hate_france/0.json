I have my bank card with money on it ofc, no restrictions on how much i can take out either but when i finish completing all the payment thing, they say (in dutch even tho i live in the french part of belgium) that the \"financial institute\" blocks me, that i can't buy RPs. I sent a request to the support but i know that I would have to wait their reply for atleast a week. The complicated thing is that i pay with maestro/bancontact which as far as i know is something only available for Belgium.. Thank you for your help ! :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-23T22:36:48.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and pulled up your ticket to see what might have been talking so long for a response. An agent was able to respond a bit ago, so you should be able to respond and work with those billing agents to figure this out!","replies":[]}]}
