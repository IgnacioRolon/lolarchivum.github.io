The only they recently gave him was a trial run and they've admitted to their mistakes. \n\nI dunno when he'll get his chance, but he'll get it eventually. Poppy is next on the list for Sion-level updates and Shen and Taric have smaller reworks and likely VU's with it soonish, so we'll see. Currently, while the feet are still a bother, the retexture really helped... a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"JohnTheLibrarian","date":"2015-11-04T08:03:53.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your not the first i've heard this from yet its only after making this (and one other post) that i've heard! I'd love more detail if you remember where you heard it! :)\n\nI've heard Shen's will be smallish, and Yorick is supposed to be up in there at some point along with Urgot. Also I'm still hoping for an Evelynn update! So much to hope for, so little patience....

I am hoping that once riot gets the Poppy, Taric, Shen updates out of the way, they could shed some light on Mordekaiser and Eve, who, in my point of view, is in the same boat as Mordekaiser.","replies":[{"poster":"JohnTheLibrarian","date":"2015-11-03T22:07:10.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can definitely agree with the Eve part! \nI guess to me the Mord update should be simpler, and sooner just because he only needs a VU where as the others are all getting reworks.

Shen and Taric will still come out during the offseason, hopefully, so after that settles down, then we will talk shop and bang on riots door until they hear us.","replies":[{"poster":"JohnTheLibrarian","date":"2015-11-03T22:16:43.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, I'd like to think Eve would get an update soon just because Riot has found her near impossible to even out, she's always either to strong or to weak for them from what i've heard.
