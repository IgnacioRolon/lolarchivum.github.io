I have tried updating my computer software and drivers, restarting both my computer and the LOL client, even uninstalled and reinstalled the client, but it still happens. I&#039;ve seen other people complain about this issue as well. When it freezes, the only way to get back in the game is to force the game to close and reconnect. Once I reconnect it will not freeze again. Every time. This can seriously impede my game play and has costed me many losses. PLEASE FIX ASAP\nmokhtariaziz123@gmail.com contact me if someone find a solution,please.\nthank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Nullarbor","date":"2018-06-04T22:19:07.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi guys, if you run into this problem it would really help us out if you can follow these instructions and provide us with some information to debug the issue:\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/1yUAdeKV-in-game-freezing?show=flat&comment=003e\n\n<3","replies":[]}]}
