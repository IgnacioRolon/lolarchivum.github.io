Compared to his older kit. In lane he's awfully bad IMO, his old match ups that were once good feel 10x worse, whilst the bad matchups now feel unwinnable. \nHe feels clunky, his damage is lackluster and very dependant on having 5 stacks up, and i honestly preffered his old Ulti with a circle+AoE Slow for engage...\n\nI'm very biased as i loved old pantheon and also despise nearly all of riots reworks, most of the champions reworked i haven't touched again. ( Graves, Zac, Yorick. )\n\nFeels like the rework was simply \" lets make him look and sound cool as possible, with amazing animations but not focus on his gameplay at all. \", he feels alot like an unwrapped present, that has nothing in. Looks amazing and exciting, but deep down feels bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Ä†old As Ice","date":"2019-08-14T18:29:32.295+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh ur W is ur best move and you should almost always go press the attack.

Or making his E block on-hit effects so he doesn't get blinded by Teemo with his E up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BainTheBanned","date":"2019-08-15T23:56:44.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's not a top laner anymore imo","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-14T14:33:51.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, I mean he has more utility beyond just killing people now.
