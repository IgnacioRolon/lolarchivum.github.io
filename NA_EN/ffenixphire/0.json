Or if you keep spamming the vote just because the game isnt going your way, what if each player had a limited amount of times to start the vote. twice per player would be viable. You know the people who spam it every time its up have already quit trying to play the game anyways and or will afk eventually and get reported regardless. Or if people in promos get more weight to their vote since they have the most to lose.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2020-02-04T21:20:39.687+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Alternatively, rather than needlessly trying to limit something that requires a majority vote, you could simply vote \"no\". Players are allowed to open Surrender Votes, and you are allowed to vote \"no\". If you want to impose limitations on opening Surrender Votes, then limitations should also be imposed on those who vote \"no\".\n\nFor example, let's say that if people are only allowed to open two Surrender Votes per match, then each successive Surrender Vote will require less players to vote \"yes\". So if a Surrender Vote post-20m fails, the next vote will only need to be 3/2 to succeed.\n\nAfter all, if you're going to impose limitations on how many times people can open the Surrender Vote, then it needs to be counterbalanced by making Surrenders a little easier to pull through. You may not like it, but other people would similarly not like being arbitrarily kept from putting forward a vote in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"FfenixPhire","date":"2020-02-04T21:24:25.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"thanks for the reply, my rebuttal includes, Why does there have to be balance to make it easier for the vote to go through?

It takes 4/5 (vast majority vote) to pass post-20 minutes, with it requiring 5/5 (absolute majority) to pass between 15-20 minutes.\n\nIf you're going to add arbitrary conditions like \"You can't open Surrender votes if you're underperforming\" (which is frankly absurd) or \"you are only allowed to open two Surrenders per match\" _on top_ of it already being generally difficult to get a vote passed, then it naturally follows that it _should_ be counterbalanced in some way, since the restriction only serves to hurt those who may want to Surrender at zero cost to those who stubbornly refuse to Surrender.\n\n> They would still have a right to vote after the 2 starts but realistically do we need people to have the ability to /ff every 3-4 minutes for the next 20+ minutes. it lowers team morale.\n\nConsidering that there are people who _can_ see when a match is turning to a loss but are too proud to open a vote themselves? Yes, I'd say that keeping the restrictions on Surrender Votes to the 3-minute cooldown is realistically a necessity.\n\nBesides, you're not the only one in the game. Other people may not have fun in a long, grueling defeat like you do, and at the end of the day, League is a game meant for players to have fun.\n\nAs for team morale, bear in mind it's a two-way street. The person opening the Surrender votes is doubtless having their morale lowered by those two players who stubbornly vote \"no\" 24/7 just as much as you're having yours lowered by seeing surrender votes opened.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2020-02-04T21:26:22.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is it so hard for you to vote no?
