For some months now, I have been dealing with heavy FPS drops. When I start a game, my fps is around 110, but after some time, it drops as low as 20. About 50 % of the time it ok, the other 50 it's unplayable. I have tried pretty much everything. Completely rebooting my pc, changed different settings on my pc, and NVIDIA and much more. Nothing seems to help. My pc is a lenovo, and im using NVIDIA, and Intel i7. Really hoping someone can help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-01T22:51:47.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure you've updated your graphics card drivers just in case something was updated recently, as well as your DirectX drivers while you're at it. This would cover the basics, but if that doesn't seem to help go ahead and try running a quick repair through the client options. That might be able to fix some corrupted files that are causing your fps to drop.","replies":[]}]}
