I would just make figures or pins myself but I am not at all good at art/crafts. I want a boutineer with flowers, but either a League pin to hold in place, or a figure instead.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-28T18:00:51.054+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! \n\nI'm actually planning a wedding that also involves League of Legends accents! \n\nWe're choosing to name our tables after champions, rather than numbering them, and the centerpieces will have iconic figures in them, related to the champion. For example, our Nami table will have her staff, and bubbles! I'm not the best at arts and crafts either, so I'm commissioning a friend to help me with them!\n\nWe also chose do add some LoL flair to our engagement photos. We're planning on holding signs at the wedding that say \"GLHF\" before we walk down the aisle, and \"GGWP\" once the ceremony is over! \n\nYou could make ward boutineers, and have the top of the ward be a flower bud! The base could help pin down the flower, and shouldn't be too hard to make! \n\nIf you're thinking something more along the lines of a League pin, you could do something similar to the centerpieces I'd suggested, where you make iconic pins (out of clay, paint, etc.) that show off each person's favorite champion. \n\nJust remember, it's your wedding and nothing is off limits! Go as crazy or as calm as you want with it!","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2015-01-28T19:50:03.641+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also having a wedding this year.
