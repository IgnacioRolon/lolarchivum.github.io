I recommend you swap over and continue to use the Legacy Client for now, to avoid further penalties and occurrences of this. I also recommend send us some League Client logs using the instructions in the post I linked so we can find a solution for the issue much quicker!\n\nWe aren't able to fund your LP, unfortunately, as we're locked out of making any changes to your LP for any reason. The system was designed this way to prevent any sort of abuse from occurring.","replies":[]}]}
