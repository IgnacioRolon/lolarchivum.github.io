This resulted in me leaving and rejoining 5 times to try to fix it every time I joined I couldn't click or use my keyboard and I was forced to task manger and force quit the program. This was a client side issue and I would greatly appreciate if the bans could be removed :) I then had to restart my computer at the end of the game to see if it would fix it but my computer is slow and I wasn't able to reconnect in time.\r\n\r\nI also tested my keyboard and mouse and they where working properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-21T21:24:17.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because disconnecting from a match negatively impacts everyone in it, regardless of intent, all disconnections are treated equally. This is also a prime reason as to why penalties cannot be modified or removed. It takes multiple disconnections to gain a 5x 20min low priority queue, as we understand that sometimes **stuff happens.**\n\nHas this happened multiple times, or was this just a one-time thing?","replies":[]}]}
