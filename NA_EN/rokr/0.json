Why do we absolutely need a Duo-queue in order for a good Shen player to perform? What is he lacking? Too much skill involved for the rewards? You miss a taunt and fear to get reported? I just don't understand why my favorite champion feels unplayable at the moment. \r\n\r\nIt seems like Riot has forgotten the tanks they have created initially, only to be replaced by nearly-broken AP \"battle mages\" (or AP-bruisers).

I'll be paraphrasing, but the meaning is intact.\n\n\"We would like to rework Shen, but we're not sure how to go about it. First of all we dont know exactly how to define his role since he's tanky, and yet a ninja. His kit however doesnt really exemplify that of a ninja at all and really just seems like a bundle of stats. If we ever do rework him, and we might, we would first have to address exactly what role we would like him to fill and how we could retain his core character without changing him too drastically. We believe we would keep his ult as we believe that a ninja suddenly appearing by an ally is thematically good and completely iconic for the character.\n\none of our biggest issues however is that not only are we unsure of which direction we want to take him, but current players in spite of his flaws find him fun to play regardless, which inevitably and sadly puts him low down on our list of priorities.\"\n\nit was kind of sad to see as Shen is a character i deeply enjoy as well, which naturally forced me to relate to the Rioters last comment in that they struggle with what to do with him because people enjoy him as is, even if his kit does have a bit of an identity crisis and no major strengths.","replies":[{"poster":"Rokr","date":"2015-02-09T19:57:23.024+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I aslo remember having read a post about it, but after some researches I was not even able to find it again. Otherwise it would be in the main subject I've posted earlier as the initial reflexion. \n\nIs Shen fun to play? I LOVE him the way he is.\n\nNow, is he competitive? No and here is why: he requires too much skill the average LoL player. You miss your ult, you get flamed. You miss your taunt AND flash (trying to get to that damn Kalista!!) you get flamed again. Shen simply demands too much for basically close to 0 rewards and its own because of his very little kill potential and his own.\n\nHe relies too much on his team mates in order for him to be successful in solo queue (to my very own experiences, if you do not agree, feel free to tell me otherwise).\n\nLike I said, recently I have been running with lots of HPs runes and some attack speed along 2 quints of damage and 1 quint of MS, got a statik shiv for the waveclear, then a botrk for the dueling power AND finally went full tanky. Becaues of the few kills I had top early game only was I able to snowball and be a better tank.\n\nNow imagine everything I just wrote down, but as a Gnar player. Or as a Lissandra player. Are you going to need an experimental build in order to be successful in solo queue? No. You go look up a guide on any website, get a good grab of their skills and you're all set to gain some elo.\n\nHis kit feels exactly like the ninja he is. Shen only needs a number overhaul, maybe new ways of regaining energy? Maybe tuning up or down his AP ratios? I would love to see a detailed answer from a Red here...\n\nStand United Shen players...","replies":[{"poster":"A Fiery Rundas","date":"2015-02-09T22:05:09.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shen has low kill potential?

No and here is why: he requires too much skill the average LoL player.\n\nI don't think that's a good enough reason to explain why he isn't competitive. The top pro teams would play a champ if they're good, regardless if they \"require too much skill\". No one plays Shen in pro play, therefore the only conclusion I can come to at this time is that he's just not seen as good by anyone at the moment. At least, they don't see him as bringing anything to the table that other champions don't already bring in a better way.\n\nWhat I personally think is the problem with him is his kit. Well, half of it at least. \n\nHis Q and W are next to useless. \n\n* His Q is good for some lane sustain, but that's about it. It does very little damage, has no other utility to it other than healing whoever hits the marked target (and the healing itself is of a very small amount), and it being a point-and-click damage ability makes it hard to make it feel good to use and good to play against. \n\n* His W gives him such a small shield, it becomes useless outside of the laning phase, much like his Q. Again, like his Q, there's no real gameplay to it, just press W and you get the full effect instantly. \n\nIf they were to keep anything in his kit, it should be his E and R. Those make him exciting to play, and those allow him to change the game through the use of player skill. The sad thing is it's only half of his kit. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Graves III","date":"2015-02-10T03:33:18.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that Shen isn't very strong right now, but I feel that his Q and W are quite useful.\n\nThey just might feel less useful. His shield lets his get his passive damage back at double speed if unbroken, and if unbroken, could be reworded as \"Take less damage on the next exchange. For just a short cooldown\" Also get energy back when broken. Its a good move.

This would encourage Shen to build tanky still, while giving a sort of counter play to the ult (focus the guy getting ulted to do some damage to both them and to Shen). It might overall end up reducing less damage than normal, but I think that would free up some \"power\" that could spread to the rest of his kit.\n\nAnother thing they could do to free up some power is reduce (or completely remove) the damage dealt on his taunt. I honestly didnt even know it did damage until I looked it up just now. Why does it do damage? Does it need to do damage? \n\nAs for his Q and W, I think they just need to be something that's more coherent with the rest of his kit, because right now they're kind of just there.

Reduce the range to about 1 screen's length, perhaps 1600-2000 range units. (I eyeballed a range based on the maximum initiation range of Jarvan's EQR combo, or Zac's elastic slingshot.

'nuff said.\n\nAnyway, on a more serious note, I'd say at his core, Shen seems to be in a weird spot. He is a ninja, but he is a tank, that is about as oxymoronic as it gets. He should be tanky through things like being hard to catch or keep track of, not just stacking health and taking the beating head on. His kit should focus on durability through *avoiding* incoming damage, not just soaking it up. He should keep his ultimate *relatively* unchanged, because that is basically the reason to pick Shen right now (and that is its own issue). \n\nFrom what I've read from Rioter feed back, Shen's big problems (and why they are wont to buff him without reworking him) are that he lacks counter play and is low interaction to any opponent. They want to get rid of his Vorpal Blade in its current state because when he is good, it makes him unbearable to play against (so they say). The want to also rework his passive entirely along with his shield, because both are low interaction, and when the shield is strong, he is overbearing in lane, but when it is weak, he is rather wimpy. His taunt, while unique, is also just not that great. Taunt as a CC is a very sloppy, lazy form of CC since it just shows that the champ is weak and lousy enough in the rest of their kit that they need to literally FORCE the enemy to attack them instead of their allies. A good tank can soft taunt everyone on the enemy team through a combination of CC threat, burst, and/or damage blocking that makes killing all of their allies harder to kill (see Maokai, Sion, Amumu, Sejuani, Braum, etc.). A real tank is supposed to be *just* enough of a threat that they make it at least mostly worthwhile to try to kill them instead of your carries. Right now, Shen has a little bit of utility, moderate damage, and an ult that, while significantly helping allies out in a fight BEFORE he gets there, has 0 impact in terms of making the enemy ever have a reason to bother attacking him instead of anyone else on the once he arrives. \n\nBasically, His kit is extremely weak because of the excessive power of his ult, which is also badly designed in that it and the rest of his kit offers no reason that he would ever be worthy of attacking unless he built FULL AP and nuked you down somehow, which defeats the purpose of being a tank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-02-09T21:22:40.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I REALLY do not think Shen needs a rework.

Specifically due to dragon being so important right now. You can take Ignite with Shen, dominate your lane (Yes really. Shen can be VERY strong in lane if you build him right), and then tp in with ult to ensure your team wins the fight.\n\nShen can be very tanky while dealing out lots of damage as well. All he needs is Wits End and Sunfire cape to be relevant.
