This week I have settled with returning to LoL, as I am desperate to expand my gaming library. Ever since I picked her up some seasons ago, I've declared myself a bad Leona. Now, why I say this is because I'm more of a passive support, or I tend to use someone who can engage and poke from afar like Nami, Soraka, and Janna. This has been how I been playing support since S1. Here are some things I do as Leona (and supports in general)\r\n\r\n1. I ward.\r\n2. I call /all/ the MIAs\r\n3. I ping the enemy I am going to target and hoping the ADC with follow with it.\r\n4. I soak as much as possible.\r\n5. I make hard engages on the ADC/Jungler when he's out of position\r\n6. I make hard engages to save my ADC from death.\r\n7. I ensure I have all much map awareness as possible, because someone help me if the ADC has none.\r\n8. I build to support the team while building endure the enemy team.\r\n\r\nNow, people have told me in the past that if you can't play a Champion, don't play them. Yes this is the easy way out, but as someone who has always enjoyed playing support, I WANT to be as versatile in that role as possible. I won't lie either, this isn't just the case with Leona, but just about any melee support and tank out there. Kind of gets boring just healing and putting shields up all day. \r\n\r\nI have Taric, Malphite, Nautilus, Galio, and Blitzcrank,and yet they get 0 playtime. Some, like Galio and Nautilus, I bought (IP/RP) and never even touched. Literally, bought them for the shelf. It's sad.. \r\n\r\nSo with all that said, I ask you, the community, what advice and tips can be given for Leona?","replies":[{"poster":"Psionic Flea","date":"2015-11-19T05:23:34.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, thanks to the advice in this thread, I went 3/9/37 in a 40 minute match.\n\nVarus was great early game, but he started falling off with his fights late-game. Shaco was jungle, but didn't start with jack in the boxes, and didn't get them at level 2 either. Jayce was holding his own really well, and Xin was wrecking the Ahri mid.\n\nAlso, helped the Jayce score a penta. Felt good. :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Der Lindwurm","date":"2015-11-18T23:41:46.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's important that you get a feel for your ADC with Leona. If you've got a loose cannon or someone who pushes like mad, stay back a little and be ready to pounce when the enemy team tries to get him/her. If your ADC wants to just farm and hold out for a gank it's a mostly similar situation - stay safe but in front of your ADC as much as possible. Use your Q as a deterrent if the enemies try to get too close to your ADC while using your W to tank their harass. Then go use your E and go ham as your jungler is arriving. If you've got a patient but opportunistic ADC, try to maneuver around the sides of the wave, zoning with the threat of your E. If an enemy moves into a bad position, ping to let your ADC know it's showtime and ride the E in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-18T23:29:52.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a post about this a couple of weeks ago that seems relevant, so I'll post a truncated version of it.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=IronwallJackson,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=z6j2sBlj,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-08T15:07:42.256+0000)\n>\n> She might be the single most aggressive champion in the game, and all the player needs is to know is when to go hard and when not to.

Go hard in the motherfucking paint.\n> \n> Are you significantly weaker? Wait for a gank, **then** you go hard and you **die** for that double kill.\n> \n> Does the enemy have an effective disengage? Harass; don't go hard.\n> \n> For everything else, zone and peel as appropriate.\n> \n> If you're following these simple rules, and your lane isn't an oppressive hellhole for the enemies, it's probably because your carry can't keep up with you.\n\nKeep in mind that Leona is an all-in engage champion/cc train. Your job is to secure kills, so that's what you should endeavor to do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Psionic Flea","date":"2015-11-18T23:15:49.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lack of multi-quote feature annoys me. Thank you @TeemoJenkins and @Alasarcher for your advice and contribution to my thread.

Personally I play her passive aggressive.  I will hang back, let my carry CS, and peel if the other team goes cheese pre-L3.  Once you hit 3 jump on the enemy carry, even if you have ZERO intention of going for a kill pounce on them.  Make them afraid of it.\n\nI will often E into the carry, stun them, pop W and walk away just to make my presence known.  Just let your carry CS, then at level 4, another point in W makes a lot of early game difference to your ability to soak damage. \n\nBest thing to do is just practice going in and getting out.  I see other Leona's all in, their carry doesn't follow and they will overstay the assault and feed.  \n\nbtw... Naut is great right now with some of the new masteries, give him a try, very similar to Leona in terms of play style, but his Q gives him an escape in addition to an engage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"alasarcher","date":"2015-11-18T20:35:54.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If someone tells you \"If you cant play champion, dont play them\" just ignore them.
