With that said though one is just easier to catch than the other. All you need to do with toxicity is look at the chat. Did they say something toxic? Yes, the evidence in the chatlogs proves it.\nWhereas trolling might not be so black and white. Any champion can be a \"Support\". Ive played TF Support for awhile, usually when i have a Jhin ADC as the Gold Card/Deadly Flourish is a great combo! But its harder to prove someone is trolling especially if they dont say anything in chat. You cannot prove someone is trolling just by looking at them. There could be any number of variables that might make it look like they are trolling:\n\nThey could be new to the champion, or new to the match-up they are currently in. They could also be New in general to the game!\nThey could be rusty for not playing for a long period of time, or also from recent changes in a patch.\nThey could be trying something different to see if it works.\n\nThe list goes on. But the main point as well is that Off Meta will never be a bannable offense. And at least from what i seen in your post thats the main issue you have. If you can go into detail to see what exactly they did that made it seem like a troll aside from them going off-meta we can probably get a clearer understanding as to what happen.","replies":[{"poster":"captaincomando1","date":"2017-11-24T04:56:45.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"'' But the main point as well is that Off Meta will never be a bannable offense.'' - that can be great excuse for so many things.How it isn't trolng if you pick Shywana support...Off meta pick ?What can she offer to me as support?Have no heal,no stun ,no poke damage...Try to play  ranked adc with Shywana support against Kalista,Alistar combo and come and tell me ''dude it's ok wee lost bot because I suck as adc''.Wee lost that game in 18 mins...\n\n ANd all things that you specify as possibilitys can be easy checked...For example if they are new to the champ u can check it on op gg,or why would you play new champ on ranked?Second you cant be new at game and be platinum player.Third you can check are they rusty...All that stuff can easy be checked...I do not think its so hard to check it,I think riot does not care about it.\n  \n I newer get feedback after someone int. or trolled...
