I used to play Warcraft 3 when I was younger so that's as far as my moba experience has gone. if anyone can help or recommend me what to do as a beginner to the game I would appreciate the guidance. \r\n\r\nI also would like to get a few friends to help me along the way. I'm completely brand new so I hope to gain good friends who don't mind the lack of experience. I just decided to give lol a shot. thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Pax Romana ","date":"2017-10-27T02:05:31.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nWith every new game, you should try the tutorial to get the basics and a overall feel for the controls. League has a pretty large learning curve with all the specific champions and items. Do not get discouraged, with dedication and practice you will be on your way. \n\nAlso might I suggest:  https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/ \n\nGood luck!\n\nCheers,\nAlways Persist  \n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-27T18:48:32.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good stuff, I agree with everything here! :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2017-10-27T20:17:20.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you find a champion you like, google \"(insert champion name) mains reddit.\" They usually have links to the most comprehensive guides, and those subs have a lot of searchable posts with good beginner information.\n\nThe hardest thing for me when I started League in 2015 was finding the point where champion theme, playstyle, and lane/role intersected. My friend was asking me to play League and showed me a bunch of champ portraits. Out of 100+ champs, Elise (the spider lady) was the one champ that made me want to go through the hassle of learning.\n\nOf the champion themes I really liked best, hardly any of them really clicked with me. The role was wrong, they were too hard to play, too weak, not enough skins, or required a lot of game knowledge. That ruled out {{champion:60}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:114}} \n\nThat pretty much left me with {{champion:143}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:17}} as my viable options. Since then, I've racked up nearly a million mastery points on Zyra. Try to pick a couple champs that interest you for each role and then focus on learning them and the role before branching out.\n\nAlso, google image skin names before buying them. They only vaguely resemble the splash art shown in the store, and it's really frustrating. My first skin was Blackthorn Morgana, and I was so mad I almost quit the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Guttler","date":"2017-10-27T19:30:35.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You picked a good time to start. They are going to update the rune system in two weeks which used to be a real pain for newer players to acquire, now all runes will be free for everyone.\n\nMy advice is try out every champion that you think looks cool or interesting during their free week.\n\nWhen I was a newbie, I didn't try out champions during their free week before I bought them. So, I finally saved up enough IP/blue essence to buy a champion and I'd buy them and then not like how they played wasting all the time I'd saved up for them. Don't make my mistake; try before you buy, so that you have someone you really enjoy playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-27T18:47:39.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Akira!  No joke, I have been binging on Warcraft 3 (US West) for the last month.  Even after so long the game is so good!  I'm pretty bad, but I've been practicing with Human and trying to get better!  I'm really glad you're enjoying League, and the boards here has a great community to help and offer tips.  My suggestion would simply be to keep practicing, and find what champions feel best for your playstyle and role.  Just like War3, you'll get the hang of objectives and build order for your champ with time.  \n\nAside from that, reach out throughout the boards community and [gameplay boards ](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance)for tips.  Have fun out there!","replies":[]}]}
