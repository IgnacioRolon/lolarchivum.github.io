It'll occur at anytime during the game but again, only once.  The packet loss shown in the picture isn't even noticeable so I have no problem with that.  Only the single huge spike you see in the \"Ping Over Time\" graph bothers me.\r\n\r\nI've tried repairing from the client, hextech repair tool, uninstalling and reinstalling, internet works fine for everything else, others with same internet provider have no problems, updated drivers...\r\n\r\nAnyone have any advice? Rioters, know any fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T02:47:26.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you try the recommended steps the log reader gave you?

It happens to me every game, my first death causes my game to freeze for a second. It seemed like it was right before my death but I've been assured by a Riot member that it only freezes when the game decides I'm dead.\nI can't recall when this bug first appeared in my game but it's been around for me for a while now. Hope this helped! \n{{summoner:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"dparkstud","date":"2016-10-12T01:41:33.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish it was that simple for my case!  The graph in the original post is from a custom bot game, no deaths.  Just happened while I was walking around the map :\\\n\nThe other graph I posted, I don't exactly remember.
