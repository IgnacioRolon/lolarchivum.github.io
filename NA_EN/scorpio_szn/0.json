Jhin disconnects unexpectedly before he even reaches the lane. Never comes back.\nSo i'm over here under tower with my Coin, doing a shit job of last hitting because I one trick support, just trying to not feed for long enough for my ADC to come back. Vayne tries to towerdive me alone level 3 to my level 2, dies to tower and neeaaaarly kills me.\nNow this is before turret plating, and before tower damage was changed such that mages can hurt them more. So they get nothing from me being forced to back. I keep on last hitting under tower and Zyra and Vayne both try to dive me before any of us have hit 6. They manage to kill me, but both die.\nThen my jungler shows up and we pull off a double, giving no kills.\nZyra ragequits.\nWe win the now 4v4 match.\n\nTurns out losing a 2v1 lane sometimes causes tilt. Tilt that straight up lost them the game because their now solo Vayne was actually behind me in level, due to having to share exp.\nWould it work in today's meta? Probably not with supports taking {{summoner:14}} and even a little tower damage yielding gold. It probably wouldn't even have worked if they picked different champions or juggled aggro better. But I honestly wasn't expecting it to work in the first place. You never know until you try I guess.\n\nAt the very least, you should try until 15 so that feeding doesn't effect your stats too much. Assuming you don't get to just remake and play a normal match instead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Trent","date":"2018-12-14T23:09:19.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone once won a 4v5 against me (I was the 5 team). If your team comp is bad enough and theirs is good enough it won't be that bad. Especially since ADC's are pretty much out-shined by their support Brands and Zyras in both utility and damage. If your adc afks, it's not that big of a deal. Worst afks are jungle, because a good jungler can abuse the hell out of that, and mid lane, because now the enemy mid lane can just shove to turret and roam 24/7. Otherwise I think the games are still winnable with how big of skill gaps and \"try\" gaps can be in games. If you're in a 4v5, the 5 team probably isn't as focused now, they probably think it's a free win. Abuse that. Also let's be real, sometimes someone on the enemy team decides to join your team by just feeding you kills non-stop and tilting off the face of the planet. Would rather have an afk on my team than one of those.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2018-12-14T21:25:35.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imagine though Early Surrender expecting vote from the CD'd guy.\nBecause that happened to me once.\nWas fun.\n\"Luckily\", another guy said NO so it wouldn't pass anyway but was bullshit nontheless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"smallriver14","date":"2018-12-14T22:39:20.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just had an ezreal keep me hostage in a game. our yorick rage quit because he lost to a poppy.
