That doesn't mean my assumption is true. I guess that identifying an ARAM account is done by looking up their op.gg history, champion selection and if they ever played anything else but ARAM. But from a single game, i can't know for sure.\n\nMy argument wasn't about people having to play champions they don't know how to. That's how ARAM works. It was about not getting loot when you get something that you don't own.\nI have 31 champions in my pool and my accout isn't an ARAM account. These are simply champions i am comfortable with on SR and if the entire pool would suddenly become available (136 champions), getting eligible for loot would be roughly 25% x % win rate x % chance for key fragment drops (really low).

This is a much bigger concern than getting free rerolls/rewards. They would obviously have to alter rewards if they opened the entire champ pool for randomness.\n\nOf course there's a chance you'll get a really good player who just happens to have a lot of champions unlocked and are at the same 'winrate' as the ARAM only accounts, and that person is at a severe disadvantage even if they are more skilled, not only for themselves but for whoever gets them on their team, and I'm not blaming them, I'm blaming the ARAM only accounts.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-04-10T08:22:07.653+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":14,"body":"No, if you dodge it should give you Urgot the next time you play and not allow you to reroll, unless someone can think of someone worse.","replies":[{"poster":"SSShutTheDuckUp","date":"2017-04-10T09:12:53.069+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":1,"body":"Urgot is good on ARAM though","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-04-10T11:20:30.652+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't seen it.\n\nMake them play as one of the poros then, with your only ability being to self destruct if you get fed enough poro snax XD\n\nYour original idea is probably the best one XD","replies":[{"poster":"KoggyStyle","date":"2017-04-11T15:24:14.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah need a ability to annoy the bastard who dident feed you by giving their position away when they are in bush.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"pokomontis","date":"2017-04-12T20:28:51.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only time I've really seen Urgot do good is when they have no range whatsoever, or the other team is bots.
