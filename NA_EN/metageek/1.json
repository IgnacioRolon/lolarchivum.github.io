Farm the jungle and maintain above 6.6 cs per minute for an S - rank or higher, and start longsword and 3 pots if you will be in a super push matchup where you will have to last hit undertower.\n\nMost importantly, don't play Katarina in ranked. She brings nothing but damage and kill steal tilting from the team. Cant duel, splitpush, apply cc, powerfarm, global ult, mediocre waveclear without a few items. Can't carry a team in low elo since players don't know how to play around her strengths. \n\nReference: M7 Kat and M7 Riven player...\n\nGo watch Katevolved or Katlife and notice how they farm, roam, engage, select opponent specific runes, track the enemy jungler, ward, overstay, manage waves, communicate and work with their team, disengage, find picks and much more for their team.\n\nSorry for the long read, hard stuck Iron Player who is willing to help you out if you have any more questions...","replies":[]}]}
