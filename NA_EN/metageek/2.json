Morde has to get his passive, darius has to stack his passive, mundo needs his ult, illaoi needs tentacles, yorick needs maiden, Sett needs to take damage to hit his W center hit. Garen is an exception, but he can't really 1v5 because he doesn't have the damage to kill a lot of people, just burst one person down with ult.\n\nTheir defense has conditions too; morde needs to do damage to have a big w, darius needs to hit q sweetspot, mundo chunks himself in lane if he doesn't hit cleavers, illaoi needs tentacles to sustain, yorick doesn't really have good sustain until he can get in to spam q at 1/2 hp with conq, sett needs to take damage to get his shield. Garen, once again, is the exception, but it's really more of a once per fight type of ability and isn't as effective for its whole duration.","replies":[{"poster":"RavenMagus","date":"2020-02-27T19:41:12.600+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius just needs to get into pull range, i.e. flash or ghost.  Once he starts hitting you he's way, way faster than you and there's just no escape.  You definitely aren't going to kill him before he finishes stacking unless you're way ahead of him already.\n\nSett is much the same way, his W still chunks a squishy even without his rage.  Against Sett you can avoid most of his damage easily if you have mobility.  If you don't have mobility, you're free food for him.\n\nAnd then there's actual tanks that just do stupid amounts of damage, like Nautilus support early game, or Ornn at any time.  It's really not fun to be facing an Ornn who's building full tank so you barely tickle him, but if you misplay even the slightest and he lands anything on you, you instantly lose half your HP (and are CC'd into next week so you're probably fully dead).\n\nIt's like Roadhog was in early Overwatch.  Tons and tons and tons of HP so he took a whole lot of shots to kill, and if you misplayed at all, he would one-shot you with his hook ability.  It was extremely frustrating to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"Corvega","date":"2020-02-28T16:52:48.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean if they have to use summoner spells to kill you( a ranged champ) and thats the only way they can, they must be pretty weak once the spells are on cooldown right?","replies":[{"poster":"RavenMagus","date":"2020-02-28T20:54:21.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once Darius has phage or one of its upgrades he generally doesn't even NEED it, as he can kill a minion, get a burst of move speed and use that to get the pull.  But if you're dying only every time ghost comes off cooldown, that's still a very very fed Darius coming at you midgame.\n\nPeople complain about ranged tops, but in order to fight Darius you actually have to also have mobility or extra kiting ability.  A regular mage will just get pulled when you try to go for cs and then murdered.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Truly Prideful","date":"2020-02-27T17:15:30.576+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually don't mind juggernauts, at least you can kite them out and they don't dash 1000 units across the screen and kill you in .5 seconds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chainman3","date":"2020-02-27T14:20:20.887+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">ok can someone please tell me how characters that get to just not die and one shot things are FUKING FAIR???\n\nFalse premise the entire argument falls apart.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaffWasTaken","date":"2020-02-27T15:29:28.296+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Juggernauts are litterally tanks who trade utility and (in most cases) range and/or some mobility for damage.\n\nThe whole concept of juggernauts is combining high damage and high resistances while not having anything else. They are the most easily juked class in the whole and, to be honest, they barely pose any threat unless they are overstated since the game is oversaturated in mobility, range and tank melting damage, three options who directly counter juggernauts. You are basically complaining about a champion class who's whole counterplay is simply to not stand still in front of them hoping to burst them.\n\nI find it disgusting how much people here forgot what to do when they can't simply one-combo one-shot anything so they complain about anything that can take it and actually hit back. \"Oh no, I stood still in front of Darius watching me auto me while I used a single ability because I thought I could oneshot him, and now he killed me! Where's the counterplay?!?!?\". Funniest part is people complaining about Sett's shield because of its size, still not understanding several weeks after release that the shield simply fades away in mere seconds (hell, the THIRD of his shield is already faded out after he simply CASTS any other ability). Oh and this ability deals so much true damage oh my god, if only you could side-step it hmmm...","replies":[]},{"poster":"LegendWizard08","date":"2020-02-27T16:33:54.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First Malphite and Mundo aren't juggernauts, they are tanks.
