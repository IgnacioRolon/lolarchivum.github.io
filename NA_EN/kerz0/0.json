It was so bad I thought it was a mechanical issue, so I pulled out my q key and checked for any debris/sticking and had neither. Then I reassigned the cast key to \"t\" and it still had the same problem. It seems to be related to moving/turning, because when I stopped moving as much in the wind up phase, I had about a 60-70% chance of landing where I wanted it to. Whereas before that, once the issue started occurring I was closer to 10% because it'd fire the first second or so of the windup more often than not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-08-04T00:32:03.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With quickcast, he should charge his Q while you hold it down, and fire when you release.","replies":[]}]}
