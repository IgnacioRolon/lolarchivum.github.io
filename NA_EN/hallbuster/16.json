Our team Nasus had a 0/2/1 KDA and 8 cs after the game ended. \n\nHow can I react positively when I get players in ranked that say I will feed and actually carries it out?\n\nSaying these players get punished does absolutely nothing, I could bring up his name right now and find dozens of games like this.

This is absolutely backwards thinking. \nThe zero tolerance policy is not a good idea. What do homophobes and riot have in common? zero tolerance. \nWhat do riot games and terrorists have in common? zero tolerance. \nIt's interesting how apparently liberal seeming riot is, yet is so extreme. \nThey also said that my acts of good behaviour (all the honours) in the game does not outweigh my one offence. \nSounds very extreme to me, almost like something an ISIS member would say before they behead me.

People do things they wouldn't otherwise do unless they're raging. Anger management works on a warning system and noticing behaviours to stop them before they go too far. Riots policy here doesn't reinforce or condone good behaviour, but only focuses on bad aspects which is highly negative considering I said it once out of 2 years of playing. \nDota actually measures your level of negativity in comparison to your positivity and judges you thusly. \nRiot looks at one game and says 'you're always like this. you're toxic.' Even though the evidence doesn't support their view. \nThis is just ridiculous. I went straight from a 10 game chat ban to a perma ban. \nNo email warning. No temporary ban. No more chat bans.

You dont like it, by all means go find a game where you can use Slurs all you want. Riot has stated their stance and neither of it is ok. Just the same as if you went to a store, or restaurant. Do you believe theyll give you a warning when you start screaming out Slur? In most cases no, theyll just throw you out because as an Adult you should know better! If you are with friends its a difficult story, but your friends wouldn/shouldnt be reporting you, If its in a public match, then you have to make the decision if its worth your account.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BBag0hxULG","date":"2017-04-03T05:27:44.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as you don't pull a hulk hogan, you should be good.","replies":[{"poster":"Hallbuster","date":"2017-04-03T05:28:20.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zahreik,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=HqRRFyhE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-04-03T05:27:44.209+0000)\n>\n> As long as you don&#x27;t pull a hulk hogan, you should be good.\n\nNo idea what that means :/","replies":[{"poster":"BBag0hxULG","date":"2017-04-03T05:30:35.254+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"“I don’t know if Brooke was f*cking the black guy’s son.
