It's like the \"stereotypical Bronze V game\" joke where everyone picks assassins, no one builds defensively no matter the score, no one gets any CS (none!), objective taking is rare, and the real objective is to get as many kills as possible. It is team deathmatch and it is glorious.\nIt doesn't have the toxicity though. The death timers are way too short for anything but pinging.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2017-06-18T02:32:02.711+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disagree.
