One of the finest examples of hypocrisy are \nposs regarding off meta builds/champions. Some posts get down votes and flame while others are \nencouraged. Take for example a post regarding \nJungle Ezreal, it earned a total of 9 down votes because players believed he was handicapping his team. Weak ganks, poor wave clear, etc. We then have a post regarding Kindred ADC in another ranked \ngame, and a player who was greatly upset that it cost his team a win when he fed his butt off. Guess what happened after he complained how upset he was in his post, it got down votes as well, up to 14. Do players come to these boards just to down vote or are they all hypocrites?","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-06-16T20:48:35.121+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can depend on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to):\n\n[1] The OP's reputation (i.e. positive, negative, known troll, etc)\n[2] How the OP represents themselves (i.e. calm, rational, ranting, aggressive, etc)\n[3] Which forum users come across the post  first\n[4] Existing biases regarding the topic being discussed","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-06-16T20:20:03.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because people are opinionated, delusional and prefer letting others think for them.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-06-16T20:30:49.955+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BEfTUx5y,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-06-16T20:20:03.384+0000)\n>\n> Because people are opinionated, delusional and prefer letting others think for them.\n\nThis is also a \"popular\" and clearly not original opinion.
