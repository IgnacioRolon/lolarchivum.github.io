If you push the wave out, you won't lose much cs. You'll be able to match their items and gain a CS lead, because they will have lost the CS you shoved under tower.

Only 114 cs spawns by then, and top and mid's final wave is delayed by 15 seconds or so compared to mid.\n\nRecalling is dependent on the wave, the champion you're playing, and the enemy champion. If the wave is pushed to your turret and the enemy champion cannot dive you, get the cs, then recall.\n\nViable champions is indeed a way to speed up your elo gain. However, playing the champion that feels the best to you is more likely to let you rise.\n\nYeah not playing support is a good idea.\n\n10% of playtime is an exaggeration, because there simply aren't that many wards. You just need to roam, and remember to drop wards while roaming. Warding chokepoints of the jungle is a great way to ward.\n\nDeath is correct, though dying for an inhib turret/inhib/dragon/baron is usually worth it.\n\nBoots of mobility is underrated, and a really nice. Probably shouldn't be kept past early game, however.","replies":[]},{"poster":"videorfeak","date":"2017-03-06T03:36:23.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2.
