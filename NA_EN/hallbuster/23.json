Depends on how your champion grows compared to theirs and the matchups. If you have no threat and your team is behind that is bad unless you can straight stall.\n\nBut defensive items particularly hybrids are pretty good value in this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2017-04-01T01:25:17.668+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only if you are an early game champion, i.e. Renketon or Pantheon, and you're past the early -game, or you can itemize it effectively. For example, if you're playing Syndra, picking up a Zhonya's to help deal with a fed Zed is a good idea. Buying a Randuin's is stupid, its just a waste on Syndra. In the case of an early game champ, its harder to snowball at a deficient, so you are more useful to your team just building tank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-04-01T01:19:19.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"who and what role are you playing?","replies":[{"poster":"Hallbuster","date":"2017-04-01T03:22:26.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RÃ²ssy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ulxQOM2u,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-01T01:19:19.226+0000)\n>\n> who and what role are you playing?\n\nWell, any role mostly.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-04-01T09:27:23.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not specific enough for me, so basically what this good person TheHappyReaperz said.\n\n\nbut i'll try to add more champions so it helps if any.\n\n\nEx: j4 top that wanted to try assassin but fell behind hard, start the tank build.\n      wukong, renekton, panth(as he said) Illaoi <----- alot of people haven't realized this one yet.  the few people that try to take xin.\n      \n\ni would add irelia/jax/riven/fiora(etc...) but those are special case by case and flow of game looks before deciding.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
