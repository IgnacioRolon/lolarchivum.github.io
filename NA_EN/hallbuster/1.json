Veigar was their only AP and impossible to reach because of his hard cc.\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2555287189/236297233?tab=overview","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2017-07-23T22:23:35.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah that makes more sense, if it was a mundo & galio I'd be worried he was inept. \nIf those tanks were paying attention, veiger wouldn't need to use his cc; conversily anivia and karma could split their team forcing a 5v2 or 3, letting talon being a distraction while hecarim wears then down with you.

Maw would have certainly helped against Veigar especially but I don't know AD builds that much since I play mostly champions that use AP.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2017-07-28T16:39:11.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough, I'd recommend glancing at items you don't normally buy, so you have an idea what you could be fighting against.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
