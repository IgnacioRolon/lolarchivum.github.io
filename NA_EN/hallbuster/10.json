Every game I&#039;ve won is because the enemy team decided to throw and every game I lost is because my team did. It&#039;s impossible to climb consistently unless you play some broken cheese champion like Pantheon, Fizz, Jax, Darius or Fiora and if you don&#039;t you&#039;re at an inherent disadvantage. I don&#039;t know if Bronze was like this but from personal experience, it wasn&#039;t. You could play any champion, even those that were off - meta and still win. If all else fails, I will have to resort to &quot;throwing&quot; games myself to go back to where I started.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-06-21T19:34:31.021+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"and you ignored my comment about dante's inferno on your thread you made about making it to silver \n\nHA","replies":[{"poster":"Hallbuster","date":"2017-06-21T20:15:36.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrFawknSunshine ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mpXXTwy9,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-06-21T19:34:31.021+0000)\n>\n> and you ignored my comment about dante&#x27;s inferno on your thread you made about making it to silver \n> \n> HA\n\nYeah unfortunately :/.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2017-06-21T19:19:09.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk what going to bronze will do.
