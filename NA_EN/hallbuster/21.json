Even if he does, his late power spike might not be able to do enough damage to get him or his team kills in bot lane or top.\r\n- Can make full use of the farm since he is technically a &quot;late game champion.&quot; He won&#039;t be able to team fight until he hits level 9.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems his win rate in mid: 48% is higher than his win rate in top:47%\r\n\r\nThoughts and suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"HOT BEEF ","date":"2017-06-18T06:06:21.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vlad can abuse a lot of champs mid and he can buy spirit visage early if you are behind becuz most mids are ap in this current meta","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-06-18T07:53:20.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or zhonyas if its against ad mid, his early game is pretty well covered by the sub items if you get either specters cowl or arm guard","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WitchQueen Annie","date":"2017-06-18T06:30:17.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like him Mid because you can roam with Ghost and fight large battles earlier, allowing for your AOE abilities to hit many people at once. \n\nI find that if I take him Top, usually the rest of the team won't pick a tanky character and we'll lack a front line (people SUCK at picking team comps in my elo) and it will become a needlessly harder game then if I picked a tanky Fighter in Top instead.\n\nYou'll probably end up with something like {{champion:8}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:16}} \n\nHowever, in Top I like to pick him into things like Teemo and Darius. \n\nThe other thing I don't like about Top Vlad is that if you take TP you feel weaker without Ghost but if you take Ghost, you've got no TP to follow the other laner if he goes to make plays.\n\nIt may be easier to survive a lot of Top lane match ups and you do theoretically get more farm. It works well for scaling but do keep in mind that a lot of Tops can easily fit a {{item:3065}} or a {{item:3156}} into their build. If they get those items, your chances of snowballing are drastically reduced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Takazaki","date":"2017-06-18T03:34:57.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a 1% difference isnt nothing to talk about really, Vlad has been in top lane for a long. pre rework his meta was top and he was a niche mid laner.","replies":[]}]}
