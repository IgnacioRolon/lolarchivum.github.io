I came to a realization that carrying does not necessarily reflect player skill any more than luck, or the feeders on each side of a team. Take, for example, a game I had today. While I hate to boast, I&#039;ll have to tell you: I ended up going 21/1/6. Then look at my second game, I went 5/9/5 while an enemy renekton went 18/1/8. \n\nWhy the huge discrepancy? I&#039;ll tell you, &quot;Carrying is about who feeds first.&quot; That&#039;s all carrying is, counting on some player to give you your kill and snowball your lead.    \n\nNow we can tie why carrying is flawed. It&#039;s simple, the team that &quot;feeds first&quot; is the team that will lose. In short, feeders have a bigger impact than players who &quot;carry harder.&quot; Once they're more fed than the rest of the team, no amount of skill can balance out the equation. You can stop a snowball, you can&#039;t stop an avalanche.\n\nAlso take a look at this thread:\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/fGO31GMx-i-will-not-be-told-to-take-my-bronze-opinion-somewhere-else-any-longer","replies":[{"poster":"Lucian Waifu","date":"2017-05-11T00:48:17.275+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"After watching a smurf in my plat 4 game carry as fiora and help us win in 17 minutes, I know that carrying is totally logical. Carrying a team doesn't just mean a lot of kill with an amazing kda, it means you know exactly what to do to snowball your advantage to take objectives to win the game. Remember that to win you have to kill their nexus, not go 100/0/100 but get zero objectives all game.","replies":[{"poster":"Qzply76","date":"2017-05-11T00:52:48.144+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Objectives and bronzies does not compute.
