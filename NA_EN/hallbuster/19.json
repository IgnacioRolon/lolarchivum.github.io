Keep in mind that this is a super high burst based Fiora build - proccing 5 vitals takes roughly 3 to 4 seconds (auto to proc 1, ult, Q+auto+Tiamat+E for the second, run to third with Vital movespeed, Mercurial movespeed, and Phage, with a faster than normal attack animation from second E, run to fourth with Vital and Phage movespeed, then Q to last Vital).\n\nThis means Nasus gets two Q's off. Assuming Fiora survives them, that means he heals 400 health. The True damage is already 100% of his max health - that physical damage with over 500 AD isn't exactly low, and Cleaver means it's penning at least some armor - I'm sure Fiora will do at least 400 physical damage. Her basic burst combo is a >400% AD scaling, so 2000*.2 (assuming 80% damage reduction) is already 400 damage.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Purpl3Jungl3","date":"2017-03-04T22:02:36.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She'll have a hard lane against {{champion:80}} because he blocks her Q if she tries to engage & her w is useless against him","replies":[{"poster":"Kukan Seishin","date":"2017-03-06T00:35:20.987+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, until lvl 6 Fiora can all in and win, he HAS to win lane before then, and if he doesnt he will never be able to 1 v 1 her again","replies":[{"poster":"Purpl3Jungl3","date":"2017-03-06T04:00:17.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even Pre-6 shell have a hard time poking.

The instinct of most players when facing a Darius is to avoid fighting him, running away, avoiding long trades etc. as his early damage is extremely intimidating.
