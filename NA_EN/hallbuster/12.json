I promise you, if you can learn to just CS more, you will get to Gold at least. Right now, you probably get about 4.7 CS per minute. If you can just raise that to around 5.5 CS per minute, you will absolutely get to Gold.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2017-03-05T07:58:51.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With Ryze I would say never unless the enemy is low enough to be killed with a single combo.  Leave the diving to tanks or champions like Aatrox and Tryndamere who can afford to dive due to their abilities.  Follow them in after they take aggro.  You should pretty much never have tower aggro as a mage.  \n\nProbably the easiest way to climb out of bronze is pay attention to the map.  If you are playing top lane and the enemy middle laner is missing then don't keep on pushing.  Stay back until you see them again somewhere else on the map.  If you see the jungler on the opposite side of the map you can save your ward for later when they are missing for a while again.  Just never push anywhere into enemy territory if all of the enemies are missing.  You will die probably 90% of the time doing that.  Also ping every time you see the enemy jungler on the map.  This will allow others to see them too if they aren't paying attention.  Try to buy a control ward every time you go back and replace any that are lost.  Even if it is destroyed by someone coming to gank you immediately after you place it, that ward just saved you from dying so instead of giving them 300g, you just lose 75g.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WitchQueen Annie","date":"2017-03-05T01:30:03.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No its one of the big No Nos. \n\nIts one of the biggest ways to throw game. In fact, you should Ping your team not to do it and type (politely) for them to stop. In Bronze, you can win the game by simply not tower diving considering how many throws are caused by these supposed LCS stunts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-03-05T01:27:54.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1v1? Yes, towers are weak enough that you should always be diving to extend your lead, if possible. Since you're ranged, you could try to just poke them outta lane, but that's not as effective and you don't get as much of a lead over the other members of the enemy team, unless you get a tower or two.\n\nYou gotta prep it well, though. Need a wave, fairly healthy. You need to know how much damage you can take, and how quickly you can kill them. You have a shield, but it won't protect you from the tower if the enemy champion takes it out first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chibi Bronzlife","date":"2017-03-05T01:22:20.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, unless you are able to coordinate it with your team and understand how to do it properly tower diving in bronze is one of the biggest ways a team loses/throws away a lead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-03-05T01:27:28.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"No.  Never towerdive unless you know what you're doing.\n\nIf you want to get out of bronze just farm (refuse to poke unless your enemy makes a mistake: e.g Kat uses her jump on a minion and doesn't get the reset)\n\nAnd ward. Warding is key. You'll be gold with those 2 tips, there's not much difference between silver and gold.","replies":[]}]}
