So far the ones who didnt snowball felt crappy and didnt deal enough damage to 1 shot. His red form is far superior and is broken, his blue form feels crappy. He seems weak toplane because his early sucks, his first jungle clear is pathetic but his ganks are undodgable. \nAll in all I think he will be a problem in the future, for now he is not too problematic, imo he has far too many toxic mechanics especially longest untargetability in the game, wall walking and massive and I mean fucking massive like thousands of health heal. He is gamebreaking when he goes red form and goes 2 damage items into full tank, other forms or builds feel ok or lackluster.","replies":[{"poster":"420SWAG69","date":"2017-07-14T23:10:49.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Very Trash champ, only good in lower elos when people have no idea that his 1-10 jg path is slow, and hes weaker than sej 1v1. 90% of jg can counter jg him, because not any mobility with e when inside of combat.","replies":[{"poster":"DoktorKaiser","date":"2017-07-15T00:02:47.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its pretty much like any late game champ, fuck him early but if he gets his items then get counter-fucked :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Pr0taku","date":"2017-07-14T01:00:02.083+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"really good at getting to fights, waaay too underwhelming when he gets there, slow spell cast animations.

Really i don't know how broken or balanced he is because of how new he is.","replies":[{"poster":"NotNedward","date":"2018-11-13T01:23:00.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally i find assasin better for his just quick kill potential and quicker ganks but from what ive played red its definetly a powerful choice.

He seems pretty absent early game, but he's brutal once he gets going. After 20 mins, he'll tear an entire team apart with massive damage and massive self heal.

In my opinion, his sustain is no worse than Illaoi's, or Mundo's, or Darius'. There are items that apply Grievous Wounds, but only mages and ADCs use them for the most part. His Shadow Assassin form is a bit underwhelming compared to his Drakin form, but it's the most fun in my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"yangus Beef","date":"2017-07-15T22:18:09.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Possibly the worst champ I have seen at release 0 damage and no sustain. Even when ten kills ahead, he can't kill the anything with a single rotation. The best way to build him seems to be tank, likewise. Which is OK, since he has a lot of sticking potential. He can only be played in the jungle; I have yet to see him not _feed_ in any of the lanes. He is simply outclassed in terms of damage and sustainability by most other lane champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2017-07-14T01:27:48.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"nerf him","replies":[]},{"poster":"Swiff Swish","date":"2017-07-13T00:54:55.749+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"pretty crappy, can't 1v1 most Top laners especially.","replies":[]},{"poster":"undesirable team","date":"2017-07-13T00:51:02.817+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"hes weak","replies":[]}]}
