Both look so cool, and have so many cool things that could be done.\nbe really cool to make this a 1350 skin and put in some new particles for her stuff, mostly based around the dandelion seeds. Her plants could wither like the flower over time and turn into the fluffy thing we know and blow, or just wilt like most flowers. \nher seed pods would make the most sense to be the little white thing. Since they die when things walk on it, it would kinda just make sense that they be like that so they can be blown away when they hit them. \nher ult could also stem (heh) from the seedlings (the actual flower ones, not hers), and rather than having creeping vines, it could be the seedlings spreading throughout the AoE before sprouting into a massive dandelion and launching champs up. or it could be the dandelion's petals instead, just creeping out from the center. Both could be cool if done right\n\nBrilliant concept, by the way. Zyra has some of the prettiest skin potentials out there, but this is definitely one of the good ones!","replies":[{"poster":"DarkLordWraichu","date":"2015-05-16T16:21:56.592+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like the ulty idea, lets spread the seed in a pattern to look pretty XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2015-05-16T07:55:54.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just realized how good chromas for Zyra would be!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neamean","date":"2015-05-16T07:09:25.657+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This look nice and all but i would rather have them make elderwood zyra.
