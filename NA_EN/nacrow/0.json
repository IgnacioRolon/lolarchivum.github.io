I didn't think this would be appropriate for the Report A Bug board, since it might be a hardware problem. I'm just hoping someone out there more knowledgeable than me can help. Before I start, I'll post my PC specs:\r\n\r\n* Intel Core2 Quad Q9300 @ 2.50GHz\r\n\r\n* Nvidia GT 730 1024GB\r\n\r\n* 4GB RAM\r\n\r\n* HDD 74.4GB, External Hard Drive 500GB\r\n\r\nA few things to point out as well before I start:\r\n\r\n* League is running from the External Hard Drive\r\n\r\n* I do not have an SSD\r\n\r\n* Local Disk (C:), the HDD, only has 4.21 GB out of 74.4GB remaining\r\n\r\n* My PC does not have an internal fan\r\n\r\nSo. Long story short, about a week ago, I started getting FPS drops. Before, I could run League at 200-210fps on Very High settings with drops to like 190fps in teamfights. Now, I'm running my setting on low and still getting 19fps without going above 50 even when just farming. My PC will give me low memory notifications (JUST in League mind you; other games I can run fine) after five minutes in game and will usually bugsplat afterwards, which actually caused me to lose two ranked games.\r\n\r\nSince I don't have an internal fan other than my CPU cooler (I know, I know, so bad, but at the time of the build I didn't have the money to spare, I was on a very tight budget) and it's summer, overheating could be a problem, but honestly, this happens even if I JUST turned my PC on. My point is, even with all these glaring issues with my PC, everything was just fine until a week ago. I haven't installed any new programs, I haven't done anything to my hardware, my PC isn't dusty because I clean it regularly, and it actually isn't overheating, as far as I can tell. I don't run any programs in the background while League is open (with the exception of Discord) and I ran a virus check, which came up clean. I currently do not have the money for upgrades, but even so, this never happened before, so why now?\r\n\r\nI don't know what to do at this point. I know I do not own the greatest PC in the world, but it was my first personal build, it only cost me 160$, and it was chugging along just fine before. I'm hoping that some members of the community could provide some insight on this problem. I can't give you much, but I can offer you a firm pat on the behind for your assistance.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n_-Equinox_","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-28T17:39:07.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, from the information you've provided, there are certainly some factors that I believe could be problematic. First, in most cases, we've seen pretty poor results from running League off an external drive unless the drive and interface are both USB 3.0. \n\nMy suggestions would be to clear up some space on your C:\\ drive with a program like [CCleaner](https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner), then move whatever data your can, over to your external drive. After you've completed that, I suggest uninstalling League from your external drive and installing it on your C:\\ drive in the default directory (**C:\\Riot Games\\**)\n\nLet me know if this caused any change for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vietpz1","date":"2016-08-27T23:13:21.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did it start happening after a client update?","replies":[{"poster":"nacrow","date":"2016-08-27T23:22:54.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes and no.
