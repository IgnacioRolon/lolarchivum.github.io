Later informed that sion is in the institute. Joins to gain his immortality back. (Plot)\n\n“Being around since the beginning is a hard thing to watch, The slow Evolution of savage animal to semi intellectual being. Their Civilizations rise, only to be razed to the ground. Such a trivial thing. I decided to dabble in their affairs. Creating religions and rituals. it was amusing at first. Watching them brainwash one another into who could get the most followers. One group in particular peeked my attention.They called themselves Noxians. I found their approach to leadership, punishment and code of honor to be so unlike everything i have seen in the past. You could say they had my bias.\n\n\tThis was up until they decided to bring back their war general. How foolish they were. I don't know how they did it, creating a ritual. Now reanimation is not what I care about, that's something the shadow isles should doctrine, but Immortality. Not just any Immortality, my immortality.\n\n\tSo I was aggravated, If you could not give me answers to what I asked you were sacrificed. One individual was able to give me information that there was a being introduced to this ‘Institution of War’ that was revived and wreaking havoc, naturally  I decided to join for my own interests. I will get my Immortality back, I will slaughter anyone in my path until I find the one called ‘Sion’”\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n**Basic Stats**\nHealth 490 (+88) (1986 at Max)\nHealth Regen: 8.8 (.86) (23.25 Max)\nMana: N/A\nMana Regen: N/A\nRange: 130 Melee\nDamage: 54 (3.4) (111 Max)\nATK Speed: 0.641 (3%) (Around 1.3 (Bad with %’s))\nArmor: 20 (1.5) (45.5 Max)\nMagic Res.: 30 (1.25) (51.25 Max)\nMovement Speed: 355\n\n\n\n**Passive - Preparing The Ritual**\n\nPassive - Moarte will store all damage dealt to him up to a cap based on his current level (Does not block just stores).\n\nAfter Moarte hits his target at least once  with either a damaging spell or auto attack that target becomes marked with “Aristol’s eye” any attack or damaging ability will do an additional % of missing health over time as magic damage to the target.
