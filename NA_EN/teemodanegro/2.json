I don't care if you or anyone likes it, it didn't do anything to morde except change his garbage play style to another garbage play style of landing 2 q's on minons and flashing q'ing an ADC or something ridiculous.\n\nThat being said, When they reworked him and his Identity went from being a ghost creating Ap carrying machine to a melee support ADC. They didn't provide any gap closer or support(cc's) for him to get from where he is standing to his target.\n\nCool so they essentially made an ADC reliant on another person who has no way to gap close without using flash, AWESOME!\nWhen you're presented with the chance to rework a champion you have to understand what is bad and what is good, then once you understand What is good you can work on ways to get to that GOAL by creating a means.\n\nI say create a means, as in Riot wanted morde to be melee focused. Okay why didn't they give him a CC or slow or gapcloser? How did they think that he would remain in competitive modes without a means to getting kills...\n\n\n\n\n**I LIKED AP MORDE BECAUSE IT WASN'T MELEE BASED AND THE WAY FOR HIM TO GET KILLS WAS PRIMARILY THROUGH E + W + R**, It wasn't the best in the world but it was a bandaid that made playing morde easier.\n\nWhen they reworked him Riot was clear they didn't want you building AP because of his lowered base damages and higher AD scaling...","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-05-26T02:17:16.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can respect that, though I would like to make it known now that I'm no longer interested in debating whether or not the rework was needed or successful.  Looking around the boards its painfully apparent that all engaging the subject will bring is more arguing and hot tempers so perhaps something alittle different is in order?  \n\nThe perspective I've gathered from you is indeed an interesting one and I wonder if its perhaps due to the character becoming to great a puzzle to work with given how easy the old one functioned as we remember.  May I ask then, why do you think Mordekaiser needs to be easier to play in order to be satisfying?","replies":[{"poster":"Teemodanegro","date":"2016-05-26T02:21:21.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> May I ask then, why do you think Mordekaiser needs to be easier to play in order to be satisfying?\n\nOkay, thanks for reading through it all first.\nBut I dont understand why he has to be easier... Adding a gap closer or some sort of CC would simply SOLVE all his problems. If you want you could give him a dash, speed boost, target aimed leaped.\n\nIt won't directly make him easier, it will just make him less frustrating to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-05-26T02:41:32.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But then how could you balance that for the opponent?  Personally, when I started playing Mordekaiser it became more for how frustrating I knew I was being for the enemy.  While it was fun for me I eventually found the other side of that coin and can say that something had to happen to give a game with Morde in it fun for more players than just myself.  Honestly, it was kind of a sobering feeling to know just how frustrating I was to the enemy back when I played him to grind summoner levels.  I feel you very much that giving him a stun or jump could help, but I'm wary to say I want it on him just because it might just bring back that frustration for the enemy once again.  I would like to point out a fair bit of credit where it should be due however in the fact that he does have a speed boost, despite the fact that it is VERY difficult to work with when you are under pressure.","replies":[{"poster":"Teemodanegro","date":"2016-05-26T02:54:19.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Riot gives him a gapcloser, it shouldn't have a slow attached (that way the enemy can stay or run as he pleases) and if they dont want to give him a gapcloser they should give him a slow / cc of some sort to level the playing field.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-05-26T03:11:27.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bit of devils advocate then?  What would you give up for this slow or gapcloser?  With low base stats as is he cant afford to give up much.  The only thing I can personally see there being enough space to dip into would be his late game power but I'd rather not give that up for a minor advantage early game that a slow or jump might grant.  I understand that is not a popular opinion but I'm a firm believer in the fact that we the players have yet to find a worthwhile and satisfying setup to work with the pieces we have at our disposal.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pointy Rock","date":"2016-05-29T08:51:39.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you not know how morde works? \nI've recently picked him up as my main top laner and my fucking god is he one of the biggest ap carries i have ever played in the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-05-26T01:44:57.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, Morde is just an identity crisis champion.
