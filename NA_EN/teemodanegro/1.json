If they don't get locked down entirely, they are very likely a mere 1 movement skill/other positioning tool away from not having to fight under the enemy tower.\n\nThe ranged **autos** means the damage to the objective is largely smoothly and consistently delivered. It's predictable, doesn't consume resources, doesn't come with opportunity costs (e.g.: Ziggs has a turret execute on his Satchel Charge, but has to consider whether he should use it because if he does, he has approximately jack and shit for mobility or escapes if there's a gank incoming. Using the skill creates a window of weakness for him, which AAing does not for an ADC). \n\nCompare and contrast, for example attempting to bring down a tower with a team that is 100% melee. If you get caught, at best you give the opposing team several more seconds to land stuns etc. etc. under tower, at worst are forced to stand and fight  while taking 4-5 tower shots. Your tank might not care but your carries sure will.\n\nSo short version: People play ADCs because the game is won by taking objectives. It doesn't matter how many kills your team has, if the other team takes your Nexus. And while there are plenty of other champions better at securing control over an objective, or the area around it, there are comparitively few non-ADCs who are as good at doing the high amounts of consistent, low-risk DPS needed to safely/efficiently take objectives.","replies":[]}]}
