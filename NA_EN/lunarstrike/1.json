In fact, You should build Liandry&#039;s instead of Ludens 99% of the time, and here&#039;s why:\n\nThe Magic Penetration on Liandry&#039;s grants a great supply of burst, more than Ludens would ever give, no matter the matchup. The only advantage to Ludens is it&#039;s MS and It&#039;s passive (which is quite useless, Becuase 100 (+ 10% AP) bonus will only give you roughly 170+ magic damage to nearby enemies, Which  is unreasonable for it&#039;s price.\n\n&quot;Shouldnt you only build Liandry&#039;s on DPS AP / Tanky enemy?&quot; - I actually got asked this recently. And here&#039;s your answer:\n\nGo on Sandbox mode as Lux, place a dummy down and Combo it with the same build except switching up liandrys with ludens. You&#039;ll see that at full build with Ludens, Youll do roughly 2200 Damage, whilst With Liandrys, You can do well over 2800. This is against a tank (which is the dummy in this case). Against a squishier target, You&#039;ll roughly do 400 more Magic damage to it than you do with Ludens. With Simple Q-E-AA trades, You can do 150+ more damage with Liandrys, Making liandrys a great 3rd item for most mid laners. \n\nWhich Means, If you&#039;re paying 3200 For Ludens, You better be desperate for the Movement speed or that tiny bit of splash, because you&#039;re actually doing less AP for more gold.\n\n___________________________\n\nFor exterior reference, Here's another article supporting my findings.\n\nhttp://www.lolking.net/news/mid-game-itemization-liandrys-vs-ludens","replies":[{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2017-06-20T11:09:39.450+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, movement speed has a high value since it is often the difference between dodging a skill shot or not or being caugh whil fleeing or not.\n\nAlso the dummies are always full HP so the liandry always deals max damages to them. But in a real game you can see liandries procs of 0 when the target is low enough.","replies":[{"poster":"LunarStrike","date":"2017-06-20T11:11:18.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, true, it could save your life Once, maybe twice every game.

You will see squish's HP disappear with a single spell.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-06-20T18:21:20.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">You'll see that at full build with Ludens, Youll do roughly 2200 Damage, whilst With Liandrys, You can do well over 2800.\n\nI'd just like to point out, the target dummy is a horrible way to compare damage when there's %HP damage involved (as is the case with Liandry's) because the dummy has 10K HP and that inflates %HP damage considerably. 2% of 10K is 200 DAM just from the first tick, while against a 3K HP target (which is still a lot even for a tank) it would be just 60 DAM.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir Fuzzi","date":"2017-06-20T11:20:25.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Movement speed.\n\nI find Liandry's is good for starting up the damage train, but Luden's is so much better for closing out kills. You can use normally-weak, insubstantial pokes and they get an extra guaranteed 100 damage slapped on top of their normal damage, plus a bonus 10% of your AP. On champions like Annie who have good bases and scaling, that extra damage can mean making or losing a kill.\n\nHonestly, why not both? Rylai's is the one you want to exclude nowadays since it's less impressive than it used to be, and Liandry's now matches it in stats and has penetration to boot. Luden/Liandry probably fit into the same build easily.\n\nOn the other hand? While you're doing tests, you may want to try it with someone who doesn't have CC on their magic damage. Otherwise, you really are building a Rylai to support your Liandry damage. Lux snare is doubling the Liandry bonus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shad√≤w","date":"2017-06-20T11:15:17.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"10% movement speed are A LOT though\n\nyou can better roam across the map, close gaps, escape, dodge with that.","replies":[]}]}
