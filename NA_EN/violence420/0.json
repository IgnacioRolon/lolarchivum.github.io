I never actually purposefully left a game for any intention but despite completing games each day. I get punished with 10 minute lower priority queue after my internet craps out on my twice in one game. This isn't even fair,I haven't done anything to deserve this. You need to find a better way to sort out who's actually leaving games and who's having computer technical issues. I love this game but I'm not going to waste my time and effort trying to play if I keep getting punished for miss fortunes..this is not even like it's a common issue I play through so many games but as soon as I have one problem I'm back in low priority queue...like what the hell who wants to play a game that forces you to wait an extra 10 minutes to play after you disconnect one time due to connection issues after at least 10 consecutive games before hand that I played with out leaving if not more. I understand you guys want to have a good community and I appreciate that,I think it has built a great community but why why why why can you not appeal the lower priority queue when it's a due to connection issue or some other computer problem. I know I'm probably not making any damn sense,I'm just ranting because this pisses me off so much. Sucks to be this aggravated at one of the only games I like to play lately..","replies":[{"poster":"Violence420","date":"2016-09-19T07:09:26.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After 40 minutes of waiting for a game,I'm giving up on this for a while..I can barely play much as it is due to how busy I am so this may be the end of LoL for me. It's been real.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-19T18:03:57.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely understand that disconnecting from a game is frustrating. It's equally frustrating for everyone else in the match that have to continue to play in your absence. This is why regardless of the reason for the disconnection, the system treats all disconnections equally. This is a key reason why penalties cannot be modified or removed.\n\nIf you're open to it, I'd like to work with you on finding a permanent solution to your disconnections. Far and away, the majority of disconnections are caused by local network settings that prevent the client from establishing a solid connection to the servers. I recommend as a first step, to work through the steps outlined inside of our [connection troubleshooting guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nLet me know if those steps helped improve your connection.","replies":[]}]}]}
