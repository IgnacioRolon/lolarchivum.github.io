I believe the second instance is a bug....I'm sitting in Bronze 4 after placing in iron 2 after going 6/2 in placements vs high gold/mid plat players.  If not, I doubt I'll climb up to where I've been in the past.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2018-12-28T11:03:21.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But your MMR still goes up.\n\nSo you may be Iron 2 but you'd probably end up playing in Gold - Platinum games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-28T04:55:30.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone starts iron now, apparently.
