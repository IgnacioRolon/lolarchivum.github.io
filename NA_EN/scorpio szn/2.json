If you stun Syndra mid ult, you're still going to see her cast animation and see her use her abilities. When Zoe launches the first Q, the abilities already out. If you stun Xerath mid cast start, it won't stop it from going off. If you stun Vlad mid cast it'll still go off.\nW - This is because not all summoners are offensive. Adding the movement speed on top of it adds skill expression allowing you to reposition yourself. If you get exhaust for instance, you can exhaust with W, reposition yourself to land your E and follow up with a combo. None of this would be possible w/o those small addons to the spell. The balls do almost no damage and the movement speed is negligible.\nE - Most mages have some way to zone, Xerath Q, Velkoz splash knock-up. This is a good way to add zoning to her kit. I think the through the walls part of the E was to allow for her to be a jungle. It used to be that her E got a cooldown reset for landing on minions. So they definitely wanted to see her jungle as well. Nobody's using her in that capacity though.","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2018-08-07T05:05:41.592+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"Your explanation for Q is wrong and with faulty comparisons because her Q is a 2-cast spell. Your example of Syndra, Xerath (doesn't his Q get cancelled while charging up anyways??), and Vlad all only have 1 cast or button press which is \"charged up\" or just has a long delivery in Syndra's case\n\nIf you wanted to use an actual valid comparison, you don't need to look further than Anivia's and Velkoz's Q which are a legitimate 2-cast spell unless they time out. They cast Q once to send it out, and casts again to explode it. If they get stunned before the 2nd cast, the ability proceeds as if the second cast was opted out of. *That's* how Zoe's Q should function, because her Q is a 2 cast spell.\n\nAs for the W explanation...you only addressed the one thing OP said he was ok with. Literally said he's alright with the movement speed but the extra damage is unneeded. \n\nAnd you'd think her splash damage Q would be viewed as her \"zoning\" tool given it's long delivery and easier comparison to both Velkoz and Xerath Q. I think her E seems much more comparable to Velkoz and Xerath E's, their only CC as long-range immobile mages. Unlike both, Zoe gets something for missing her E and unlike Xerath, she isn't punished for using E at short ranges.","replies":[{"poster":"TitanAnteus","date":"2018-08-07T08:12:06.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"It's her only damaging ability and only zones when it lands. Seriously look at other mages with more map control then her at the moment. It's why when she gets ganked after casting E she's dead.\nXerath's got crazy range on his.\nVlad's E is not just one cast. He can cast it again to set it off early. His Q is one cast though. He can second cast the E if he's stunned..\n\nThe W does barely any extra damage on its own. Go into practice tool. Take heal or flash or whatever and flash onto a caster minion. Look at how much the orbs provide in damage to a caster minion for yourself.\n\nDoesn't Velkoz's E go straight through minions? Isn't Xerath's E on a 6 second cooldown rank 1, with barely any mana cost? Zoe Es and boom goes her mana, and the splash zone gets eaten by minions. The splash is not very strong in laning. It's only strong in the jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"HeimerLmao","date":"2018-08-07T20:01:19.587+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1: Vlad's E is a channel. CC stops it and causes it to go off instantly. Same goes for things like Nunu's ult. Zoe's Q isn't a channel, it's a 2 time cast ability, which shouldn't be possible to use while CCd. Also \"it's her only damage ability\" isn't an excuse for that either. That's how stuns work. That's why they are a counter to high damage threats. They stop their damage and movement, allowing them to be picked off. Imagine if a stun didn't stop Vayne's autoattacks, cause they are her only damage option.\n2: If her W does barely any extra damage, then why is it a thing? She already has a powerful ability just cause of the free summoners.\n3: Xerath's E has a 13 second cd rank one, and I don't know where did you find that 6 seconds bullshit. Mana isn't a problem for Zoe past her lost chapter, and that's her first or second back. The splash may not be very strong in laning, it's still unnecesary. For example, we have Lux Q, which has similar purpose (setting up a high damage combo), she has to hit it, and while it does hit two targets, it doesn't have the wall-travelling range of Zoe's E. I think it would be a fair tradeoff, if not the trap part. It's literally a 4 second killzone for everyone that isn't a tank or a bruiser. You walk in? You are already dead. It doesn't make sense for a mage/assasin champion with high amount of burst to have this zone control, considering she also has mobility, range AND utility with free summoners and items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2018-08-09T06:07:10.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gamomg already responded to you (I noticed you lack a response to it), but I wanted to point out that you still failed to address the two issues I mentioned about her E.

Also hitting an E from 3000 units away means there's no way in hell she can follow up with a Q fast enough especially with merc treads.\nAlso the hitbox is not that generous and there's a bug where the projectile will just phase through the target and not hit which is incredibly odd.\nHer R is arguably one of the most powerful parts of her kit, she can avoid and dodge basically any skillshot on an 11 or less second cooldown and costing only 50 mana.
