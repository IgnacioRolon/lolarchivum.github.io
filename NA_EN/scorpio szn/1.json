You may attempt to stop me on my path, but you will fail nonetheless.” - Aurora, The Forerunner_\n\n_Considered one of the most peerless sorceresses’ on Runeterra, Aurora is a sociopathic, zealous archmage who has devoted her life’s work to gather the World Runes - fragments of the raw magic that once shaped the world from nothingness. Descended from a family of powerful mages dating back thousands of years, she is among the very few with the capability to utilize Rune Magic. Aurora views herself as the 'Chosen Mage' who’s destiny it is to gather all the World Runes, using their immeasurable power to usher in a new era on Runeterra where all of its chaotic civilizations are united under her will._\n\n**Forerunner**\n___\n\n_Aeons ago before the current manifestation of Runetera was known, Aurora was the secret apprentice of Sylvia the Wise, a powerful sorcerer and one of the leading members of an ancient order whose mission had been to gather and protect the most dangerous artifacts in Runeterra._\n\n_Although world wide knowledge of the artifacts only became apparent before the First Great Cleansing, Sylvia would train her apprentice on missions that would enhance her arcane prowess and battle stamina. An abandoned and orphaned girl, Aurora was bred to fend for herself during her upbringing, and had a rather unusual form of sorcery that even her master failed to fully grasp. Strong willed, brave, and ready to prove herself worthy in the eyes of the one who gave her a purpose, she was the perfect weapon for Sylvia's plot._ \n\n_Many of the artifacts Aurora would be sent to gather were the usual arcane weapons and eldritch scrolls, but to her surprise she was sent to retrieve a perplexing relic called a World Rune. Said to contain magics unfathomably powerful, it was the acolytes final test to prove herself worthy of the title - sorcerer._\n\n_The World Rune that was to be claimed as Slyiva's was located in the Noxii territories, long after tensions built up concerning it's place among the locals. Instructed to result to lethal force as a last resort, Aurora only resorted to slaying her adversaries if they chose to oppose her at the the temple of Noxii, and once the young apprentice came in contact with the Rune itself an event would incur that would bring forth the next era on Runeterra._ \n\n_She had slayed two primordial temple guardians as a testament to her worthiness, and once she got hold of the Rune itself the ground itself began to vibrate as if a power had been freed from its grasp. The outlining perimeters of the temple radiated with powers beyond human explanation, and upon removing the Rune from its encasing entirely Runeterra yielded to it's destiny._\n\n_At the village of Khom the last living witnesses of Aurora's first claiming pleaded in awe as the earth fell away beneath them, the bedrock itself seeming to retch and squeal, while the sky above them recoiled as if mortally wounded. While many perished upon coming in contact with the devastating powers of the rune itself, Aurora relished in it - becoming invigorated by the cleansing flames and leading to her own personal quest, one that would have her \"unravel\" each and every World Rune to sustain herself off their concealed energies._\n\n_In Aurora's eyes she was chosen to wield the power first hand while thousands other succumbed to it's destructive might, but above all else her master's initial teachings remained within her heart despite her \"ascended\" form. The magical relics Runeterra houses are innately seductive to any who can comprehend what power truly means, but as the Forerunner she would be Runeterra's \"savior\" in gathering and protecting runes, even if any and all reject her chosen destiny._\n\n>___\n\n\n**Overview**\n___\n\n**Roles**\nPrimary: _Skirmisher_\nSecondary: _Battlemage_\n\n**Attack Form**\n_Melee_\n\n**Position**\n_Top -  Mid - Jungle_\n\n**Generic Playstyle**\n_Skirmishing, Split Pushing_\n\n**Difficulty**\n_3/3_\n\n**Damage**\n_2/3_\n\n**Toughness**\n_2/3_\n\n**Control**\n_2/3_\n\n**Utility**\n_1/3_\n\n**Mobility**\n_3/3_\n\n**Statistics**\nHealth: 575 (+85)\nHealth Regen: 8.5 (+ 0.55)\nMana: 325 (+55)\nMana Regen: 6 (+ 0.7)\nRange: 150\nAttack Damage: 64 (+3.275)\nAttack Speed: 0.625 (+3.5%)\nArmor: 34 (+3.5)\nMagic Resist: 32.1 (+1.25)\nMovement Speed: 345\n\n**Kit Changes**\n___\n\n* _Minor cool down changes, damage changes, and range changes across all abilities for balancing purposes._\n\n* _Healing mechanic to Q that increases based on Testament stacks._\n\n* _New mechanic (\"gimmick\") to W which has greater synergy with her kit as a whole._\n\n* _Removed bonus armor and mr from ultimate in favor of putting more power into the shield itself to better express the ability's fantasy._\n\n**Abilities (Brief Description)**\n___\n\n**Innate - Testament of the Forerunner:** _Whenever Aurora deals magic damage to an enemy champion or large/epic monster with an ability she gains 1 Testament stack for a short duration.

Begin the crusade with Pious Cascade to build Testament stacks, whittling your opponents down and sustaining yourself. When the opportunity arises, correct use of Arcane Assault will inflict susceptible burst and grant you the upper hand with an added effect to your next ability. If your opponents attempt to retaliate against you, clever timing of Runic Reprisal can shrug off their worst counter attack while allowing you to turn the tide of the fight with its second cast._\n\n_If you are challenged by a confrontation that requires the aid of the World Runes themselves, activate Zeal of the Saint and gain a super shield that manifests itself over a short duration. Once your enemies are ready to yield to their destiny, trigger Eschaton to cut their life strings, outright executing any and all who remain within the impacted area._\n\n>___\n\n**Tips N Tricks**\n___\n\n* _Testament of the Forerunner grants Aurora magic penetration in prolonged fights, allowing you to shred even the most durable of targets._\n\n* _ Pious Cascade will deal bonus magic damage to those in the middle. Ensure that you continuously hit enemies within the center for maximum damage output._\n\n* _Pious Cascade will heal Aurora if she damages an enemy in the center but the value is reduced if an enemy champion or large/epic monster isn't hit._\n\n* _Pious Cascade's heal increases based on Testament stacks, amplifying her sustain at max stacks._\n\n* _Arcane Assault's will mark the target for a brief duration, granting a bonus effect to the next basic ability that deals magic damage to consume it._\n\n* _Arcane Assault is best used when following up with another ability instantly. Do you prefer to bolster your mobility with a burst of speed or amplify your crowd control to lock down an enemy?_\n\n* _Arcane Assault's mark can only be triggered by her basic abilities dealing magic damage (Q Center Hit - E 2nd Cast)._\n\n* _Triggering Arcane Assault's mark will grant 1 additional Testament stack, allowing you to build stacks swiftly._\n\n* _Runic Reprisal is most useful when you know an enemy spell is inevitable and you need to shrug it off, utilizing the spell shield to absorb the ability and it's short dash to reposition yourself._\n\n* _Runic Reprisal will not only absorb abilities, but also ability triggered auto attacks modifiers (Nasus Q, Camille Q, Jax W, Fiora E, Kassadin W) and on hit abilities (Gangplank Q, Ezreal Q, etc)._\n\n* _Runic Reprisal has a second dash that can be utilized, but only if the spell shield absorbed an ability from the first cast. If you desire the second half of this ability in any given situation ensure the spell shield will absorb an ability._\n\n* _The second cast of Runic Reprisal costs mana. Make sure you have mana to spend for both casts before activating the first._\n\n* _Flash can be utilized during Runic Reprisal's second cast to surprise your opponents (akin to Gragas' Body Slam &amp; Camille's Wall Dive)._\n\n* _ You can take advantage of Runic Reprisal’s second cast stun to ensure your other abilities hit your enemies._\n\n* _Zeal of the Saint greatly amplifies your defensive capabilities but is still no match against focus fire from to many enemies. Because of this it's best suited against a delayed nuke or in an extended 1v1 or 1v2 where the shield will be able to soak up damage._\n\n* _Despite being a second cast, Eschaton costs mana. Make sure you have mana to spend for both casts before activating Zeal Of The Saint._\n\n* _You can trigger Zeal of the Saint before a team fight or duel is destined to begin and you want to enter the battle with a massive shield while also empowering Eschaton’s damage._\n\n* _Eschaton's initial strike will deal minor physical damage to those hit but the impact crater will erupt and deal magic damage to nearby enemies. Combine this with your allies other abilities to ensure your enemies remain within the impacted area for maximum damage output._\n\n* _Eschaton’s damage increases based on how long the Zeal of the Saint has been active. It’s imperative that if you’re activating Zeal of The Saint it’s for a drawn out fight where Eschaton will be able to scale overtime._\n\n>___\n\n**Design Philosophy**\n___\n\n_The initial spark for my fantasy to create Aurora was the Arcane Warrior mage class from the game Dragons Age Origins due to a not so recent play through. This class, as their name may suggest, are a specialized group of mages trained their magical arts to augment their martial prowess. They channel magical power through their weapons and bodies to become terrors on the battlefield. I wanted and had to portray this on the rift; a melee mage who converts their magics into destructive melee attacks that can wreak havoc, but can also bolster their own defensive capabilities._\n\n_When designing Aurora, the one thing I set out to accomplish is to create a melee AP champion that didn't rely heavily on blowing someone or to lock them down as a cc bot. but something in between; an AP skirmisher that relied on hitting their spells like a battle mage to maximize their sustained damage output (think of a Mordekaiser that naturally scales harder). She plays almost entirely identical to an Arcane Warrior if you've played DAO, because their key characteristic is being able to cast spells continuously like a battle mage but also inflict devastating melee attacks despite being a mage in melee range. They also wear heavy armor like a typical warrior or knight would rather than a mage (signifying the fact they aren’t as squishy as their counterparts)._\n\n_Because I wanted Aurora to be a hybrid between a skirmisher (duelist) and a battle mage (team fighter) she had to be a jack of all trades, a good team fighter and duelist but not the best at either. While battle mages are easily the best duelists of the mage class, they are far more effective and dangerous in team fights. However, because Aurora is half skirmisher she has the capability to duel most of the champion roster excluding true duelists such as Jax, Fiora, Tryndamere and Master Yi (Pure Skirmishers). This intended design choice would give more diversity to the Aurora player in their build paths and even macro decisions, allowing each and every game to play out differently._\n\n>____\n\n**Items**\n___\n\n_Aurora's flexible kit naturally scales with items that grant a mixture of ability power, health, mana, and cool down reduction. Because her kit lacks the burst potential of most other AP champions she functions better with an AP bruiser build to survive and inflict powerful sustained damage over a prolonged time._\n\n**Starting**\n{{item:1027}} {{item:2003}} {{item:3361}}\n\n**Early**\n{{item:1001}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3010}}\n\n**Essential**\n{{item:3027}} {{item:3151}}\n\n**Standard**\n{{item:3003}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3100}}\n\n**Situational**\n{{item:3165}} {{item:2065}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3152}}\n\n**Defensive**\n{{item:3102}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3001}}\n\n**Consumable**\n{{item:2031}} {{item:2055}} {{item:2138}} {{item:2139}}\n\n>____\n\n**Builds**\n\n_Below is some of the possible build that I've brainstormed which all have tremendous synergy with Aurora’s kit, shedding light on how truly diverse I want her to be as a champion.

The fact that the outside cone does physical damage and not much of it makes that part of the ability seem pretty arbitrary. It's not like camille's q that rewards spacing properly because you just use it when you're up in your enemy's face already.\n\nAlso I think these cooldowns are a bit low on a champ that's supposed to be about cdr. E is ok, but I'd make the cooldown start after the spell shield dissipates (not consumed), and after the second dash if it becomes available. 2.2 sec cooldown on q with max cdr is kinda busted, especially when it has that heal. W cooldown could also go to a 6 or 7 sec cooldown, bc with cdr it hits 2.75 seconds, which is also broken when you consider that it empowers her abilities as well as her autos.\n\nSeems like the main difference between a good aurora and bad aurora player is the e use.\n\nBtw not trying to flame, just criticism on the problem points I noticed","replies":[{"poster":"Scorpio Szn","date":"2019-12-09T16:32:36.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You’re right cool downs were a little to much. \n\nThe W is 6 seconds at all ranks now and the E is 9 seconds at max rank. \n\nI’m hesitant on touching the q cool down cause it’s her bread and butter and similar ap champs have max cd on their Q (4 sec).
