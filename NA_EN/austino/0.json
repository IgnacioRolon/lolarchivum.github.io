I played just last night before the patch and everything was running smoothly, and then I patch the game and I can't jump into the game due to an unknown directx error? I know it isnt my gfx card because I just ran Overwatch and WoW on it to test it... Riot please don't let me get leaverbuster'd because of this.... pls fix ASAP\n\nEDIT: Went into  C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config and deleted game.cfg file, then I launched the game using lol.admin. It seems to work because i just tested the game in practice mode.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-03T20:14:31.785+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've been looking into an issue where some PC players are getting a DirectX error, and the cause may be an issue with some custom resolution.  In this case, we're recommending deleting the Config folder as a work around, which will restore your resolution and settings to default so you can get back in-game.  Glad that worked out for you!","replies":[{"poster":"Austino","date":"2017-05-03T21:13:09.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can I get back my 20lp that I lost due to this? any other leaver buster penalties held against me?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-03T21:17:48.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks you lost that LP, sorry dude.  :(  We can't adjust game stats, but we can take a look at leaverbuster situations on a case by case basis.  Hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and we'll see if we can do anything- without guarantees.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
