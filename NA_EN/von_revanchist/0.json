It's great that he can hit you three times and carry you with him because he cares for you that much! and then just one shot spits you out, I have so much fun when that happens I cry tears of happiness. Another thing that is great about tahm is his passive that gives him 2 life bars! O man if I didn't have fun draining his life the first time i get to do a second time! haha but the great part is he gets away yay!! I slam my fists on my desk in celebration!!!!! =D and here is the best part you can't get away from him between his Q and R. It feels good that he cares so much he doesn't want to go anywhere without you!

Several release level champs got similar treatments-- Zyra comes to mind.\n\nMy only objection to Tahm is his ult passive. Why does a support get the best on hit passive on a tank?

They announced they would be changing velkoz up a bit so that he would be better, and then everyone lost their shit at the mere thought, because apparently 3 skill shots, a stacking passive that just deals more damage, and a stand-in-place ult is super exciting!\n\nI also like how you are talking about how tahm was fine at release and was overbuffed, illao is going to be the same, meanwhile velkoz \"cries in a corner\", which I'm taking you to mean that he's on the weaker side (I agree with you), but at the same time everyone also cried that velkoz is perfectly balanced\n\nI'm not disagreeing with you or anything, because, in fact, I agree with you.

Oh, and his grey health doesn't regenerate unless you leave him alone; same deal as Garen, only more limited because he can only regen the grey health.\n\nNever mind that it is entirely possible in the laning phase to NOT let him hit you three times in a row, or that his only hard CC relies on this. Unlike, say, Blitzcrank's one-hit pull that can move you further than Tahm ever could, or Taric's point-n-click stun. (Had a game as Tahm where in the first 8+ minutes I couldn't land 3 stacks on either enemy player without blowing Q, because they knew not to let him close the gap). He stacks by AAing, which draws minion aggro, meaning that to proc stacks he has to tank the entire minion wave.\n\nNever mind that his ult is cancelled so easily that a Tahm facing average-IQ or higher opponents generally shouldn't be able to use it in the middle of combat (seriously, a single AA will stop it). Oh, and he roots himself while channeling it, so try using those skillshot abilities.\n\nNever mind that he scales best by stacking health as a defensive stat, which is countered by both a staple ADC item {{item:3153}} and a situational pick {{item:3034}} / {{item:3036}}.\n\nNever mind that outside of the aforementioned easily cancelled ult, he has no mobility. None.\n\nNever mind that his Q can be blocked by minions; the same defense that is widely agreed to be acceptable counterplay for Blitzcrank.\n\ntl;dr Don't play aggressively, and if he pops his shield wait it out.

He currently sits at 46.26% for support (22nd out of 25) and 48.41% for top (36th out of 56). Literally the only positive attribute that stands out when looking at his stats anymore is he's near the top in damage taken, yet is also near the top in not dying.
