Was winning game, and then started lagging hard. Game crashed and forced a search on my files to find the issue. Because of this, i did not get back into game. The enemy team surrendered before i could load back in. I was not awarded IP, but also not hit with a leaver buster.  Is my IP lost or is there a way i can get this back?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-12T22:00:03.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting marked as a leaver disqualifies an account from receiving IP, EXP, or LP for that match.  I know leaving was not intentional, but the [Leaverbuster ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)system treats all leaves equally because they still cause others a negative experience.  It sounds like your patcher was identifying and repairing potentially corrupt game data.  Hopefully, the issue is now resolved but I recommend going over our [Game Crash ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes)guide just in case.","replies":[{"poster":"YamiJoeysFriend","date":"2016-07-29T03:47:20.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your help, I'll look through it and see what i can do to prevent this in the future.","replies":[]}]}]}
