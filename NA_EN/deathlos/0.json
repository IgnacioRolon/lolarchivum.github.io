Most of the time once the enemy has acquired lvl 2 boots, unless you land the Q on them 100% center, they are going to walk out of it, and even when you do hit it in the exact center, the mobility creep leaves most champions with a way to dodge it.\r\n\r\nThis Hinders His ability to gank coming from the jungle, and His ability Initiate late game team fights, its too much provided on them making a mistake rather then the Good play from cho.\r\n\r\nNow what are our solutions? Right now if we reduce the time that Q takes to go off, we are just making him overpowered, as now its very hard to dodge, and provides too much CC for the ease of use.\r\n\r\nMy Suggestion, Is to make Cho'Gath's Q a cone ability similar to his W, About the same range/area, A bit slower on the \"missile\" speed till the end.(Think Zyra Ultimate.) It has a scaling Knockup and slow. 1.5-1sec knockup and 50%-20% slow increasing the closer you are to Cho'Gath.(All numbers are subject to change, it's a general idea not the exact numbers i want.)\r\n\r\nThis would help out his Ganks from the jungle as it would be alot more consistent to land. While it won't help his late game initiationit would basically require flash Q it would solidify him as a very good Peeler and tank disrupter, which at this moment in time is to inconsistent to be overly viable at higher levels of play.\r\n\r\nThoughts, Opinions?","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-01-18T12:16:23.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, see... the problem with what you're wanting is something that would remove the one thing that Cho uses to catch enemies so that he can actually get close enough to do damage to them. If you're in melee range with a Cho'Gath and he didn't CC you for him to get near you, you're either dumb, crazy, or you're also a melee and you're trying to get him off your carry or he's that last one alive and you're melee. His current Q is a great way to catch people with how much damage it does, plus the fact it's a knock up and slow all in one. It's a bit harder to hit, but when you land it, your opponent is screwed. If you had to flash and Q just to be able to CC them, then all they have to do is burn any of their lower CD escape tools. The one thing you should never EVER have to worry about when you play a melee champion is having to use your Flash as your only method of getting close to a target. The only other champion who has this issue is Mordekaiser and he's in a horrible spot right now. Every other champion has some kind of ranged CC, speed boost, or something. Cho has his long range, rather large area knock up that's on a nice cool down. \n\nPersonally, to fix Cho, I'd say to make it cast even faster the closer he uses it to himself. Normal cast rate at max range and progressively casting faster the closer Cho uses it to himself, making it a incredibly scary when you're in melee range with him and all of a sudden you're now flying into the air going 'OH CRAP'.","replies":[]}]}
