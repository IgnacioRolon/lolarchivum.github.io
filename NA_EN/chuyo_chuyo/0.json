I&#039;m unranked and it was him and his 3 other buddies that didn&#039;t talk much in the game, but this dude was beyond belief toxic. The type that insists: &quot;no one loves you&quot; or the &quot;you&#039;re lonely af i bet.&quot; and not that it got to me, but this game idk made me more sad than anything else. That people like that play this game and the fact his 4 friends didn&#039;t condone anything he said, they just stayed quiet. League of Legends just repeatably makes me sad for players like that and idk what it is about this game that does that to people. \nP.S I don&#039;t have screen shots so this isn&#039;t a report on the dude, but more using him as an example + I wish i did take screen shots because this guy is probably one of the most stuck up toxic players I&#039;ve seen.","replies":[{"poster":"KumikÃ´","date":"2018-04-17T19:59:56.240+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LoL changed my life from a man who love living\nto a shit that wants to kill himself","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lakega","date":"2017-11-27T00:06:38.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because this game is the definition of toxicity. IT puts 10 random people into a game environment that is insanely frustrating to play in, where defending yourself, or pointing out teammates flaws or simply asking them not to do something instantly gets you targetted by your whole team as \"Toxic\" and you get flammed for the rest of the game. Sometimes even by the enemy team who didn't even see the chat. \n\nThen that said person goes into another game, already pissy from the first, and gets 2 back to back losses because another teammate doesn't have the IQ to play safe if he's behind, and attempts to ask the feeder to play safer, only to get flamed and harrassed again for it. Most likely with his team claiming he's the toxic one, and \"not working with the team\". \n\nThis results in toxic behavior for EVERYONE. Even the giggly little fucks who are trying to white knight and attack you for not worshiping their ass at every turn. Remember if you don't say how amazingly well your teammate is doing, and dare to ask him to play safe when he's 0/11/2 You're toxic!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Some Noob Dude","date":"2017-11-26T04:37:44.713+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please removed the name of the player from the post, calling out people on the forums isn't allowed.","replies":[{"poster":"Chuyo Chuyo","date":"2017-11-26T21:01:50.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry I didn't know, this was my first post, i removed it!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Raeyxx","date":"2017-11-26T04:55:49.783+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Name and Shame goes against forum policy.

Its simple how League of Legends catches people lets say the average player is 12 to 15 Years old or older and someway lonely. So they play the game, more and more they will win and lose, if they win they will have luck feeling just like you play casino, and if you lose your mind is telling you it was a bad investment. If it says that, you will play and play again because you want that good feeling back. Your spending money on the expensive skins or more. The most people don't recognize that it's really expensive and they will lose the feeling for their money. So they win and the mind gets more fascinated by the game - so you will spend more money. And when the people lose they will rage because they WANT to spent money.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tactrix","date":"2017-11-26T21:09:35.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League and MOBAS in general are a very poor design in terms of toxicity. These types of games are literally built to disappoint, think about it. It's a team of people that are expected to play equal or good, if anything or anyone does badly the entire team goes on tilt, now the smart players don't let it tilt them but everyone else absolutely loses their mind and hence loses the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cheeseburger57","date":"2017-11-26T07:27:51.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, what it all comes down to is that they're losers in real life.

Due to they're used to being able to say what they want. But that's just the internet giving them that anonymous cloak makes them feel that sense of no remorse for their words. In most games, players can say what they want without consequence. \n\nHowever, Riot is fighting against that. If you ever feel that a player or players are ruining your experience in League of Legends, you can always report them. If you feel you need to go into more detail, send a ticket to Riot Support. They'll help you out there. With that said, just because Riot is fighting against toxicity, doesn't mean you can too by retaliating a response in chat. What I recommend is to mute them and then report them. Just don't tolerate their toxicity by keeping them unmuted. Simply report them after the game. Just don't type back to them. Just play the game as intended and report them after.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Has No Team","date":"2017-11-26T04:36:48.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It brings out the competitive nature in people.

Sometimes we forget that they are humans with lives and families too, and then there's anonymity as well, where someone could be trolling or having a bad game, but you can't ever really tell. So the loss of control and power makes people feel insecure and so they take it out on others. Then there's the trolls that were either banned previously and are getting back at riot or just like to force people into dealing with them for 20+ minutes. Being held hostage is only made possible through a team-oriented game where you're not allowed to leave without punishment, which makes trolls powerful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-11-26T04:27:14.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because they are already trash.\n\nAll free pvp games attract trash due to their desire to prove their superiority over anonymous people that will never see them again, as they are worthless pathetic scum in real life and nobody cares about them or their angry ego.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Built to Tylt","date":"2017-11-26T04:24:32.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Like attracts like.
