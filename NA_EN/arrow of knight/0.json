For instance, My client will not tell me queue has popped occasionally. With a 100% success rate issue, the timer is always de-synced from everyone else, saying that it is the picks above me turn, while everyone else is seeing that it's my turn, therefore not allowing me to pick a champ and being kicked from the lobby. Another issue is that once or twice every game, I get a really bad 'disconnect' from League and watch the old minion fight for eternity. It lasts anywhere from 5-10 seconds. I have attempted to repair my game and to no avail. Thanks for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-16T18:34:17.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you queue and accept a match, the server scoops everyone up and moves them into champion select together.  It sounds like you are not getting a notification from our server that a match was found and getting left behind due to a connection issue with your network.  \n\nDisconnecting from games also reinforces that you might be experiencing a connection issue, and I recommend going over the steps provided in our [Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to get this fixed up.  I hope that helps clear up what's happening, and these steps help get you back into game asap!","replies":[]}]}
