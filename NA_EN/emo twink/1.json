Not suffering mana issues\r\n2.  Good waveclear (especially for an assassin)\r\n3. Can get hexdrinker into a rough matchup and be almost unkillable while mages can&#039;t do the same (suffer mana issues, seekers is useless)\r\n4. Post-lv 3 can all in any squishy from full health (electrocute + ignite, his passive damage etc). Maybe a problem with electrocute but one small combo and hell just kill them or send them back easily.\r\n5. To not die so easily to prior point, stand back and he hard zones any squishy.\r\n6. A great roamer, esp with youmuus and his  mobility.\r\n7. People act like killing someone is high skill when its just button mashing with his ult, easier to hit than it&#039;s made out to be. Does a ton more of damage.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know, I&#039;m just another whiny person like everyone else on gameplay boards. He can snowball hard, and even though as soon as he gets to late game he struggles more, he is just so frustrating to deal with and go against. Maybe it&#039;s electrocute&#039;s damage pre-6 that makes it rougher, but even at 6 he can easily all in cuz his ult is on click and increases damage from all his abilities which are easily hit onto it, so dying to it feels unfair. It&#039;s an ult, it should do decent damage but either have more damage relying on his ult and decrease from his other abilities, or use the ult as more of a mobility and rely on damage from his q or something.\r\n\r\nHe needs some proper weaknesses, falling off late game isn&#039;t much of one. Even a decent weakness would just be buffing seeker&#039;s armguard. It needs its armor to stack through farming, and doesn&#039;t offer or block much damage either. It needs a better passive to protect mages against AD champs. If mages are going to suffer major mana issues from not going lost chapter, **seekers needs worth the purchase**. \r\n\r\n&quot;Then go stopwatch&quot; is another point, but it&#039;s single use, and once you use it youll need to buy seekers straight after for some protection at least, until zhonyas. But that delays mana building so much, and means you&#039;ve died, or been poked out, so much. \r\n\r\nJust I hope these made sense. Zed has a major lack of weaknesses early, and is so infuriating to go against. Seekers, the anti-ad item for mages doesn&#039;t protect as much as it should, and either one should be looked at to increase counterplay. Magic resist is much stronger than armor, so it&#039;s easier to counter ap assassins by just a null cloak, but armor is both weaker than it, and lethality cancels it out. There&#039;s barely any protective options around for mages, and I&#039;m honestly surprised it wasnt touched during mage rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Aerial Queen Liz","date":"2018-05-01T14:47:11.484+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":3,"body":"I just ban him if I'm on an ADC or a Mage, there's no real solution to come on top when he ults in a 1vs1, you always need a tank or a support to peel for you and cc him...","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-05-01T17:08:03.412+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":5,"body":"...so like any assassin?","replies":[{"poster":"Heckin Support","date":"2018-05-01T20:29:24.936+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=chipndip1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Wswn4ezA,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-05-01T17:08:03.412+0000)\n>\n> ...so like any assassin?\n\nWhile I agree that late game an assassin should be able to pick off people in a 1v1, his early game is *too* safe.

At level 6 you say hide under tower. He can 1 shot you and escape with only 1 tower shot.\nHis problem is he has kill pressure at level 3. So he can't 100-0 you unless you position badly, but he can chunk you, wait 20 seconds and do it again. Or if hes already been poking you (as he should be) then he can finish you off at this point. There isn't really a counterplay to him unless he's bad.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Who Fed Ru","date":"2018-05-04T15:04:40.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gonna save that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Trixsta","date":"2018-05-01T17:12:04.270+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":28,"body":"1.

So dodge that 2nd q combo and u hard zone the zed for 20seconds..\n\nSee #1 (the first 1). Zone him with what? Your amazing mage autos? His EHP is 125% of the typical mage at level 1 and the gap only increases from there. Lux can literally spam E at rank 1 or 2 until she is at 0 mana, and it's not enough damage to kill Zed with level 1 base stats and a D Blade. \n\nFun fact: Lux can land QEaa (with 30 AP) and it deals 25% of Zed's EHP; he uses WQ during her autos and he deals 30% of Lux's EHP. If she's still in range of the shadow when her root breaks, Zed uses W recast Eaa, dealing a total of 59% of her EHP. He gets an Electrocute proc, putting him at 71% of her EHP. Ignite puts him at 86% of her EHP. If he gets one more auto on her, and she took at least 2 minion hits in the trade, Zed gets the kill at level 3. Even if he doesn't get the kill, he just won lane.\n\nThat's what OP means by Zed passively zoning. He can literally eat a Lux combo, and she's the one that could potentially die because she got in aa range of him. Meanwhile, she literally doesn't have enough mana to kill him if she spammed spells and hit 100% of them.\n\n>4.Zed can't effectively roam unless he has a lead.\n\nCorrect. And since he has a lead baked into his kit for free, effective roaming is his baseline.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thilmer","date":"2018-05-01T21:37:15.607+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"The core of the problem is that Riot is convinced that this {{item:3191}}  is the AP equivalent of this {{item:3155}} .\n\nYeah, they really think these two ítems are similar in terms of power.

Zed's \"Lack of weaknesses\" is entirely based on his opposition being retarded.\n\nIn the real world, Zed has several pronounced weaknesses.\n\n1: His W has a fucking gigantic cooldown. This one's important, and ties into several things.\n2: Using his W to effectively poke requires landing two skill shots from two angles, and the damage is heavily mitigated if either of them hit anything (like.. say.. a minion..) prior to making contact with a champion. If you're constantly eating double Q's without any intervening target, you're supposed to suffer heavily.\n3: Zed's W is a one way ticket; if he uses it to go in there's no coming back out. If you all-in a mage too early, especially with creeps, they will kill you.\n4: Zed's W removes his ability to escape. If Zed W's to poke, he has a 20 second window where he cannot escape ganks or engage (without ulti), leaving him open to being zoned, ganked, or poked.\n5: Zed sacrifices his W (his primary escape and poke tool) in order to effectively clear waves.. Leaving him, you guessed it, vulnerable.\n6: Zed's burst is delayed. Regardless of how you feel about Zed's R, the way it functions gives it more counter play than most damage sources in the game.\n\nZed is not without his strengths. His ulti lets him juke CC, he has an extraordinarily long threat range (though he becomes less threatening the more ground he has to cover) with his W and R, R re-activation gives him escape options, he's manaless, he has decent wave clear. \n\nAfter the recent rebalancing even Phreak, a literal ADC main, was saying that Zed wasn't given the compensation he deserved... and he wasn't in a great place PRIOR to those changes!

Lee falls off because it's not only harder for him to access priority targets due to the fact that you can body-block his gapcloser, but his scaling also leaves something to be desired and his offensive tools double as defensive ones - meaning he has to be more careful about when and where he uses them.\n\nAs for Caitlyn, it's certainly no secret that ADCs are busted and they have extensive changes coming up soon.","replies":[{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2018-05-04T14:35:56.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Lee Sin builds an assassination build he can 1 shot just like Zed.

Lee Sin has 1160+480% AD in his kit, and his 8% missing HP is attached to his gapcloser, meaning it will likely be used when he engages and not as effective. Zed (assuming double Shuriken hit and counting R amplification) has 945 + 503% AD and 15.5% missing HP which is guaranteed to go off when target is low, ensuring maximum effectiveness. Zed's missing HP damage is almost double of what Lee has and is always applied at low HP, and high scaling means that, Zed only needs around 40 AD more to break even with Lee Sin's flat damage - which he will always have by the virtue of his R passive.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the ease of target access and escape. Lee Sin has to hit a bodyblockable skillshot on his main target where Zed doesn't have to worry about that. Zed also has a much easier time escaping after a succesful (or failed) assassination. Lee can 1-combo shot if he goes glass cannon (as can every other champion), but he sure as hell isn't as good as real assassins.","replies":[{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2018-05-08T21:35:58.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if that's the case Zed also has to get within 625 range of his target if he doesn't want to use his W to gap close.  Will have to ult to an easily predictable location and deal with all that. Lee Sin doesn't need to worry about losing damage because he can use his W as a point-click gap closer and can ult for the stun lock into an auto attack and a Q. If we're talking about effectively going to the target. Zed only gets the AD if he kills targets that have AD. Also, getting that much AD is actually rare. On average a Zed usually gets around 30 (they designed it to be similar to old W 25% AD increase) and this is only late game. Zed needs to get off an auto attack which isn't always possible because he has no crowd control, the only time he is really guaranteed the auto attack is if he uses it right after his ult or his W. If that is the case he is not getting the execute damage off and I've already said using W to gap close is much more likely than straight up using R unless the enemy doesn't respect you.\n\nLee Sin USES the target as an escape after kicking them. Lee Sin has a point-click dash that goes anywhere. Lee Sin does not need to use his Q to start his assault. Because Lee Sin's ult is a knock up it means you cannot zhonyas it. Lee Sin is classified as a Diver but can play the assassin role effectively. Just like WuKong, Master Yi, Rengar, Kayn, Diana, and Jarvan.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BenTheDegenerate","date":"2018-05-01T16:58:09.107+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":14,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HoneyOTU,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Wswn4ezA,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-05-01T14:34:01.744+0000)\n>\n> I know there's always a ton of threads complaining about Zed but he has a lot of frustrating features in his kit, and could use some tuning so laning against him isn't as much of a chore as Yasuo.\n> \n> He lacks much weaknesses early on and feels so irritating to go against.\n> 1.

He can snowball hard, and even though as soon as he gets to late game he struggles more, he is just so frustrating to deal with and go against. Maybe it's electrocute's damage pre-6 that makes it rougher, but even at 6 he can easily all in cuz his ult is on click and increases damage from all his abilities which are easily hit onto it, so dying to it feels unfair. It's an ult, it should do decent damage but either have more damage relying on his ult and decrease from his other abilities, or use the ult as more of a mobility and rely on damage from his q or something.\n> \n> He needs some proper weaknesses, falling off late game isn't much of one. Even a decent weakness would just be buffing seeker's armguard. It needs its armor to stack through farming, and doesn't offer or block much damage either. It needs a better passive to protect mages against AD champs. If mages are going to suffer major mana issues from not going lost chapter, **seekers needs worth the purchase**. \n> \n> \"Then go stopwatch\" is another point, but it's single use, and once you use it youll need to buy seekers straight after for some protection at least, until zhonyas. But that delays mana building so much, and means you've died, or been poked out, so much. \n> \n> Just I hope these made sense. Zed has a major lack of weaknesses early, and is so infuriating to go against. Seekers, the anti-ad item for mages doesn't protect as much as it should, and either one should be looked at to increase counterplay. Magic resist is much stronger than armor, so it's easier to counter ap assassins by just a null cloak, but armor is both weaker than it, and lethality cancels it out. There's barely any protective options around for mages, and I'm honestly surprised it wasnt touched during mage rework.\n\nHi, I'm a Zed main.\nYou want to know what infuriates me to fight against? Swain, Zilean, and Illaoi, Zilean messes up my ult with his stun, and can ult to survive Death mark and come back full if I do hit him, Swain and illaoi can hit me from a range and build tank, Zed can't do jack to tanks.\nIf you badly want to counter Zed, use them and build a Frozen Mallet, I'll hate you later.\n\nReading what you said though, I don't think you understand Zed that much to be ranting lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Evil Bisex Plant","date":"2018-05-01T17:22:50.304+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fuzelop,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Wswn4ezA,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-05-01T16:58:09.107+0000)\n>\n> Gimp yourself for the whole game and potentially lose it to your team while I easily still can go after your AD carry.\n\nOr should the ADC also pick Zilean, Swain or Illaoi and build tank...?","replies":[{"poster":"BenTheDegenerate","date":"2018-05-01T17:49:03.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Evil Bisex Plant,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Wswn4ezA,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2018-05-01T17:22:50.304+0000)\n>\n> Or should the ADC also pick Zilean, Swain or Illaoi and build tank...?\n\nA tanky support like Alistar?
