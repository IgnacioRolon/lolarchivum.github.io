This type of reward has only ever been given to those who could reach the absolute highest pinnacle of league gameplay (challenger), but I would say being a veteran since S1 is an even bigger achievement. First of all, we all know LoL ruins your school grades, imagine ruining your GPA for 7 years straight just to get some icon pixels. Here&#039;s a list of things on why it&#039;s harder to be a veteran than Challenger.\n\nVeteran Achievements-\n* You haven&#039;t ever been perm-banned 7 years straight (You can control your toxicity for 7 years to the point where you don&#039;t get permed).\n* At least 100 games per season (decent amount of time dedicated to your favorite game).\n* 7 years of Riot balancing nightmare.\n* Probably Generated more revenue for Riot. \n* Never quit any seasons.\n* Never forget 1k RP btw.\n\nChallenger Achievements-\n* Just don&#039;t get banned 3 months prior to season ending.\n* Get carried to Challenger.\n* Get boosted to Challenger.\n\nIn the end, it&#039;s obvious who deserves the actual GOOD reward. I would think the sample size for actual veterans would be small, so it&#039;s not like Riot would burn that much money doing this.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-10-14T21:55:19.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I cant tell if this is a troll post or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-10-14T21:57:27.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought he was serious and a valid point till i saw the challenger acheivement.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Skouriasmenos","date":"2017-10-14T21:59:20.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Raigarak,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0WfqW4ME,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-10-14T21:54:15.686+0000)\n>\n> Veteran Achievements-\n> * You haven&amp;#039;t ever been perm-banned 7 years straight (You can control your toxicity for 7 years to the point where you don&amp;#039;t get permed).\n\nI have actually done that and I did receive physical rewards ... a nice, rare teemo statue, some seasons ago ... ;p","replies":[{"poster":"Ahris","date":"2017-10-14T22:20:14.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Skouriasmenos,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0WfqW4ME,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-10-14T21:59:20.580+0000)\n>\n> I have actually done that and I did receive physical rewards ... a nice, rare teemo statue, some seasons ago ... ;p\n\nSerious?
