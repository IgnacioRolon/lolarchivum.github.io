This is consistent problem it really makes me fucking angry. Not 10 minutes ago i was 1-1 in promos after getting flamed by everyone in the game for no reason and when i go to play my 3rd game for G1 it says im offline and have no internet connection. ALWAYS i have to restarted my computer or stop the shutting down mid way where it closes everything. I feel like Riot should be able to have a thing where if its either one of those two errors someone shouldn't be able to lose. I have probably lost more lp cause of not connecting then actually playing (Obviously exaggerating) but still. I should be in Plat with the amount of losses ive gotten from those and im serious about that","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T15:53:22.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you have a combination of different issues here that may be impeding your game.
