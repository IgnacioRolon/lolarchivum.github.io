[Queue dodging](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) will automatically count as a loss during a series and also disqualifies the [promo helper win](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ#h6q2).  Your best bet is to stay committed and connected during champion select to prevent those penalties, and even a lower priority queue.  I hope that helps clear things up, and I wish you all the best in your ranked games!","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlueBonquet","date":"2016-07-26T13:23:28.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you believe there was an error feel free to contact riot support.
