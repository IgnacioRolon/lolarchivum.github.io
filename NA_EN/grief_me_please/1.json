Fiora is a relatively recent rework, and her splashes honestly look fine!\nBut Karma was the first relaunched champion, and her splashes for Traditional, Sun Goddess, and Sakura all suck, straight up. She still uses **fans** in them for pete&#039;s sake!\nWhy would Fiora get higher priority over Karma?\nAlso are there any plans to change Traditional and Sakura Karma so that her dress doesn&#039;t look like it&#039;s made out of silly putty?","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-09-09T16:10:53.291+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are doing Fiora first because of the reasons many people have listed below. That being said I have heard you guys loud and clearly about Karma's splashes. I have since put them much higher on the priority list. They will likely be in the next batch after Twitch. We probably won't start that batch until after Warwick releases though since WW has so many splashes.","replies":[{"poster":"Snaketits","date":"2016-09-11T10:29:06.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a chance for Cassiopeia's Desperada and Siren splasharts to be updated?

What I'm saying is that they probably had just about enough time to finish Nightraven, start Royal Guard and Headmistress(?) and ship those before they'd have to start shifting those resources onto Warwick.\n\nJust my guess based on Red posts though. :P","replies":[{"poster":"adidas","date":"2016-09-09T16:46:21.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DwarvenGiant,realm=EUNE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=jaGdyxel,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-09T12:15:24.648+0000)\n>\n> so they probably just thought that it might be better to just keep doing Fiora\n\nYeah id keep doing fiora too\n\n;]","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weiner the Pooh","date":"2016-09-09T14:36:18.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're doing NightRaven and Royal Guard, thats what Reav3 said, as far as im aware non of her other arts are getting changed.","replies":[{"poster":"DwarvenGiant","date":"2016-09-09T15:07:34.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, wasn't sure about Headmistress.
