I restarted my computer and after some lengthy updates I am no longer able to play in full screen mode. Every few seconds my game minimizes, I am able to play on borderless mode, but it makes my game lag, and sometimes my mouse shows up on my other monitor, or it clicks through league, really screwing up my game play. Has anyone had this issue before? How did you fix it?\r\n\r\nWindows does not seem to be minimizing any other fullscreen applications.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-18T22:02:26.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League could be having an issue interacting with your Graphics Card.
