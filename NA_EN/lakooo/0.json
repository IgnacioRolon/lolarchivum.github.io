Doubled the RAM and the game lasted longer before lag and it was less than before.  Got a PCI-e Graphics card shoved in and lag is all but gone now.\n\nCPU built in graphics? Increase ram, but more importantly get a new card :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gilamarth","date":"2017-12-30T22:33:55.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I went through the FPS Issues list and then some, cleaners, heat, etc. and still no change.  Will be attempting to get something a bit newer for graphics and see if that will help.

If it's late game, it could even be something with baron.  My suggestion here would be go over each step of the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to rule out possibilities.
