I found this strange because I was currently talking to that exact friend in discord at the exact same and I knew for a fact that he was playing a different game. I thought it might be a glitch so I had him log into his account and it showed his name had been in fact changed and it showed the reconnect to game screen. Is there anything we can do to help his situation other than have him change his pw and wait for riot to look at his support ticket?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-06T18:41:23.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Changing the password is a solid step.  I also recommend changing the email as well just in case, per our [account recovery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694-Recovering-Your-Account) guide.  Have you friend submit a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) as well so we can take a closer look and help too!  Thanks for helping your buddy!","replies":[]}]}
