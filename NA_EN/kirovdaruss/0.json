For example, right now I'd like to practice {{champion:157}}  vs. {{champion:131}} and {{champion:157}}  vs. {{champion:101}}  (with me as Yas) so I can be more comfortable with the matchups for ranked play. I would be willing to play matchups that you want to learn or get better at. Another thing I've been experimenting with is {{champion:429}} mid so I'd like to play that as well, but I'm mainly focused on learning {{champion:157}} matchups.\r\n\r\nI main {{champion:157}}  and {{champion:101}}  so if you guys want to learn to deal with them in laning phase and play their counters ( or someone who's weak against them), reply and I'll friend you.\r\n\r\nBtw, I was placed Bronze 1 this season but Silver 2 last season so I'm looking for someone somewhere in that range.\r\n\r\nI'm also in the process of learning other mid and top champs ({{champion:7}}  {{champion:103}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:161}}{{champion:120}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:5}} ) so I can practice those if you'd like to lane against them as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Superfoxman","date":"2015-03-18T22:35:25.561+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am always up for 1v1's  >;]","replies":[{"poster":"The Dominatrix","date":"2015-03-19T15:27:35.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't mind taking you on","replies":[]},{"poster":"VG elfsoamah","date":"2015-03-19T00:13:10.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I play you :0 :D, I would love that :))","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VG elfsoamah","date":"2015-03-19T00:14:57.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you dont have this up there, but I'm starting to learn how to play LB.
