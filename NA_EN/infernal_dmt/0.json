You're not allowed to insult, harass, or verbally abuse other players. If you didn't read the rules (which you're prompted to when you create an account), that's on you.\n\nAnd, let's put it like this; would you like it if people called you \"trash\", \"scrub\", \"noob\", or \"moron\"? 'Cause, frankly, I doubt you'd enjoy it all that much yourself.\n\n> sounds like a loser ass fucking game to me huh perma banned for insulting other players...\n\nIf you don't like the rules, you're free to find another game.\n\n> ...what the fuck is mute option for?\n\nTo stop one player's chat/pings/emotes from reaching you, whether it be because they're disruptive, harmful, etc.\n\nThe mute feature is _not_, however, an excuse to break the rules and flame like there's no tomorrow.\n\n> if you dont curse and act completely fucked up why perm ban?\n\nI'm guessing what you're asking here is \"why permanently ban (players) if they're not cursing and not acting completely unreasonably?\"\n\nWell, one, cursing isn't against the rules. You can say \"fuck\", \"damn\", and \"shit\" without penalty. It's when you start leveling swears at other players that it becomes a problem; as I like to say, it's the difference between saying \"aw shit\" and \"you're a piece of shit\".\n\nAnd; you can't really say you weren't acting completely unreasonable in your chat logs. It's full of insults and harassment.\n\n> why perm ban period for talking why not perm mute?\n\nAs The Djinn said; all that would do is restrict toxic players to gameplay-altering means of toxicity. We want toxic players gone, not continuing to be toxic in less verifiable ways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arngrim31","date":"2019-06-24T03:16:28.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-24T02:40:24.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2zlPNGuPbw","replies":[]}]}
