It's just that, when I read your post, it was a bit beyond just stating the facts.  You assigned intentionality to a person's actions (or lack of action) that I think wasn't there.  Then, after that, you built a case to support that previous intentionality.  What you did wasn't like \"punishable\" or \"reportable\" by any means.  You're frustrated and we're just talking.  That's all.\n\n-------\n\nBy this argument, every person a Rioter does not respond to is being \"singled out\".  There are dozens of \"unban me\" posts made in the boards every day as you know.  Is Riot singling out each one that they _don't_ respond to? I don't think so.  I think it is more likely that Rioters are busy doing their job.  When they check the boards, they are just logging on quickly and responding to whatever they see immediately and can be handled quickly.  \n\nAnd once again, they do this because they want to (responding on boards) not because they have to.\n\nYour case was probably complicated.  Rioters who read the boards either didn't catch it in the multitude of posts made here by other players or they thought it was too complicated to handle quickly and publicly.  But Riot did eventually handled it.  These issues aren't the cause or the responsibility of just one Rioter but the entire team.\n\n--------\n\nI understand your frustration at having been banned and the process taking a few days to resolve.  I just think you're misdirected in your outlet for it.  Also, I really do appreciate your constant efforts to reform.  As an outside observer though, it's not these particular comments that have me worried for you.  It's the rationale behind them.  \n\n\nI don't want you to get banned again, accidentally or otherwise.  The way I see to help you is to just try and help you understand if your frustration is earned (here it is, I think) and if your responses to it are appropriate (I think singling out one Rioter when a group of Rioters handle these things together is not).\n\n----\n\nAnd the last bit, things may feel personal (such as not getting an answer immediately) but they often times are not.  There are so many other factors that go into play.  Try to view it from the other party's perspective.  For instance, take a moment and try to put yourself in Tantram's shoes.  If you were Riot Tantram, what might be some reasons why you didn't respond to one post, out of many, regarding an issue you and the rest of the Player Behavior team were probably already working?  I can think of far more benign and understandable reasons than I can cruel and mean ones.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-05-21T16:17:27.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Firu,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=9ue5E2oa,comment-id=000a000000000000,timestamp=2016-05-21T14:36:13.609+0000)\n>\n>frustrated and we&#x27;re just talking.

You are acting as if I am looking for someone to blame and randomly selected Riot Tantram, that is not the case. He knew exactly what was going on and singled me out as someone he would not provide information to.  It's not complicated.\n\nAnd (yet again), I am not saying anything ill about Riot Tantram, it is not his job to assist people in the way that I wanted , however, being singled out as someone he chose not to assist leaves me with the impossibility of ever viewing him in a positive light.

You were one of quite a few people who did not receive any response from Riot regarding the issue (on the message boards).  You did receive a response from Riot via your ticket and email.\n\nIn my opinion regarding this issue, you were not singled out by anyone.  You received the same exact treatment as the majority of players who were incorrectly banned under that mistake.  By constantly implying that you deserved a response (here on the boards, from Tantram or anyone at Riot) you sound like you were demanding some special treatment (i.e., a Red Post specific to you).\n\n\n--------------\n\nYour situation was a mistake by Riot.  Riot handled it as best as they could.  In fact, I would think you deserve some sort of compensation (like an IP boost or mystery skin) for being incorrectly flagged if you're completely innocent.  However, I think you're incorrect of your assessment about how one particular Rioter did (or did not) handle your specific case.
