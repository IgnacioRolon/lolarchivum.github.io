On the 4th try, the client by itself seemed to switch to the new client (I never updated/switched to the new client!) and loaded it rather quickly. I tried to select launch legacy client from the new menu and the same thing happened. After logging in, the game would crash and upon reopening League, it switches to the new client.\r\n\r\nAt one point, i switched to the legacy client and clicked Repair and let it finish. It seemed to fix the issue however just now when i tried to log in to LoL, the same thing is occurring. Is this because Riot has started it's full transition to the new client or is it an error in my files...?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-18T04:22:11.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While we are trying to make the move to our updated client, we have _not_ tried to enforce this change on anyone! When you have the new client downloaded, though, it _will_ be the one that loads first.\n\nSince the legacy client began working after allowing it to repair, there could be some corrupted game files associated with the legacy client that is causing it to switch to the updated client. My best advice would be to try letting it repair again.","replies":[]}]}
