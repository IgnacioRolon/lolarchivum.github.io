After making a smurf and exposing myself to this &quot;Elo Hell&quot; I&#039;ve made a conclusion to why games seem so hard, and how people can easily get out of, or avoid this &quot;Elo Hell&quot;.\r\n\r\n1) The first part that I want to touch on is why games in low ELO seem even harder to win than games in high Diamond sometimes. My first game in Silver 3 I noticed almost instantly that everyone is stuck in the mindset that they MUST carry the game in order to get out. With this shared philosophy, about everyone in the game is playing, in a lack of a better term, selfish. I can half-reason with why everyone feels this way, they consistently play with others who believe in the same idea or other players they deem &quot;don&#039;t belong (boosted)&quot;. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, players need  to realize that this isn&#039;t Starcraft or Warcraft, where skill is determined through one vs one player abilities. This is a team game and in team games skill is much rather determined through how well players can sacrifice for the sake of the team&#039;s victory. Compatibility is key in team games, and this isn&#039;t any different for League of Legends. If you&#039;re asked or notice that your team needs a certain champion to have an edge, don&#039;t turn your back on them because &quot;you need to carry solo only&quot;. \r\n\r\n2) This transitions well into the second part of my synopsis which focuses on what low ELO players should do to grind their way out of &quot;Elo Hell&quot;. If being selfish is what keeps you locked in Bronze/Silver/Gold, then maybe being SELFLESS will be a key quality to breaking free and ranking up. This won&#039;t come easy, especially to the players who have played for many years. However, slowly try to embed characteristics of being selfless, sacrificing for the team, and getting more victories than reports. Remember, You don&#039;t need to carry every game, in fact, the best players in any sport or e-sport don&#039;t carry their teams by putting them on their backs. They do it by getting all their teammates to play the best of their abilities! \r\n\r\nGood Luck, and let me know if this helped or not! \r\n\r\nSHerv","replies":[{"poster":"bleufromage","date":"2016-07-03T11:22:07.167+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"This advice is virtually useless because even if I become a team player there at 4 other people who think they have to solo carry even if they have no skill to do so.

I'm not sure why this is the case in lower ELO, but to avoid this I would recommend players to practice Jungle or Mid. Jungle controls the pace of the game and mid controls where the fights are to be located.

One time I went from silver 5 to bronze 5 because I just couldn't win a game for the life of me.\n\nOther times I've won 25 ranked games in a row.\n\nNow that I also record my games I can see where I messed up and improve that way. \n\nSo, there's hope for me ^~^\n\nAlso: I've been reading your replies to other people and I'd like to say thank you. You're one of those few high ELO players that doesn't see us bronzies as a waste of space. That earns my respect for what it's worth.\n\nIgnore any typo's. It's 4 am and I'm sleep deprived","replies":[]},{"poster":"shyv","date":"2016-07-03T16:39:51.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> high diamond\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/c07f528230d3bc839f639564bb5614c6.png","replies":[{"poster":"Dekatz","date":"2016-07-04T07:16:52.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's a diamond 1.

It's sort of a punishment for those who can't/don't have the ability to que duo or team. We're at the mercy of the team's ability to function together. The sad part is that concept is MIA in low elo. I'm not really complaining, just stating facts. I've noticed that some pairing is extremely mismatched where me as a lowly S5(cuz a lose streak makes me rage), gets paired with unranked and B1. Bronze and Silvers at least should be paired within their ranks. Anyway, off to the beach!
