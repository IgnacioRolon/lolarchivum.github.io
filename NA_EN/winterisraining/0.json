Now I log into league and it says my account is perma banned and to check my email for info regarding it. I checked both my emails I ever linked to this account and I received no email regarding why I was banned. Also Ive only ever received a leaver buster one time for 5 minutes. Why would I be perma banned for spending money on this game?  Can I get my account back? I sent in a ticket, but I'm so upset. My boyfriend bought be DJ SONA and now I can't even play it. I really don't want to start over.....I spent so much money on the game between my account and my boyfriend's account (I buy him lots of skins because I love him and he loves this game). What can I even do.....Im really distraught.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-09T22:47:32.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked over your account for you, and it looks like there were some suspicious logins that were signs of this account being compromised (hacked).
