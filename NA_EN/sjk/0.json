I mean, all the game files are installed on your computer and not bound to the server right? And we do also have this implemented on the tournemant realm. So why do we not have this for public use?\r\n\r\nThis is something that alot of players and more importantly pros can use to practise. I mean, with so many mechanics being able to use in 0-5 ping enviroment such as certain Riven or Rengar combo not being available in an 44-70 ping enviroment.\r\n\r\nThis would not only be fun to use for practise, but an amazing mechanical playground.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-07-23T03:26:05.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game SERVER is not installed on your computer, all you have are assets and visual scripting.\n\nThe behavior of every ability, minion AI, jungle mobs, turrets, movement, collisions and pathfinding ect are all purely server-side.\n\nPutting it in the game client would add a lot of filesize and probably be way too much for the average CPU to run smoothly, as well as being a potential security hole, as hackers/exploiters would get limited access to the server code.","replies":[{"poster":"SJK","date":"2016-07-23T03:38:01.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the information. \n\nbut couldn't you simply add the game data into the game, without including crucial informative code for the actual game?","replies":[]}]}]}
