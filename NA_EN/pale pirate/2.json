Huni is very capable of going even at worst and if you watch you see him making stupid plays over and over to try to feed his ego....

Was the biggest selfish ego play I ever seen the fear doesnt even do anything to the blobs, he could have ulted onto the the other 2 and the \"team\" would easily finished the blobs....but he sat waited for those blobs to come together then ulted 100% onto just the blobs to get the kill. Net result? They get crushed in the ensuing fight, in part for waiting to finish the engage thx to huni and in part him wasting his ult just to kill blobs....\n\nSee it agian next game, he activates his ult too early and then chases giving up first blood, over and over, poor target selection by huni, greedy plays that dont work at pro level, because he was feeding into his ego, instead of playing as a team player and see where the cards fall. \n\nHonestly lets be honest I think reignover bought into his own ego hype train as well, and made alot of greedy plays that cost his team and took some kills that really could have went elsewhere. Good teams playing well don't fight for personal scores or waste precious CD's to take kills that are free .","replies":[{"poster":"iamleburk","date":"2015-10-26T02:21:53.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ehh at that point they were just tilting. i stand by my point that Huni should have been put on carry champs; i think would be fine on a vlad, malphite, or gnar. Even rumble would do well for him, but they really should have known better to put him on to riven, he was obviously going to be outclassed. In game 1, he had some misplays but they didn't matter as much because he was playing Hec, which is a little bit less of a carry. Imo Huni is still a top 20 player, but imo the difference between top 5 and top 20 can be massive. They should have recognized he would not be able to carry this game, and drafted accordingly. I think there was one game where they could have taken Lulu... I think Huni on Lulu then Rekkles on a hyper carry would have been a great composition for that matchup.
