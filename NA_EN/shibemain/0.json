In order to try and not get a penalty, I would use practice tool to check my ping. As of now, my ping is at its normal state in practice tool which led me to believe it may be fixed. However I have not actually gone into a pvp match yet because im still worried it might spike out of nowhere again. Is anyone else's ping normal now or is it just me?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-22T02:58:42.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like we're still seeing a lot of Verizon issues =(.
