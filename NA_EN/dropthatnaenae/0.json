Whenever I start a game, my ping is around 200. I have to manually disconnect and reconnect the game to get the ping to a lower level (around 60). According to the Hextech Repair Tool, I should have a ping of around 38-40, which was my regular ping before these large spikes. \nhttp://imgur.com/a/QrIxE\nI have no idea what caused this. I was playing one minute and the ping was fine and the next it suddenly spikes. My guess is that it had something to do with the maintenance they recently had.","replies":[]}]}
