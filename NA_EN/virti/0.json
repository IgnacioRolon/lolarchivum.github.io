I have reset my keybinds thinking that may help but it didn't.\r\n\r\nPlease help, I have tried over and over again. Every game I play I am unable to chat with my team or enemies and my cursor isn't the normal league cursor.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-04T04:37:08.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mentioned having tried resetting your keybinds to fix this, but let's make sure it was done in the right order juuuuust to be 100% sure that it would have taken effect.
