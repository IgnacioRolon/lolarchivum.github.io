Im more interested in the scaling; i know this is sometimes presented in patch notes, but shouldnt it be regularly available, just in case the champ isnt included in the notes?? am i supposed to jump in game without an understanding of the champ? yes there is 3rd party stuff, but for a new comer this should be readily available.\r\n Is this a ploy to get us to buy the champion before we can see their stats?? or maybe an attempt to entice us into using their training grounds??","replies":[]}
