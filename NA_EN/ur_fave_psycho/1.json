Your rig does sound pretty amazing, but it's probably your connection that's the culprit.  I suggest using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and tighten up your network.  Test it out in a custom game, though, to prevent further penalties.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
