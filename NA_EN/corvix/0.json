The Rioter said he tested it and it's not there in the patch he's on. But do you understand what that means? This is his first post, meaning he did not post, yet he had already fired up League of Legends in an attempt to test the bug, silently. The bug was non-existent when he attempted to reproduce it, so he decided to let a player know it was ALREADY GONE, so there is no potential for disappointment as well. \n\nSo what we have here is A) Rioters try to fix problems BEFORE making any promises to avoid backlash, which is intelligent decision making on their part.\n\nand B) This Rioter only wanted to tell this man that the issue he was having is no longer an issue as of next patch, and you are angry already. Do you see why Riot does not want to attempt a communication for anything that is not definite? Because even when they do, they receive heavy backlash. \n\nI do understand Morde is literally in the triple digits with bugs, and it's no doubt frustrating for you as a Morde main, especially when it seems like there's no end in sight. But this is no reason to yell at this poor man, look at his job description. He is an analyst for a website, not a game tester or anything of the sort. This tells me he was going out of his way, above and beyond his job, to test and replicate a bug before getting it to the proper people to fix, only to discover it was already fixed. He does not deserve that type of backlash when his only intention was to help someone.","replies":[{"poster":"Yoinked Your Ult","date":"2018-02-14T10:37:53.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say the same to every rioter, it's not an attack to them directly, more to Rito as a whole.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2018-02-13T15:33:48.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm willing to give you benefit of the doubt.
