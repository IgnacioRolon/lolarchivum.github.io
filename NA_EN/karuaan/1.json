Since the match ended early, it was no longer active.  Getting a loss and leaver for that sucks, and I highly recommend running through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot, as it seems like your connection to the game server is in trouble.
