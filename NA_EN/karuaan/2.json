Recently my ping has gone up from 35 to about 250+ every game I play. So while wondering what was up with my ping I stumbled upon this page: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/spsh1JRU-ping-increase \r\n\r\nI followed the instructions the rioter has given us in the post and have found something interesting that pertains to the lag issue in between the Verizon Fios and the Riot Servers. Here are the results: http://imgur.com/a/iqBfX\r\n\r\nFrom what I see, the riot message is not connecting with one of the servers like it's supposed to and causing the path of the data to be much longer than it should regularly be. Can other people with lag and ping issues from NA also do the test in the other post and post their results to prove that I am not the only one receiving the problems!!!\r\n\r\nThank You, \r\nFellow League Player","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2016-11-18T23:39:23.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having a similar problem but for me pinging the 104.160.131.1 server just gives me a small increase in ping from my 70 to 90 ms. This is not my in-game ping however as its a steady 130-140 ms right now. However when I use the new one given on the site (192.64.170.1) I get something closer to what you're having. This also started recently, and after a disconnect while playing LoL. Neither my ISP or riot seems to have any solution.\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                             192.168.1.1 -    2 |  151 |  148 |    1 |    3 |   34 |    2 |\n|                         162.246.104.229 -    0 |  163 |  163 |    3 |    5 |   26 |    8 |\n|                         162.246.104.228 -    0 |  163 |  163 |    2 |    5 |   36 |    3 |\n|       xe-6-0-0.0-brx-teracore02.cwc.com -    0 |  163 |  163 |   43 |   50 |  154 |   46 |\n|           ten2-2.br02.mia02.pccwbtn.net -    3 |  147 |  143 |   45 |   56 |  320 |  142 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   32 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                          104.160.129.46 -    0 |  163 |  163 |  131 |  134 |  163 |  142 |\n|          ae30-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  163 |  163 |  130 |  134 |  167 |  134 |\n|                         104.160.131.101 -    0 |  163 |  163 |  132 |  134 |  170 |  135 |\n|                            192.64.170.1 -    0 |  163 |  163 |  131 |  135 |  162 |  136 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider\n\nI'm starting to wonder if some of the servers Riot uses have some of the routing services used by certain ISPS blacklisted and when players are moved to another server they sometimes get hit.

It's important to get that fixed up before assuming your ISP is not routing to our servers properly.  \n\nIf the issue is physically with the router, you can try power cycling it.  If that doesn't work, you may need to reach out to your ISP about replacing it.
