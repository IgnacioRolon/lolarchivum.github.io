Also High Ping and Lag Spikes for 5-6 Patches now!!!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So after this patch, my fps randomly dropped from a constant 200+ fps to a max of 60 fps. I checked if my setting got changed but no nothing has been changed. Wait for vertical sync and anti-aliasing are both unchecked as they were before and my frame rate cap is uncapped as it was before. So last patch I was getting about 200+ fps and now I am getting a max of 60 while the average is around 40 and has the game lag while in game. Not to mention that my ping (which should be and was for a while after the servers shift) should be around 35-37 since I am from NJ, now I get constant 150+ ping and worst part it keeps fluctuating to about 2000+ ping throughout the whole game. I have read other posts on this thread for multiple patches with similar issues and you guys have told them that they need to contact the ISP. Well I have called Verizon and they say they are not getting anything on their end and when I complained that this is the cause and my ping is a lot higher than it is supposed to be, they said it might be the router that we have purchased from them. So they have agreed to give us a new router and after installing it and everything I am still having the same issues as before. I have no idea what else to do but I quit playing ranked because I simply cant move my champion in game anymore. I will be attaching my logs here so you guys can let me know what is going on!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-20T23:56:49.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FPS issues can be due to driver, game file, or hardware issues.
