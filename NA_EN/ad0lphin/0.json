The league_client process starts but a few seconds later just disappears.\r\nI tried everything, using the launcher repair tool, re-installing the game, deleting the air_client and launcher folder in RADS and even used the hextech repair tool. But nothing seems to fix my problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Viceroy Bolt","date":"2016-09-18T06:08:52.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same issue, a full clean Hextech Repair Tool based reinstall resolved it for one login attempt, but just my luck the login server is having problems right then.\n\nHad to shut the client down, the issue is back. I've gone through the whole checklist again, though this time I'm copying league into a backup folder so that if this all goes pear shaped a third time the amount of downloading required to make this work doesn't take me until after the coveted double IP celebration weekend and fresh new league I wish I was playing in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-17T23:25:00.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't recommend deleting folders as it can cause more issues, unless specified to do so.  Your OS settings might be blocking your patcher from launching, and following the steps in the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) could fix this up.
