And then whilst going back to lane and to recall later, I pull up the store and somehow the item glitches, and says the Locket costs 2200 coins. That I don't have enough for it, when I clearly have it's bottom 2 items to convert it into a full Locket. Same thing goes for the new item Remnant of the Aspect, the new item. It won't allow you to purchase saying you don't have the amount of coins to make the full purchase, when i've already purchased its items converting into the Remnant itself and I do have the coins to buy it left, but the store says I still need the full price of the item. I'm so confused..\n\nI've tried to sell the items to see if it will un-glitch the full price of the locket purchase, and undo it. But it doesn't change. This goes for some other items as well.\nI've tried alt-tabbing, I haven't left the game to re-load up to fix it, because it'll take time out of the game, I just have a regular school laptop that will take some minutes to load back in. So I don't want to try that method while ranking.\n\nBut I'm sure i'm not the only one with the problem, it's never happened until the patch 2 days ago. But Let me know, I've lost 2 rank games because I couldn't purchase certain items, Because I don't have enough coins to purchase it, even when I do and I have the items leading up to it. It's bothering, and I would like to see if anyone else is having this problem.\n\nEDIT: UPON Looking through further topics, There are others having the same problem!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-26T02:02:08.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't had the chance to check out these item changes myself, but the way you describe it does sound rather worrisome.
