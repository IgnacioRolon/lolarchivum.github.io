Please check my status, every 10 times i always have to decline during champion select. What the hell is that ? I always have to end the progress and have to wait for 5 minutes, i really want to say some bad word to you lol. I haven't ever dc once before, everytime I dc now, because of system? I really try to screw that, i haven't experienced that before this year. Really horrible upgrade after all. Please hire people who really could do something ? At least don't upgrade anyway because most of the update just make the game even worse. Any no where to report such problem. Shame for that. Even more, LOL please, tell me how to play this game when my teammate feed all the way? It's fair? Gold? I can't even know how to win a game like that?  I don't really care if you block my account or whatever.
