I've tried everything recommended. Restarted router (Obviously), made firewall exceptions, downloaded hextech repair tool, reinstalled, repatched.\r\n\r\nI've run ping tests and my results are good. I can play other more demanding games with little to no issues. I love this game and really want to find a solution. Thanks, team!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-08T00:44:07.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your fluctuating ping can be caused by an unstable connection to our game servers, and you've taken some solid steps so far.  Make sure to go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to rule out any local possibilities. \n\nAlso, when running ping tests where are they routing to?  Grab [WinMTR ](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/)and route directly to NA:  104.160.131.1\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
