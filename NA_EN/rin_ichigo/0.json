When I launch the LoLLauncher or w.e it is, it takes a little longer than normal to load up, but I can click Launch anyways. But after I click launch, there is a long delay followed by the current audio for the Login Screen. However, everything is invisible. The client is PHYSICALLY there ( I can't click the things under it ) but it's invisible. I can even hover over the screen til i find where to enter my password (from memory) and login, but then the home page is invisible too. \n\nI've seen discussions on this dating back to 2011, and from what I've seen, no matter how many bumps or upvotes it gets the problem is never answered.\n\nI've tried \n1) Reinstalling\n2) Deleting certain folders in the league folder (as mentioned in various other discussions) \n3) Launching as admin (duh)\n4) Trying different compatibility setting on LoLclient.exe and other exe's.\n5) Using a new computer.\n\nThough I had this problem for a while years ago, it fixed itself over time. \nI suspect it was updating my graphics drivers.\nHOWEVER, I needed to role back my graphics driver because with updated graphics, my screen has flickering black bars in game (ANOTHER problem I've seen discussed but not fixed).\n\nSo either, I have to deal with one BIG problem and can't play\nor I have to deal with another BIG problem and pretty much not play either.\n\nAny helps would be appreciated, but i honestly believe this is a problem only Riot themselves can fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-12T10:28:47.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rid yourself of the pests which harass your gameplay by using the [Bug & Crash Exterminator.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) Kha’Zix and Elise won’t know what hit ‘em.
