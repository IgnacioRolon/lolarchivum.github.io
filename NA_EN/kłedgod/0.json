It said a report was sent to the server but I should check the forums. So here I am trying to see if I am the only one with the problem. I re-logged twice still no good. I could maybe get away with this if it was runes since I don&#039;t change those as often but masteries I change almost every game.","replies":[{"poster":"Prynce","date":"2016-09-06T23:37:19.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Delete all your mastery pages, make new ones, make sure no two pages have similar names and watch out for capitalization.","replies":[]}]}
