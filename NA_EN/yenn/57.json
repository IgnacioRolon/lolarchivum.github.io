He was always considered a more mid-late game oriented champion. His early has always been trash.\n\nAlso, if ADCs cant deal with rammus, hes not broken, because most mages can deal with rammus, especially DPS mages, because rammus's kit punishes him for prioritizing MR over armor.","replies":[{"poster":"AFilthyCaitMain","date":"2017-09-02T23:47:43.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And ADCs are designed to fuck tanks.
