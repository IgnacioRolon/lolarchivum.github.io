This makes it impossible to trade with him unless he fucks up, and I get punished every time I try to use my wave clear.\n\nIf he does fuck up and somehow fails to dodge a skill shot, I can&#039;t even punish him for it, because I can&#039;t 100 to 0 him and he&#039;ll completely heal over all of my damage with life steal.\n\nThere is absolutely no potential for outplay here, nor any way to really play safe. This is stupid, and applies to almost every mid lane champion that isn&#039;t high burst, like Syndra or Annie.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkdemon653","date":"2017-08-28T16:26:32.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yenn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=APAJlHoL,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-08-28T06:54:44.955+0000)\n>\n> The range of his dash + auto is effectively the same as my W\n\nIf he's using his dash to harass you, you should be hit him with your E and blow him up.

Personally, I would imagine a champ like that would use their dashes defensively to avoid poke champs like Vel'koz. But if I was in Vel'koz's position, I would probably focus on farm and wave pushing if I couldn't poke down my opponent. \n\nPersonally, it simply feels like that match up would be a stale mate, if both parties were reletively competent, and baring Jungler intervention. But then again, With Lucian being an ADC, he's probably going to have the advantage later on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HÃµund","date":"2017-08-28T16:21:40.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's the thing Lucian is the only marksman viable mid and he has bad matchups as well. Just because you lost to him one time as bel probly means you misplayed or it's a hard counter either way not necessary to nerf nor is it possible to need Lucian out of being a mid lane option because no matter how he's changed unless it's a full rework he will be an option mid or adc at all times your argument is like saying I played against galio mid got stomped please fix this it's not that simple and not even a problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-08-28T06:57:40.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would agree 100%, but then i get flashbacks of ziggs in the botlane so it fell to 99%","replies":[]}]}
