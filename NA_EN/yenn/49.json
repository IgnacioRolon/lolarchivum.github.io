They're quite a bit easier to deal with than the rest of his abilities, and that's why they hurt more. And to dodge Barrel chains, you just need to position carefully (especially near bushes you don't have vision of) so that you can react if he sets up a chain, and it's easier to dodge if you have a blink or dash.\n\nAlso, think about this. Say you gut GP's barrels (Which are a primary core function of his kit) so that the damage is significantly lowered. This could throw him completely out of viability, so instead the team lowered the power of other parts of his kit to compensate for the large amount of damage the barrels do. Not saying GP is 100% balanced, but he's strong when picked against someone who lets him scale for free, his early game is rather slow before Trinity Force.\n\nAlso, he's kind of supposed to be able to do damage, he's a late game Carry and if he tries to mostly use Auto's in a teamfight he should probably get blown up assuming the enemy isn't a sack of potatoes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"adidas","date":"2016-08-29T03:06:47.956+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's pretty much how it is.

The barrel  thing sucks but you can avoid it, and see him run up to try and place another to hit you with it in concession. If you wait a second the health on the first one goes down so you can destroy it if you hit it before he does, same with second ones. If you get on top of him though he can't really do anything, besides shoot you with his stupid pistol and try and run. Or ult you if it's up, which doesn't do much damage unless you stand in it forever.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warmanreaper","date":"2016-08-29T03:08:34.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gangplank isn't even that good.. if you lose to him you're just bad..
