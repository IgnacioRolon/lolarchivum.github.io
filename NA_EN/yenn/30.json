Also if you are immobile then you should know that you shouldn't be overextending without having the support of your team. Hell he would have survived if he would have took the blast cone into the enemy blue buff and just hid in one of the many brushes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-06-23T16:22:26.550+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, you gave back about 900 range when you chose the right angle Segway to the river.\n\nAnd, Cass isn't Morgana.
