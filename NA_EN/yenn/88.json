If you play a chess tournament in teams, your win/loss is determined by your team score, but your ELO is determined by your win/loss against your opponent.

Your skill level is a very minor contributor vs. your team mates' (and luck).\n\nWinning should be the primary indicator, but it shouldn't be the only indicator, like it is now. There should be some user input (i.e. MVP type system) to reduce the luck factor in climbing.\n\nSee my history.
