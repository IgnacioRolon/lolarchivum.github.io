Your most recent removal amounted to nothing more than an extended \"Heal on Senna too strong, must nerf\" complaint thread.\n\nPretty much every champion has a honeymoon period on release, mostly because opponents need to learn the play pattern. Between that and the \"freshness factor\" it's not surprising she has a high pick and ban rate. [You can see, however, the day by day progression towards the League average](https://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/platinum/plus/champion/Senna/ADC/graphs/).\n\nIf you're going to make the case Senna is too strong, you should either put more effort into the post or you should choose instead to post on GD or RANT.","replies":[{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2019-12-15T01:01:49.340+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"any post from YENN is just a rant crying about something being broken and nothing that contributes to logic or discussion of topic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2019-12-14T23:42:42.209+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are they giving the same reason?

It explains why Senna is able to ignore trading patterns. It poses the question of whether her self-healing is necessary, for further discussion.\n\nI want to address this separately, because the argumentation is driving me crazy. **Senna does not ignore trading patterns.** It would be far more accurate to say that the presence of healing in her kit **changes the nature of the trades.** The same is true of every champion with access to a healing power... or a shield... or a dash... or invisibility... or a remote minion unit. That list continues on for a long while.\n\n> It poses the question of whether her self-healing is necessary, for further discussion.\n\nStrictly speaking, no power is necessary on **any** champion. It would be similarly more accurate to ask if the mechanics and scope of her heal interact with the rest of her kit in a way that is unhealthy. I don't think it does, as Senna's kit is basically what you would get if you handed Lux's daughter a gun, but it would at least be a discussion we could have.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-12-14T23:45:35.846+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"How many of them are just \"Delete senna: title\"?","replies":[]}]}
