But this is Riot, and it's just embaressing that some1 was able to ruin so many games before the action was taken. There is literally 0 excuse that no1 noticed some dude having 0% wr on a champion in 200+ games. If every teammate that played with him reported him he would gather 1240 reports, how he fuck no1 noticed this motherfucker got 1.2k reports and didn't think he might do something that pissed off so many people and that he should be reviewed?\n\nAnother example...SionOrnnMid. The guy managed to gather over 500+ reports in over a month before he got caught, guess what? He got 14-day banned. Only 14-day. What. The. Fuck. Not that I care since he's not on my server but still... How can some1 evade the ban for that long while his teammates obviously knew wtf he was doing. One would think that a company with so much money could invest it in a system specifically designed for detecting the trolls. I bet that they are smoking some rich-ass cigarettes from Cuba and lighting them up with a burned 100$ bills on a daily basis ffs xD \n/rant over","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yenn","date":"2018-06-09T20:20:23.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AeroWaffle,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=kQpVJEBE,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2018-06-09T15:01:23.221+0000)\n>\n> https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/MKBQUoKd-banned-for-intentionally-feeding\n> \n> This guy was banned for trolling with anivia\n\nThis is easily detectable trolling, the player in question is doing it from start to end.\n\nThe problem is when they start doing it half way through the game. These players aren't punished, because regardless of the fact they ran it down mid lane three times at 20 minutes, they were playing normally up until that point.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-06-09T22:57:44.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, you're answering your own question as far as \"Why isn't this behavior being dealt with more harshly?\".\n\nIt **is** dealt with harshly. First offense for trolling is a 14-day ban, second is a permanent ban. But, as you pointed out, there are people who troll who try to make that behavior hard to spot.\n\nIs Riot going to catch all these people? Of course not. The anivia example I gave is an example where the person was trying to avoid the system by making sure that he didn't die a lot but was banned anyway. Likely a manual review. But no matter what sort of realistic effort Riot makes they are not going to catch 100% of trolls. No system by any game company is going to catch 100% of the people who troll, not even close to 100%. It is compounded by several reasons;\n\nThey don't have the man-power to manually review every single report. There are millions of games played each day alone.\n\nThey are under extreme pressure to not ban anyone by mistake. Banning an innocent is far worse than letting someone who's guilty skip by one time. If a guilty is missed for one instance of poor behavior they have another shot at catching them at the next instance of poor behavior, but if an innocent is mistakenly banned they likely lost the customer. So all it takes is reasonable doubt of someone to not be punished.\n\nA automatic review is never going to be very accurate at detecting trolls. League is a complicated game and there are plenty of subtle ways that someone can troll that, across millions of games, will look indistinguishable from someone who's just playing poorly to a robot.\n\n\nSo what do you suggest Riot do at this point?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Korijenkins","date":"2018-06-09T08:17:41.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen more of it than I would like. Not strictly feeders, but a lot of ragequitters, which is just as bad honestly. \n\nA recent game comes to mind. We had a bizarre comp including Trynd mid and Ziggs bot, something you would expect to see in a previous season. Our Xin JG decided to invade, got caught, and got out. He spam pinged the Trynd for help in a bad fight, went in alone, and died. Instantly dced.\n\nThankfully he came back about 5 mins later and we won the game. \n\nThe worse of these was in a game where I won lane, bot won lane, and our Renekton top afked. He came back about 10 minutes later, but we lost 4v5 for the whole time, and gave up drag and herald. His first item when returning? Warmog's. Despite not having the health, he rushed it. He then ignored us telling him to build health so it would work, continued to feed, and then we lost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yenn","date":"2018-06-09T11:37:38.456+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"And yet again. 5/6 games today.\n\nOur support got mad that we wouldn't surrender after our ADC went 0-4, and started intentionally feeding.
