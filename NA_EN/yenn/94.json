If your ADC tries to attack the turret, he throws an E + Q on your caster minions and the ADC loses 80% of its health from the bounce.\n\nMaking it spread to minions is fine to help his wave clear, but spreading to champions without killing the minion is 100% not okay.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-06-20T02:44:50.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New Ryze is pretty toxic to lane against as an immobile melee, but idk, he still seems like he sucks in team fights.","replies":[]}]}
