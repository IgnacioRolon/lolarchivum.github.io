His E does a ton of damage, his R makes his E do even more, his W now has instant execute damage (4-8% of missing health), and he can then abuse his W with a few extra AA's. Dodge his fish, don't let him land his E on you, and save a dash for when he tries to Q. Cass being an immobile mage though makes her easy prey for any assassin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reynard the Æ’ox","date":"2015-02-01T04:29:23.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yeah idk fizz has always been dumb","replies":[]}]}
