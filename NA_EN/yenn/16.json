There is no direction you can move in to dodge in time, unless you flash, even if you have instant reaction time. It has to be side stepped while she's in the casting animation, which is why pushing it through terrain is problematic.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-12-02T03:31:50.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then ward or play careful when you don't have vision.","replies":[{"poster":"Yenn","date":"2018-12-02T03:35:47.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=rujitra,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZEJmJJJd,comment-id=00000002000100000000,timestamp=2018-12-02T03:31:50.381+0000)\n>\n> Then ward or play careful when you don&#x27;t have vision.\n\nYou can't maintain complete vision control or 'play safe' when you're being sieged at 30 minutes, unless 'playing safe' involves backing off and giving up everything up to your Nexus turrets.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-12-02T04:47:53.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're behind, play like it.

Post 30-minute Zoe can and will one shot any sort of carry after landing a bubble without being ahead. You can't maintain vision of all sides while being sieged, and being sieged doesn't mean you're behind. At best, your wards are sweeped and the fact that a Zoe bubble from a fog will dumpster 70-80% of your support's health (if not kill them) prevents them from rewarding.\n\nYou clearly have no idea what you're talking about or how the game works above Bronze, stop posting.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"I lit your baby","date":"2018-12-01T11:19:02.338+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=7thHeaven,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZEJmJJJd,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-12-01T11:01:37.049+0000)\n>\n> Dodge the bubble then its ok\n\nJUST DODGE IT LOOOOOOOOOL","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-02T03:02:44.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seeing as how Riot wants sudden death mode after 15:00, 30 minutes is way past a match's life expectancy.","replies":[]}]}
