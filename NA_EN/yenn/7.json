Makes no sense. Individual skill rating has nothing to do with having a consistent team.\n2. As I pointed out in the first comment in this thread causes your MMR to be artificially inflated due to a higher chance the enemy has a troll than you do assuming you are not the troll yourself. If the team with the troll always loses you win more games due to troll than you lose due to them.\n3. Has the opposite effect of 2, and would therefore cancel each other out assuming smurfs and trolls happen at equal frequency.

It's all just free gold for the team that's ahead; not only is the person playing badly essentially useless to the rest of the team, they're also actively generating income for them. You actually have more chance of winning if the player just leaves the game.\n\nThe problem isn't bad players. Bad players are going to happen, and have always happened, but they didn't completely and utterly fuck over their entire team as much as they do in this season.
