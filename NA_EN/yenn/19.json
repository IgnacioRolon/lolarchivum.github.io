That doesn't matter. If you use anything minions should attack you. Darius q isn't p/c but if you land they attack you. Even nasus e.

He stands behind your caster minions and Flamespitters in your direction, so he's not hitting the minions, and only briefly turns for one tick to last hit.\n\nEven if he's not doing that, he still turns away until you're in range, so he's not pushing more than he needs to.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DGAGAAsharpAGD","date":"2019-07-17T05:47:25.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Geez, you fed the ever living shit out of that Rumble lol and he still lost :/ \n\nSo every aoe spell should draw minion aggro?
