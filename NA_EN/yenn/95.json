However there are two mistakes that he makes in this fight. First mistake is that despite Morde missing his abilities he doesn't need to aim his autos and so as such you really shouldn't be getting close to Morde unless you're going for a kill and Morde was not even close enough to be killed when he got close the first time he got close at which Morde used his shield to block half the dmg AND landed an auto giving him one stack. Zed continues to stay within Morde's auto range as Morde is activating his ultimate. Once his ult is dropped Morde now has increased health, armor, mr, and most importantly ATTACK DAMAGE which Zed must build and thus Morde's autos now have been empowered which he immediately lands a second one just after using his q and canceling his Q's animation to get that auto giving him his second passive stack and is now doing slightly more dmg with his auto. Finally Morde walks up to Zed and to force Zed to not attack him and dodge another attack Morde uses his E and right after using it lands a third auto which has now procced his passive.\n\nThis is where Zed has now made a second mistake. Because the passive can deal massive amount of dmg within a few seconds he needs to get out immediately and avoid fighting Morde altogether now. Zed HAS NO DEFENSES against magic damage and as such is nearly destroyed in a matter of seconds merely because he stayed in and tried to trade with his autos and has no other abilities to use now and since the very MOMENT Morde procced his passive Zed has been in it for a total of nearly SIX SECONDS. In this game six seconds is FOREVER. Morde is a juggernaut and as such has decent defensive stats but Zed still dealt a good amount as an assassin should but Morde isn't squishy but any means and is able to not only take him on at half health but can beat him in a trade if because he has both dmg AND defense and can take more than Zed can even when it comes to health Morde most likely had about equal if just a few hundred behind Zed at full health so if anything they were equal at the start of the fight. Ultimately what clenched this fight was Morde's W eating all the dmg at the time the shurikens hit him and so giving him time to get his auto attacks in and proccing his passive.\n\nIt may not be \"fair\" but honestly Morde didn't \"miss\" his skillshots other than his protobelt. They were all dodged but Zed's \"fair three shadow jumping ability\" My opinion? Completely fair. Like I said before six second in this game is a long time and Zed was in Morde's passive that entire time. Taken into account that Morde is a juggernaut and so has higher defensive scaling stats than Zed not to mention his builds are mostly AP/Health items such as Liandry's and Rylai's and if I was the Morde I would've gone Hourglass first and that gives him armor. Seeing as both players are lvls 12 and 11 (lvling in Morde's favor btw now that I look) we can assume he has at least one item done and a couple smaller ones in the making and since I'm not seeing Zed getting slowed during the fight it is most likely is Liandry's Torment which does increasing amounts of magic dmg equal to missing % of health which only made the passive even stronger. Do with that what you will.\n\nEDIT: Damn I spent a good hour on slowly watching the video and breaking down the fight and someone else just points out the passive dmg and says it's broken...why do I try?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leon4167","date":"2019-06-26T07:23:57.985+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is what juggernauts do.

Morde proced his passive and the Zed player was in it for a LONG time so it makes sense Morde won the trade. Maybe his passive is broken go ahead and make that argument but you can't say he \"missed\" everything. He did exactly what Illaoi does just stand there and let an ability do all the work.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-06-26T09:00:23.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I watched the video again.\n\n5 seconds, that's the amount of time he got hit by the passive.

You get shredded simply for _existing_ near him?\nAnd that Q.... good AoE damage for teamfight and waveclear, but if he finds himself in a 1v1 situation he also gets bonus damage just to make sure he dominates in both, duels _and_ teamfights.\nHe even gets free stats with his E (magic pen).\n\nOh, and of course his W gives him both, shield _and_ a heal if he desires. So he can instantly shield himself without it getting reduced by GW during a fight. But he also can use it for sustain outside of fights.\nAnd to top it all off, he is absolutely ressourceless. Even doesn't have health costs anymore.\n\n_________________\n\nSo, what is the actual weakness of his kit? Yeah, he is _kitable_, I guess.

He gets great AoE _and_ single target damage.\nHe gets good fighting defense with a shield and sustain with heal.\nHe gets AoE hard CC.\n\nHell, unlike other lane bullies, you can't even gank him that effectively.
