There's no incentive to treat their off-role games as anything but throw aways, because the LP loss is so minimal.\n\nThis is beyond stupid and whoever designed this should be held accountable for it. It's pretty disgusting to imagine all of the things this design and development time could have been spent on that would have actually improved the quality of the game, instead of this abortion that disincentivizes trying if you get anything but your main role.","replies":[{"poster":"Midg3t","date":"2019-02-02T14:12:53.048+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is something I was worried ever since they introduced the new ranked system.

It won't stop some1 who will only throw games when they're autofilled (and that happens once every couple of games). Simply winning games inbetween is enough 4 you to not have ramped up losing splash LP\n\n2. If some1 trolls every game to the point where riot's solution for that kicks in, those players probably don't care about their rank.\n\n3. Players who want to derank will have a field day with this one.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2019-02-02T15:59:42.863+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because you gain 18 or whatever it is when it happens on the enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"Yenn","date":"2019-02-04T04:16:38.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=usul1202,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IMEeRWyI,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-02-02T15:59:42.863+0000)\n>\n> Because you gain 18 or whatever it is when it happens on the enemy team.\n\nImagine even suggesting that ranked devolving into flipping a coin is in any way healthy","replies":[{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2019-02-04T06:42:09.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How else are you going to do a team game and have you be the 100% influencing factor in every game?
