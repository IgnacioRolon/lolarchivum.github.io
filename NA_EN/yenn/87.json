I know I'm gonna get skinned for this, but there was one Dota player, ex-pro, who made a guide about midlane, and he shared many things that were basically only known to pros at the time, and his reason for that was simple: \"You can only raise the skill level of the playerbase as a whole if you raise the skill level of the bottom players\". The balance problems Riot has is because instead of balancing only around the highest skill level players, they try to balance around others as well, I think plat or high gold was their lowest solo que threshold (citation needed), and well, between you and me, we know how players at those ranks are.

The big difference though is Bramblevest is a 1000 gold investment while Adaptive Helm is a 2800 gold investment.  Bramble also is far more \"standardized\" in it's ability to be used, as every game has an ADC that will almost without a doubt become a major threat, and Thorn will provide +80 armor +250 HP, a -15% AS debuff, and the thorns+grievous wounds, a fairly solid value, while Adaptive Helm only really fits on tanks, as it grants HP, CDR, regen, and the MR/anti magic DPS passive.  APs can't get it, because it has absolutely no damage on it at all, and they would probably be better served getting either an Abyssal Mask (Similar MR, HP, CDR, and also grants mana, the Eternity passive, and +10% magic damage), ADCs can't consider it, and would be better served by a QSS/Maw anyway, Assassins would look at it and go \"Well this grants me jack all, worthless\"\n\nThe level of commitment to getting it before you even see the real benefit is massively different from Bramble into Fiora.","replies":[{"poster":"Cowseed","date":"2017-10-07T05:23:19.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that point is true. Obviously it can't be built on everyone but when a team has two sources of AP and they are dot or similar then I opt for the adaptive help as my resistance item. If i'm playing a tank I usually get armor first more often than half the time so I don't really run into much problems with mana because I don't have high cooldowns and can't spam anything. But if I do want mana I'll get the mask or iceborn depending on the situation.\n\nBut If i'm on a champ that can build one or two tank items without losing much elsewhere then I buy the adaptive helm because the tankiness is really noticable in my opinion. the 20% reduction is equivalent to it think it's around 100mr or something like that. I say this because it's a flat reduction and doesn't use the actual damage formula. Nor sure if it's more efficent with less or more mr though. Can't think out the math at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"Steelflame","date":"2017-10-07T06:15:17.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The impact of 20% reduction massively depends on how much MR you already have.  If you have 100 MR, a 20% reduction brings you to 60% magic damage resistance, worth 50 more MR.   If you have 150 MR, a 20% reduction in incoming magic damage is worth 62.5 MR.  For it to be worth as much as +100 MR, I think it would take you being at 400 MR or so, but I'd need to grind the math a fair bit more as it adds a few extra steps to calculate how much it takes for a -20% modification to equal X MR than just figuring out how much that 20% modification is worth.\n\nTherefor, it is more efficient the higher your MR already is in what it practically is granting you.   No, I'm not going to type out the math, the math is messy and I don't want this post to take 2 pages or so.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Glory97","date":"2017-10-06T16:18:02.564+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I've played arround 25-30 games with the reworked azir here are my thoughts.\n-Using his 3 soldier attackspeed buff he can make a pretty strong all-in at early lvls. I think there should be slight nerfs, but because it's also very mana reliant (you all in once and you're oom), it won't be too strong once people are prepared and dont get surprised by the all in.\nLater on in the game the attackspeed buff isn't all that impactfull, because you don't really trigger it that often unless you defend against siege, and the 5 second timewindow is not really long unless you attack the backline (but you can't really attack the backline because any adc will still do more dps than you, and he'll focus you unless he's boosted)\n-His range nerf makes staying out of the range of his soldier much easier during laning phase for ranged champions, but he's still extremly oppressive against melee champions, but so are some other mages aswell, (cassio, heimer), so i think it is kind of ok.\n-The nerfs to his ultimate are quite remarkable. Not blocking jumps after the initial cast makes it much worse as a tool for self-peel, still i see a lot of players that don't know they can jump over the wall which makes it favorable for the azir.\n-His DPS against Baron is way beyond broken. this needs to be hotfixed. He can shred baron at 20 minutes in ~10 second, only needs someone to tank it.\n\nI think his kit is ok after the rework, and the winrate is justified, because a lot of people who had given up on this champion before started picking him up again, explaining why there is such an increase in the win and playrate. I think there should be some nerfs to the bonus attackspeed of the 3 soldier buff at early ranks, and the shield should have less base scaling. His dps against Baron/Drake etc, needs to be nerfed heavily. The rest of his kit is quite ok.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teemo Did 911","date":"2017-10-06T08:55:50.900+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"azir  is overpowered , and i dont know why people don't realize this ,  his  soldiers deal more damage  than  annie's  full combo . \nazir needs 3 items to 1 shot your ass back to bronze 5","replies":[]}]}
