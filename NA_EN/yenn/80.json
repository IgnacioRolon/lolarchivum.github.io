Now replace the Bronze Alistar with a Diamond player, and their reaction speed will be fast enough to side step anything I throw at them, no matter where I aim it, until they get in range. The faster you're moving, the larger the window for reacting to a skill shot is; with mobas, the window is so large that any decent player can consistently dodge most things.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RenownedWheat42","date":"2018-10-12T19:18:40.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People outside of support build them in elos outside of diamond.
