Im rubbish at mid and even I had no trouble aginst him with Pantheon. You just farm until he dares make a move, especially if he wastes his jump, stun him, spear him, etc. If he doesn't waste his abilities, you obviously win an autoattack exchange, and you can use spear because of the short cooldown, just watch out for the lane minions.","replies":[]}]}
