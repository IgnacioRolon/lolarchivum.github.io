It's not worth it.\n\nYou can see this in literally any play montage video on YouTube. Some champion, usually a top laner, wins a 1v3 or 1v4 because they have 70% of their teams kills, despite the total number of kills being relatively even between both teams, and the losing team not having made any glaring mistakes beyond even attempting to interact with the fed champion.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2019-06-23T18:47:32.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yenn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uALwjMIr,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2019-06-23T06:34:50.917+0000)\n>\n> The killing blow is too valuable compared to assists, and even more so because bounties aren't split.\n> \n> If one team has a single champion with 10 kills, and the other team has five champions with 2 kills and 8 assists, that single champion will often trivially stomp the other team with straight numbers.\n> \n> The reward for killing the champion with 10 kills is also heavily skewed, because it will likely take a minimum of 3 people to take them down, and 2/3 of them are only going to get 75 gold for their effort.

I mean if you want there to be an even harder snowball in the game then sure i don't mind assists granting more gold","replies":[]}]}]}]}
