My team has two bruisers, two carries, and Zyra support (basically three carries). Enemy team has three bruisers, one carry, and Lulu. Everyone is full build.\n\nTeam fights are literally just the bruisers barreling into the other team's carries and almost instantly killing them, except the enemy team has more bruisers, so they kill three of our team near instantly, and we kill two of their team near instantly, leaving us to automatically lose because it's 2v3.\n\nThis is stupid as fuck and in no way healthy game play. There's zero thought to this bullshit. We can't defend our carries from their bruisers, and they can't defend theirs from ours.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-18T09:15:06.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sounds like improper positioning to me.

Maybe our Darius pulls Irelia away and cripples her, but then what do we do about the Trundle and Lee Sin both running into her at 500 MS?\n\nYou have no idea what you're talking about.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-18T20:35:38.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If bruisers \"running at you\" is an issue for you then your positioning is way worse than I thought. I am sorry, I did not realize you just started the game. I mean, Lee Sin has two jumps that can be an issue for you and his ult can kick you into the enemy team if you are in a poor position or bad at dodging skillshots, but if he is just running at you then you should be orb walking. Attack him, step back, attack him, step back. Use a movement skill if he gets too close.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2017-01-18T10:52:44.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zezockary,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iMf8ae9I,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-18T09:15:06.990+0000)\n>\n> Sounds like improper positioning to me.

I mean, surely you know about this Mr. High-Elo? So why only give us the shallowest description and bare minimum insight into the pillar of your argument?\n\nWhat can I say? Your bias is clearly showing there nicely. Obviously you use the example because if merely favours your argument, and you purpose only stay on the highest level just so you could push it.","replies":[]}]}
