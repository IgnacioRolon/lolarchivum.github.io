They either get fed and snowball to victory, or their plays don&#039;t work out and they just plain cannot function without being ahead, because they have nothing but mechanical skill. And this play style is extremely effective in the current and prior season.\n\nIt&#039;s getting kind of silly that we&#039;re seeing 4/5 Diamond+ players who have no map awareness, knowledge of how to position, or decision making skills succeeding in their games by going all in at every opportunity and hoping it works out. In a lot of cases, they just totally stop trying if they get behind on one or two deaths, instead of playing safely and trying to make a come back.\n\nFor example, in my most recent game, the enemy Riven went 0-2 in the mid game, and left the game because it didn&#039;t want to play while being behind.\n\nIs Riot okay with this? If not, what&#039;s being done to curve this behavior and deal with these players being able to climb without any of the skills that used to be required to perform well in ranked?","replies":[]}
