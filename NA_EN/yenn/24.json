Their MMR is nowhere near the rest of the players in this game.\n\nStop trying to find ways to explain away this broken system.","replies":[{"poster":"bluefire mark 2","date":"2019-02-09T08:16:52.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't have to because it isn't broken. If it was broken you'd be playing with bronze. You're just salty about not having a high plat player with a 70 percent winrate. Just deal with it man holy crap. It's just matchmaking. If you are so worried about it just dodge. It's not that bad seriously. Gold 1 isn't that far from plat 4 and 2. Climbing is quick now with this system, so it really isn't as far as you think. And his 48% winrate seems to be pretty average with the winrates i see there with the rest of you anyway.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-09T07:14:27.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the way: when posting Imgur links to Boards, you need to add square brackets [] at the end of the link for the preview to work correctly (e.g. \"...png[]\" rather than just \"...png\").","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yenn","date":"2019-02-09T07:06:52.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Queue again, and:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/lDOdxIE.png[]\n\nWhy are there two Platinum IV players on my team, against a team of 4x Platinum I and 1x Platinum II?","replies":[{"poster":"bluefire mark 2","date":"2019-02-09T08:25:59.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because you're all platinum, it's freaking normal dude stop it with the system being broken nonesense.
