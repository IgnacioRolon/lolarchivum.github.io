And while it is true he said it a while ago, he also reaffirmed it last season.\n\nDo you know the music Video for Rise, World's 2018. It highlights season 7. The beginning of the video has an ardent censer hanging high.\nSeason 7 is known by many as Ardent Censer season. Or Ardent Censer meta.  Because it was. Ardent Censer was so broken that hyper carries would buy relic shield to let their supp rush ardent censer. Twitch kog jinx kalista and hyper carries became the deciding factor of every game because janna and lulu with censer was just too strong and the adc would never die. Even ardent censer trundle was played in lcs. Patch 6.22 also introduced redemption which allowed supp to influence teamfights from afar or even dead. There was a lot less burst back then so supp could save a carry much easier.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"kaijukitten","date":"2019-07-13T12:21:38.782+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":7,"body":"Why is autofill even a thing for ranked games?

Autofill which causes people to purposefully int at times, go afk, dodge multiple queues, etc etc. Or no Autofill (possibly opt in autofill? where after so long in queue it asks if you'd like to play your off-role/autofill to shorten your timer) where queues will probably take longer but at least if you lose you'll know it was probably because the other team was better and not because your autofill Supp is a top main or something.\n\nPlus it might encourage people to branch out into other roles to fill the gaps. (Though I honestly don't understand why Supp is the most filled/least played role). Or maybe they could give people some incentive to want to play their best when they're autofilled, a small XP boost maybe? Bonus BE? A small amount of OE?\n\nMaybe they need to delve into why some roles are hated so much and improve them so more people will play the roles that are usually autofilled.\n\nI don't know, Ranked is already difficult enough as it is, it just feels like autofill causes more problems than it solves at times.","replies":[{"poster":"KuroCorbeau","date":"2019-07-13T13:13:07.490+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"I do believe that Supp is the least played roll because of the following reasons:\n\n1.

Warding, ganking, farming, counter-farming... at least in low ELO (can't speak for Gold and above, as I've never been there), what often makes the difference is the jungler (camping, above all).\nThe only thing I complain about the current support meta is gold: items should grant a little more gold than they actually do, as it's often hard to build more than 4 items, unless you opt for a full-support build.","replies":[{"poster":"Asobi Spirit","date":"2019-07-13T15:23:48.938+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also wanted to say what you said here, Jungle is roooouuuugh.

Though support is second. \n\nThe problem with that mentality, is that most players, myself included, would rather wait for a game they can enjoy than play 2-3 games they don't enjoy and have a lower chance of winning. If you've been playing all day getting your secondary roll, only to then get filled, you probably wouldn't even want to play that game out. And when that happens, it can lead to worse performance. Then your team may have to deal with playing from behind.\n\nIt's not fun for you, its not fun for your team. If you're lucky, you only have to wait 15 minutes to get out of that game. Or you may have to wait 20. Or more. At that point, if a longer queue took 15 minutes, it would be the same delay for a fun game.
