The purpose of the thread was to point out that Senna's E has too much power associated with it because it shuts down a large portion of the jungle roster with no counterplay, and also provides suggestions for toning it down.\n\nIf you want to go through this logic, any post suggesting something is overpowered is a rant.

Let's play that game by going through your post:\n\n> [title]Half the jungle roster literally cannot gank a lane with Senna in it\n\nHyperbole. Breats the proposed rule against clickbait titles. Offers zero information about which champions are affected. \n\n> Any champion that relies on a targeted ability or moderate movement speed cannot do anything against her, thanks to her shroud.\n\nMore hyperbole. No conversation can follow from \"cannot do anything against her, thanks to her shroud\". People facing Yasuo have been told _forever_ that they needed to learn how to play around Windwall. Surely her Shroud can be played around by skilled enough players?\n \n> As Udyr, I can't touch her lane. Her shroud gives more movement speed than my bear form until rank 4 and has double the duration. I can't blue smite for speed or slow, and if I somehow get close enough to see into the shroud, there's a point blank root.\n\nThis is mildly better because it gives a specific example and I have sympathy because Udyr isn't in a great place right now, but I have to ask, how many games have you played against Senna as Udyr? It's also more hyperbole. \n\n> Vi, Kindred, Xin, Ekko, Rengar, Yi, etc. all have the same issue. \n\nPeople pointed out a number of counterplays from those champions, especially Vi, which was actually a factor in removing the thread because it highlighted how much of a raw complaint your post actually was. We're pretty clear about this, if you want to complain, we're not going to stop you. Just do it in RANT or GD.\n\n>The lane is almost immune to being ganked, because the shroud prevents you from using your engage, and it lasts long enough for them to retreat to the turret, even if they're hard pushing.\n\n[Senna seems to be in a pretty good place right now.](https://blitz.gg/lol/champions/Senna)\n\nAt top, she's strong against Garen, Riven and Jax, which seems good to me because this might increase diversity up there.\n\nSenna as ADC seems to be a wash. She punishes the champions she should and loses to the ones I would expect.\n\nAs support, it makes sense she struggles against root/hook champions as someone with a super-slow shot delay.\n\n> Her E really needs to be cut back or replaced with another ability. 6 seconds is too long and it doesn't even need the movement speed.\n\nThat's an opinion you can have. I'll be interested to see how it shakes out over time.","replies":[{"poster":"Yenn","date":"2019-11-18T09:15:59.581+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is all more yikes, you're just further proving that you have an agenda to push here by trying to tell me that my opinion is wrong.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Ulanopo,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=Al9RzQ2b,comment-id=000000010000000000010000,timestamp=2019-11-18T03:44:15.084+0000)\n>\n> Hyperbole.

There is a strict character limit on titles. What the fuck?\n\nThese champions that I used as examples make up almost 40% of jungle picks. I can go through the entire roster and pick out the rest, but why would I do that if I've already demonstrated the types of champions that have issues against her? This isn't hyperbole.\n\n> More hyperbole. No conversation can follow from \"cannot do anything against her, thanks to her shroud\". People facing Yasuo have been told _forever_ that they needed to learn how to play around Windwall. Surely her Shroud can be played around by skilled enough players?\n\nExcept I use Udyr as an example and give an explanation as to how there's nothing you can do about the shroud. If you think there's something that these champions can do about it, it's on you to provide counter strategies.\n\n'Surely her Shroud can be played around by skilled enough players?' If you don't know the answer to this, are you in even in a position to be suggesting that there is something that can be done to play around it?\n\n> This is mildly better because it gives a specific example and I have sympathy because Udyr isn't in a great place right now, but I have to ask, how many games have you played against Senna as Udyr? It's also more hyperbole. \n\nThis is completely irrelevant. I've explained exactly why Udyr cannot interact with a Senna lane due to Shroud. Why is my experience even being brought into question? Again, if you're going to just say 'you haven't played against Senna enough' and not offer examples of counters, you're contributing nothing and should not be part of the conversation.\n\n> People pointed out a number of counterplays from those champions, especially Vi, which was actually a factor in removing the thread because it highlighted how much of a raw complaint your post actually was. We're pretty clear about this, if you want to complain, we're not going to stop you. Just do it in RANT or GD.\n\nThey pointed out a theoretical counterplay for exactly one champion, Vi, which is absolutely not a viable strategy at high elo, and most, if not all, other high elo players would agree with me.\n\nIf you really want to dig into this, the suggested counterplay for Vi, that she can just 'Q into the shroud' is completely absurd and not possible. Senna's Shroud gives +20% movement speed. Vi's movement speed is slowed by 15% while she charges her Q and she doesn't have any sort of speed boost. There's no realistic way for her to Q into the shroud, unless we're talking about a lane with no wards where Senna is pushed to the enemy turret. \n\n'Your opponent just needs to be playing extremely badly' should not be considered a valid counterplay for any discussion.\n\n> [Senna seems to be in a pretty good place right now.](https://blitz.gg/lol/champions/Senna)\n>\n> At top, she's strong against Garen, Riven and Jax, which seems good to me because this might increase diversity up there.\n>\n> Senna as ADC seems to be a wash. She punishes the champions she should and loses to the ones I would expect.\n> \n> As support, it makes sense she struggles against root/hook champions as someone with a super-slow shot delay.\n\nI'm not even sure what you're trying to say with this. She has 0.4% pick rate and 47% win rate in top lane. This shouldn't even have any relevance. If you want to talk about her overall viability, she has 53% win rate as support at Diamond+, which is insane for a champion who has been out for only a week.\n\nI'm really not sure why you're trying to debate Senna in a thread about your blatant abuse of moderation privileges, instead of the relevant thread which you deleted.\n\n**EDIT:** Surprise, you're also responsible for the Yuumi bullshit going on in gameplay. You're very obviously abusing your privileges to push any conversation about support balance in the direction that you want it to go.
