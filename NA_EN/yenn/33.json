You basically can't get much CS while grouped unless you're incredibly fed or rushing Deathcap as second item.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"letsfeedtogether","date":"2019-02-08T08:01:48.507+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"No. thats not a good reasonto buff a champ. and she does 1 shot them i used to all the time","replies":[{"poster":"Yenn","date":"2019-02-08T08:37:17.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=letsfeedtogether,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vJakko1d,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-02-08T08:01:48.507+0000)\n>\n> No. thats not a good reasonto buff a champ. and she does 1 shot them i used to all the time\n\n'i used to all the time'\n\nOkay, well she no longer does. You have to go Dematerializer, and even then, the casters are left with 10 health if you don't use 5/6 of them on caster minions. If you need Hourglass as your second item, you're shit out of luck, because it doesn't provide enough AP.\n\nAnd yes, that is a good reason to buff a champion. Being shut down from CSing well during the mid game, which is very crucial, is kind of game breaking. It's also compounded by the minion speed buffs making it so you can no longer hit the entire wave as it's moving, since they walk through the area too fast.","replies":[{"poster":"letsfeedtogether","date":"2019-02-08T08:46:25.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:2403}}","replies":[{"poster":"Yenn","date":"2019-02-08T08:58:52.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=letsfeedtogether,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vJakko1d,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2019-02-08T08:46:25.590+0000)\n>\n> {{item:2403}}\n\n.\n> **You have to go Dematerializer, and even then, the casters are left with 10 health if you don't use 5/6 of them on caster minions.
