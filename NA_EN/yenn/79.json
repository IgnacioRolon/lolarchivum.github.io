She was usually considered a big lane bully too but it got a lot stronger with her new passive.  She trades for that with her low range with AA and no escape abilities so that it is hard for her to kite effectively.  Hench, she is a wombo combo queen instead.  In late game she really needs to hit a good ult or she is a pretty easy target to capture.   Still, I agree that the damage is too high on her Q during the early phases of the game at the moment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-11-14T11:02:35.065+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"How many double ups did she land? were they bounced on a minion first that died with the Q?

Besides, if you give her a weak laning phase she'll just be stomped by everyone else like she was before the reworks. It's very difficult to access Love Tap's damage after you start roaming unless people are dumb enough to come in pairs and get kited to death. and She can't weave double ups betweeen her AAs once she gets Attack speed because it lowers her DPS\n\nThis is like complaning that Graves slaughters you at melee range, with OR without items. Or that Caitlyn won't let you farm because she has a gazillion traps between the minions and yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"kaltenashes","date":"2015-11-14T16:01:44.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and that valor is a taxi driver now with a pretty ct blind (next patch)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-11-14T12:11:54.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is pretty common, especially after Miss Fortune gets a BF sword.
