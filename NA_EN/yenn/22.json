They could go do something else for a while, relax, recharge, and then come back with a fresh attitude. It's a lot more heavy-handed than their current \"we'll toss in a load screen tip about taking a few deep breaths\" thing that reminds me of Mr. Smithers asking Marge \"don't you think you've gambled enough? ...okay; we're required by law to ask every 75 hours,\" but it could work out.","replies":[]}]}
