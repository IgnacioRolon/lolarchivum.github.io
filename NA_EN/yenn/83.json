The point may be \"why am I getting penalized for feeders\" without taking into account that its a 5v5 game. In almost all his games, someone in the game is feeding. Its just how the game is played - a good player will make his opponent into a \"feeder\" even if the opponent doesnt generally play poorly. Coupled with the fact that every player has bad games and the team with the feeder often loses, its really not getting punished at all - its just the nature of the game. \n\nGetting a feeder is random. Going against a feeder is random. Part of the game depends on whether or not, on average, you can overcome the deficits of your team while minimizing the strengths of the enemy. You cant expect a 5v5 game like League to have its outcome solely determined by your own play. If you want your own skill and no other factor to determine your win conditions, youre looking for a PvE or a 1v1 PvP type of game.

Most of them will just repeatedly suicide into the enemy if they died once because they think they can fight him (I know this because my lane opponents usually keeps doing this and never learns his lesson).  Yes I'm good, Yes I don't belong in this elo, but its very frustrating to have to deal with several fed enemies simply because my teammates decided the best way to lane is to launch themselves at the enemy till they've got four or five deaths.  Other issues are trolls, afkers, 12 year old kids who rage at the simplest of stuff and others who turn a potentially winnable game into a 4v5.\n\nBefore I go I would like to direct your attention to this game: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2398709872/219387867?tab=overview\n\nIn this game I got uber fed because the enemy was simply terrible at the game.  I thought it was winnable but my team proved me wrong.  While I was clearing out superminions to prevent them from destroying nexus towers my team who was severely behind decided it would be best to fight 4v5s without their carry.  When they all died to the enemy and 5 enemies rushed nexus, there was absolutely nothing I could do even with my 18 kills and 300 cs.  I ended that game with an S+ being overall unsatisfied because of my teammates.  People just don't care in bronze and sometimes in silver and it just makes climbing a harder task because each game you roll a dice and pray that you get good teammates and all the trolls go on the enemy team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2017-01-17T00:59:38.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup. \nToo many players with 1,5´KDA on average and average 10 deaths stay in higher tiers just because the current system is so forgiving on doing bad and not really rewarding on doing good and you will get carried once in a while and somehow maintain that ~50%winrate. \nAnd i still highly believe that riots system puts you into trashteams on purpose. \nOn my smurf i have 75% winrate currently playing in silver 1 with hig gold/plat already. \nAlways the same, after 3-5 wins or as soon as i hit promo my teammates have an average winrate of 40% or even worse. \nThe current meta of: jungler roflstomps every lane just adds so much frustration. \nLiterally one gank and a kill is  enough so both are a level ahead and snowball out of control. \nIn my last few smurf games i was doing well, really well but there was just no way of getting back or carrying because everyone snowballs sooo hard and my team wasn't even feeding THAT hard. Like the highest deathcount was 6. Which is average to say in gold tier. \nBut a small lead leads to 5 towers+firstblood and suddenly the enemy is 5k ahead and rofl stomps you. Add on the current dmg creep where everyone gets oneshotted=freelo even for mechanically trash players and this is what bothers me the most. \nI average around 8-9 cs/min in most of my games and having more CS is winning the lane, denying XP and cs for example but it literally doesn't matter when they are already back or ahead once they got one single gank or FB tower.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-01-16T18:17:41.771+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot's stance on this:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tuSJM10.png?b","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bigg Facts","date":"2017-01-17T18:10:06.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like an average day for me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yenn","date":"2017-01-17T04:14:42.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just had someone force our mid to swap with them or they were going to troll, and I already dodged my last game.
