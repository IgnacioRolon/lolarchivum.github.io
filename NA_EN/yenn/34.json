For this to be true the hitbox of the **small fish (lure)** would have to be 450 (that&#x27;s as big as the **gigalodon** hitbox. I don&#x27;t think that is the case.\n\nI'm saying that if you're at 1300 (max range) from Fizz, you need 450 movement speed to sidestep the fish (in any direction).\n\nIf you're closer than 1300 range (i.e. even if it's the smallest), you still can't side step it, because it moves too fast. I used max range because it gives the most time and requires the least movement speed to dodge (if it were dodgeable).\n\ni.e. if you're at 400 range, the fish reaches your initial position in ~0.3 seconds. You need to move more than it's base radius of 200 in 0.3 seconds; you need over 600 movement speed to sidestep it, and that's not including how much it's grown by in that time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DepressedTomoko","date":"2018-08-06T12:20:30.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's extremely easy to dodge if you're in mindgames with the opponent, otherwise yea you won't dodge it without mobility.
