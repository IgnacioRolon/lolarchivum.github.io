At the same time, I need to do wolves to hit level 3, and I can't effectively gank at level 2 because I'm at a disadvantage to the solo lanes.\n\nBecause of this, my ganks are now 100% predictable in every game, and the down time ensures I have little chance of winning against opponents whose champions have AoE in their kits, because they gain a significant EXP advantage during my down time.\n\nOn top of that, I'm now forced to always start red if I'm on the top team, which makes my path also completely predictable. \n\nIf I try to start blue, I need to do both gromp and wolves before I go to my red. If the opponent knows I started blue, they can invade and steal my red while I'm at wolves, putting me at a massive disadvantage, because doing either of the top side camps will leave me too low to contest scuttle, after seeing my red is gone, aside from not being able to win duel without red. If I go straight to red without doing wolves, I have to backtrack for them, which is a huge loss of time and puts me at a disadvantage, similar to as if I had started red.\n\nThis change should not have happened.","replies":[{"poster":"FireDrizzle","date":"2019-05-04T10:24:26.168+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you start {{item:1039}} on blue side  you can cast a spell on birds and walk too red and regen a lot while you take red.

Unless you skip the mini ones, in which case you won’t get level 3 in the middle of the wolf camp, so you’re going to take even more damage from them.\n\nTbh jungle is just fucked.
