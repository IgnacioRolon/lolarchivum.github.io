That's what burst does, you have no HP and barely any MR. A single defensive item is not going to protect you from burst damage. Specially not from someone who was FULL BUILD!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-18T09:11:55.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you talking about the game as lux just before your most recent game where your only item with a defensive stat was an abyssal scepter?\n\nCause yeah, Leblanc should be killing you with two skills at that point. Build a banshee veil, rod of ages, rylais, liandries torment, anything. You cant buy an offensive item with a defensive stat and think yourself immune to burst damage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ScissorsNstuff","date":"2017-01-18T10:51:51.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you don't have defense on and you don't kill leblanc faster than she kills you then leblanc will kill you\n\nNothing more needs to be discussed here...\n\nExcept ahri, when leblanc goes deep ahri just goes faster.
