Just because a random choice has constraints doesn't mean it's totally predictable and not random. When \"the only thing you don't know is which buff will spawn next,\" that is a random dragon. I don't know how long you've been playing, but there used to only be one kind of dragon, so there was no unpredictability about it. Introducing different varieties of drakes that are chosen based on no preceding event is a random element, by definition.\n\nSimilarly, the exact spawn time and location of each type of jungle plant is chosen randomly. For example, Scryer's Bloom can appear in two possible locations in each quadrant. Once a quadrant's Scryer's Bloom is destroyed, it respawns in one of these two locations, chosen at random. The respawn timer is a randomly chosen duration between 5 and 6.5 minutes (starting after the plant is destroyed). Plants, therefore, are another source of randomness in the game.\n\nI see nothing wrong with simply removing Klepto from the game, as it was mostly only used by Ez, with a few occasional outliers like GP (both of these being more \"abuse cases\" than \"use cases,\" highlighting the problem with the rune). If it did have to be replaced for some reason, it should've been replaced with something good, not something terrible like Omnistone. Klepto was a poorly-conceived idea in a past preseason, and Omnistone is a poorly-conceived idea in the current preseason. Justifying Omnistone with \"something has to take its place\" is a form of the politician's syllogism: \"Something must be done. This is something. Therefore, we must do this.\"\n\nI wasn't referring to live in contrast to PBE, wasn't even thinking about PBE. I just meant \"push to live servers\" as a way of saying \"add new changes to the game.\" Sorry for that confusion.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ValiantKiller","date":"2019-11-23T04:03:12.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PZThd0F7,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-11-22T13:01:36.937+0000)\n>\n> We got random dragons a while back, random plants a year or two ago, now we have a random rune.

Conqueror is objectively and mathematically better for Sylas at all times, because you will only get Conqueror some of the time with Prototype: Omnistone.\n\nNow, let's say Prototype: Omnistone was buffed so that it also makes the random keystones 20% stronger. In that case, some games Sylas might be better off taking Prototype: Omnistone for the versatility it offers, and the occasionally stronger version of Conqueror.","replies":[{"poster":"Cobothegreat","date":"2019-11-26T21:16:24.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you and everyone else here seems to be missing is that DH stacks effect all other keystones so Conq Sylas vs Omnistone Conq Sylas with 3stacks of DH the Omnistone sylas is getting a bigger benefit from conq.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"vurtruvious","date":"2019-11-23T01:19:48.842+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Laughs in {{champion:77}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2019-11-22T15:24:25.457+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:164}} and {{champion:24}} because they can use any Keystone in the game.\nAltho both preffer New Conqueror because of the way it functions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"World peace plz","date":"2019-11-22T13:28:30.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The stone should somehow know what champ you play like for example jax i can live with it to get random afthershock pta or qon but when i would play champs like teemo it dont give runes like afther shock cause its useless on teemo.

The benefit was the items was something you can use to augment your playstyle, or dust to get gold. So at the very least, for champs without a real keystone, or even champs with a good stone, it provided an option with a clear benefit. Extra gold.\n\nThe problem is theres no benefit for anyone. If your champ has a clear cut rune to use, this rune would just handicap them. I wouldn't want to get,bfor example, fleet on my support or something. For the champs that have no dedicated rune or a versatile rune, it looks like it would have potential but it still boils down to, \"why would I take a random rune every x seconds when i can just take the one that's strongest for this match up?\"\n\nI think it should give the rune a high, high and a low low. It needs some kinda incentive to be used. I'd personally see it as appealing if it gave stronger versions of normal runes but on a long CD. \n\nFor example:\nOmnistone harvest: will deal 40-120 bonus damage opposed to the 20-60 but then a cooldown kicks in and the player is without any stone for a min or 2. Then they get say, phase rush that will give a larger ms speed boost but then again they'll be runeless for a while. It would be a lot more interesting to play around those unique power windows imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NelsieLisnen","date":"2019-11-22T16:29:07.247+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Big surprise? Naaaah. However, what's funniest to me was that Riot removed Kleptomancy because it was supposedly too versatile. Instead of nerfing it and maybe introducing a 4th keystone, they completely remove it and introduce a joke of a keystone. Not only that, their new Conqueror is not just versatile anymore. It's taken by like 50% of the champion pool. Mages can use it, ADCs can use it, Juggernauts, Bruisers, it's even better than before on champions it was already good on. But let's just put HALF of the blame on riot and try to find the root of the problem. So, yeah, kleptomancy was never the problem, the problem is:\n\nA) The kneejerking playerbase that constantly whines and wants things removed instead of brainstorming to fix them\nB) Riot pandering to that unfortunately hefty portion of the playerbase.\n\nLike, on the same train of thought, why not just dump champs like Yasuo, Fiora and Akali to a garbage bin and replace them with rushed imitations instead of trying to find viable solutions to the champs themselves? It's really pretentious of many people, because when you want an organic part of the game to be straight up removed, that is like you will for the game to be thrown into a state of imbalance, unavoidably. So why act all flustered when this very imbalance and the rushed attempts to fix it, because something has to fill the place of lost mechanics and items, turns out to be imbalanced?","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-11-23T05:20:50.304+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Klepto was a problem.

I see people posting delete Yasuo memes even though the strengths and weaknesses of this champ have been explored and exposed in depth ever since his release. What is your stance? That the playerbase of which a sizable part consists of immature 12 year olds can judge what balanced gameplay is while being faultless and holy? False equivalence? You know champions have a little thing called matchups right? And matchups are key elements in the fabric of the meta right? You know, the way in which champions interact with and against each other creating a power structure? Why don't you try removing lee sin from the meta and see whether or not no other lane and champ notices that? What about Gragas? Kai'sa? Renekton? Hmm. Klepto can be taken by any champ? Sure, just like ANY other keystone can be used by ANY champion save for a few. What kind of a point is that? And if we follow your logic about champions, then Klepto wouldn't really affect champions that didn't use it exclusively. Klepto was used not by everyone, but by champs who didn't have any other optimal options set in stone, so that they could benefit from the earlier powerspike it offered. That doesn't mean it was optimal on most champs. No adc save for Ez used it, and the top Karmas and Viktors were sufficiently driven out of the meta long before Klepto was removed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Astronomy","date":"2019-11-23T16:41:12.558+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I'm very interested in hearing what Riot or the people who designed the keystone have to say about it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garson211","date":"2019-11-22T17:21:52.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rune for trolls, i seen 3 times this rune all 3 used by inters to rundown mid.EVEN TROLLS HAVE NOW RUNE THX RITO POGCHAMP","replies":[]},{"poster":"TJK2719","date":"2020-01-06T16:26:35.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It’s completely mind blowing that this rune was made to replace klepto they just made the entire inspiration rune tree useless","replies":[]},{"poster":"GenOblivion","date":"2019-12-27T15:05:42.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they buff the rune to be more consistent in giving you what you need then it will be broken on champs that could run various runes\nif it stays inconsistent then it's garbage.
