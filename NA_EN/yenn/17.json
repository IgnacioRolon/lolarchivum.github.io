I would be extremely surprised if he doesn't have at least one report for intentional feeding in 90% of his 200 games.\n\nAll of these accounts should have been permanently banned long ago, and it's absurd that he can evade a ban and continue inting in hundreds of games.

He's doing the same thing at all stages of the game, but his early game strength makes it work in the early game, while it has zero chance of success in the late game.\n\nHe 'locks on' to any champion that gets near him, and chases it down until one of them dies. After the early game, the only possible outcome is Alistar dying.\n\nFor example, in one game, we watched him chase a full health Malzahar from his outer turret all the way to his inhibitor around 21 minutes, while the entire team was at the base. After about 25 minutes, he said he was bored with the game, and started running directly into the enemy AD carry every time he respawned. He was basically permanently dead.\n\nThe win rate is a side effect of this season's early game having insane snowball potential. In the season he was banned for it, it didn't work so well in the early game, and he actually demoted out of Diamond V multiple times, which is extremely hard to do.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2019-02-13T12:50:25.989+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yenn,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=TEmKw6bZ,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-02-13T11:30:52.806+0000)\n>\n> In this case, the combination of the consistent pattern of incredibly high deaths and the volume of reports should be able to algorithmic-ally identify that something is wrong.\n\n\"Incredibly high\" is not really an objective measure, it also does not necessarily imply a lack of trying to win, as certain strategies with high death counts have emerged a bunch of times over the years.\nHow often they are reported… really shouldn't matter much, to be completely honest. It may legitimize a manual review of the account, which to my knowledge it does already, but banning somebody purely because he was reported by a lot of players is not sensible.\n\nBut what's really interesting is that the second factor of how many people reported a player has to measured **against** the first factor of a high number of deaths. Humans are innately biased when it comes to intention. If somebody does something that often yields in a certain result, people are prone to assume that the result is the intention of that somebody.\nIn other words: Somebody with a high death score is **automatically** going to be reported more often for intentionally feeding. So, ironically, the higher somebody's death count the **less** you can rely on reports for intentional feeding when they are issued in good faith, as statistically the expected bias becomes stronger.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-02-16T00:55:51.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yenn,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=TEmKw6bZ,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-02-13T11:30:52.806+0000)\n>\n> In this case, the combination of the consistent pattern of incredibly high deaths and the volume of reports should be able to algorithmic-ally identify that something is wrong.\n> \n> If an actual human is looking at it, his chat logs don't leave any question about whether or not he's inting; he literally says in chat that he's doing it.\n> \n> I made another post about this, but it starts off as just hyper aggressive play, which works very well for Alistar in the early game, but transitions into actual bonafide intentional feeding as the game progresses.
