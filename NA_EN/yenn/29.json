League isn't entirely skill based like sports, it's also a numbers game, which you lose when you're at a disadvantage.\n\nAlso, while they have the advantage, you can easily be shoved out of lane or denied CS, especially if they can freeze the lane. You're completely fucked with no recourse.\n\nAnd on the off chance you do collect it, you probably now have a bounty and are still behind.\n\ni.e. I just had a Morde + Alistar duo with a combined 17 deaths at 20 minutes. Either the Yi or Lucian they fed would take at least 3 of us to kill alone, without their team mates","replies":[]}]}]}
