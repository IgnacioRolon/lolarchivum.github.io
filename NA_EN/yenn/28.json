I'm not saying ADC is useless when fed - far from it; they're supposed to be the carry - but I think other roles have some agency, enough to stand a chance at having an impact.\n\nI'm gonna spectate some more right now while I snack compulsively. I'll keep an eye out for the phenomenon you're describing.","replies":[{"poster":"OtterlyLost","date":"2019-02-28T12:13:09.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You wont find it. I'm finding that Solo laners and Jungle have more agency and control over the game than even a fed ADC and that carrying from the ADC position pretty much requires you to play perfectly while carrying from mid/top/jungle literally only requires you to kill the fed ADC, an extremely easy feat since peel oriented supports have been weakened severely.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-28T08:00:44.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yenn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mipH0dFR,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-02-28T07:15:15.290+0000)\n>\n> I'm not talking about the winning bottom lane 'doing well,' I'm talking about the carry having a ridiculous score like 20-2.

However, the ADC on the winning side did the most champ damage in the match by far, which was surely important, although it didn't seem like she was getting much done while I was watching.\n\nMatch for reference: https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA1/219822320","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Metal Janna","date":"2019-02-28T06:59:07.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is how mid has been for about a year now.
