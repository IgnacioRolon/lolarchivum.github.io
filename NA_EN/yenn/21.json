Look at the last buff they gave to Trundle, it's like they're just completely out of touch with their own roster, like there's no thought that goes into what they're doing. \n\nThey nerfed the hell out of Pillar, his bread n' butter skill for teamfighting, skirmishing, nearly everything (it's near useless at early ranks, and by the time it becomes useful most games are already decided). Then they nerfed his base damage and changed his scaling on Chomp so it's weaker early and scales a bit better IF he builds a decent amount of damage. The problem with this is that he scales primarily with health and CDR, and damage-wise scales about as well as most support tank champions. In addition, if he wants to actually not be dead weight he maxes W last, which makes the latest buff pretty much pointless. \n\nNobody picks Trundle for his damage, so no matter how much they buff his damage he's never going to be picked over champions that have real damage scaling, as well as more consistent ways of dealing damage. I mean damn, I'm no expert on balancing, but logic would denote that if hitting his Pillar with nerfs is what made him disappear, maybe that's what should be changed. Maybe the nerfs were too harsh. But no, it's like they completely lack any semblance of common sense when they make changes. \n\nIt just gets so tiring.

When his skills become weak, he simply doesn't get picked, much less building an expensive item like Trinity Force. In my arrogant opinion he doesn't scale well enough as a damage source to justify a lofty purchase like that, especially one with no real defensive stats. The CDR is the most attractive thing about the item, but there are better choices for that. \n\nFor example {{item:3800}} is literally amazing if you need health, sustain, CDR and want to actually catch targets. I wouldn't be surprised if Riot nerfs it at some point. This is probably one of the best items in the game right now for champions that scale with health and have limited tools for sticking to targets.\n\nIf you want attack speed/on hit {{item:3153}} is exponentially better than Trinity on him. However, because Vayne is abusing it it's getting a price increase of 100g, fantastic. I mean, they could just nerf Vayne but god forbid she doesn't get picked every other game. Neeko occasionally builds this as well, but clearly her invalidating melees in lane isn't the problem, it's the item.

It's cheaper, has health regen, some armor, mana, **and** CDR attached to it. For only 2650 Gold that is a deal. The active is also incredibly strong. I can't think of a single health-scaling champion that doesn't also want more CDR in their build. The item basically improves everything they do, while also providing sustain and a powerful active.
