I can&#039;t even carry games as jungle, because I can&#039;t rely on anyone responding to ganks.\nThe other half spend the entire game raging and/or feeding.\n\ni.e. last game had first two picks both auto-lock jungle and spend the entire game raging at each other.\n\n**I have fucking Silver players in my normals who are better than this shit and rage less.**\nWhy is Riot not doing anything about this? It's pretty fucking sad.","replies":[]}
