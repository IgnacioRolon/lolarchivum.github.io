I can't even gank anything, because I'm at such a huge disadvantage, and there's nothing for me to farm because my entire jungle is gone.\n\nCan this please be fixed, instead of reducing jungle EXP? It's sad that this problem hasn't been addressed by now, and further lowering EXP is just going to make this exact scenario worse.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-10-21T09:10:34.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you expect to win a 3v5?","replies":[{"poster":"Yenn","date":"2019-10-21T09:35:11.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=55ZGXKEU,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-10-21T09:10:34.771+0000)\n>\n> Do you expect to win a 3v5?\n\nThey briefly disconnected and reconnected a couple seconds later.\n\nThe problem isn't winning a 3v5, the problem is that I don't have the ability to acquire either EXP or gold because of these early deaths in my solo lanes.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-10-21T09:47:19.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yenn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=55ZGXKEU,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-10-21T09:35:11.341+0000)\n>\n> They briefly disconnected and reconnected a couple seconds later.\n> \n> The problem isn't winning a 3v5, the problem is that I don't have the ability to acquire either EXP or gold because of these early deaths in my solo lanes.\n\nYou mean they disconnected mid-fight, died, reconnected, and never recovered from that setback?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
