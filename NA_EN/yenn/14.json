If one side is at a clear, detectable disadvantage (i.e. because not one, but two, players are auto-filled), the game shouldn't be made and we should be kept in queue.\n\nThis is even less acceptable when you consider that the system auto-fills people just for the hell of it, and not necessarily to reduce queue times.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Saltarin","date":"2019-04-01T08:18:07.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Why is this even still a thing?\n\nBecause you guys dont play ADC or Supp, since you all queue as Mid well, autofill happens","replies":[]},{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2019-04-01T05:11:24.417+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"translate: i got fucked by bot lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Clockwork Mouse","date":"2019-04-01T06:31:30.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't even get auto fill at times.
