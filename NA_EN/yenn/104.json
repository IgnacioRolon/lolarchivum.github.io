He cannot 1v1 any tank. He cannot 1v1 any non-ADC with sustain. He cannot out-burst any burst caster. He cannot out-damage any sustained caster. Basically, he can&#039;t kill anything unless he&#039;s way ahead.\r\n\r\nHe also can&#039;t team fight unless the enemy team has five immobile champions with no CC. If I try to get into the enemy team, the support or front lines will CC me before I get in range. If I somehow get in range of a high priority target, there&#039;s a good chance it has some sort of mobility, and will just mobility out of range. Or just kill me when someone on their team CCs me.\r\n\r\nThis is pretty stupid. It was fine in earlier seasons, when there was less mobility and CC, but right now it&#039;s impossible to get a good ult off unless the enemy team is borderline retarded and has picks with no disengage, targeted CC, or mobility.","replies":[]}
