Mainly the buff to tenacity and armor/mr scaling for tanks. The only reliable way an adc gets away from tanks is because of what the rest of the team brings. Take Irelia for example. With the right runes, masteries, and merc treads she gets about 65% tenacity. A good, fed irelia turns into an assassin that just doesn't care about the frontline, and will jump through them not worrying about the cc. I honestly think adcs need a buff to armor shredding, or stacking armor shred other than cleaver. Take Cho'gath for example. He builds warmogs, stoneplate, and locket. Lets say he has 6 stacks. He has around 3k health, stoneplate with stoneskin gives him close to 150 armor and 6k health. (cleaver won't do anything to him, so you have to go lw), he can silence the frontline, knockup the backline, flush ult and insta burst an adc. After that because your team has no damage because you are dead, the team fight falls apart and you lose. Adc plays further back to counter this, they do no damage, and are open to assassins picking them off because you have no peel that far into the backline. Or cho just flanks and kills them anyway.\n\nI do agree with the change to crit, rather than a flat 200%, it should scale with how many times you auto attacked to help the assassins to their job. I have been on the giving end of this many times, where an assassin who definitely has enough burst to kill me jumps on me, takes 90% of my health and then I just kill them in 2 shots. Start at 100%, every auto attack increases the crit DAMAGE done on a successful crit. If you fail to crit 5 times, it's fine because even though you didn't crit, you still increase the the damage on the next successful crit. Obviously IE would have to be changed to \"Base crit damage increased by 50%\". If you get a lucky first crit, you would to 150%, lucky second 160% AD ETC scaling up to the original IE at 250% crit damage after the 10th auto attack.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaeblen","date":"2017-09-18T03:58:29.478+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"3 points for you to consider:\n---\n---\n> After that because **your team has no damage** because you[adc] are dead, the team fight falls apart and you lose.\n\nFunny how you don't think that's a design issue...\n---\nhow come you assume non-adc on enemy team will deal damage, but not on your own team?\n---\nyour argument about Cho-gath is... well, lets be nice and just say it isn't convincing.

They make up almost half your team and are key in taking objectives, especially dragons which affect the entire team. They're designed to be a large part of deciding the game by role and because it's 2 championd out of the 5 on your team. ADCs are ideally easy to shut down since anyone who can get on them, cc them, and burst them kinda screws with what they have going for them. A fed ADC becomes a powerhouse who's support allows them to survive the stuff they're supposed to be weak to and burn through people with their undodgable attacks. So yeah a fed bot lane is definitely a nightmare and would probably decide the game. Bot lane can also be extremely snowbally. Since a lot of the time when one ADC gets ahead the enemy support is forced to play more defensively since it's very hard to win a fight based so largely around who out point and clicks in a full on trade. Meanwhile the fed botlane can still play very aggressively with their support and often still get kills regardless of the enemy trying to play passively. I think the fact that ADCs are based around auto attacks just makes snowballing lane very easy since if you have more damage than them, they won't be able to out play point and clicks to win the fight all that easily and get some kills to catch up. ADCs and support items might be overturned but that's not all that determines why a bot lane can decide a game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-09-17T11:50:36.408+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played a couple of games as ADC last night, Sivir mainly if i recall.\n\nIn the game i won, i took a single tower over the duration of a entire game, that's literally all i did except kill enemy rakan that kept doing crazy dives every now any then.\n\nBut yeah, i won despite only taking a single tower. \n\n\nI didn't do shit the entire game, my jungler had twice as much damage as i did. \n\n\nFelt so powerful and OP, didn't have to do anything in particular except farm to win.....and even my farm was shitty^^","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2017-09-17T16:01:30.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"What is that supposed to prove? \nSivir is not an adc that snowballs well or can carry hard until 4+ items.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-09-17T16:16:24.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A number of people on the boards state that marksmen are currently deciding how each and every game goes, that they effectively dominate the game by their sheer awesome power.\n\n\nI just wanted to share an example of me playing a marksman while sitting on my hands not even farming alright and my team won without me doing anything to help them.\n\nExcept that one tower.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2017-09-17T16:28:29.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When one player sabotages the lane whether bottom or support, their ally performs worse and the game becomes something of a 3 vs 5.
