This can't just be blown off as a bad game, either; there are players like this in every single game.\r\n\r\nWhy isn't anything being done about this?

You took too long and their wards expired, leaving them helpless and only hoping that you would make your way over to them soon. \n\nSo just make sure that they know they are placing their wards before you place yours so you can re-ward and they don't have to worry or recall to buy more wards since you couldn't re-ward their wards when they assumed you would.
