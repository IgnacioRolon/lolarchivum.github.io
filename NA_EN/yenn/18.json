He's busted and Riot designed themselves into a corner with him. There is almost no counter play depending on your team comp, and there's almost no way for Rengar to be useful depending on certain team comps. He's a champion with a leap and abilities that do damage. Nothing else matters. He either one shots or doesn't and then dies. And thus he is constantly thrust around from being too strong to too weak depending on Riot's mood. He's an example of a champion that's the opposite of an overloaded champion. As all he really does is leap and QWE spam which is essentially just damage and then a slow. \n\nIf you die to a Rengar, don't feel bad and don't feel mad. Easiest way to cheese the champion are clusters are champions with some form of CC. And if that's not possible, at least 1 other player with you who has CC and will survive the burst is all that's needed. Just have said champion move till he's marked by Rengar then keep him between you two before he gives up or jumps and gets killed, a lot of people don't feel like wasting ult so they will go with 2.

The adc's only defensive item was a doran's shield (no armor) and was underleveled with only one kill at the end of the game (the game ended 4 to17 in favor of the enemy team). Needless to say, he got fed. When assassins get fed that's what they do. This is more of a snowballing and scaling problem in the game than it is a \"no counterplay.\" Rengar has counterplay, it's just that if you feed him, or any assassin in general, they tend to make your game not fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2019-01-31T13:46:28.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"GA is a pretty valid option for an ADC.
