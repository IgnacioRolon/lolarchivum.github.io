It costs him nothing but a trinket ward to fuck up his combo. Then he came back a minute later and just flashed into me, instead of bothering with the ward hop.\n\nThis is fucking ridiculous. It happens literally every time I&#039;m playing against a Lee Sin as an immobile caster, and I know it&#039;s going to happen, and I can&#039;t do anything to stop it. I can keep chickens warded, but I can&#039;t defend the ward, and then he can just come back a minute later; if I try to defend it while he clears it, he&#039;ll just do this to me.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-02-10T05:41:10.587+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Imagine having to actually ward the map and pay attention to things to not die.\n\nYou got outplayed.

My ward at chickens is constantly cleared. I cannot defend it and I don't have unlimited wards. Completely leaving the lane every time he clears my ward is not an option, I'll never get CS.\n\n\\> Zed tanked your combo since he knew you lacked the damage needed to kill him\n\nZed tried to trade with me using his W and missed, so I punished him. If I leave him at full health, he'll roam to side lanes and pick up kills, which is significantly worse than me being dived. Aside from that, he can 100 to 0 me under my turret if my Barrier is down. Keeping him below max health prevents him from blowing my Barrier. Not interacting with Zed is not an option.\n\n\\> and it let Lee dive you because you had no way to respond, since your Q was on cooldown.\n\nWrong again, I couldn't have responded either way. Lee only used half of his Flash range, not the full Flash range. I had vision of him for maybe 1/4 of a second, at which point he could have flashed over my Q, or just flashed before he entered vision. Best case scenario, Lee is bound while kicking me and nothing of value is gained.\n\n\\> Not to mention how Zed set up the dive by getting minions right up to your turret. The minions you ignored in order to try to combo Zed.\n\nThis is completely irrelevant. Now you're just making shit up, or you actually have zero understanding of the game. The minions don't matter. They can do this even if the minions are at his turret.\n\nAlso, Lee's R + Q combo took about 70% of my max health without the Barrier. It was not mostly Zed.\n\nGet out of here with your armchair analysis, you clearly lack understanding of how the game works.","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2019-02-10T07:41:06.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yenn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2lzaiYPb,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2019-02-10T06:51:44.018+0000)\n> Also, Lee&#x27;s R + Q combo took about 70% of my max health without the Barrier.

Lee-sin is a bonafide assassin at this point, building 400+AD with 40% CDR and roflstomping squishies with his massive 450+1.0bAD ult and 210+1.6 bAD Q.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-02-10T16:08:11.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"zed is like \"your already dead\" after she snares him she sees lee sin... lux: NANI? proceeds to get blown up by 2 ults and a flash.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-10T08:17:49.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It took them over two seconds to kill you, not one (starting from when Lee ulted you), and the fight was a melee assassin plus a melee fighter against a squishy mage.
