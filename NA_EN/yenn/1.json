I have seen Fizz ults just change 90 degree angles to hit people.\n\nThe latch hit box is strange, but at level 8 with only Revolver + Dark Seal (no stacks), his AA + Q + AA + W + AA combo deals around 850 damage, while most mid champions have a little over 1000 health. That's assuming he doesn't even land his ult, or hit you with Playful / Trickster, or use Ignite.\n\nThis is way more problematic than his ult hit box, considering he doesn't even need to land it against immobile champions.","replies":[{"poster":"BobaFlautist","date":"2017-10-04T16:59:07.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"How are you letting him hit you with 3 AAs if he didn't land E (I assume because you didn't include the damage)?

This is with 24.4 lethality, mind you, the numbers would be much higher if he specced into raw ad but it is pre-mitigation so it's probably a little less even with the lethality. This is also with no keystone (Thunderlord's anyone?), no ignite, and assuming he misses both w returns.\n\nAssassins do a ton of burst if you let them sit in melee range and smack you.
