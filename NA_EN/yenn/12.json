Aery procced 4 times in in that fight.  The rest, 3 heat targetted hits and 2 empowered autos.  (pretty much 5 autos because the dmg early-midgame from w is negligibly different from base autos.   Lategame W deals a total of 195+40% AP (as in all three attcks add up to that)... early game it's unlikely a Zoe will have the W ranked more than once, much less more than twice, so we'll be generous and give it two ranks for a total of 105+40% ap. the empowered autos are gonna have a total of 126.2 +20% AP, she empower autod u twice so that's 252.4  + 40% .  so 357.4 +80%.   She wasn't holding more than 100 AP, so we'll be generous and say she had 100 AP, that's 80 dmg added on so 437.4 dmg (factored in before mr)... So if Lux had no MR items (only had her base mr), that's only 329.1 dmg she'll be taking , the rest of that dmg comes from Aery, Ignite and the GLP (glp was small anyway tbh).   \n\nSo 136.5 dmg from Aery (4 procs) 167 dmg from GLP, 230 dmg from Ignite, then some dmg from the minions (about 66.. maybe more because at least 3... [i think it was 5, but for sure 3 hit u, so we'll use the lower number]... managed to hit u and they each deal ~22 dmg at that time)...  so after MR and armor  it's pretty much 102.4 dmg from Aery, 125.25 dmg from glp, 230 dmg from ignite and ~43 dmg... So that's  ~529 not coming from Zoe, more than half ur health.\n\nEDIT:\nOh... i hadnt realized u were hit with two ignites.   Ignite doesnt stack, it just \"refreshes\" at lvl 9, ignite deals 46 true dmg per second, u were under the effects for 7-9... 9 seconds.. which is 322, 368 dmg or 414 if u count the very first moment of the second of ignite being applied which is how ignite works)  so that's actually 592.2, 638.2 dmg or 684.2 dmg (whether or not u use 7 secs, 8 secs or 9 secs of ignite).    Leaning towards it being 7 seconds of ignite rather than 8 or 9.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bears Dont Care","date":"2019-02-10T22:14:38.012+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"She hit you with a bubble at the end.
