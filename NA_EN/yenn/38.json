His win rate in NA is currently 45%.\n\nHis kit doesn't synergize well and doesn't allow him to do his job as a team fighting champion. His mobility is too weak and doesn't allow him to get on top of high priority targets and he doesn't have the survivability necessary for staying in range of high priority targets if he does manage to get in. He's forced to build two items to cover these two weaknesses, but as a result, he does no damage. This means he needs to reach 3 items to actually be effective.\n\nKlepto covered this weakness to some degree by expediting these items. Without Klepto, it takes him too long to obtain the items that he needs just to barely function. The old Nimbus Cloak also helped to cover his mobility issues, by allowing him to get on top of his target faster when he ults, but now that's gone.\n\nScaling champions needing items to be strong is one thing, but a champion should not need 3 items just to perform their basic role.\n\nUpdate his kit to something that works in 2020. If nothing else, increase the cooldown on his E and give it something like a mini-flash (i.e. Pikachu Up+B in Smash).","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-12-08T10:34:30.828+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya he needs a full rework","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahri Baka","date":"2019-12-08T12:37:46.505+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weird this isn't downvoted yet , idk much about Kennen but from what I know he is one of the most despised top laners","replies":[{"poster":"Z3SIeeper","date":"2019-12-08T12:55:08.912+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We want him reworked *because* we despise him.

If the fact that his mobility doesn't allow him to get on high priority targets then you got it wrong. The E is both for engage and disengage and it's pretty toxic to play against it on top taken how MUCH mobility it provides.

Damage in this meta simply does not allow a champ to just walk into the middle of an enemy group with dashes or leaps without having to be disguised or invisible. (Kai'sa E becomes invisible. Vayne's tumble becomes invisible. Neeko's passive is disguising her or she can W to go invisible into the enemies.) Now be it, Kai'sa and Vayne aren't gonna do a whole lot to hurt a whole group of enemies unless super fed, but Neeko... she essentially does Kennen's job. The 3 auto dmg... the root... the easy wave clear in her q... the AOE CC ult... and the quick mobility. Honestly, if they are gonna fix him, he's gonna have to take on a new identity or Kennen and Neeko will be extremely similar.","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-12-08T10:37:54.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yep he has no stealth and weak wave clear.

He can be pushed up to enemy tower and not fear ganks much. He also is great to gank for in such a long lane. The issue tho is he was meant to be a team fighter but was much better top with his pressure and it allowed his team to do other things without him dying a lot to ganks.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2019-12-08T12:04:54.257+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Kennen's in the dumpster because the ~~abusers~~ I mean mains  actually have to play the game and learn basic mechanics like farming if they want gold.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3SIeeper","date":"2019-12-08T12:52:14.446+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Kennen has no mains.
