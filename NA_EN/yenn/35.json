Having any impact on games is impossible.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":3,"down_votes":11,"body":"Last season, I climbed from Platinum III to Diamond V/Diamond IV three different times after decaying, on three different roles: the first time with jungle, second with middle, and finally with ADC before the season ended. I&#039;ve been Diamond in every season prior to this, even if most of the time I decayed before the end of the season.\n\nThis season, I&#039;m stuck in low Platinum with &lt;50% win rate in all roles, and I&#039;m struggling to have literally any impact over games where team mates are feeding, even with champions I&#039;ve historically had 55-60% win rate with in past seasons. \n\n130 games into the season, the only mid lane champion I have positive win rate on is Lux, and that was primarily due to a freak string of 15 games with teams that didn&#039;t put the game into an unwinnable state within the first 10 minutes.\n\nI have zero impact over the outcome of the game, because even if I win early in a losing game, every other lane has already fed the enemy just as much as my opponent fed me. For example, games like this:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/oBuqRe9\n\nI have 100% kill participation in a 20 minute game.\nThe jungle fed and left the game; in fact, their match history in the past week has 7 leaves.\nTop and mid were combined 0-7-0 until Taric and I gave up bottom lane to try to recover the game.\n\nThis is literally how every fucking game this season plays out, win or loss. There is no variation on it. One team has multiple lanes feeding the shit out of the enemy team, and then the fed champions just steam roll over the losing team with so much gold advantage that the losing team can&#039;t contest anything. \n\nIt doesn&#039;t matter how well I play; even if I&#039;m playing jungle, the losing teams&#039; lanes will start feeding on their own 9/10 times, without the enemy jungle&#039;s intervention, often before I even hit level 3. If I&#039;m playing a solo lane, chances are they&#039;ve died 3-5 times before I even hit level 6.\n\nThis is actually out of control. Last season felt bad, but trying to win games in this season is hopeless, thanks to the comeback mechanics just being more sources of gold for the winning team, and not actually doing anything to facilitate comebacks when one team is up 10-20 kills.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-12T08:42:21.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you believe any of this is due to it being pretty early in the ranked season?\n\nDo you think gold income in general is too high?\n\nDo you think people feed and leave on purpose, or do you think they're initially trying to do well and only leaving because they don't see any way to salvage a win after their unintentional deaths?","replies":[{"poster":"Yenn","date":"2019-02-12T08:58:05.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2QVWEngu,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-02-12T08:42:21.136+0000)\n>\n> Do you believe any of this is due to it being pretty early in the ranked season?\n> \n> Do you think gold income in general is too high?\n> \n> Do you think people feed and leave on purpose, or do you think they&#x27;re initially trying to do well and only leaving because they don&#x27;t see any way to salvage a win after their unintentional deaths?\n\nI've had no problem getting to Diamond within 50 games at the start of every past season, the timing shouldn't matter.\n\nIncome isn't too high as long as everyone's income is relatively the same, but i.e. turret plating gives the winning team up to 2400 free gold for being ahead early, on top of bounties on the one or two players who aren't feeding on the losing team.\n\nThe current meta probably gives too much incentive to play like a hyper aggressive monkey, because if you get slightly ahead with this play style, you'll easily snowball out of control with little counterplay.

If you mean splitting gold among the team, that was tried with bounties. Bounties were changed to split the shutdown gold among the killer's team in [5.22](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-522-notes), and the explanation for this change was basically \"bounties are good.\" Bounties were changed back to reward all the shutdown gold to the killer in [8.10](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-810-notes#patch-bounties), and the explanation for that revert (see [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/7lOZPHOi-quick-gameplay-thoughts-march-21) for more) was basically that it made things too binary. If only the killer was doing well on their team, shutting down a target with a bounty didn't give them enough gold to carry. If everyone on the killer's team was doing okay, the global gold turned that entire team into unstoppable carries.\n\nBy limiting a single champion's kill gold, do you mean basically inverting the current system where successive deaths reward less gold? So, a champion kills two targets who hadn't died yet and receives 300g for the first and, say, 250g for the second?\n\nOn the one hand, people want to be able to pull ahead and carry. On the other hand, people don't like watching an enemy pull ahead and carry. At the end of the day, you're 20% of your team, and you just have to hope the other 80% does okay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2019-02-12T12:54:43.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yenn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2QVWEngu,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-12T10:38:08.131+0000)\n>\n> possibly start to limit kill gold once a champion is too far ahead, to shift their focus to objectives and mitigate how badly a feeding player can throw the game.\n\nThey already do this. A feeder is worth less and less gold each time he feeds. Though I believe it should be adjusted. Snowballing is way too high. Perhaps the reduction in kill gold given by feeders needs to be much higher. Like 150 gold for dying a second time and 75 gold for each subsequent death. This way, your 0-13 bot lane doesn't give that much gold to the enemy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"mack9112","date":"2019-02-12T10:15:23.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"First off you have been diamond once with all previous seasons you being in was plat. \n\nIf you go back and look at your own game history you have plenty of games that you perform rather poorly. \n\nIt is my opinion that people who always blame others will never get anywhere in life or this game.
