Whilst a lot of people are complaining about this 'high damage assassin/fighter' meta, others metas are equally as fun. Tanks metas where a Maokai just sticks on top of you for 20 seconds a slowly whittling you to death is no fun either and neither is an ADC 4 hitting every champion in the game, whilst being almost impossible to take down, because their enchanter support, who is inevitably also meta at this time, just heals and shields them for 1,000 extra damage is fun either.\n\nMages feel different though. Aside from the rare exceptions such as {{champion:8}} and {{champion:268}} they really feel like a class that's overall really well balanced. Their damage is very obvious. Either they're high range skill shots, that will rarely kill you in one hit, or short range point and click abilities. Both of which have obvious strengths and weaknesses. Oh, you're laning against {{champion:161}} ? Make sure not to be hit by his e, or take too much poke damage from his q and you should be fine! Laning against an {{champion:1}} ? No problems, just make sure to stay out of her range and you shouldn't have any problems. \n\nAnd unlike a fed fighter or assassin, the game doesn't feel like it's over if a mage gets ahead. They simply don't have the mobility or durability to allow them to make the same mistakes that other classes can make. Get the pick on a mage who's out of position and they are unlikely going to live, no matter how fed they are. \n\nOn the flip side, if a mage falls behind, it doesn't feel like they're completely useless either. Would you rather have an 0/8 LeBlanc who can't even one shot the enemy Sona or an 0/8 Annie? Neither of them are ideal team mates but one of them still has the potential to land a huge AoE stun than can win a team fight of even the game despite being put off to an early start. Not to mention, a lot of them have pick based abilities that will allow their team to dish out the damage they may not provide, such as Lux's Q and Xerath's E. \n\nTL;DR - I believe mages should be the focal point of every team as it feels like they have clear cut strengths and weaknesses vs every class in the game, a trait no other class shares.\n\n{{sticker:sg-ezreal}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2018-08-03T16:37:16.243+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very true. It might be a weird comparison but look at Vel Koz and Atrox: Vel uses his E - it is announced, your enemy sidesteps and he knows he's save from your combo and your passive.

And then he can dash mid skill to actually change the hitbox and opposed to Vel Koz's Q there is essentially no announcement for the near instant hitbox adjustment. Not to mention Vel's Q being blocked by creeps and hitbox size. To stick with Aatrox as an example - we have reached a point where the range squishy mages like Vel Koz have on their QWE isn't paid for in lack of durability (when creating new champions) anymore.
