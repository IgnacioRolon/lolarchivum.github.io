Check my Match History if you want. It's the same build every time.\n\nThe most powerful engage. There are 2. One is flash close to the enemy and knock them up with a fast Q and ult them into your team similar to what Alistar does. The other is if you're closer and manage to flash in front of the enemy and then R + Q to keep them in your team. Exhaust can secure it. The reason this is the most powerful engage among Supports is because you can do it with more than 1 person and it also can displace/push back anyone around your ultimate, forcing them farther away.\n\nShe is best used as a disengage support, yes. But she can pretty easily be used as an aggressive one by turning your carries extremely durable by being there with your perfect timings and reactions. Ofc, this is something even i have yet to fully master. (See my build, everything is an activatable excluding M.Boots.)\n\nHer engage is strong because of her W and Q. Most people never know how to hit Q and don't buy Mobility boots on her for some reason even though it helps to outmanouver the enemy and put wards with rapid movement.\n\nBtw, you can also displace anyone with your ultimate if you use it at max range while they are running away, acting as a short form of stun. The trick is knowing the exact range of your ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"Odinakos","date":"2016-10-04T22:13:13.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all you dont bother explaining simple things like a rule of thump build. Then you say you are tired to anwer a simple question, go to op.gg. You could type \"Usually coin SS mobis, talisman locket...\" on the first post and be done. \n\nMoreso, I build the same with lucidity for more cdr (exept that wild randuin because shaco was somehow focusing me). Yes spellthiefs Jannas still exists but now that she is rare, the vast majority i encounter build more or less the same as you. It is not something special tbh.\n\nAs for the engages. The first one is quite weaker than Allistar's. It takes more spells, time(allistar's Q-flash is instant, no reaction time for counter-flash) and its more risky (both in the way in and out) as Janna is way more squishy than Allistar that can just press R. No matter the speed, you can get hit by a cc and turn the fight 4v5 in a second. Allistar can do it way easier with Q-flash combo. Furthermore during laning, Janna lacks the damage to burst in order to secure the kill. Eg sona, can flash R AA Q AA for decent burst. This can be dangerous if the enemies have the burst to counterengage.\nAnd if we go deeper, Janna's engage does not seem on **average **stronger than a flash R from Sona or Flash RQ from Nami or.. or... Seriously if we study methodically all the possible ways a support can reliably engage either 5v5, picks or laning, Janna is just average.\n\nThe second... Com on. Someone is in sub flash range and the most powerful you can think is Janna? Yes it is impressive and unexpected but the list is so huge.\n\nYes Janna can reliably engage depending on situation but many supports can do it. She is not in the same league as the most powerful ones. Far from it. So you cant say she has a good engage because of that.\nIt is like saying that Leona has the best peel in the game. Yes she has quite good cc that helps peeling (and i have turned 2v4 with good peeling), but she is nowhere near the defensive supports like Janna Braum or Nami.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2016-10-04T22:35:42.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not going to go in-depth with the build cuz i'd have to explain why and how and everything and counter the typical counter-argument of \"But AP gives better shields\" and how it's not worth as opposed to what the items provide compared to stats that are basically useless and remind me of shitty rune pages with 12 different stats that have no meaning but that's beyond the point.\n\nIn this order: Sighstone > Mobility Boots > Talisman of Ascension > Locket of The Iron Solari > Mikael's Crucible > Righteous Glory > Ruby Sighstone / Elixir of Iron\n\nI was tired because as you can see IT'S NOT 16 PM IN EU AT THE TIME OF WRITING THIS.\n\nThe vast majority upgrades the Coin into the Eye of The Oasis or forgets about it as far as i've seen and builds the rest of the dumb shit like Frozen Heart or Ardent Censer which is outclassed by Locket by a longshot.\n\nWith that said, Locket is almost mandatory anyway on any Support as of recently.\n\nQ flash instant? You do realize you can only do it once in 5 minutes? It's not even instantaneous as the Q has a cast animation and can be cancelled by..well anyone with a knockback, Janna is obviously the easiest choice here. Seeing Alistar approach alone could make me charge the tornado and \"accidentally\" hit when it was intended for his W. I mean Janna has 600 movement speed upon which most people can't react on if she gets the edge on them and only needs to be in front of someone to push back and create a small stun delay as a killzone for allies. It doesn't require flash if you get close to them, use knockup and ult.\n\nBut ofcourse, i haven't seen any other good Janna players because they build shit and they position improperly plus fail Qs and never use ult in optimal ways.\n\nYou're saying someone will expect you to do that? Not in my 2.5k games on Janna has anyone ever instakilled me when i \"Insec\" ult someone. Not once, it's always been unexpected and if you looked at my **items** you'd know i have more than enough to get out plus the movement speed.\n\nLaning? Her Laning relies on outfighting the enemy. You don't need fucking damage when the enemy Support is basically a starving mid laner and you're keeping your Adc alive better than a Soraka could.\n\nSona's ult has a 0.2 sec delay in which any..decent player can flash out of, it has short range.\n\nNami's ult has a horrendeous delay, most people can avoid it.\n\nIn my opinion, she's the best Support in the game merely because she has no weaknesses other than the lack of damage/grabbing with squishiness but with the build i use, i get 3.3k health with high resistances anyway when it's done. Braum and Nami are ridiculously useless, they blow their little burst and turn useless. Janna relies on cycling abilities or turning the enemy completely useless with the W + E AD bonus and allowing the ally to rip them to shreds.\n\nThis is why i hate mage Supports, have damage but can only do it once. If you outplay that, you've won. Janna's E and W is point and click and her ult is easy to land. What else do you need?","replies":[{"poster":"Odinakos","date":"2016-10-05T09:00:34.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, is it real that people argue that AP build is better on Janna than the normal build? I thought we got over it months ago. I could see an Ardent if you cant bother with another active(heh thats me, 3 are enouph) but thats as far as it goes. Was funny to see Jannas with more gold of spellthiefs gold over time than the gold from damage. Spellthiefs was the goto in competitive for the damage in trades and bullying 2v1s. Janna screams talisman in solo, i havent seen spellthiefs for months.\n\nAllistar's best engage is Q flash, not Flash Q. You flash during the animation. Like Mata did in the game with TSM, that did not leave reaction time to one of the best team of the world. Ofc it requires good training to do that. As for Sona 0.2 sec is perception time, add in decision time and the reaction time is way over it. Sometimes people read that but there is a very high chance Sona is gonna pull that off. I could keep throwing examples there, eg Blitz Flash E , W out, Q R. OTPs blitz can def pull that.\n\nThere is a  reason Janna is nowhere to see in competitive. She can be bullied in lane from other range supports, her offensive utility is low compared to other range supports. Teams like to sacrifice the best defence with some offence. Nami and Braum (along with others) have a lot of utility also not only damage. Nami and Karma that compete with Janna as utility range supports, have seen pick and bans in the worlds. Karma especially would be the next candidate for Victorius skin after Nida, if only for the fact that there have been 2 Victorius supports already.\n\nMage supports are another threat for the enemy team. A Zyra with Rylais Guise and Sorc will do significant damage while providing decent utility. Mage supports bring different strengths than the utility supports.\n\nKeep in mind that Janna is my alltime favorite one and i know that she is far from weak, more of middle of the pack. I dont argue that she has no offencive capability, Just that it mediocre compared to other supports. Especially compared to her competitors of range utility supports. Like Leo can peel but that is meh compared to others, her strength lies in her powerful and constant all ins and lockdowns.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2016-10-05T10:36:56.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes well you'd be surprised if you saw the Jannas i've played with. Pretty much everyone makes AP items for damage or Ardent Censer for better shields.\n\nI think you missed my point. Even if Ali's Q hits, he will not W if it gets countered and can be countered easily because Q has a cast animation and a recover animation so you can't move in front of them and W back that was. Janna's W is the only ability that slows her down everything else has no cast time.\n\nSo just because they have damage you think they're better? All of those Support can be easily outplayed or countered with something from Janna's kit and rendered helpless.\n\nThe only Support that DOES counter Janna is Brand because of his sheer hitboxes, ranges and damage output Janna can't keep up with.\n\nWell i can't argue against that on the behalf of everyone except me because i can do that but i suppose that's still something only i can do.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fenikkusu1","date":"2016-10-03T00:28:25.460+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"The sad part is that Rito won't nerf Karma anytime soon, because they've tried so hard to try to get her to see play with all the buffs they gave her after they took her identity away during her rework, which pissed off a lot of old Karma mains.

Elise is a feast or famine champion in the early game that gives early jungle pressure until she falls off. \n\nKarma is a support burst champion with kiting singed wished he had in bot lane where every adc is squishy and 2 shot them mid-late game. In mid lane she's just another poke mage but with burst, shields, substain, and lock down. \n\nThe only thing comparable to karma is leblanc but safer range and can actually stay in long team fights. Leblanc is fun right?","replies":[{"poster":"Rivuo","date":"2016-10-04T01:18:26.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Worst Spider NA,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qpG7yNYc,comment-id=00020002,timestamp=2016-10-04T01:16:28.226+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m an elise one trick, and I&#x27;d never compare elise to karma.
