They only need small buffs.\n\nMore than that, look at why they are only 47%. Their counters are popular meta picks.\n\nSyndra needs a slight buff but she was doing poorly well before the mage changes, and she is only 1 mage.\n\nBest Orianna one tricks are literally doing 1% less then the best Zoe one tricks, that right there should tell you who her WR is low. She is a hard champion to play.\n\nOverall you may have individual champions in a bad spot but the mage archtype as a whole is fine and the ones struggling are performing well on mains and only need small buffs, not anything major.","replies":[{"poster":"Ayzev","date":"2018-06-19T07:48:35.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't really making a point, just felt that I should correct that specific part.
