Games where you&#039;re forced to pick a solo lane early, and then ending up thinking &#039;Wow, this match up is so bad that I&#039;d rather just not be playing the game,&#039; are not fun and shouldn&#039;t be the norm.\n\nGames should be decided by which team plays better, not which team had to pick top/mid first.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2016-08-29T23:02:48.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meanwhile in LCS they are talking about how there is no 'hard counter that snowballs the lane' atm.","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2016-08-29T23:04:54.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd imagine that's because no one picks the champions who can be hard-countered in the first place.\nRemember that the LCS champion pool is much smaller than the pool for \"normal\" players who want to play their favourite champions instead of always just the safest picks.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2016-08-30T12:16:23.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, my comment was completely irrelevant.
