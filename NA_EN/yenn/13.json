He only has ~5 losing match ups in mid and bottom lane, while he only has 10 losing match ups in top lane (out of 70 potential match ups). Even if you first pick him, you're *probably* still going to win your lane.\n\nIf you're playing most melee champions, the match up is hopeless. His turrets will poke you down when you try to CS, while he's also moving too fast for most melee champions to engage on. If you do somehow manage to reach him, his stun grenade is impossible to miss at close range. The only melee champions who can actually do anything in these lanes are ones who can dash onto him, burst him hard, and have enough built-in survivability to not die to the turrets. There are very few champions who fit this description, and most of them are the highest performing top laners.\n\nRanged champions don't fare much better, because most are heavily reliant on skill shots, and he's just too fast to land anything on at mid to long range. It's not a matter of 'aiming better,' because his movement speed is so high that he can easily side step with mediocre reaction speed. Landing skill shots on him generally require a mistake on his part. If he does have good reaction speed, he can also drop a turret to intercept an incoming skill shot that's too close to avoid.\n\nI think one of the biggest issues is the movement speed near turrets, which seems to be a completely unnecessary part of his kit. It allows him to hard push 24/7, because nobody wants to gank him; it's too risky to dive into his turret nest, and landing anything on him when he's moving so fast is too unreliable. It's also incredibly hard to clear the turrets, even as a long range champion, because they have so much health and you generally need your cooldowns to counter his pushing.\n\nReplacing his passive with something else that doesn't give movement speed, or making the movement speed more conditional and not something he just gets for free at virtually all times in lane, would be a good starting point to giving him more lane interaction.","replies":[{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2020-01-02T17:01:57.447+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"> ranging from 52% to 54%, because he's so hard to interact with, let alone punish.\n\nYou forgot to mention his 0.5% pickrate.

Vel'koz's win rate against Heimer is consistently 40-43%, and there are only a couple of champions who can 'poke out' the turrets better than he can. It takes at least two spells to kill one turret, and he'll position them in a rough triangle to either side of the minion wave, such that you can't hit more than one with a single spell, unless you want to put yourself in a bad position to target it. You also need some of those cooldowns to wave clear, plus it's a mana sink.\n\nOn top of that, Heimer doesn't need his abilities to clear the wave. If you use two of your cooldowns to clear a turret, he has a window to just walk up with his movement speed and dump W + E on top of you from close range, since half your kit is on cooldown. Even if he only clips you with the edge of a rocket, he'll still win the 'trade' with most champions.\n\nThere's also the issue of the grenade speed. Unless you have a dash/flash ability, it's actually completely unavoidable if he gets closer than slightly above auto range. To sidestep the stun of a grenade centered on you, you need to move ~200 units (probably actually more). If you have 375 movement speed, moving 200 units takes ~0.53 seconds. His grenade can travel 636 units during this time, so if he's closer than that, there's no way to avoid it even if you react instantly.\n\nOnce he gets to late game, a well placed R + W is a straight one shot to any carry at ~1000 range, so he doesn't fall off after his extremely safe early/mid game, unless you have one of the few champions who can dive and burst him.\n\nThe entire problem with him is that he's braindead levels of safe and doesn't fall off, like most champions with similar safety do.","replies":[{"poster":"PhearBunny","date":"2020-01-03T11:25:01.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yenn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WrJ49tAc,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2020-01-03T05:38:35.497+0000)\n>\n> It's not.

Sitting in three of them would effectively double his health, which is definitely too much. But AoE spells would be more effective, it would allow enemies to take down multiple turrets when approaching only one of them, and he would sacrifice his own health if he wanted to protect his turrets from poke. Maybe it could be a percentage instead of splitting evenly?\n\nMy subsequent thinking on it was that this would basically be a passive for his Q, not for the champion himself, so it shouldn't be his passive at all regardless of strength. \\o/","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Exodus247","date":"2020-01-02T18:55:21.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hes a cheese champ, if you seriously cant deal with heimer with either abilities that fuck or move his turrets, or point and clicks that go around his turrets, then you deserve to lose lmao.

Ive picked heimer into darius before (a hard counter to him) and ive lost because he KNOWS not to fight me unless my spells are down or if a jungler comes.\n\nHeimerdinger isn't really a hard counter to Darius. I know it says that on some sites, but as someone who mains Heimerdinger and Darius, Darius could win if he plays it smart. Heimerdinger's damage mainly comes from his rockets. Darius has high base HP regeneration so he can simply outsustain Heimerdinger, which is one of Heimerdinger's win condition (keep pressuring the lane and denying cs from the enemy while staying safe doing so, kills are nice but not necessary). A Heimerdinger simply cannot kill Darius who isn't running into his turrets. The only thing is the lane is going to be a bit boring because you have two lane bullies, but Heimerdinger is more of a defensive champion that has a long range poke and Darius is an aggressive lane bully that can't really do anything before lv.6. Darius can just start with 3 rejuvenation beads to mitigate the poke, rush Mercury Treads, and then grab + ghost on Heimerdinger who is squishy. {{item:3211}} is also good on Darius. Since Heimerdinger's main method of killing is kiting around his turrets, it'll be harder to kite Darius when he's using ghost. Heimerdinger will need to try land his grenade perfectly to stun him before he gets hit too hard by Darius. If Darius gets too low on health, he can Q to heal. Top lane Heimerdinger isn't really amazing either, tho I do play him top sometimes, and chances are, the Darius is being played at top. So....I would say its mostly a skill matchup. There's room for error for Darius. I'm um...also really bias so I just find Darius and Heimerdinger just easy to lane against since I know what they do. So yes, I've won against a Heimerdinger in lane before as Darius. \nThe counterpick part is really just Darius not being able to snowball so early, at least without lv.1 bush cheese or jungler ganks. Although, funny enough, jungler ganking Darius or Heimerdinger isn't usually a good idea lol. They're both really good at 1v2.","replies":[{"poster":"Exodus247","date":"2020-01-03T17:55:59.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well im not disagreeing with you, but ive come to find in my experiance that he is sort of a hard counter since a LOT of darius i see take ghost and go for early cheese, and end up getting fucked.
