In my opinion, this game turned into a braindead oneshot-fiesta twelve months ago and continued to stay that way.\n\nGames are decided ten minutes in and as soon as turret plating falls off, they snowball out of control. Strategic teamfights turned into three seconds of button mashing and the calm aspect, the part I loved about League the most, completely vanished. Get seen/hit first, die.\n\nThis has been the case for twelve months and if this pre-season does not change anything about it, I will call it quits after six years of playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eyesack","date":"2018-11-26T18:32:53.207+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":5,"body":"Honestly, yes. I like the turret plating change. It extends the lane phase while actually rewarding you for playing aggressively and dominating your opponent. It also rewards roaming to some extent because you can hit a lane and snowball them, grab some plates or potentially a turret, without just instantly losing your tower when you leave. \n\nAlso the teleport nerfs mean we actually see a plethora of summoners up top now. I've seen a lot more ghosts, ignites, and even exhausts up top.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shigure","date":"2018-11-26T20:29:23.664+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diamond here. Personally I like the concept of turret plating but feel like that the amount of gold given is a bit too high. One problem with mid lane is that your roams even when successful can be easily turned against you as if the jungle comes mid whilst your gone the enemy mid and jungle could take your whole tower/majority of it in one roam. Same situation in that a single gank that sends you back could screw you for the whole game if your tower is taken. This could put you heavily behind due to the amount of gold from first blood tower and the loss of your tower making it much more difficult to farm safely (same situation for side lanes). \n\nI can understand the reasoning behind turret plating as they wanted to prevent towers falling from a single push however the problem is lane bullies are now hard shoving and snowballing off the huge amount of gold you earn from a tower now. This is more pronounced with lane bully bot lanes who take their bot tower and rotate top in the first 14minutes to take the turret plating gold from there as well.\n\nHonestly just reducing the amount of gold to 100-120 per plate would reduce the frustration people are having with them. Also i don't think people have overly noticed but the reason turrets after the first are falling quicker is that minions are dealing a little more damage then last season. If this is a problem they can just reduce minion damage to towers and easy fix but personally I don't see a problem with this as it actually makes splitpushing for champs that aren't Yi or Trynd a proper threat.","replies":[{"poster":"Fire Blaustoise","date":"2018-11-26T22:14:40.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Honestly just reducing the amount of gold to 100-120 per plate would reduce the frustration people are having with them.

Feels better. The turret plating system rewards correct rotation and laning in the sense that if you now force your enemy to recall you are not only rewarded lane presence, dominance and a better back timing but also gold from the tower.

If someone loses their lane, it's usually because they were counter picked and there's not much they can do; they still would have lost the turret pre-plating, but now they lose the turret **and** the enemy gets a ton of bonus gold.\n\nI also haven't seen a single comeback. The winning team is always thousands of gold ahead from all the plating they took, and have enough advantage to close out the game unless they make a massive mistake. \n\nAlternatively, games where 2/3 lanes lost, and the one winning lane has a significant bounty that can easily be collected by the other team, which feels like a 'fuck you' for doing well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brown Man Darius","date":"2018-11-28T16:42:48.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope.

I think games tend to have more gold in them now, thus end game builds happen sooner. However I do think that the bounty system does allow for come backs. I have had games where the behind adc gets a 1k shutdown + a 450 shutdown in a fight and suddenly they are a monster. This to me feels not bad. It means the better players have to consistently out play their opponent not get a few ganks get a head and one shot everyone till end game. \n\nDragons feel much more important now than before. I still feel like people dont prioritize them enough atm. I like plating fine. It can add more gold to the winning team but it can also allow a team to punish roams, and it does keep towers up longer which is good. Overall I think it is a net gain. \n\nBasically people just need to play less reckless to survive and do well in this meta. Players that constantly dive in for kills and are greedy are going to be hurt big time by the bounty system. Players that focus on objectives and not overstaying will find success and climb. \n\nI just recently got diamond, but I have played the game according to my logic above and I have done very well this preseason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emelie Cauchemar","date":"2018-11-27T23:31:00.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I more or less quit ranked last season.
