The game normally freezes for a short time (~300 ms), but there was one instance where I placed a ward in a brush containing Lee Sin, and the game froze for about 1500 ms.\r\n\r\nIt **may** have to do with his Knockout skin, because he was using it 3/5 of the times it happened, but I don&#039;t recall whether he was using it in the other two.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else experienced this?","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-30T07:44:35.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That isn't your game freezing, that is the fear shutting down your body.\n\nJokes aside, I havent seen many Lee Sins lately so I cant say I have noticed anything.","replies":[]}]}
