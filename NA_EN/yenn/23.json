This forces me to either dodge and pray that I'm not assigned my secondary role in the next game (which, statistically, I will be), or waste 20+ minutes in a game I don't want to be in.\n\nThis seriously needs to be fixed. Only getting my main role in 3/15 games is not acceptable, and just makes me not want to play League. I would rather sit in queue for a longer time and do something else on the side than deal with this bullshit.\n\n**EDIT: I've now gotten my main role 3/18 times.
