I am fairly new to this game (level 19).\r\nI have Rakan, Nami, Sona, Lux, Morgana, Soraka, Thresh, and a couple more. As you can see I play support. Rakan: No one follows up when I dive. Thresh: The shields get no value as I can't react fast enough and my teammates don't click the lantern to get back to safety. Nami: Teammates will not get close enough for a bounce and when I bounce it off myself, I lose the trade. Sona: Despite the healing I still watch teammates die (with W, E, Q, and R on cda after using them) and she is too passive. Also with her I feel like I have to get carried to win (which never happens). Morgana: I just got her but same with thresh the shield get no value and I use her more to poke and protect by getting the enemy to back off. Lux: Stat wise, isn't she a better Morgana? 2 person root (vs 1), lower cd on shield, it shield for more, and it can hit more people, but the AoE damage is slightly worse. These are my thoughts. WHo do you recomend?","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2019-05-06T05:02:53.303+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Lelsers, it looks like you've pretty much hit all of the supports for beginners. You've mentioned a few things you've noticed while playing support though; you don't really carry the games. Support champions typically enable their team to carry the game either through heals, shields, warding, various CCs, or a combination of them.\n\nHere are my thoughts on some of the support champions that I normally interact with:\n\n- **Rakan**: Depending on your Summoner Level (and skill level), you may get a wide assortment of players; some may jump in with you, others may not. If you notice a pattern in solo queue (like no one following up on your dive), you may need to play poke, shield, and utilize your knock up for disruptions or use it to as a cherry on top in a wombo. As you go up in Summoner Level and see that player behaviors change (like they're more aggressive or more willing to follow-up on your initiations), adjust accordingly. Having a duo queue partner or jumping in as a 5-player premade can also offset the feeling of \"Whoa, I initiated, but no one followed me.\"\n\n- **Nami**: I've noticed some Nami players try to save their heals for a bounce. If it doesn't bounce, they want to save it. That can lead to a cool play, but as long as your mana is high enough, go in for the heal even if you don't get the bounce. Remember that your abilities give you a speed boost as well; her bubble is a great disruption and disengage ability before you get access to her ultimate.\n\n- **Lux **and **Morgana**: Lux is one of those supports who can turn carry-ish champions. I wouldn't say she's a better Morgana, but they excel differently in enabling their allies and doing damage. Lux has a group shield (if positioned properly), but it doesn't allow an ally to simply ignore CC like Morgana's Black Shield. Lux has a slow AOE and 2-person binding which is good, but the latter doesn't last as long as Morgana's (they both start as 2 second root, but Morgana's duration gets longer when it levels up). Lux can do extra damage by auto attacking marked targets, but Morgana has an AOE damage over time spell which goes well with her Dark Binding which has a longer range than Lux's auto attack. Lux has a fairly low cooldown giant laser which can snipe off a low health champion or make the enemy team back off from a chase while Morgana's ultimate makes her a threat if she gets into range of the enemy team (if accompanied by Zhonya's).\n\n- **Thresh**: Your lantern is great for shielding, saving allies, or pulling in your jungler for a quick numbers advantage. While you're still pre-Level 30, you may run into instances where your allies aren't taking advantage of your lantern. But the real clutch in your kit is the ability to hook an enemy champion (usually someone squishy), get into range, and then knock them back a little long enough for your team to obliterate them.\n\n- **Sona**: As a support player, you'll likely see allies die because not everything goes according to plan. Players are of different skill levels, utilizing different strategies, and sometime pick champions that can counter you or your team. Sona's can seem passive, but knowing when to use which power chord can turn the tides of a fight; knowing when to use your ultimate can secure a team fight or keep the enemy team just out of reach of an Ace.\n\nIt really depends on your play style. It seems like you like enchanters and spell caster type support champions. I'd say out of all you've played Nami, Sona, and Soraka are the three most basic healers and really friendly for beginners. \n\nIf you'd like to test out other supports, I'd say Lulu is a fun one that I enjoy; she doesn't have a heal, but her shield, polymorph, and ultimate gives you a whole lot of abilities to protect your allies and keeping your enemies off of them. Similarly, Janna and Karma have great poking, shielding, and CCing abilities, but you usually find Karma in mid and act as a second support while Janna goes along with a bottom lane partner.\n\nIf you'd like to try a different type of support altogether, may I suggest tank supports like Braum, Leona, and Nautilus. They can take a beating and enable you to just \"stick\" on the enemy champions which enable your carries to do damage. They all have abilities to disrupt grouped up enemies, disengage, CC enemy champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lolipopbaby","date":"2019-05-06T11:40:23.108+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are looking for a save-your-garb-team support play soraka.

You don't have to consistently land skillshots to have your presense felt and as a bonus if your team leaves you high and dry with your dick in your hands you stand a better chance of disengaging and getting back to your tower by yourself than as a squishy mage\n\n{{champion:201}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:12}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wizard Blaze","date":"2019-05-08T12:09:37.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stick with {{champion:267}} i have been playing her for long and in fact im one trick.
