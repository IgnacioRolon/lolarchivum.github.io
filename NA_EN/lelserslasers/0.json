Lucio heals everyone around him but only for a little bit of health? And are there any supports who just heal a ton? I tried Sorka but I kept dying because my heal hurts me and someone on the other team just flanked and 1 shoted me.\r\nThanks, LelsersLasers","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2019-03-11T19:35:23.149+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awk and Cheini are pretty spot on with their assessments. Those are pretty much the support champions that excel at healing others. As a note with Soraka, it's important to be good with positioning with her for all of the things you mentioned. The last thing you want is to get flanked from the side or have someone charge at you while you're trying to top off an ally with a heal. \n\nLuckily, she has a spell that is good at zoning off enemies who rather not get snared or silenced. It's not only until you are Level 6 that you get a pretty powerful global heal that's a pain in the neck for Karthus (who has a global damage dealing spell, Requiem).\n\nLastly, if you're finding yourself near death a lot as Soraka while you're healing, remember that your Q will heal you if it hits an enemy champion; it's her way of sustaining herself since she takes damage when utilizing an essential part of her kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Cheini","date":"2019-03-11T21:20:21.443+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Son Golin,realm=NA,application-id=okOuNvuT,discussion-id=atGAuZKU,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-03-11T19:35:23.149+0000)\n> \n> Lastly, if you're finding yourself near death a lot as Soraka while you're healing, remember that your Q will heal you if it hits an enemy champion; it's her way of sustaining herself since she takes damage when utilizing an essential part of her kit.\n\ngolin just to note btw, if she is nearly dead, a q on enemy champion will _ensure_ her fate sooner than it could be.. xdd","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2019-03-11T22:20:45.757+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cheini,realm=EUNE,application-id=okOuNvuT,discussion-id=atGAuZKU,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-03-11T21:20:21.443+0000)\n>\n> golin just to note btw, if she is nearly dead, a q on enemy champion will _ensure_ her fate sooner than it could be.. xdd\n\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Awk","date":"2019-03-10T00:34:58.710+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Healing Supports:\n{{champion:37}} \nSona\nW: Aoe Heal + Shield to players in close area\n\n{{champion:267}} \nNami\nW: Heal bounce; Ally > Enemy > Ally [OR] Enemy > Ally > Enemy\n\n{{champion:12}} \nAlistar\nPassive: Heal everyone within range after 7 minions/monsters die around him\n\n{{champion:40}} \nJanna\nR: Heals allies over 3 second period to anyone in area\n\n{{champion:497}} \nRakan\nQ: Heals allies within short area after hitting an enemy or epic monster","replies":[]},{"poster":"xScarfy","date":"2019-03-12T22:13:45.373+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"One champ that wasn't mentioned yet is {{champion:44}} Taric! His Q heals everyone standing near him, only for a bit, but he can collect stacks of it and thereby empower his heal.

Aaaand don't count on him unless you are in a getting hard-flamed mood.. xdd\n\n&nbsp;\nNami {{champion:267}} has a bubble stun (once you meet a _certain champion mains_ {{champion:157}} - suspend so he can R) and a wave (and a small speed buff),\ngl catching Janna {{champion:40}} (and tornado/knock-back),\nRakan {{champion:497}}  - 1,000 (3 per cd) dashes and charm - he is not mainly a healer though,\nBard {{champion:432}} - stun and wall path (+stasis),\nNidalee {{champion:76}} has 5 sec cd dash (am y she can be a disc healer because of her E att speed buff and the traps charge athene even without high dmg)\nIvern {{champion:427}} has Daisy and bushes (yet is not much of a healer either)\n\nand still, if they are focused... rip.. (save for Bard) and once their cds are popped in a teamfight, it is all up to the team :p\n\n&nbsp;\nyet.. none of them is on par with Soraka, and Sona can just do _too many_ things - ranging from assassin, healer/shielder (not for too much btw), speed/slow, feed, steal drakes (if she goes full ap, late game she can deal 526 + 158% ap which is like 2k magic damage - maybe more in an instant, without accounting R as it doesn't damage monsters)..\n\n&nbsp;\nso if you want a pure healer just play as Soraka, buy zhonya if they have a phys assassin like Zed after you get your first heal power item (redemption or ardent censer usually - 2.5 sec immune so how about _no!_) and hope your team would protect you properly... and keep yourself at like 50-60% hp unless you are about to R or rede anyway :p\n\n&nbsp;\n######we are still waiting for holy priest's spirit of redemption but qq","replies":[]}]}
