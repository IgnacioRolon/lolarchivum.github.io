It's the intended product that's the issue at a fundamental level.\n\nThe difference between this skin and Thresh's other skins is that VISUALLY the hook ends instead of on the body of the victim, it ends ON TOP OF THE VICTIM. And so the fundamental flaw of LoL's 2-D based calculation and visual mismatch has been more emphasised due to the additional angular offset in the animation (in terms of height that is not a part of the game's calculation).\n\nEDIT: Riot could reduce this issue by simply bring down the rope circle to the victim's waist after catching them, but the problem is ultimately innate to the lack of a 3rd axis and issues like this would persist no matter what.","replies":[{"poster":"CrocsRock21495","date":"2018-10-19T06:04:33.569+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":14,"body":"[REMOVED BY MODERATION - ULANOPO] why do u support this sht company","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-10-19T06:42:33.259+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrocsRock21495,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=q3RJVe4A,comment-id=0001000000000001,timestamp=2018-10-19T06:04:33.569+0000)\n>\n> [DELETED CONTENT REMOVED - ULANOPO] why do u support this sht company\n\nWhat does that have to do with this?\n\nIt's not even me saying I support Riot, I just elaborated on where the issue is.\n\nAlso, iirc, you were the one who wrote the thread that wished mass shooting upon Riot HQ (now deleted), were you not?

The shadow (hitbox) of the hook would've been lower then the model of the lasso, but instead the lasso's model was just eons away to begin with from the actual hitbox.\n\nYou'd expect this to be the case if liss was under the lasso model (where the hitbox would actually be lower due to camera angling as a shadow) but in this case she was above and since her character does touch the ground without feet even, its safe to say her character hitbox is pretty accurate. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/fhLX7UN.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/WNgimgo.png\n\nThis is sketchy too because the hitbox would be closer to the center of the screen. Looking at it as clockwise, the hitbox would've been closer to the center (slightly more left) but lee is to the right and somehow still gets clipped. \n\neither the animation or the model itself just doesn't sync up. But either way, a lasso is a lot wider and harder to judge dodging from the standard hook. \n\nIts not that you're wrong, this is how the game works, its that this doesn't add up to what the OP is showing.
