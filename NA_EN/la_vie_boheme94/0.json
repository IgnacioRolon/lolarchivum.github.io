Was wondering if it would be able to run league comfortably as well? Specs are \nCPU: Intel Core i7-8550U   1.80GHz  1.99GHz\nGPU: Intel UHD Graphics 620\nRAM: 16GB DDR4\n\nSince its quad core I thought there might be a chance it could handle it, but thought I'd ask before waiting forever for it to download.\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Valeeva","date":"2017-11-15T03:59:07.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it will.\n\nI got league running on a i5-2540, GeForce 610M with 6GB RAM.\n\nIm sure your little beasty will run it fine.","replies":[{"poster":"La Vie Boheme94","date":"2017-11-15T04:10:14.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks :) was just worried about the 1.8GHz as league says it requires 2GHz.","replies":[{"poster":"Valeeva","date":"2017-11-15T04:58:07.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I read thats the base clock speed, it has it's own inbuilt turbo of up to 4.0GHz across all cores. \nYou should be fine running it, might get a little warm so keep it elevated and have enough air circulating the inlets.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-15T05:39:09.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaa this will probably run league just fine ^_^!
