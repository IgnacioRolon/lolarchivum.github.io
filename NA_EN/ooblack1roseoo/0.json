Resetting your settings should get this fixed up:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nWe aren't able to remove any [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) timers, but hopefully that will help prevent more.
