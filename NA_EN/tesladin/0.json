They still lose 10% of their games. If theyre so pro, that is something.\r\n\r\nThe real question is, why on earth did they lose THAT GAME SPECIFICALLY and not another one of the 9 other games theyve played? I know its just one game out of ten in terms of probabilities, but within the framework of just this one game, why did they lose this game? How can a diamond player + 4 silver players lose against 5 silver players?\r\n\r\nAnd if you do have an answer as to why they lost that game, how can you call it anything but luck? See league is a game where luck is involved if not a luck based game...","replies":[{"poster":"Deathﬁre","date":"2018-10-04T15:15:47.500+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"people make mistakes.... and some games are lost in champ select, sometimes teammates feed beyond a pros ability to carry in any elo","replies":[]},{"poster":"0 Hogapu","date":"2018-10-04T19:18:59.482+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"because there might be a smurf in the other team\n\nbecause a specific champion that counters the smurf will get fed\n\nbecause all others 4 people get crushed hard \n\nbecause the smurf is having a bad game, disrespecting people ?\n\nall of this happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir Prepuzius","date":"2018-10-05T15:19:08.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think you guys on the board think of high elo players like they are some sort of superheroes impossible to defeat in game\nyou know, a diamond player could lose lane to a bronze, it can happen\n\nmoreover, even if the player was challenger tier, if the rest of the team doesn't follow, he would lose the game, it's not like since he is high tier he can 1v9 every game\n\nthere are plenty of factors to consider, and sure, luck is one of them too","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-05T15:12:35.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok so I have a second account dedicated to my man Ekko.

If your bot gets camped and has more deaths than there are minutes in the game before you can roam, you really can't win that. If the mid assassin gets 5 kills then roams bot, you're not really going to win that as the ADC.\n\nSometimes the enemy team just outclasses or out-lucks your team. Sometimes it's lost in select due to your team picking a terrible comp. Sometimes you just can't win the game no matter *how* skilled you are.\n\nLeague is skill-based, yes, but there's always an element of luck to everything. Even going to the most basic strategy game in the world: Chess, your opponent may just have a strategy you don't know of, even at the highest tiers of play. Maybe they're having a bad day and are sick and not quite thinking right, or maybe it's the same for you. Or maybe the building will collapse and kill both you and your opponent.\n\nAnd chess has many less potential variables than League. Maybe your team has people that are great mechanically, but none of you play tanks or juggernauts, or maybe you just get out-comped, or they have a better strategy, or any other number of variables that even a god-like player can't account for.","replies":[]}]}
