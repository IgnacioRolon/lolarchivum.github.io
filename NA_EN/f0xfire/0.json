I play them never or very little so obviously I deserve to be flamed! \r\n\r\nI&#039;m tilted on my main account (this one) so I made a smurf to try to &quot;go back to basics&quot; and also explore different roles a little more, but at level 13 why the heck is the expectation that I should be Plat I? \r\n\r\nMy smurf account is LEVEL THIRTEEN. \r\n\r\nHas Riot ever looked into punishing heavier at levels under 30? Seriously, if they invested more time in filtering out trolls before they hit ranked play I feel like so many problems would be solved. It would also make the gaming environment more enjoyable for new players (not just higher level smurfs like me) who may like the game but can&#039;t deal with the toxicity and never become regular players (aka: $$$)\r\n\r\nBut something tells me that the players who troll and flame the hardest are also the ones who spend the most money on this game. \r\n\r\nHm. I wonder if they could run a correlation check on that. That would be interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-03-28T10:22:59.087+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They already hold lower accounts to higher standards because A: new players might not know the rules and a chat restriction + email is a good way to show them and B: they are hurting the experiences of impressionable new players\n\nThe problem you are encountering is that you are better than a new player so the game went, \"Oh, guess I better put this guy with the other smurfs\", and a lot of those other smurfs are people who were recently banned and made a new account.","replies":[{"poster":"Makior72","date":"2017-03-28T15:29:23.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zezockary,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7u1rJAaE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-28T10:22:59.087+0000)\n>\n> They already hold lower accounts to higher standards because A: new players might not know the rules and a chat restriction + email is a good way to show them and B: they are hurting the experiences of impressionable new players\n> \n> The problem you are encountering is that you are better than a new player so the game went, &quot;Oh, guess I better put this guy with the other smurfs&quot;, and a lot of those other smurfs are people who were recently banned and made a new account.\n\nThis","replies":[]}]}]}
