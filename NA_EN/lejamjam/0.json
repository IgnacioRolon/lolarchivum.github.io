However when everyone else has loaded and the game has started, then I can join and play the game at 40 ping, this means that I join a minute or two into the game. This wouldn't be too bad, but I can't connect to the practice tool at all. I've tried using a force repatch with the hextech repair tool and that didn't fix it, what should I do next?\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-1}}\n\nEDIT: Tried uninstalling and re-installing. This is still happening... Just did a full repair and it still won't work, please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-23T02:39:53.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm do me a favor and try [**updating your firewall exceptions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq3) to be sure they aren't blocking your network from accessing our servers. If that doesn't help, also update your DNS settings to 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 to see if that gets you a smoother connection. Let me know if those steps aren't helping at all and we can try a couple other things!","replies":[{"poster":"fatsilentnin","date":"2018-01-24T01:29:29.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue...  any help would be appreciated..
