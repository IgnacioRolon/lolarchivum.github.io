I propose that Riot allow us to order food with rp and for every order we get 10% of the rp back and 1 skin point. At 200 skin points you buy a ward skin, at 2000 skin points you can get a 390 skin, 20 million you can get a legendary. This will encourage people to spend rp so Riot can do awesome things like makes LCS matches even better by having cool bands play at them like One Direction (omg they're the best and super hot!). They can also make SR even more awesome so that people with toasters are unable to play thus removing them and their 2 hour load times from the game. With this implemented they can nerf ip gains and taric (also delete anivia 2014) and buff swain and urgot (they are ugly and need buffs to their faces)  (✿◡‿◡)","replies":[]}
