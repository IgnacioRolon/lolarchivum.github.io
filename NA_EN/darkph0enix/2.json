I appreciate it.\n\n1) Alright, so do I have your \"approval\" to mute everyone as soon as we enter the game? Trust me, I have played this game for a very, very, very long time and I cannot hold my anger sometimes.\n\n2) Thanks again for clearing it up. Maybe I am being paranoid\n\n3) Yes and No. \n\nThe chat logs in my 10 game chat ban were COMPLETELY justified. I was being an ass, I got what was coming to me.\n\nIn the 25 game chat restriction, 1 of the 2 games was a 3v3 ranked flex Q between me and my friends. We were just chilling around on skype laughing our butts off and then one of my friends goes \"watch this\" and tells the enemy team to report me for flaming. I thought nothing of it and then I saw the chat logs. In the other game, I was being a crybaby because my lane was getting camped. Sad life.\n\nThe 14 day suspension though is my biggest gripe. I was playing Flex on my own and I was telling my jungler \"please don't ignore me, come gank\" and \"at least say no\". He was solo as well. This player that was mid was premade with the 2 bot laners and around the 30 minute mark, after constantly, non-stop flaming our jungler she said \"Rengar and Udyr, go afk\". At that point, I lost it. Her friend was 0/8 and she decided to blame me for losing so I told her \"SHUT UP, THIS ENTIRE GAME YOU HAVEN'T STOPPED, JESUS\". After that, she just started to say \"enjoy ban\". I reported both her and her toxic team (the 0/8 AD carry was flaming the enemy AD carry), didn't get any notifications when the suspension was finally finished today.  In my opinion, this game and the game in which I was with my friends should NOT have been applied. I may be wrong.\n\nIn the other chat log I was provided with on the 14 day suspension, I was on my promos and I got an AFK Riven. I just lost my shit in that game.\n\nSo, I'll ask again. For a \"toxic\" player like me, would you advise muting everyone as soon as we enter the game, provided I let my team know on champ select and yet still communicate with pings?\n\nThank you for your time, Tantram. Just seeing a Rioter reply made my day a bit better.\n\nEDIT: In the 25 game chat restriction I was talking about, we were writing curses in the chat.

When you /mute all and then type something in chat can your team still read it? If they are muted does it mean that youre muted as well. I tend to, recently, /mute all and then when im angry at something my team has done I flame them. Im sure it could be tested if I was playing with friends but this just occurred to me and I have no one online to play with atm.
