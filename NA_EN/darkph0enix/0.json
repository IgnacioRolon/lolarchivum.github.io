This seemed odd, but I didn't catch it. I left the practice tool and friends list was expanded. I tried to enter again and sure enough, I was late into champion selection.\r\n\r\nI left, collapsed friends list, tried to enter again and instantly joined. I finally caught on to it and this wouldn't be a problem, except that by collapsing the friends list the client froze up for a bit.\r\n\r\nSolutions tried: Restarting the computer, low-spec mode  and initiating a full repair. None worked.\r\n\r\nSide Note problem: Why is it that my flex queue rank appears in custom games instead of Solo Q? \r\n\r\n\r\nVideo Evidence:  (Client moved to the side so you can't see my friends' names. I am cool, but they may not be cool).\r\nhttps://youtu.be/hmnTRJzN12M","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-23T23:56:10.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen a few reports on this and would like to gather some more info on the issue.
