I have to shit click the map look at mid lane, top or the bot lane and it's very annoying that I have shift-click it. My brother was smashing my keys one day and this happened (he was playing a custom game). jungle just got so much harder.

Either bindings have changed or your config folder messed up, so you may need to reset your bindings to default and see if that works.  That option will be available in the binding options in game, but keep in mind you'll have to rebind you keys.  You should also get your brother to make his own account if possible, since bindings are stored server side per account (also because we don't like sharing).  Let me know if that helps.","replies":[]}]}
