ARAM is not All Random All Middle\r\n\r\n2. Please start enforcing that just because it's normals, doesn't mean you can troll with whatever and say \"its just norms\"\r\n\r\n3. Change your name to Riot Game because you don't make any other legitimate games, and no, the games they give out and then take away later do not count because they aren't actively existing for someone to \"play\"\r\n\r\n4. Rebalance your champions around low level play, because I'm pretty sure it'd be a hell of a lot more fun than seeing adcs tank turrets, turrets getting 2 shot, assassins 1 shotting anyone. Mages that were supposed to be the number 1 damaging mage after rework(cough vel'koz = less damaging than Annie/Zyra[A SUPPORT])\r\n\r\n5. Make supports not build damage.\r\n\r\n6. Remove Keystones\r\n\r\n7. Reduce rune prices\r\n\r\n9. Stop allowing first timers in Ranked\r\n\r\n10. Start doing something about the 3rd party bots in AI/ARAM/Blind Pick(Inexcusable across any mode)\r\n\r\nand to all those saying I'm wrong, it's not bad. When you get 1 shot as many times as I have when I was under turret, you tend to get salty.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\n\r\n11. Fix Matchmaking","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-25T07:59:04.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1: I have yet to play aram and not get a random champion. People can make accounts with less champs to skew their chances but they still have the free week champs to worry about and they get less rerolls.\n\n2: That is wnforced. People get banned for trolling all the time, they just don't post about it as much because there isn't much of a question as to whether or not it was happening.\n\n3: It would probably cost a lot to do that and then they would have to pay to change it back if they made another game.\n\n4: I have never seen an adc tank a turret for a large enough time to complain about or a turret die to two shots. If you have video evidence to back that up please provide it.\n\nAssassins are supposed to burst squishy targets. That is their job, their burst window was recently widened to allow for counterplay. If you are still having issues try building cheap early defensive items like seeker's armguard, hexdrinker, warden's mail, or negatron cloak.\n\nVel'koz has the advantage of eztremely long ranges over annie and zyra, and he also has reletively short cooldowns.\n\n5: Right now the optimal build for suppirts is generally tanky items with actives such as redemption or locket. Besides that I like offensive support builds. They allow diversity in the role and more types of team compisitions.\n\n6: Reasons? I see no reason to.\n\n7:Again, I see no reason to. You can already get tier 2 runes for 1 ip each and the core runes are very cheap compared to what I bought them for.\n\n8: If nobody could play ranked for the first time then nobody could play ranked. I feel like you may not have worded that properly.\n\n9: I have literally never been in a game with a bot. They are banned in waves so that it is more difficult to tell how their programs are being detected.","replies":[]}]}
