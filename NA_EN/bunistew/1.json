Rito please.\n\nFirst off from someone who was on tribunal - the backlog of reviews that was present made issuing punishment take even longer than the current system.\n\nSecondly, it does not punish a person more if multiple people report the individual for the same game. Each report creates a flag for the game and then that game is reviewed by the automated system to determine (usually by the chat log more than anything) if a punishment is necessary.","replies":[{"poster":"scazzman","date":"2016-09-22T05:44:38.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i honestly feel like riot may just be saying this so people dont ask for reports","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bob the Toastr","date":"2016-09-21T18:50:08.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said the automated system is slower, just not as good. \n\nAnd I have never seen the \"A player has been punished\" screen when I was the only person to report someone.
