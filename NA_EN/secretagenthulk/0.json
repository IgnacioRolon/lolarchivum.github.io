Don't take the 'Bronzelord' thing personally. :P\r\n\r\nSecond, smartcasting. Smartcasting is amazeballs and you should use it. My Braum is easily 25% more effective with Stand Behind Me and Unbreakable smartcasted. Thresh's Dark Passage can now just be thrown. Veigar can cast Dark Matter fast enough that Fizz can't escape Event Horizon before it lands. Ryze can spam like he lives in Nigeria.\r\n\r\nDon't set everything to smartcast. I like having to manually target Teemo's Blinding Dart.  Braum's Glacial Fissure, Thresh's Flay, and Veigar's Event Horizon are things you'll probably want to manually adjust. But smartcasting will improve your response times, making you a better player.

It's going to take awhile, but eventually you'll find you can react faster and easier than before.\n\nI started it on only a few champions that I knew very well.  At the time, I think it was Leona and Caitlyn.  But after awhile I was eager and willing to smart cast all the champs, then I started smartcasting items and summoner spells.

Eventually, regular casting will feel so clunky you'll never go back.\n\nMy personal recommendation to begin smartcasting is Riven; her Q, W, and E already smartcasted by default, and after a while it gets really irritating to normal cast R because you're so used to mashing keys. Then you switch to smartcasting Wind Slash instead.\nThen you play someone else like LeBlanc and you're like \"wtf so clunky\" and you switch over to smartcast and double the speed of your burst combo.

In all aspects. For me, I took a champ I knew super well (lux) and just turned it on. I played a couple bot games to get used to the changed timing, but it only improved my game play. One can make split second plays better if they can split second cast! \n\nTwo notes that (while seemingly obvious) caught me offguard : \n1) This doesn't transfer automatically to PBE. First PBE blitz game I played, I thought I was unable to cast abilities when I tried to hook. ROFL. \n2) This is a setting stored LOCALLY. Not server side. You have to reinstall league, you have to set this again. \n\nI would also recommend taking new champs into bot games at least once to get a feel for the abilities and their ranges on smart cast. Or a custom. \nAt least at the beginning. Once you know the champs well enough, you should be able to wing it in game if you want to try someone new. \n\nBest of luck!\n\nEDIT : I still wouldn't recommend smart casting VIktor's Q or Rumble's ult until you get REALLY used to where they land and how it reacts. It's not intuitive. I've sent many rumble ults off the side of the aram map because fail.

I know that when I started playing league. I played with a trackpad on my laptop. When I moved to a mouse and keyboard, my skill SKYROCKETED. \n\nBut what I found was although my strategy wasn't 100% solid, small little pieces of my skillset were better than my peers. Like dodging a Blitz pull with a trackpad. You have to react like .2 seconds faster because it required an extra button press and actual thumb movement. \n\nSo when I had an extra .2 seconds on my hands I was not only able to dodge, but retaliate faster than my peers. It didn't make me a world class champion, but it made noticeable differences in my strengths vs. the strengths of others.\n\nWhat I find with smartcasting. Is people who start smartcasting early, have a worse sense of distance. And they miss more at long-range, they also have a worse sense of positioning. But they excel and fast rapid fire exchanges. While players who switched to smartcasting later in their gameplay, are far better at landing long-range skillshots but are a bit less skilled at short-range skirmishing. They tend to get spaghetti fingers when they're caught off guard but have a better sense of positioning in team fights which I think comes from the extra time they spent lining up skillshots pre-smartcasting.","replies":[{"poster":"mrackham","date":"2014-10-30T20:52:25.488+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is really interesting.

While I truly don't believe LoL is a  great game (it's good, not great. This community is so many negative points it's laughably sad), I've still embraced it because for better or worse, it's not only absurdly widespread across the world, but a benchmark for e-sports now and in years to come.\n\nBe that as it may, my computer barely plays the game (56kb video RAM EXTRAVAGANZA). Over the years, even though my skill, map awareness, and playmaking puts me at the top in my group of friends, I've almost exclusively played Support for my entire time here because there are so many visual things that could crash me out of the game that it's easier to list off things and events that DON'T bugsplat me. However during the OFAs I found I wrecked face and carried on a team or game of Katarina's, even when grouped with people who mained her (or for that matter, owned her). Kat is the only thing in this game that gives me ZERO lag.\n\nKat really needs quickcasting to play her right though, so I started with her E - Shunpo. It's the kind of power you need to go off directly when you want it to, not a half second later cause you had to tap a button then click your mouse. I started playing her in TB. I beat Yasuos (he crashes me because he buys Shiv and ~that~ crashes me). I started quickcasting Q, and now even my 1 key is set to it. I played an ARAM the other night as Nidalee and chucking her spears  were the easiest it's ever been.\n\nBecause I aimed for years, I know how far they can travel.\n\nBecause I quickcast I barely have to think about setting them up.\n\nBut the biggest thing about switching is I DON'T CRASH ANYMORE. I still lag, cause, hey, you know, *East Coast, and Rito doesn't particularly care about us enough to actually level the playing field*. But I haven't crashed. I've can buy Shivs now. My friends can play LB and Velkozby and actually get back-up from me in a fight without me getting in range and getting booted to the desktop while I curse in skype.\n\nThe thing I'm trying to say is that, if you use a sub par rig to play, and your game is unbearably laggy during big fights, try swapping to the quickcast. I have a ~85% win rate as Rammus jungle in TB, and around 60% for Kat. I actually get to be the captain for my friends, and not the blind shotcaller asking what's happening while I load back in.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-10-31T04:10:19.962+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, I smartcast EVERYTHING.
