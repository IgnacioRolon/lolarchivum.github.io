This is disappointing both because I can't use it to see how whatever is being shown affects my play (great example is the ward counter), and also just because I like seeing cool uses of technology. I know it would probably require a lot of work to get it there, but I think a long-term goal should be:\r\n\r\n**The Riot Games API should allow a player, and that player only\\*, to allow third-party tools access to their unranked/alt-mode stats after logging in with their PVP.net account and manually granting access.**\r\n\r\n(Perhaps there should be caveats to such access. As an example, while I agree that my warding in normals [I haven't played a ranked game in IIRC 4-5 months] is not a thing that the ward counter app should use to determine the average stat, I would like to be able to use my normals warding statistic to see how it stacks up against the rest of the playerbase.)\r\n\r\nAnyways, it'd be cool if you'd look into this, Riot. Thanks!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\\*Maybe anyone who the player provides a link to? A randomized link, so as to preserve the original emphasis on privacy? (E.g. mycoolleagueapp.com/stats/SecretAgentHulk as a public URL that only does ranked stats, while mycoolleagueapp.com/stats/SecretAgentHulk?private=$RANDOMSTRING for private stats.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps access in such a case could also be limited to a week, or some other finite period, before requiring renewal, in order to prevent old/forgotten links from being abused.","replies":[{"poster":"Sargonas","date":"2015-02-18T21:10:32.751+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something close to this is actually in the works already, and it's been briefly touched on in our Dev Forums.\n\nWhen Match History was previously announced, MattEnt talked a bit about the philosophy behind the data: Ranked info is public, Normals should be shared between friends only. Now, this works in Match History because it's tied into your account and we can check your friend association. For API usage however, we have to blanket filter Normals entirely, as there is no technical mechanism *yet* to support this. \n\nThe missing piece is a form of SSO/OAuth that will allow 3rd parties to authenticate players and validate their friends securely, without insecurely sharing login info. This tech is not something we have right now, but we recognize the need for it and plan to have it one day. Once it's in place, then you will (in theory) be able to have a bit more access to Normal Queue info in the API, as 3rd party sites will then be able to share and display that info to you and anyone on your friends list.","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2015-02-18T21:25:07.660+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have two related questions. Both pertain to **[Factions](http://LeagueFactions.net)**, but I think are of broader relevance.\n\nFirst, can there be an option to allow Custom matches to be included? Maybe an option for the game creator?\n\nSecond, can Match History show each Summoner's current and S4 rank? That's good information to have. Rank is the main metric we have to roughly assess someone's overall skill level. \"Hey, that GP was really amazing, were they Diamond or something?\" It's also interesting to see how people have changed rank between seasons.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SecretAgentHulk","date":"2015-02-19T06:16:38.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool, thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
