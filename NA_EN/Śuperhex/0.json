I don't know whats going on as I have no other problem with any other champion, it seems as though I load into the game, buy my items, and when the gate opens I proceed to my first buff for a leash and bam, crash and then they remake the game. I dont want to have a leave penalty or a ban. Is there any help I can get? Is it on my end? Can a riot employee or someone take a look at my files and see if anything is wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-19T00:49:35.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won't be able to personally look through those files for you, but I think you're actually on the right track. Try running a quick repair through the game client options since there might be some file related to Kayn or the jungle causing those crashes.","replies":[]}]}
