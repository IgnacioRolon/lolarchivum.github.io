I enjoy playing against AI to screw around. So far in the past week I've run into three matches where I was the only real player on my team. There's not much I can do other than afk for 20 minutes while the bots duke it out and feed the enemy AI like mad from minute one. I also can't simply leave the match because I'm forced to reconnect to it until it's over. Is anything actually being done about this or is this just a \"sweep it under the rug\" problem? It seems like it's gotten a lot worse in the past year. \r\n\r\nAnyone else have this same experience?","replies":[{"poster":"hanai02","date":"2017-07-13T07:53:10.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know , I just play one game coop vs IA and me and other guy were the only real persons, and this guy was his second game of all xd, every day is worst.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BluePress","date":"2017-07-09T23:12:50.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AI games? The normal PvP games are loaded with bots. I don't know what the hell Riot is trying to accomplish with all of these bots in the normal games, but it is pissing a lot of players off. I have been playing normal games all weekend and everyone of them has had at least one bot on the team. I just played a game and there were only two real players on the team. That's THREE bots. The game was completely absurd and a total waste of time. I think I will be taking a break from LOL until they clear up this matter. I'm not wasting anymore of my time playing normal games with bots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-09T22:05:32.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We definitely don't want people botting matches, regardless of if it's a ranked or AI match. Your best way of getting our attention to the issue is to make sure you report them in the post game screen if you suspect they might be a bot.","replies":[]}]}
