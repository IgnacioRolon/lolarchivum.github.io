Many players have lost their old accounts simply because riot decided to lock account due to suspicious activity and will not unlock unless verified as owner \nlet me clarify  on the questions and their flaws\nThe Basic\n- Account Username (what you log-in with):\n- Account Summoner name (your in game name):\n- Platform you play on (NA, EU West, EU Nordic &amp; East, OCE): \n- Your current email that you use now:\n- Any other email addresses that could have been used on the account:\n- Do you still have access to these email addresses?\n- Who made this account?\n- Any other people (including family members/friends) that have ever had access to the account:\n\nA bit harder\n- What was the month and year that the account was created in?\n- Location where the account was registered (City, Country):\n- Name any refunded champions or skins:\n- If you have received or sent gifts, please tell me what it was and who sent it or received it:\n- When was the last time that you had access to the account (Month/Day/Year):\n\nok first of all some people create multiple email and decide to change email \nthis is true if you played games in your teen years of 12 to 15\nyou probably just didn't even care about the email\nso how can those people remember the email\nthe only thing those people can tell are username summoner name and the email it is verified to\n,refunded skins or champs and location\nlets face it some people just don't spend money in free games thus they wont have any bank details in account\nand i doubt people would use  their real date of birth\nwhile  going  to watch porn would you rather watch it by clicking im over 18+ button than OR rather not watch at all because you wont get access if you type your real age\n\ni hope any rioter reading this reads this message and decides to change the system for security \nand suspension and resolve for those players who got banned due to suspicious activity simply because of their ip\nim not saying if you think there is suspicious activity that you should not lock accounts im just saying they should not be locked permanently\nat least lock them for a time period of 1 o 2 years\nPlease vote yes to make this topic be heard ","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-05-10T20:30:50.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Locking necro","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serevas","date":"2019-04-07T13:49:48.680+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> - If you have received or sent gifts, please tell me what it was and who sent it or received it:\n\nImagine sending a gift to someone 5 years ago, not having them on your list any longer, and even if you remembered who it was add a name change or two to the equation and that question is completely invalidated.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-04-07T17:17:55.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"First of all, Riot can see the original gift along with any name changes.\n\nSecond, you don't have to answer everything.
