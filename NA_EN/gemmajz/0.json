I like TFT alot and I studied a few guides like [this](https://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/how-to-play-teamfight-tactics-tft-553575) before trying ranked because I wanted to give it my best and actually try to climb.\r\nFor some reason it's like I hit a wall on TFT around high silver low gold and I can't see to climb anymore. I watched pro streams like [Scarra](https://www.twitch.tv/scarra) and [Hafu](https://www.twitch.tv/itshafu) whenever I got the chance, TFT highlights on Youtube and other [guides on winning more ranked TFT games](https://lolskinshop.com/how-to-win-more-tft-ranked-games/) but I feel like I suddenly stopped climbing for some reason and I've been going back and forth between gold and silver lately.\r\nI think it's mostly because I wanna try out different builds rather than what is strong in the meta atm (demons, elementalists) and I don't wanna do the same thing over and over again.\r\nAny high elo players have advice for me like what should I do to win more TFT games while playing things that are not pretty much the same every game?\r\n\r\nAppreciate any advice or tips!","replies":[{"poster":"Z3SIeeper","date":"2019-07-30T09:27:09.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Be a meta slave.

But don't force a comp. It might sound weird but I have seen so many people lose because of it. The main goal is finish top 4. If a good comp and items are dropping run it and push for 1st. But early stages if you arnt getting much go for xp  and 2 stars and just hold put.","replies":[{"poster":"such yas muchwow","date":"2019-07-30T06:10:30.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, I rolled all my economy so many times trying to hit that Brand or Kennen it's kinda sad :)\nI'm not high ranked but In my opinion OP I think in order to climb in high elo you pretty much gotta go for what's meta rather than what's more fun.\nI guess same goes with league","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Imninsomniac","date":"2019-07-30T17:30:06.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just the opinions of a Plat 3 TFT player:\n\n1) Only ever take a 2 cost unit on the first carousel\n2) Sell whatever that unit is immediately after the first round and buy out the shop \n3) If you have above 30 hp, and are not in the one of the last two positions already, try to lose the round before carousel.\n4) In carousel rounds after #1, prioritize the items on champions based on the cost of the champion i.e. orange > purple > blue > green > grey. \n4b) If a lower cost champion in a carousel would allow you to 3 star a unit, go ahead and take that instead. Particularly if the item it has, won't autocombine and/or it's an item you actually want on that champion.\n5) If you lose a round in the late game, change your unit positions. In general, melee in the front/sides and ranged in the back/adjacent to walls, but this positioning is NOT always ideal. \n6) If you notice 3+ copies of a unit on opposing boards, DON'T TRY TO 3 STAR THAT UNIT! \n7) Most of the time, a 2 star Unit is good enough. Plenty of games have been won without a single 3 star unit.\n8) Plan your items starting in round 1 and WAIT TO COMBINE, until you confirm your unit composition or at least obtain the first 3-4 items/units you intend to keep into late game.\n9) Everyone talks about flexibility, but you often can't make drastic lineup changes once the mid-game hits if most or all players are still in the game. (Late game this is easier to do, as more units are back in the shared pool.) Therefore, have a plan for divergent paths in your item AND unit compositions. Ex: If you start with Graves and Tristana, Gunslingers is the obvious path to target; however, if you notice 3 Lucian 2 stars and 5 Pyke 2 stars around opposing boards the best course of action may be to transition to Yordles, holding onto your Tristana. Alternatively; if you had a Spatula and/or BF Sword, you might consider looking for Blademasters instead and making a BOTRK for one of your existing units.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheBrothersGrymm","date":"2019-07-30T14:49:28.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"be lucky pray to RNGesus you will win","replies":[]},{"poster":"phoda","date":"2019-07-30T14:45:29.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently there is only few rules.\n1. Level asap, reaching level 6 and 7 are main priority even if you need to sell some units\n2. Build items and t2 champions for win streaking, much stronger than sinergies pre lv7. Of course you can change some units like if you will get 3 elementalists 3 assassins 3 sorcs and not very important unit\n\nDemons are currently op and 90% builds use it in some form. Even only 2 are good. Elementalists are very good cause of anivia and brand demon, rangers have demon, shapeshifters have demon. Gunslingers have on hit items so they dont need demons.\n\nMostly use t2 champions you can get and try to transitionwith them in mind. Like finding early karthus means you go 3 sorcs and so on.\n\nI noticed its better to have more half comps than one strong like 2-4 demons, 3 yordles, 3 assassins cause you can make it more diverse and deal with stuff better. In short play game and notice what is good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deceased Kebab","date":"2019-07-30T08:25:15.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I watched scarra and hafu's streams also, and i hate to tell u this, but u aren't gonna learn much from them. They are good players no doubt about it, but with\n4000 to 15000 viewers watching their stream and massively spamming their chat they are not gonna answer any questions you might have.\n\nI will recommend that you watch [http://www.twitch.tv/redoxxx](Redoxxx) instead, he is not master tier, hes around plat/diamond level.\nThe great thing about this guy is that he explains what he does, and he answer most question people have in the chat.\n\nWhat helped me to climb to gold (i stopped at gold 4, i just want the reward if there is any, i know its lame he he)\nWas to examine what win early,mid, and late game. I also did some research witch champs were power picks.\nIf you aim for top 4, then one of my favorite strategies is to simply just buy all key components for the various origins.\n\nYou don't really need much synergy early on, after mid game u do, one of the mistakes a lot of players do is that they fill their bench with crap champs.\nFor example early on if i see a kennen i snatch him, because he is a key component in elementalist origin and in ninja, and so forth.\n\nI might not go for either, but kennen is still darn good early on alone, u can also stack a few items on him.\nAnother mistake i see a lot is that people spend too much gold on re rolling early on. screw that vayne 3 star, he cant carry games, but ashe 2 star can, so level instead so u get a higher chance to grab her.\nI'm not saying vayne 3 star is bad, but for a ranged composition 2 star vayne is good enough, in this example you want to focus on the carry champ, and that's ashe or varus, what win games is tons of AOE, and vayne dosent really provide that.\nOh well hope it helped :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cr√§fty","date":"2019-07-30T06:26:32.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn't a set in stone strategy to win in ranked TFT. You gotta adapt on the spot.\n\nOne advice I can give you, as a plat 2 TFT player myself (if you consider that high enough elo), is to change your comp orientation based on the items you have rather than the units you have. Sadly, in the current TFT system, items dictate what comp you should go for, even though the game should make units matter more than items, but I digress.\n\nSo, for instance, if you're keeping a 1 star {{champion:102}}  on the bench because you have nidalee and elise and you wanna force shapeshifters, but sadly you don't have key items for her such as {{item:3083}} or {{item:3075}}, but you have other items that can work for another comp, then it might be wise to abort the shapeshifter plan and go for a comp that utilizes your items better. Having {{item:3070}} and {{item:1058}} items is not optimal for shapeshifters afterall, so maybe try and go for sorcerers or something like that.\n\nA lot of players will try to force something just because they happened to buy a lot of units for their synergy, just to lose the game in 20 min because they didn't have the key items for what they tried to pull off.\n\nI hope you got my point here.","replies":[]}]}
