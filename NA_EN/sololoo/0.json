The GA is disabled so the ad doesnt have one. All the ap ones that build it in this mode like shaco, fizz, ekko all zhonyas abuse it making the gameplay less fun, the will use their invisibility, invulnerability, or chronoshift, use the zhonyas, and the ability to disappear/escape is already back up then zhyonyas is up not even 30 seconds later. I get it oh kill them before they can use it, not always an option when they just go zhonyas into the escape.{{champion:245}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:35}} {{item:3157}}","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-06-18T08:10:02.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the game mode is all about outplay and countering, zhonyas is an outplay item. like locatedeagle said, GA is a second life restores a portion or your hp and mana.  zhonyas saves you from damage, while GA makes it so you have to be killed twice","replies":[]},{"poster":"LocatedEagle232","date":"2017-06-18T05:01:51.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AD is stronger... Most of the AP champions don't have lifesteal\n\nIgnore akali for a second bc her burst isn't as good....\n\nAnd GA is a second life, Zhonyas is a free frame to try to dodge some absurd amount of damage.\n\nBut honestly I think the real reason is that GA has low offensive stats (and armor,) while there are NOT many AP items for assassins (relative to AD) and Zhonyas is pretty standard item on most of the champions in there to counter Zed or whatever...","replies":[]}]}
