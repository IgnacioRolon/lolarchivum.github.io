I can post the chatlogs if asked, but from what I see my actions in the chat were alright. I mentioned some words that the machine has maybe recognized as flaming? The only thing that can be took as an insult is \"Noob\" which I even wrote to myself after I died stupidly on the botlane wasting flash too.\r\nIn 2 of the 3 games that I've been shown in the ticket I had a bad time score wise, and I wasn't listening to every word my bronze teammates were saying to me, so I got reported.\r\nIn the chatlog it can be even seen that I'm telling the players that taunting is bannable and if someone wants to report anybody they can do it without others forcing it into their faces.\r\n\r\nI can get tilted playing league, like everybody else does. But I wouldn't really compare myself to the flamers I'm facing every game and who are even the cause of my punishment. They insult and harass me in a game, and after that even report me... At all times I'm trying to keep my head calm and focus on the match, but sometimes there's a frustrating day and you play that game where you wanted to relax but all of a sudden all your teammates flame you and ruin your whole experience. On the NA server I've made friends with people across the ocean who I enjoyed playing league with, sharing stories with, and some of us may even meet IRL, even tho we met on a video game. I understand this community and want to be a part of it, but in the good statistics, not in those bad ones. During this one year of playing league I have found an addiction and an escape from real life into something different. It's really sad that because of some people that got bored or do that every game but somehow go through it without a punishment I can't spend time with my friends, who basically became a part of my daily life.\r\nWhenever I see someone new asking for help, advice, I'm trying to be friendly and helpful to them, and not the opposite. Somehow I've found myself permabanned, my personal judgment is that I don't really deserve such a hard punishment. My personal friends who also play League are sometimes toxic themselves, they are all playing league longer than me and are Plat+. Many of them received punishments themselves, but they never got banned. After the new honor rework they were making fun of me because of how unlucky I am with those punishments, my honor was always locked, and they sometimes couldn't believe themselves for what reasons I was getting punished for. I mean, I don't really think my behavior is FAR BELOW the standards of League community, I have maybe 1 or 2 bad games out of 150 played, and always look to be useful and positive.\r\n\r\nSo my question is - Is there a way to get unbanned again? Who can I speak to relating my problem? Could anyone spectate those matches where I got reported and see if I actually did what I was reported for? Could they see what other peoples chat logs look like, and judge the situation even further by the given circumstances?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-09T05:11:47.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it doesn't look like you were overly offensive or toxic in those logs, it does show quite a lot of consistent arguing with your own teammates and trying to put others down. I don't personally think these offenses would warrant a perma, but with that being said, this account did go through the normal chat restrictions followed by a temporary ban then finally this perma. \n\nThose previous punishments were meant to show this kind of behavior doesn't really fly, and showing the same behavior over time probably warranted escalation in punishments. You're welcome to hit up the player behavior agents to talk about exactly which parts led to this in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), I don't generally like giving out personal chat logs here, and those agents are best equipped to explain these things.","replies":[{"poster":"stefanrsb","date":"2018-01-09T16:10:44.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, thanks for your fast answer. \nYou say that it doesn't look OVERLY offensive OR toxic, so how am I below the community standards? I know players who flame every game, yet get out with it.\nYou don't even think those offenses would warrant a perma. Did you read what others were typing to me? Every each of us is different in its own way, and everyone has its bad side. I react very bad and get very angry when being insulted, so I get drawn into the argument easy. Other players noticed that, so they've taunted me to continue typing to them. I try ignoring it and muting but sometimes its just too much, and the whole game feels like hell.\n\nThis account did go through 3 chat restrictions and one temporary ban which all were \"not overly offensive or toxic\", except the first chat restriction where I told a person to perform oral sexual activity to me.\nLike I said, in all times I try too keep my head cool. I have played over 1000 games during the last year on this account, and I had bad behavior in LITERALLY 6 of them and got permabanned. Wouldn't you say that is too much?\n\nI have certainly learned my lesson and I'm playing League of Legends without chat experience from now on, so now I'll miss out on the better part of the community too because of toxic trolls that taunted me into an argument that got me banned. If you read my last chat logs you can see I tell the guy to not taunt me, and I don't even say a bad word to him during the whole game, but the game is marked as inappropriate for some reason.\n\nThe temporary ban I received was issued to me in october, and since then I've played a lot of games but still had my honor locked, now I got banned. I don't know why but for some reason I feel the system has marked me and is treating me different than others, I just feel I'm the unluckiest person on this server... I mean I play 5 games a day and get flamed and my teammates feed their asses off in every one of them. It's my fault that I continue to play the game as there is no time restriction to play it, instead of finishing for today because of people who ruined my day? I feel like after 5 games of hell and intense gaming my reactions to them flaming me and telling me all kinds of stuff are actually good since I have an anger disorder. So because of my medical condition and kids who didn't sleep at 10PM pacific time I don't get to play my favorite game anymore? Do you think my ticket will do anything for me, and do you feel like this ban can get lifted?\nThanks for your time.","replies":[]}]}]}
