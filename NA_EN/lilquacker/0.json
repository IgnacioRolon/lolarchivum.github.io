We as NA are the guinipigs of the system (due to their failure to fully test it out on the PBE) and what it's doing is that if you've had any sort of chat restriction on your account at any time, you can't get anything. \n\ni've known people who have been clean for 5-7 months in terms of toxic behavior, who have only every received a 10 game chat restriction and they STILL aren't getting rewards. These people who say that it takes 3 months to drop down a tier, yes it does in terms of the behavior system (which in itself needs work) but NOT from the hextech system..","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-03-17T00:18:42.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?
