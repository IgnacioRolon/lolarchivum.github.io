I guess there is no OFFICIAL site for IWCI.  What a shame really...\n\nRiot.  Include IWCI in the Leagues dropdown.  Its odd this hasn't been done yet, while All-Star is still there and isn't being done this year, ESPECIALLY since IWCI has been around just as long as All-Star.  (and All-Star is useless in comparison to IWCI as it directly involves Worlds)\n\nI wanted to keep on track, and be able to watch games chronologically and catch up... Unfortunately, I accidentally spoiled myself and have lost all interest in watching any further matches in IWCI.  I even searched 'spoiler free' in my search.\n\nRiot, take this seriously.  Forcing your players to search elsewhere, and be instantly spoiled is going to be a huge turn-off for most.  Get a grip and control your eSports scene, or just let it spin out of control and crash.  Sorry for the vulgar analogy, but it fits VERY well in this situation.","replies":[{"poster":"vinicadez","date":"2015-04-24T18:31:00.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://www.lolespor.com/iwc/2015/iwc-20153/overview \nor http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/2015_International_Wild_Card_Invitational","replies":[{"poster":"Seseru","date":"2015-04-24T18:37:47.050+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1st link isn't in English (google translate can't catch it all) and the second is drenched in spoilers.

Though, I wish I can just purge past memories and watch the tournament fresh from the start.\n\nKeeping something like this optimal isn't a good idea for fresh users.  I'd look at optimal information once I finish watching a game.  This is why there is a VODs section... simple and clean with NO spoilers.\n\nThe point is this league, which is recognized and maintained by Riot, isn't being portrayed like ALL the other recognized and maintained leagues by Riot.  They did include links in the Schedule, but only to the live stream, and only displayed the tournament banner itself (not the match information).  It is inconsistent and highly unprofessional, especially when the official site for the IWCI is lolespor.com...  Sounds like a scam site to me.\n\nRiot should give Turkish hosts access to the site, instead of them having an identical site with a dubious name.  lolesports has multiple languages, and Turkish :|\n\nI am sure Riot already recognizes this, but just in case, PLEASE fix this for next year.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"vinicadez","date":"2015-04-23T18:44:56.926+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://www.lolespor.com/iwc/2015/iwc-20153/overview\nor\nhttp://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/2015_International_Wild_Card_Invitational","replies":[]}]}
