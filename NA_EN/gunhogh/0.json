I'm really question who made a decision but i'm pretty sure he made a miss take.. If u guys think this is an stupid decision please give me an level 6 ezreal skin token because if not I'm going to be tilted for the next century... Please look at the game and tell me if i did good or bad... How much do I need to do to get an s? I'm questioned... seriously Riot this is not right... And Also can you guys tell me how to reroll?

I know it's not the score that you want, but a lot of Ezreal in that role are performing really well right now too.
