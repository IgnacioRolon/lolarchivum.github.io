Am I over thinking this. He has 500 range and most the other ranged supports have 550 with the exception of karma who is at 525. Some supports who are meant to walk into the enemy team like Morgan's have a lower attack range but that is understandable.","replies":[{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2015-02-25T21:26:36.051+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:40}} has 475 auto range.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lumus Avatar","date":"2015-02-25T21:10:03.729+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You pay for a loaded kit. he has short range to compensate his extreme utility","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-02-26T05:13:40.852+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:412}} lolwut?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-25T21:24:05.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Loaded kit?

Look at Sona.\n\n- Passive lets her deal burst damage, slow a target or even reduce damage. How many champions can reduce another champions damage without Exhaust?\n- Her Q brings more damage and gives her whole team bonus AA damage\n- Her W is a heal that can shield her whole team as well. \n- Her E is one of the strongest MS abilities in the game\n- Her R is game changing when you land it\n\nEverything but her ulti does multiple times. \n\n\nHis kit is not loaded. \n\n- He has a situational hard CC. Has lots of counterplay to it. \n- Unique mobility(saw that coming though) that could open a lot of options for other champions. Sure mobile champions can use it too, but I don't find mobility to add in with eachother. Thresh really doesn't make Lee Sin stronger. But he'll make you fear a good Skarner.\n- His heal is weak if you have to use it early, and it's cost is massive. \n- His ult could get your team killed. It has a lot of power, and a lot of risk. Similar to Gragas. \n\n\nI'm not saying Sona's kit is actually loaded though. It is slightly but each part rewards a different play style. \nBard's kit IMO is quite balanced. If anything the fact he can roam will be what decides if he's OP.","replies":[{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2015-02-25T22:36:52.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cindikle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fTTsWTpq,comment-id=0000000000000001,timestamp=2015-02-25T22:34:20.026+0000)\n>\n> What a loaded support kit?

I don't think he is. \n\nI'm just saying - in response to your statement that he has lower attack range - that he has a lot of utility in his kit so to balance that utility, he has less range for aggression. I think his kit looks pretty good. \n\nI am curious about the chimes passive. I want to explore the interactions there.

His ult is the only loaded part of his kit. His Q is a pretty standard, low range stun thats dependent on a variable and the damage on it is SHIT. barely crawling over 200 at rank 5. \n\nHis heals are pretty on par with other healers in the bottom lane, except he has to wait more time and can never 'clutch' heal. Sure he can set them up at the tower which is nice, but he will never be able to completely revert aggressive burst the way shields or straight heals do. \n\nHis magical journey has about one use, hardly overloaded, long cool down, even enemies can follow, supportive initiation tool. \n\nHis ult has many uses, its clearly the focus of the designers when they made him. But it will take skill to use properly, You use it on an enemy team at the wrong time and you may waste cool downs of your allies, use it on an improperly positioned ally and guarantee their death. \n\nHis passive, it scales up in damage the more you collect chimes, which I suspect are the frequency of Thresh souls in number, except they're not spawned in a max radius around you. They spawn ALL over the map, so a certain percentage of them you are unlikely to get. Even still, the damage only increases by 20 every 3 stages or so, thats a lot of collecting them and him taking risks to get them. For 20 or so damage. The slow attached to it increases as well, to a max of 80% for 1 second. A pretty standard cc for a support type in late game.\n\n I cant accept that you think he has an overloaded kit, when many of his abilities typically have 1 or two functions.","replies":[{"poster":"Lumus Avatar","date":"2015-02-25T22:44:13.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never once said his kit was **over**loaded.

Morgana, thresh, Janna even. Even karma with 525 range has her mantra w and e to keep her safe. Bards heal does nothing at an instant and most of his damage comes from his auto attacks. His e isn't for a team fight but as an initiation or possibly escape and his ult is far ranged as well as his q. Just seems to clash with his kit especially since his passive is all about harassing enemies with his auto attacks but to do that you always put yourself at a disadvantage getting in closer than anyone else's range. Since Morgana thresh and Janna all have very long range hard cc.","replies":[]}]}
