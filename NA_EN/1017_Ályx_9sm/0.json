I looked around b4 I rolled there's only one guy had a 2* trist, so there would still be 30+ trist in the pool.

It looks all fine if you look at the average across many, many games, but for each individual game played it can be a total bitch and you can't rly on anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-09-16T16:52:48.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If RNG were truly random, you'd have had a better than a 99% chance of finding 1 trist with 50 gold at level 4.
