The modern relationship is something which by no means should be appealing to a man. However the one thing that perseveres through all the changes leading to our perfect and safe world is the concept of male being inferior if he doesn&#039;t successfully court a woman. Do I believe that shouldn&#039;t be the case? Not entirely. I believe that the &#039;protecting and providing&#039; man should be cherished. However I hold women to the same regard. If a woman is not able to hold to the standard of &#039;maintaining and entertaining&#039; that woman is inferior. It&#039;s not nice to say that about women, of course, but it&#039;s equally &#039;not nice&#039; to say that about a man. The truth is that because of our perceived roles in society we are not allowed to hold women to any standard. When we are &#039;not nice&#039; to a woman we are demons but when women are &#039;not nice&#039; to a man they are significantly more likely to garner sympathy because of their gender. This basically means that a woman can do whatever they want and when that&#039;s the case--with anyone, man or woman--they can not be trusted.","replies":[]}
