It sounds like your network might have lost sync in champion select, so it couldn't communication information and kicked you off.  I suggest using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your connection is holding steady comms with the server.  It may be also worth removing play.tv entirely in case it might still be working in the background but just hidden.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Wąr","date":"2016-10-16T02:02:44.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just saw this, thank you for the response I'll see if that helps !","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T21:49:24.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks that happened, and I'd like to help fix whatever is causing you to leave champion select.  When you say bugged out, what do you mean exactly?  What happened and when?  Did you receive any error messages?  Are you currently using any third party programs that interact with league like play.tv?  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Wąr","date":"2016-10-13T00:35:20.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what happened was we were in the ban phase when it was one of my team mates turns to ban, his ban clock went to 0 while he was hovering a champ and it never locked in and it didn't dodge out, it just stayed on that like it was frozen, yet everyone was chatting and talking and I couldn't see what was happening or whose turn it was to pick/ban. Next thing I know I got kicked out and it said I failed to select a champion. So I guess my turn came but there was no way for me to see or interact with the champ select menu. \n\nThis is an isolated incident and has never happened before, it just sucks it was during promos and made me lose. \n\nI have play.tv but I don't have it on , so nothing third party should be interacting with league.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ishidar","date":"2016-10-12T22:13:16.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had the same problems but haven't gotten losses, just dodge penalties (which I guess is a loss in your promos).  It happens to me most often where the client will just freeze (spinning blue wheel) and the screen will fade and I get the Windows error saying such and such has quit working, looking for a solution.  But no solution comes so I have to quit the program and restart the client.\n\nHappens to me about once every other day or so that I play.  I've found that if it happens after I pick my champ and I wait long enough for the game to have launched, when I reopen the client it will let me reconnect (sometimes), but if I do it immediately, I can't re-queue for a few minutes because I have dodge penalty.\n\nLately I've also been getting very significant packet loss in about every other game.  I'm not the only one either, and I've checked all my computer and router settings and nothing has changed.  Been trying to learn Syndra and it makes it really hard when I can't see my orbs being placed until too late, or my Q & E get stuttered and I throw before the ball exists, or I accidentally W in the wrong spot because I can't see it pick up the orb and wind up double clicking in the same spot...  Yeah it's been frustrating.","replies":[]}]}
