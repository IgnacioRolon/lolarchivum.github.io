I haven't left a game in my recent match history anywhere, so I thought maybe because I had frequent internet disruptions a while back, and earned myself leaver status then that perhaps some new patch bug caused me to re experience my punishment for those past leavers (I didnt leave I just had major ISP issues)\r\nIn any case now every time the 20 minute timer counts down it resets as though I left another game, and suffer the same punishment. NOTE I did not leave a game in the first place...","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2015-01-16T01:14:21.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taamyhvh,\n\nLeaverbuster cannot distinguish between whether you are leaving a game intentionally, or experiencing connectivity issues.\n\nFirst off, if you are experiencing connectivity issues, you should attempt to resolve the issue before playing more games.\n\nNow, to address your issue ... are you able to get in game? After the 20 minute countdown is complete, it will immediately put you into queue. If you decline or miss the ready check, the timer will start over from 20 minutes again when you requeue. The timer works differently than the queue dodge timer. \n\nPlease tell me if I am misunderstanding your issue.","replies":[]}]}
