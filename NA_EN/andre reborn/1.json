Riven is a fed or famine type of character so if she not fed she can kinda fall off extremly fast. As a riven / fiora main this is from my experince. i win a lot of riven games but from time to time a malphite will come and just DEMOLISH me if i don&#039;t get the first kill.","replies":[{"poster":"Rossendale","date":"2016-04-26T19:27:55.441+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"People just don't like getting outplayed (and no, I am not a Riven main.
