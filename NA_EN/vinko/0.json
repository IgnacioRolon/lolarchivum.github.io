Example: &quot;Show only 20 games per site&quot;.\r\n\r\nBoth would be nice too.\r\n\r\nBut at least something has to be done.\r\nThis lag, crash and freeze fiesta cant  be ignored.\r\n\r\nI hope my english was quite understandable. Im not a native speaker and usually use my english skills for smaltalks most of the time.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[]}
