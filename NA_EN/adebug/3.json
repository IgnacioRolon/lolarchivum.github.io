Why you didn't land in the bush is purely the ward's positioning. They made that change to make your teleport position more predictable, both for yourself and for the enemy team. Where before it was completely random, now it's the closest position to your base that it can place you. Not getting placed in the bush also doesn't matter at all unless the ward expires mid-teleport, which I personally think that TP shouldn't let you teleport to wards that would expire during the channel.","replies":[{"poster":"AdeBug","date":"2017-02-27T21:00:33.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you. I guess I read the tp update too fast since I rarely top, and I remmeber something about being placed closer to your turret, which was great because so many times you'd tp way too close to an enemy + ur champ had fwd movement and you'd be like 'woah hey back up for a sec'.\n\nNot sure what you meant by 'Not getting placed in the bush also doesn't matter at all' - because if I take it word for word then I strongly disagree. \n\"TP shouldn't let you teleport to wards that would expire during the channel.\" - I think it keeps the ward alive like the minion, but I could be wrong.\n\nNow about being placed in the bush, I think it's imperative.

When they do, the channel still isn't interrupted, but now becomes a ton more risky because anyone can walk where you're porting to and you would have no idea.\n\nThe only time porting into a bush vs not into a bush really matters is vision and if you have some kind of bush interaction (Nidalee passive, the mastery, Rengar, Ivern). Other than that, it typically won't because typically the ward won't expire when your port finishes and you'll be able to see into the bush.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2017-02-25T02:10:01.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"teleports you behind the ward, (i suppose red side is the upper one on the mini map)","replies":[]}]}
