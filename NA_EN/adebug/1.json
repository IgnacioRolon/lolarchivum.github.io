And for other examples, if a champ is OP, I would like that champ on my team... I don't get this point, you play to win, what's annoying for the enemy is a plus for you.\nAnd for this, even people in the PBE cannot get good that fast for new champs, just watch today's NB3's stream, they're likely to suck if it's on the enemy team. And if it's on your team, I would dodge because no one can get to mastery 6 in 2 days, so why would you wanna play ranked with an experimenting player...\n\nAnd same as above, these are mere suggestions and more of a 'please do something about this', not 'please do exactly as I say' because I know it's hard to find proper solutions that won't backfire/be exploited. Plus the warning sign is what it is, and should help with accidental bans.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"tnwsbtuiynomuykg","date":"2017-11-25T07:16:09.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Banning a team-mate's pick is just bologna.

There's an entirely different meta, and a lot more things are open to play. Where there might be 3-8 viable picks in a position in the pro circuit (say, junglers, there's {{champion:79}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:120}}  {{champion:421}} {{champion:2}} ), there's probably ~20 below Plat (people jungle all sorts of things like Master Yi, Shyvana, Sion, Rammus, Graves, Fiddles, and many more).\n\nYou also have no idea what a person's champion pool looks like. In the pros, most players have an idea of the style of champion other pros pick. That's why Froggen gets hit with Anivia bans every game. It's possible to ban someone out and take out up to four (or more, depending on if the picks can be flexed) of their champions, which for some players forces them on to something out of the meta. \n\nThat can't happen in solo queue, especially under Plat. Most bans are targeted towards the champions with \"toxic gameplay patterns\" -- namely assassins and hook supports. There's 1-2 players in pros who have played Fizz (I know Ray's played it, but I think I've seen it elsewhere). But Fizz has a toxic gameplay pattern, so he's commonly banned below Plat. The same is true of Leblanc, Blitzcrank, Thresh, Zed, Akali, Ekko, etc., again, namely assassins and hook supports.\n\nSince there's no power picks, limited trading (not everyone has every champ), and no ability to ban someone out, there's no reason to ban a champion your ally is showing.\n\nOh, and if you try to ban my champion? I have thousands of games played in my career since Season 1. I can absolutely suicide rush every respawn in one game and nothing will ever happen to me because it's not a pattern.","replies":[{"poster":"xXxAlta√ØrrxXx","date":"2016-08-11T13:38:07.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stoped reading when u put Lee Sin in reliable junglers.

You shouldn't dodge just because the champion you would like to play is banned. Your're not \"forced to dodge.\" There's a penalty for a reason. Champion select is for people to create their team. Both team get to ban 3 champs they don't want to see in the game and they can construct a team composition around it. It's not about you and the champion you want to play. It's about the teams and all the 10 players in the champ select.\n\nI agree that an indicator if you're about to ban a teammate's prepick would be useful but I disagree that you should dodge if you can't play the one champion you want.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolf Queen","date":"2016-08-11T08:52:17.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if your a 1 trick pony then you pretty much have to dodge if you dont get your champ or its likely youll lose.
