Now IDK what they do up there in Diamond or whatever, but here in the ELO of the common folk I almost always rush Essence Reaver first item and basically never regret it:**\r\n\r\n* Essence Reaver costs less than BT, gives the same AD, gives CDR, and the only downside is less LS and no passive Shield, but none of those stats matter if DRAAAVEN just executes the enemy before they touch him.\r\n* Essence Reaver actually gives more offensive stats because it lets you keep your W on way more often which means MORE SPEED MORE AXES MORE ACTION TONS OF DMG\r\n* I personally think of Reaver as a superior defense item too because you won&#039;t think twice about mashing W to dodge a skill shot or win a trade, whereas with BT you&#039;ll often be left high and dry on mana\r\n* Reaver CDR lets you keep your axes UP. How many times before a major Dragon fight have you had both Axes spinning and wondered &#039;wow my axes are gunna drop if I can&#039;t hit something right now...&#039; then charge in and die? WIth ER&#039;s 10% CDR that happens LESS FREQUENTLY because more often than not your Q will be up a third time to refresh that duration\r\n* Even with Reaver instead of BT you still get more than enough life steal to bully in lane. Your AA already heals for basically twice a normal ADC&#039;s lifesteal AND the other chump who isn&#039;t Draaaven probably needs to build IE first\r\n* The Mana return is SUPER noticeable. I don&#039;t always notice the bonus LS or shield from BT, but when I&#039;m essentially never OOM even while spamming W, it&#039;s a really really big deal\r\n* Crit is for chumps! There are so many items that reduce crit damage, but nothing can stop you if your AA&#039;s just do 1K without crit anyway! Against particularly annoying comps I often go for {{item:3006}} {{item:3508}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3035}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3072}} and I never ragret it because a dead Draven does 0 damage, whereas a live Draven who has the mana to keep Blood Rushing does tons of damage!\r\n\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s all folks","replies":[{"poster":"YossarianSensei","date":"2015-10-27T07:34:19.326+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":0,"body":"Charge in and die LESS FREQUENTLY?\n\nThat's literally all I ask of my ADCs","replies":[{"poster":"LaserDeathBlade","date":"2015-10-27T07:58:37.230+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"muh Derknethhh\" {{champion:67}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Myrddin","date":"2015-10-27T09:05:01.078+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's simply not how you build draven its\n\n{{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3072}}","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-10-27T17:56:39.544+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget the trinket. {{item:3031}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Merkel x Tsipras","date":"2015-10-27T12:50:18.748+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":26,"body":"no critical on draven....and since when with that build you do 1k damage AA?\n\nYou build critical on draven so he can crit his Q for 1K DAMAGE \n\nBut then again you are plat 5 so you can build a lich bane and win down there\n\nI am not against you but i want you to realize that this build is BAD if you want to make this type of build go play Top lane riven or something and remove the mana restore item for something else BC lets say\n\nADC NEED AS and you have 0 attack speed build...WAT? your whole point is to ATTACK FAST FROM BEHIND and to take down turret fast if you attack slower than the Maokai who was in top lane have fun destroying the gates later on....\n\nAnyway like i say in PLAT 5 you can build lich bane and you can win but later on you need to reathink your build","replies":[{"poster":"Borbland","date":"2015-10-27T14:19:57.357+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're gold V in EUNE, how do you know NA plat 5 level so well ?","replies":[{"poster":"Merkel x Tsipras","date":"2015-10-27T15:25:07.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":24,"body":"A Small research on this account on board would reveal you that this is not my main account and i was playing on N.A before you even knew what league is \n\nA small research would reveal that too\n\nThe more you know","replies":[{"poster":"iamthegoatofwar","date":"2015-10-27T16:25:30.865+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"a small research would reveal you're an asshole.\n\nthe more you know.","replies":[{"poster":"Merkel x Tsipras","date":"2015-10-27T16:36:34.401+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":26,"body":"so you curse me but i am the \"asshole\" here? hmm cool story","replies":[{"poster":"Sinlaire","date":"2015-10-27T17:52:47.219+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"You being the first one cursed at and not the other way around doesn't prevent or negate the fact that calling an asshole when he's being an asshole, is still a fair and obvious call.\n\nan asshole is an asshole, and the shoe fits for you bud.","replies":[{"poster":"Excitidly Insane","date":"2015-10-28T11:57:49.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"inb4 AP Draven FOTM below diamond.","replies":[{"poster":"Sinlaire","date":"2015-10-28T21:56:12.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AT what point do monkeys like you see me calling an asshat an asshat think that it's me condoning the building of Lichbane on draven?\n\ndid you read the post?
