They can lane against them just fine. But the problem is with how they scale relative to ADCs.\n\nMages are much more level-reliant than an ADC is. Being forced to share exp with your support means that, even if you are technically even with the enemy adc, they will be more valuable because they aren't as reliant on scaling with their levels. Ziggs wants to level up so the base damage on his abilities and their cooldowns get better. By going bottom lane he is going to be struggling more than the Jinx or Twitch who can scale based off of their baller as fuck auto attacks, rather than abilities.\n\nAnd, as people said, your team frankly needs an ADC-equivalent. Kindred jungle might work as a fine replacement, but if you don't have one you're going to struggle as the game goes on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kidro","date":"2016-06-14T23:53:23.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"granted I'm only low silver so this has a lot to do with that but carry's arnt going to build MR to counter his dmg and ziggs can 3 shot turrets after midgame","replies":[]},{"poster":"ofart","date":"2016-06-14T23:51:33.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's only viable if you have something like GP top and Zed mid or an AD JG.","replies":[]}]}
