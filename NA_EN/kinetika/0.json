We updated the rules for /remake based on some player feedback.  A first blood will not prevent a remake from happening unless it happens against the remaking team, before the player leaves.  The primary purpose of this rule is to prevent a player from quitting after the other team scores a kill, and hoping for a remake.  \n\nThe original post you cited was unfortunately out of date, but has since been updated.

In the case where friends are playing together, then it makes sense that it counts as a loss for all of them.  I'm less sure about a case where people who randomly queue up with people (e.g. from a previous game, or from the suggestion box) - in that case, they might not actually know that the player is toxic and it would be a little unfair to punish them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-06-22T17:16:04.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would it be possible for you to tell Scarizard next time to include the \"updated\" parts in the patch notes? \n\nAt least let us know it was updated and go read the article again.\n\nThe remake just happened to me after I got first blood, and I was so sad to find out it was intended.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kinetika","date":"2016-06-18T22:09:34.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you....appreciate the reply. \n\nI get why that was changed, but it sucks that we lose so much time (in queue, champ select, game loading etc).  \n\nHow about giving everyone in a /remake a free one game skin boost when a remake occurs?
