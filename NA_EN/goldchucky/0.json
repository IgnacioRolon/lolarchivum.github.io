BS.\r\nThis happened to my friend Woonjoom and I, when we were playing in a normal match, (Ping 131), and then we both disconnected due to internet problems. About a minute later from the internet problem, we reconnected to the game, but the server says the game was already over, and we were &quot;Free to play another one.&quot; But once I was in the lobby, It says something about &#039;Leaverbusting&quot; or &quot;AFK&quot; or &quot;You&#039;re put into a lower queue for 5 matchmade games.&quot; We didn&#039;t do anything, but the game just crashed. So much for normal games!","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-08-14T23:59:48.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok.\nThat's what happens when you're disconnected for whatever reason and someone reports you.
