Even it's just a quiet foot step, I still want to hear it in the game. It will make the environment to have more activities. Furthermore, it will be cool to hear the different foot steps sound effect from each different Champions. Example,{{champion:72}} with his insect's legs sound, {{champion:111}} with his heavy metal foot steps sound, {{champion:120}}  with his horse's foot steps sound, and many more... Is it possible for Riot put some work in this area? Can I expect to hear these beautiful sound effects in the future? Please Riot, give this some thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Eno","date":"2014-10-30T00:53:34.478+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!\n\nI haven't seen this topic come up in a while, and I'd be glad to give some insight.\n\nThere have been some experiments in the past with adding footsteps and movement sounds to the Champs.

They did a pretty good job with the footsteps and movement sounds (every Heroes have their own footsteps sounds). Well, I don't mean to copy them, but just borrow the idea and try to improve ourselves.\n\nHoping to see this improvement in the future, Riot :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2014-10-30T00:56:50.531+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"well you won't need to change much for certain champions.\n{{champion:69}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:133}} (valor){{champion:37}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:26}}","replies":[{"poster":"o0Sasori0o","date":"2014-10-30T02:43:47.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um... really?\n{{champion:69}} sound of her tail sliding on the ground (snake movement sound).\n{{champion:42}} sound of his engines running.\n{{champion:127}} sound of the ices following her.\n{{champion:3}}, {{champion:10}}   sound of their wings flapping.\n...","replies":[{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2014-10-30T02:45:04.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"those can be added, they just won't have *foot* step sounds","replies":[{"poster":"o0Sasori0o","date":"2014-10-30T02:49:07.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol true, but to be specific, movements sounds :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RowGo","date":"2014-10-30T01:38:46.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally wouldn't like it I don't think.\nIt would be to much noise with when 10 champs are around you just hear taptapptaptippiytap\nAnd there is already champ move quotes.\nBut hey my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"o0Sasori0o","date":"2014-10-30T02:36:51.511+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you have the option to turn it off or quieter :)\nAlso, Dota 2 has footsteps and movements sounds in their game, and it works beautifully","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"o0Sasori0o","date":"2014-10-29T05:43:13.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I almost forgot to mention that the sound effect while champions are walking on the river should be include if you are going to actually take this thread into work :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2014-10-29T03:32:43.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://oligoclonal.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/tumblr_mfczmbe6ob1rp0vkjo1_500.gif\n{{champion:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"o0Sasori0o","date":"2014-10-29T04:29:05.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha... make my night :D but that will happen only when he reaches his maximum stacks xD","replies":[{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2014-10-29T05:18:50.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why it's satisfying.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Magnathar","date":"2014-10-30T21:13:34.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ON TOPIC: i think these footsteps/wings/etc is a great idea!
