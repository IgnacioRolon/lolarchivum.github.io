Veigar is this twisted monstrosity that comes in a very small package with an ego that exceeds his stature by far. Yet, despite how annoying and pathetic he can be, it is easy to feel sympathy for him, an innocent caught in a whirlwind of misfortune who suffered for an indeterminate number of years in a prison far from home and hope.\n\nHe emerged broken, yet more powerful than ever before. Perhaps history will repeat itself? I dearly hope so.\n\nAlso, when I got fed as Veigar, I felt nigh unstoppable if I could keep enemies at a safe distance; when I said someone died, they fucking ***died***.","replies":[{"poster":"Dangerous Man","date":"2015-03-07T19:18:42.977+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"He was my 2nd main, he is really good :(","replies":[{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2015-03-07T20:07:03.455+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":2,"body":"Was* {{item:3070}}{{champion:45}}{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2015-03-08T00:22:39.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he's still at least meh if you don't count on his stun landing... ever...","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-03-08T03:42:56.222+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd walk into it for old times.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Terff","date":"2015-03-07T18:48:07.349+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"First was draven","replies":[{"poster":"GoodOlAlex","date":"2015-03-07T18:53:44.568+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Terff,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=MmXh1eA0,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-03-07T18:48:07.349+0000)\n>\n> First was draven\n\nBut why?","replies":[{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-03-07T21:09:13.322+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because DRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVEN","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"pinkyblossom","date":"2015-03-07T22:52:46.673+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:1}}  coz she said: \"It'll be fun!\", and than she introduced me to Tibbers!\n\nO!

I loved how outrageous Urgot was. His whole theme and personality was one grotesque joke after another, and his kit was quite satisfying to play.
