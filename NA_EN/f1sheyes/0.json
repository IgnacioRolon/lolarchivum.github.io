But I keep track of my dice (mainly because they're not actually mine, but a friend's so I shouldn't lose them), so the likelihood of actually stepping on one is very low. Also, not many people own d4s or other dN (where N != 6). It's just a rare occurrence.\n\nLegos, meanwhile, get everywhere. Have you ever been building something and just have it explode on you? The risk of legos is far worse than a d4.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2018-02-27T21:03:57.192+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"This gave me a giggle.","replies":[{"poster":"F1SHEYES","date":"2018-02-27T22:43:25.354+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yay a rioter comment\nAlso 39 up votes wtf","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nyloaf","date":"2018-02-27T00:31:08.420+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"ik this post is kind of dumb but it made me laugh","replies":[{"poster":"F1SHEYES","date":"2018-02-27T00:35:48.204+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the point\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2018-02-27T04:05:27.871+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take a table with you in lane\nMake him stub his toe every dash\n\nEz pz lemon squeazy","replies":[{"poster":"F1SHEYES","date":"2018-02-27T04:12:42.053+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"ouch","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PurpleKingCrazy","date":"2018-02-27T04:15:29.678+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now, Taliyah will have more lego's with her E!\n\n{{champion:163}}","replies":[{"poster":"F1SHEYES","date":"2018-02-27T04:23:14.240+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh no","replies":[{"poster":"PurpleKingCrazy","date":"2018-02-27T20:41:24.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In addition, Taliyah's ult will have a collection of lego's and she'd be called \"Bob the Builder.\"\n\n{{champion:163}}","replies":[{"poster":"hoyohai","date":"2018-03-03T06:13:57.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's Ryze's next rework.","replies":[{"poster":"PurpleKingCrazy","date":"2018-03-03T13:21:10.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep.
