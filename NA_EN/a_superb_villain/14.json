The easygoing half-pint race, though fierce, is often regarded with some degree of joviality. Their high-pitched voices and naturally cute forms inspire something of a protective instinct in the larger races, or at least bring to mind images of children playing at being adults.","url":"http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/veigar/","image":"http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Veigar_1.jpg"},"up_votes":33,"down_votes":3,"body":"> Every now and again, however, a yordle turns so bad that even at its small stature it **strikes terror into the hearts of others**. Veigar is one such twisted yordle. As a master of the magical black arts, as well as a corrupter of cosmic energy, he is** one of the most powerful sorcerers on Valoran**.\n\nIt is established that Veigar is legitimately terrifying. It is canon that among Runeterra&#039;s myriad manipulators of magic, Vegiar is one of the greatest.\n\nSometimes I feel that comedic principles overshadow Veigar&#039;s character, and let&#039;s be honest, it is all good fun. We like the villain no one takes seriously. We may roll our eyes when the evil antagonist shakes a fist and promises revenge against those who foiled them, but a part of us loves that they lived to fight another day.\n\nWhile I believe this is all very important to Veigar&#039;s concept, it swings too far towards ineffectual. It&#039;s not that we think The Tiny Master of Evil is pathetic, we are _shown_ his lack of competence without anything to counterbalance his failings. The most Veigar has ever accomplished is steal some balloons, horseshoes, and string. Adding insult to injury, his attempt to steal the Mothership was largely ignored; no one even bothered to stop him from trying. His attempt at theft was stopped by a flock of geese.\n\nA group of birds put a stop to his plans. How sad is that? The problem practically resolved itself.\n\nI suppose my fear is that all anyone sees when they look at Veigar is a clown with a big hat and a mind too small for any real evil. He&#039;s a joke, a fool. We laugh because in spite of any frightening potential he may have, we know he&#039;ll never succeed. What chance does a four foot tall cat in a hat have to be a real villain?\n\n> Instead of returning to his people and Bandle City, **he sought tutelage from dark wizards across the land**. With his demented will focused on one task, **he quickly became a dangerous and powerful wizard** in his own right. Now he seeks to end all conflict on Valoran **by bringing all of the city-states to their knees**, regardless of their affiliation.\n\nFunny as he may be, Veigar is not in his right mind. He is insane and sadistic, a volatile combination exacerbated by a mastery of potent magic. The Tiny Master of Evil suffered serious trauma and abuse for an indeterminate amount of time. Hearing him scream about swallowing souls in a squeaky voice gives us a good chuckle, and it is very easy to forget Veigar is dead serious. He _wants_ to devour souls, he _wants_ destroy minds, he _wants to crush the entire world beneath his sabatons_.\n\nVeigar is a psychological mess, and exceedingly violent. Most disturbing of all, he has the power to make his dreams a reality. How shocking is that? The Tiny Master of Evil did not just search the world for dangerous and powerful wizards, he _mastered_ their craft.\n\nImagine if you will someone who is mentally unstable. Now give them a knife. Seems like a bad idea, right? Now give them a weapon of mass destruction instead. The phrase &quot;worst case scenario&quot; comes to mind, doesn&#039;t it?\n\nThat is Veigar.\n\nhttps://31.media.tumblr.com/7bcbeffb597b4eefe3d994d38732e88b/tumblr_inline_nypmktNdGU1so6ef2_500.gif\n\nPlease keep in mind, no matter how funny we may find a walking hat with a short temper, he is still a horrifying tragedy that will obliterate your soul at the slightest provocation.\n\nIt&#039;s late, I&#039;m tired. Please, Riot, don&#039;t make Veigar the butt of Runeterra&#039;s jokes.","replies":[{"poster":"Trylobyte","date":"2016-02-21T06:05:35.079+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"In other words, a little more Kefka, a little less Wile E.
