Dialga is not a space dragon, it is a time dragon. there is no argument here. Giritina is not a space dragon, it is an antimatter dragon, there is no argument here. Rayquaza is not a space dragon, it is a sky dragon, there shouldn't be an argument here.\n\nthe 18 dragons that can traverse the skies are dragonair, dragonite, altaria, salamence, latias, latios, rayquaza, reshiram, zekrom, kyurem, charizard, flygon, dialga, palkia, giritina, hydreigon, and noivern.\nDragonair and dragonite are basic dragons with no special attunement, they are not sky dragons. altaria is tied more to clouds than the sky itself, so it is not a true sky dragon, salamence is tied more to aggression than the sky, and is not a sky dragon, latias and latios are tied to speed, and are not sky dragons, rayquaza is a sky dragon tied to all of the sky, reshiram is not related to the sky in any way past traveling through it, and is a fire energy dragon, zekrom is lightly tied to the sky, but is tied more closely with electricity energy, kyurem is only capabe of flight when it is tied to zekrom or reshiram, and is based closely two a lack of energy, or ice, charizard is a true fire dragon, that is only a true dragon when under the affects of mega evolution, flygon is tied closer to sandstorms than to the sky itself, dialge palkia and giritina can only travel through the sky by merit of them not needing it and being able to bend reality, hydreigon can fly but is more representative of darkness, and noivern is more related to sound than to the sky.\n\nbased on this incredible list of things that i just pointed out that really only scratches the surface as to why ray is not a space dragon, specifically the fact that no dragons in pokemon share the same themes ever, and something traveling through a medium does not make it something. I think we should be able to decipher that he is wrong.\n\nif you want to get even farther into this argument, I suggest your next move to follow up on this one is to try to convince me that rayquaza is a robot dragon, because in destiny deoxys rayquaza travels through a bunch of robots, and by your logic that makes it a robot dragon.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-03-02T14:42:36.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is that the space that palkia rules is this one:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\n\nIt controls the 3-dimensional room.\n\nBut here everybody is talking about this kind of space:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space\nthe stuff that is outside the atmosphere of the earth.","replies":[]},{"poster":"elon wątroba","date":"2016-03-01T22:11:43.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garchomp WHERe?","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-03-01T22:43:29.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't remember garchomp being able to fly, or able to go through space. it might but I \"m pretty sure its land based.","replies":[{"poster":"elon wątroba","date":"2016-03-02T04:44:41.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So does dragonair :D can't either fly or go through space.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Krizalid","date":"2016-03-01T15:57:33.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't believe so many people don't know about the Metroid, lol.
