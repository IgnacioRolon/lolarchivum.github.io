I believe the bodysuit fits champions like Fiora and Vayne, who are in close proximity to their opponents. Form-fitting works best since it offers decent flexibility and denies any trailing garments that could be grabbed (Fiora's cape and Vayne's cloak work against this, but my point stands).\n\nSadly, my insight is limited with regards to designs that depart from the leather leotards so many Demacian champions sport. I really have no frame of reference for what Demacia \"is\" besides blue, gold, white and lots of armor.\n\nhttp://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/102/1/4/kingdom_death___great_game_hunter_by_lokmanlam-d4vvuc7.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2015-02-13T06:55:50.159+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I agree that \"skin-tight\" isn't as much of a problem as \"body-suits\".

I personally don't see straying from this being very beneficial. Its kind of like the Spartans from Halo with their under armor, and really the only other option I see would be chain mail, but this could only really apply to only the larger fighters, like J4. \n\nTLDR: Stick with the body suits.

Same difference, its some light durable material that offers light protection.\n\nHowever yea, boobplates (chestplates with boobs carved into them) would never perform well in real life ESPECIALLY how they displayed it in lux's case. as the sword would be either deflected upwards toward her bare neck (ouch) or down toward the top of her stomach (a much more slow and painful death actually)\n\nI would like to see riot implementing better armor designs in metal armors actually. \n\n http://www.videogamesblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/hildegard-von-krone-in-soul-calibur-4.jpg Hilde's armor is a good example of female armor done right.

Look around her collarbone. The armor end's in the perfect way so that if a sword were to slide up the side of her chest, or shoulder, it wouldn't stab her in the neck.\n\n\nKayle does it... somewhat well though i dont know how that chick can stand having those 1000 pound pauldrons, and layers upon layers of armor slowing her down...
