As I understand it, **Spirit** is an incorporeal manifestation, whereas _soul_ is an ethereal essence of one's existence. **Spirits** tend to be bound, but don't have to be, to a body, while a _soul_ serves as a matrix for one's psyche. In case a **spirit** wasn't bound to a material anchor, or was independent on it, it could be possible for it to have a _soul_. In the end, the two terms are often understood as synonyms and tend to be interchanged rather freely, which brings me back to my primary statement.\n\n_Note: I tried to answer the question academically, because, damn, am I a meddlesome bore.
