For example, to trade:\r\n- Both players have to agree that they wouldn&#039;t want the skin back\r\n- Both players must give a skin \r\n- The skin must be activated\r\nAnd If a player want the skin back, they should ask the other player that they traded with to give back the skin to them, If not it&#039;s their problem not Riot&#039;s. Please add this it would be a cool idea and many people will like it.","replies":[]}
