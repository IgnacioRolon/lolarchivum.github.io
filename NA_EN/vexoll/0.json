The better part of 3 years has been spent building this account and making it my own and building friendships along the way. I took a break from LoL about 5ish months ago to focus on school and figured I would come back for Christmas break. Well, To get to the point I tried to log into my account the other day only to find out I couldn't remember my password. NBD, I'll just change it. Well, I went to change it and realized I couldn't remember what email I used. I have only 4 emails that I use for everything so I was confused. I went and decided to just look myself up on LoLKing and saw that my account was still active and being played... And it most definitely wasnt me playing it. I quit last season while maining Poppy top and somehow I finished the season with Cass and all these champs I had never really played before. Then to this season(which I havent personally played a single game) there have been games being played. I emailed Riot to try and prove that account was mine. The account review process definitely doesn't favor somebody who doesn't keep track of everything they have done in LoL for the past 3 years. I have no idea who the first 5 champs I purchased or gifts that I've sent or received. I'm not sure what to do from here. Somebody is playing on my account and I don;'t have the information riot is asking for. I do however have screenshots and videos of the account that only the account owner could have. Ill post the links. I want my account back and I just need help to figure out what to do.\r\n//screenshots from the client \r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/YoU2U\r\n//Video of my buddy and I playing \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1VIzUp0ODQ \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETw47kaSZ7k","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-28T02:32:01.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't really address account recoveries here on the boards.
