As for your tickets, reply to me and provide your ticket numbers.  Every single ticket submitted is read and responded to by a Rioter and never a bot.  This way I can make sure that the responses you received are ones trying to help resolve your issue!\n\nAdditionally, your tickets should allow me to take a look at your Network Configuration (this has sensitive information, which is why we ask for it in tickets and not here on the Boards) to see if there are any immediate problems we can identify that could be causing the lag spikes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kem Ravenbane","date":"2014-09-22T03:25:08.067+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel the same way enough is enough Riot...","replies":[]},{"poster":"PapaFizz","date":"2014-09-22T13:58:10.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I'm done.

I've been having huge lag spikes (my ping doesn't even move) for the last few weeks and now I got demoted and I just can't take it anymore.
