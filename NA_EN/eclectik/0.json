I'm not saying I get so angry that I want to hurt people, but I go in expecting the people I am playing with to want to win, because losing just sucks. When people start running lane to lane giving out free gold, how can I have fun? Is my Vayne better than this persons Jinx, who knows, cuz jungle anivia is feeding every lane and i don't get a chance to find out. The game is about having fun, and people take that away for a few chuckles, or the reaction of people in game. It sounds like an angry child but its just my competitive nature, whom enjoys winning.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Baby Ghoul","date":"2015-08-21T11:53:09.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you trying to insult specific champions?\n\nI'm conflicted because I hate the, \"it's just normals\" people with a passion because they suck all the fun out of my day, but some of those champions are strong picks right now.

She was basically a goddess of Solo Q.\n\nAniva has an above average play rate and win rate, as does Sona.\n\nSinged has a low pick rate but tends to only be played by Singed mains, and also he's basically the strongest champion in the entire game, with the most 1v5 potential of any champion. Sort of joking, but I guarantee that some dumbass will chase you if you play as Singed in Solo Q. He finds a lot of success there.\n\nNo comment on Poppy, but yeah the others are fairly bad or at least are situational (Taric is a beast against an all AD comp). \n\nI'm just saying, even though you don't see a champion often doesn't mean they are bad.
