DTN provided a pretty comprehensive guide here that I hope was beneficial to you.  I'd especially like to recommend the [Protecting Your Account](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account) portion which provides some great safety practices to help ensure the security of your account.

Please follow all of the steps below to regain control of your League of Legends account and reverse any unwanted actions that the individual who compromised your account may have taken:\n\n1. Run a complete anti-virus scan on your computer and remove any malware that is detected. If you don't have an anti-virus program, I recommend downloading either [**MalwareBytes Free**](https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/) or [**ESET NOD32 with a free 30 day trial**](http://download.eset.com/special/live-installer/us/eset_nod32_antivirus_live_installer.exe). Either or should be able to get the job done. \n\n2. Once the scans have run and any detections are removed, change any accounts/passwords that you believe may have been compromised. This may include your email account(s) and League of Legends account (if you still have access to it; if not, skip to the \"Submitting a ticket\" step). You can change your League of Legends password by going to the [**League of Legends account area**](https://account.leagueoflegends.com/na/en/protect) in the top-right corner of this page. Click on your summoner name, and select \"Settings\". In the box that comes up, click \"Change Password\" and follow said steps. (Make sure that your email account is secure before doing this step, as a confirmation email will be sent to the corresponding email account.)\n\n3. Now that your accounts are secure, it's time to contact Riot Games Player Support to deal with the unauthorized actions on your account and/or recovering your account. \n\n\nTo contact Riot Games Player Support, you'll need to [**submit a ticket on the Riot Games Support website**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38154). In the ticket, please submit all the requested information along with whatever information you can provide about your situation: \n\n> ##**[NOTE: DO *NOT* POST THE INFORMATION ON THE BOARDS. SUBMIT THEM IN YOUR TICKET!]**\n\n Lastly, to increase your chances of a quick resolution to your request, follow the tips below the best that you can:\n \n1. Be sure to submit as much information in your initial ticket as possible. For obvious reasons, each Player Support Specialist's request for more information will delay the resolution of the issue.\n\n2. Be respectful and polite in your correspondences with Riot Support. (They're doing their best to help you!)\n\n3. Try not create a new ticket or respond to an existing ticket before a Player Support Specialist has had the chance to review your request. New tickets/replies may bump your ticket back to the bottom of the queue, thus increasing the amount of time before a Player Support Specialist is able to review your ticket.  \n \nI know that there are quite a bit of steps listed above, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Best of luck!\n\nPlease visit the [Protecting Your Account](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account) and [Recovering Your Account](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694-Recovering-Your-Account) articles for more information.\n\n-DTN","replies":[]}]}
