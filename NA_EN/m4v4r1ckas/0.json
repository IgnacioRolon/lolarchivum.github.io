As a first step, log out completely.  Then, you'll need to sign in from the [EUNE ](http://eune.leagueoflegends.com)page first, then visit the [EUNE PBE](https://pbesignup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/pbe) link. \n\nSo, log out first then head over to the EUNE page. Once there, the EUNE PBE link should get this resolved. Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
