I often find myself choosing a new background and screensaver every 2-3 weeks or so just because there are so many and I want to use a ton of them.\r\n\r\nThat being said, why aren't there any plans to have support for mobile? I've seen this mentioned on here time and time again only to receive no response from Riot and no hard answers as to whether or not it will ever happen. This is a huge wasted opportunity because I would use the hell out of this.\r\n\r\nPlease bring League Displays to mobile. It sucks having to google specific images all the time, and there's a demand.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2020-01-25T19:15:53.144+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can download the images from the League Displays app to your computer, and then transfer them to your device with whatever method you prefer most.","replies":[{"poster":"CV Protostar","date":"2020-01-25T19:20:36.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean.....the.....ah damn you.
