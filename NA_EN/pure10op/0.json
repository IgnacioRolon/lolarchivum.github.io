She may well need nerfs, but that's up to what parts of her kit are revealed to be overtuned.","replies":[{"poster":"koshkyra","date":"2017-07-04T05:39:28.015+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"My issue with her is her early game burst damage when she takes TLD and ignite.

Though at some point I stopped building her as support when I do play her support. Mostly because that style of play is boring with her. Leona is ALL about going in, and pushing poor positioning with THE EXTREMIST OF PREJUDICE.\n\nI build her as AP bruiser and adopted the motto \"ALL IN OR ALL DEAD!\". If your team is nearby, there is NEVER a bad time to 'JUST GO IN' in with Leona. It's the same as Poppy. They are both tanks who just take forever to die when they are being pounded on by the entire enemy team.\n\n\"Leona! You are supposed to feed the ADC!

I've won some, lost some, couldn't even farm, and farm great. The problem isn't her crazy damage. If we're gonna discuss damage on supports, then zyra needs to be gutted in that department like everybody else who does crazy damage. It never has been Leona's damage. She's an all in who if she fails to miss all her combos, then she has to wait to all in again. The problem is the cd on her cc abilities. They are extremely low making her a miniature sejuani with half the item build as sejuani. Not only does most her kit lock you down for eternity, she also has the tankiness to survive a nuclear bomb. Since she is an all in, perma cc support support who engages, it is reasonable to do the amount of damage she does, but there is no counterplay when she misses all her combos. She can q stun every other second, she can dash in with e every other 2 seconds. Her ult cd is nonexistent. By the time you back get an item and go back to lane, you have your ult again and this is at level 1. At level two you don't even need to back she'll have by the time the team is ready to go in again. Laning against her is as oppressive as laning against zyra and that is another problem. She's SUPPOSED to be an engager, not an oppressor. By the time her cc combo is finished, you're already dead and even if you manage to kill her adc, she can still 1 v 1 you. Don't even waste your abilities on leona, as she will survive long enough for her team to come to her rescue. It's moreso about the overall gameplay experience from multiple persons over time rather than her stats. Yeah, nerf her base damage and w passive. Hell, nerf all her stats for all I care, but that would not change the outcome of her fights or gaming experience because her kit is what is making her detestable. No one needs to do damage if you can keep the enemy in one place for eternity not being able to do anything. She is a support who can make any friendly adc experience blissful and effortless and that is not healthy for the bot lane let alone competitive play.","replies":[{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2018-01-29T18:48:51.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Breathe man, breathe.\nLeona's Q cd is what you describe but not her other spells.
