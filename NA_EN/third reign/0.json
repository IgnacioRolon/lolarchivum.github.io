The only Other skins I could test where base and Nightblade, which did not exhibit the texture revert after repair.","replies":[{"poster":"Third Reign","date":"2015-05-19T17:29:05.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the quick reply KateyKhaos,\n\nI know it was fixed previously, and all was fine for the previous patches, i just noticed that it occurs again with patch 5.9. \n\nIf its only on my end, I'll give the client repair a try and leave a note if the textures stay or not.\n\nEdit:\nSo I repaired the client and can confirm that Irelia's W changes to the old textures on activation. Something must have happened in patch 5.9 as I'm very sure this issue did not occur on 5.8. The skin I used was Aviator, as the brown blades are the most pronounced change in the texture rebalances.\n\nHopefully someone else can confirm this bug reoccurring on 5.9.\n\nEdit2:\nNightblade Irelia and Base Skin do not exhibit the texture revert, so it seems to only be an Aviator Irelia problem.\n\nPicture with Champion Mastery for proof:\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-19T17:01:22.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Third Reign,\n\nIt looks like this issue was resolved in March. I just loaded her up, and I didn't see the texture changing. \n\nIf you're still seeing this on your end, I might suggested repairing your client.","replies":[]}]}
