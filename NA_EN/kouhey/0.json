Visual Designer here from the client team.  I feel you on the color read - I like when I can tell quickly what is happening, and color association can be so powerful.  One thing we got really excited about, and may have been mentioned in our recent dev blog, is the connection between magic and metal that we feel equals Hextech.  Our magic is blue, and we think it's pretty cool, so we wanted to use it as a color and a material that gets you closer to the game.  Thats why our \"Find Match,\" \"Play,\" and \"Play Again\" buttons are all blue magic buttons.\n\nWith this concept applied to the social panel system, it made alot of sense to make the \"playing a game\" status be blue, this lets us add in Mobile (gray) to our already established colors: away (red), online (green) while also reducing some of the color noise.  Our really bright yellow we took out of the Social Panel status system for now, and use it other places to mean \"you\", just like the yellow health bars in game - so you can always see your chats, your icon, where you are.\n\nI also hear your feedback about wanting to organize games with friends.  We're definitely looking at other things that (I think) can handle this in really cool ways rather than depending on our status icons to have to do it for you.  Stay tuned! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Kouhey","date":"2016-05-27T05:06:00.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool! It makes more sense to separate \"In queue\" from \"In champ select\" and \"In game\" as status because I can still ask people in queue to cancel queue while in champ select is in champ select, they can't dodge.\n\nRight now In queue, In champ select and In game are using the same indicator, what I'm saying is there should be an extra indicator to tell someone is specifically \"In Queue\" so that they stand out from people who are actually In champ select or In game already and I can ask to join.\n\nOn a side note, there could be a more detailed version of the status bar just so that I can stalk my friends better, for example, \"In store\", \"Browsing News (pretty sure it's gonna be a thing yeah?), \"Editing Rune Pages\" etc., and just for privacy, you can turn \"advanced status\" off in setting so your status still shows like how things are on live.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mad Milliner","date":"2016-05-20T20:00:11.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it just looks better with the overall color scheme than yellow.

(i haven't been accepted yet, thats why im asking)\nbesides that i agree with you. it has been like this forever (at least since beginning of s3) and we are used to these indicators. imo the indicators should remain as they are now.\nif they want to change something with the indicators, i suggest they add a new status (which has been requested many times) \"don't invite me\" or \"don't want to play atm\" and give it the blue color.","replies":[{"poster":"Kouhey","date":"2016-05-19T18:14:02.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not hard to see, it looks more like indigo or whatever, point is they just remove the yellow one completely and add this blue one, which does the exact same thing as the old yellow one","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"yolabas","date":"2016-05-19T16:08:06.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like people currently use the \"away\" icon to show that they don't want to be invited to things. I don't know if color settings are the right way to go about it (because would you just have a different color for out of game? or for idle and in game? would the ingame color take precedence or the \"go away\" color?), but maybe there could be a \"do not disturb\" like skype where you can't get game invites or chats or some combination.","replies":[]}]}
