Only ranged champions are truly viable (Gnar, Jayce, Gangplank, Kennen).\r\n\r\nMany people have probably forgotten, but Doran&#039;s shield used to give 100 health instead of 80 and it used to give 10/5 regen instead of 6/5. I believe that if Doran&#039;s shield was buffed, we would see greater diversity in the top lane. Picks like Shen, Garen, Maokai, Singed, Mundo, Sion, Malphite could see much more play. \r\n\r\nThe biggest reason I don&#039;t build Doran&#039;s shield is because you can only buy 1 potion at the start. It simply isn&#039;t enough versus these oppressive ranged champions when you are playing a tank. Starting Doran&#039;s shield usually means you will run through your potion and be forced out of lane before the first cannon wave. As it stands, I would never build Doran&#039;s shield as my first item against a ranged champion, I would just buy corrupting potion every time.\r\n\r\nIdeas for buff:\r\n\r\n* Instead of only blocking 8 damage from single target spells, allow it to block 8 damage from AOE spells too (ie Gnar boomerang, Jayce Q)\r\n\r\n* Lower the cost to 400 from 450 (this would allow you to purchase 2 health potions at lvl 1)\r\n\r\n* Revert Doran&#039;s shield to 100 health and 10 per 5 health regen.\r\n\r\n* Buff the damage blocked from basic attacks if the basic attacks are ranged\r\n\r\n* Add a tiny thorn-mail like passive (3 damage returned to attacker per auto)\r\n\r\nNote: I am not suggesting all of these buffs, just maybe one of them. Doran&#039;s shield only needs a tiny buff to be viable and allow more tanks to be played without getting totally destroyed early in this meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Durfain","date":"2016-10-01T18:46:15.706+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doran's Shield is just in a really bad place right now. It's the only Doran's item that actually gets _worse_ with items since for some unfathomable reason Rito decided that the block damage should apply before armor reduction which means building armor devalues the item (why when the block mastery reduces it after armor.. makes zero sense). A simple fix would be to make it 400 gold so you can grab an extra potion and, perhaps, also boost the base health it gives.

It doesn't need a huge boost but 10 more HP, +50% HP5 regen instead of a flat 6 hp5 and some changes to the damage reduction will make the item scale a little better past early game (in other words once it damage taken is above 100 stronger for the damage reduction). Will likely be slightly weaker early for some champs for the health regen though.\n\nI don't want to see it made too strong since that would likely result in a must buy item that out class other options.

Provides some nice stats up front, but Id say its about the same as shield in terms of effectiveness at level 1.

A 4 item ADC would rather keep the D.Blade than sell for a Longsword. \n* {{item:1056}} is good. A nice chunk of AP to start out the game - more efficient than any other item in its price class at Level 1, and decent MP regen that stays useful until you finish a major mana item.\n* {{item:1083}} has the best regen until the first back, but at the expense of no extra health and quickly falling behind D.Blade after the first back.
