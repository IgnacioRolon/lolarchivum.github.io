Is it working as intended? When I hover over my rank, it tells me I have 10 days until decay. It has said 10 days for the last 2 days now and hasn't gone down. So my question is, is it actually stuck at 10 days, or have I already started running out of days and just don't know it yet? I don't want to get hit with a random 100 LP decay.\r\n\r\nAnother thing about it. If I go to my own profile, it says that I have 10 days until I decay. However, if I get on another account and click on my main's profile, it says that I have 0 days until decay.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-10T21:39:35.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the heads up on this!
