As a Singed main, I had been building it in 99% of my games for a year. It became a core item on Singed for me because it helped me defend my tower against champions that counter Singed (Jayce, Kennen, Teemo, Gnar, Rumble, etc.) Season 6 was brutal for Singed as we had Gangplank and Gnar come into the meta and then later in the season Jayce decided to make an entrance. Zz'rot was the only thing that kept Singed relevant during season 6. I used to place the portal behind my outer turret and I could base and make it back to lane right before the enemy minions reached my tower.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Zz&#039;rot received nerfs today. The voidlings lose health at a faster rate and thus, do not go as far. It seems like it goes only 33% as far as the old Zz&#039;rot? They do deal more damage to towers, but the range is so short that you have to place the Zz&#039;rot really close for them to even reach the tower. This leaves the Zz&#039;rot vulnerable for destruction because it is not under the safety of your own tower. I don&#039;t see myself building this item in every game now, but experimentation is required. I have played one game with it so far and the active had very low value.\n\nIt should have been nerfed, but maybe not so hard. Maybe a compromise could be that all of the lesser voidspawns keep the current health decay rate, but every 4th empowered voidspawn can have the old decay rate and thus go further. Anyone else have better ideas?\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}} \n\n{{champion:27}} {{summoner:6}} {{summoner:12}}","replies":[{"poster":"The 14th Angel","date":"2017-01-11T22:44:02.189+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i actually feel bad for you. like i never build it. but thats pretty harsh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kilanost","date":"2017-01-11T21:52:23.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may be wrong but what you're perceiving as a faster decay rate is actually decreased void spawn health across the board.

It allowed games to either stall out longer or end faster with an extra minion defending waves so the team could group while still providing gold to the player who is grouping, forcing objectives and jungle camp theft.\n\nIf a top laner goes bot or dragon/etc, the opposing top laner needs to respond and if they don't have a zz'rot 1st or cant get one because it compromises their build/etc and they possibly fall behind gold for failing to win a fight and lose objectives to a larger team grouped.\n\nI love the rot but at the same time. That item is aids on certain champs that work well with it. Take Udyr jungle, this items gives him insane speed near towers and a free gold with his Void minions killing minions while he ganks, then forcing an objective after a successful gank while also gaining gold from another lane as the minion delivers gold. An Udyr on a tower is not something to ignore, but the thing is you need so much cc and damage and even if you push him off a tower u just left cs to defend a tower and possibly didn't even kill him.","replies":[]}]}
