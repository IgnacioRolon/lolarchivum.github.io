Yes, he still wrecks and duels and splitpushes like he always has but his model just seems very lacking and out-of-date.\n\nI really hope Riot will consider giving Jax a VU soon because his in-game model clearly does not live up to the monster that is Jax. He is also my first main when I just started playing League. Still love Jax for what he is, though!\n\n\n{{item:3070}} {{champion:24}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Eatingwaffles","date":"2015-08-06T23:42:34.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree!","replies":[]}]}
