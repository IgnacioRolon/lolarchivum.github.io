Critical strikes are a way of amplifying AD and it is an interesting addition to any game. A lot of people want this changed because things that are luck-based should not be in a competitive game, and rightfully so.\n\nI know this proposal has been suggested before so don't credit me for it.\n\n**What if critical strike chance was changed into BONUS AD? ex. 20% crit chance -> 20% bonus AD; 35% crit chance -> 35% bonus AD. The bonuses are additive.**\n\n*I know 20% bonus AD sounds very high right off the bat because AP has Rabadon's Deathcap. But remember, AD has a crit chance variable which does 200% more damage on such critical hits.*\n\nFor example, Statikk Shiv currently grants 20% crit.\n\nIf you have 100 bonus AD, Statikk Shiv has a 20% chance to turn that 100 AD into 200 AD. In other words, you will be able to deal at least one critical strike per five autoattacks on average. \n\n100 (x4) + 200 (crit attack) = 600 damage **ON AVERAGE**\n\nObviously the problem here lies in the \"chance\" variable as one's damage total within those autoattacks can range from just 500 damage (no crits) to 1,000 damage (all crits) which is an incredible difference.\n\n\nWith the bonus AD suggestion, the 100 bonus AD turns into 120 AD permanently.\n\nEssentially, this change equates to the same amount of damage as the example above but it removes the RNG element to make for a more fair matchup.\n\n120 x (5 autoattacks) = 600 damage **guaranteed**\n\n\nFor crits, the bonus damage is certainly not guaranteed as it is based on RNG. The five auto attacks with 20% crit should, on average, net you 600 damage in total. \nWith the bonus AD, you will be dealing 600 damage no matter the circumstances and this completely eliminates the finger-crossing element that is RNG.\n\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-01-19T04:19:51.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There was someone who proposed stacking\nand its my favorite idea so far\n1% crit rate = 1 stack = 100 hits till you crit\n10% crit rate = 10 stacks 10 hits till you crit\n33% crit rate = 33 stacks= 4 hits till you crit, excess stacks carry over\n50% crit rate = 50 stacks= 2 hits till you crit\n\nand sounds alot less game breaking than your idea imo\nedit: \n>100 (x4) + 200 (crit attack) = 600 damage ON AVERAGE\n>120 x (5 autoattacks) = 600 damage guaranteed\n\nyeah in theory, that makes alot of sense but anything that's AD scaling will immediately be broken\nRight now, the only thing that crits... is mostly AA\n\ncuz some nerd.. is gonna calculate what AD you need approximately till its just more gold efficient to start stacking %AD items\nand you're gonna see crit Rivens with like 1000 fuqing AD and her 180% AoE EXECUTE NUKE scalings n shit.. oh dear god\nteam killer Riven\n\nand AP will be left in the dust \nZed is gonna dominate mid for sure","replies":[{"poster":"Orders","date":"2015-01-19T04:32:14.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LeagueSrsBsns,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8lvc891k,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-19T04:19:51.286+0000)\n>\n> There was someone who proposed stacking\n> and its my favorite idea so far\n> 1% crit rate = 1 stack = 100 hits till you crit\n> 10% crit rate = 10 stacks 10 hits till you crit\n> 33% crit rate = 33 stacks= 4 hits till you crit, excess stacks carry over\n> 50% crit rate = 50 stacks= 2 hits till you crit\n> \n> and sounds alot less game breaking than your idea imo\n\nThis was one of the other proposals that I saw and this one makes a lot of sense as well.
