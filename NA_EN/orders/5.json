I am thinking of using 9 scaling CDR glyphs so I get 15% CDR at level 18, which allows me to retain max CDR without going over the limit or anything.\n\nHowever, this means I miss out on Magic Resist glyphs which does make me consequently more squishy and easier to kill.\n\n\nThoughts?\n\nEDIT: Twin Shadows is a more gold-efficient alternative if I want that 10% CDR. I will miss the 120 AP from DFG though. ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"Done25","date":"2015-01-14T03:39:25.571+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could grab the Ghosts instead.
