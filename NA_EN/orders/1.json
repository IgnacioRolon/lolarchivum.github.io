This means that, upon activation, it grants true sight and slows the target immediately.\r\n\r\nOf course, the shield on Safeguard is pretty negligible early game so maybe they can buff the base stats a little bit and lower the cooldown but it does seem overkill to give him both a shield and lifesteal + spellvamp. IMO, it should be either or but certainly not both. Safeguard can grant either a shield or bonus Lifesteal + Spellvamp.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem I have with this idea is that his passive is dependent on him spamming spells and auto-attacking in between them. Each ability combo costs a total of 80 Energy (primary and secondary ability) with his passive giving back 30 + 30 Energy (due to double proc'ing). Currently, each combo costs only 20 Energy in total after using his passive.\r\n\r\nWith my proposal, the new Safeguard should cost the same amount of Energy but (Tempest + Cripple) should still cost 80 Energy.  This way, it can starve his energy usage slightly and this can be his balancing factor.\r\n\r\nPractically speaking, Safeguard will still only cost 20 Energy in total due to his passive.\r\nTempest + Cripple will cost 50 Energy after AA's from passive instead of costing only 20 Energy due to double proc from his passive.\r\n\r\nEither way, I am just throwing this idea out there. I have played Lee Sin a couple of times but definitely not enough to use him to his full potential.\r\n\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR: How would Lee Sin be if he did not have his secondary W (Iron Will) and Tempest + Cripple was combined into one spell?","replies":[]}
