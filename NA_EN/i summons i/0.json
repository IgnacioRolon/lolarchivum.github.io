When I swap champions with someone else, I sometimes gain the ability to use skins I don&#039;t own.  In a recent game, I swapped Corki for Lissandra with a teammate.  I was able to use the blade queen lissandra skin, even though I don&#039;t own it.  Not really sure how exactly it is reproduced.","replies":[{"poster":"LaoBushido","date":"2016-01-18T19:07:46.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a know bug that will be fixed in 6.2","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-20T00:30:11.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct!
