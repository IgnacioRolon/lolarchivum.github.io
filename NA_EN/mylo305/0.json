What do you mean by malfunctioning?  What is happening, what do you see, and are there errors?    Are you on the updated client?

I reinstalled it and it still wasn't working, it kept doing the same thing. So I did the instructions I just gave you, it seemed to work for my friend but now my client just wont start. But I wish you good luck, and I hope you find your answer.{{item:3073}} I'll just sit here and cry as I try to find mine. ","replies":[]}]}
