I was one of the stupid-crazy people that, just as I hit level 30, I jumped into rank. Not knowing all of the champions, having a very very small champion pool, didn&#039;t know proper warding, only was able to play ONE role (top) and a few more things. I undoubtedly ruined my win ratio and my rank (landed myself in bronze) :/\r\n\r\nBut let&#039;s move on. I decided that I should start fresh. Make a new account, rank with confidence, Have a higher win ratio, etc.\r\n\r\nBut here&#039;s my problem. I need runes and rune pages. I have 2 rune pages, (they&#039;re not full) I cannot afford the champions I play. How can I jump into rank without my champions? Without being able to change my runes around because I only have 2 rune pages? Without being able to afford runes on top of that..\r\n\r\nThese are the main champions I play\r\n{{champion:72}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:35}} \r\n\r\nI main jungle and top [mostly jungle] and my 2nd account is already level 30. \r\n\r\nThere&#039;s no way I&#039;m suppose to be able to get runes, rune pages, and the champions I play. What am I to do?? Keep playing on the account daily and wait until mid-season 7 just to be able to play on it?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-29T19:44:56.049+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What else would you expect to do?
