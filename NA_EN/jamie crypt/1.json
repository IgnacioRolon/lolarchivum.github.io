I go into settings and reset them but it won't let me input any new hotkeys. It's as though the keyboard isn't working, except I can type to teammates and do everything except use my hotkeys. It makes the game unplayable as I have to point and click each ability, summoner spell, and active item. I basically have to convince my team to surrender as soon as possible but often times they don't understand so we play a 20-30 minute game of pure agony as I die again and again but can't leave at the risk of getting a leaver penalty.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-05T00:09:34.030+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh lordt that must be incredibly frustrating.....\n\nMost of those config settings like hotkeys are saved server side so they might not be updating correctly for those random games. Since they didn't load correctly, the system won't let you reassign those hotkeys in-game either. \n\nSince this is happening so randomly, it's rather hard to narrow down the main problem. Your config settings might not be saving correctly or have become corrupted. Let's try resetting those, and hit me back up if this ends up becoming a problem more often!\n\n\n_**Reset Config**_\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
