If we just get the standard 3 sentences for Bard, then he will have no character and just serves as a mechanics object instead of an actual person. \n\nIn my opinion the Voice/horn over is a failure because unlike other champions or even Rek'sai this leaves us with barely any insight into the character. We already have lots of champions whose mysteriousness serves as one of their main themes (Jax, Aatrox, Amumu, etc.)","replies":[{"poster":"OneMoreDaySK","date":"2015-02-25T14:36:38.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, I think the bigger problem is the lack of interaction between champs nowadays and the stagnancy of the narrative.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Overfeels","date":"2015-02-26T16:40:10.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Male Sona","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baron Von Bangin","date":"2015-02-25T03:53:08.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Wow, third thing in a row WITHOUT a real voice over, Rek'Sai, DJ Sona and Bard.

The various growls and sounds are each very different though so you can get some since of emotion from her.\n\nBard is what feels lazy to me. His VO is basically just his sound effects. Now because of the lack of lore the VO has been a necessary tool to get a hold of a champions personality but because of how Bard's VO is, that becomes impossible. We will probably only get a 3 sentence bio and without a VO Bard is basically limited to a game-play component who has no actual character.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-02-25T05:29:46.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.

Something we identified last year was that there was some cool stuff we could do with non verbal champions. Original plan was to space Rek'Sai and Bard out a bit so they weren't back to back, in part because of the lack of voice lines, these release times ended up being better for other reasons though.\"\n\n-cough-\n\nAlso, doing the audio like Bard's is *harder* to do than just recording dialogue from a sound perspective. You have to create it all, as opposed to adding layered effects on a person's voice.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Baron Von Bangin,realm=NA,application-id=aAJWt2b9,discussion-id=F1ZXb6oj,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-25T06:42:29.560+0000)\n>\n> Sorry, I think she says \"metronome\" somewhere in there.

I figure its just easier to use your already on staff sound guy over a professional voice actor.\n\nYou can understand French? Because none of the singing in Daft Punk's music is Thomas Bangalter or Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. It's either other musicians, or vocoders. That and maybe Sona's voice actress was unavailable to do recording for the new skin?","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Von Bangin","date":"2015-02-25T07:57:25.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fine. Meddler can say that Bard is the last champ for a \"little\" while that doesn't actually have a voice over.  That doesn't invalidate the fact that Riots past three major releases all lack a real, spoken voice over.  \n\nYou might wanna cover your mouth when you type the \"cough\" in.  Don't wanna spread your germs.\n\nAnd doing Bard's voice isn't any harder. In fact it's easier.  Riot has a sound guy/staff on salary already on working (I guarantee you Riot pays salary based on the hours a game company will have you working).  He's getting paid the same amount no matter what.  If Riot has to bring in Erik Braa to do Vek'koz's voice or whatever, they have to pay the actor PLUS the guy editing the voice.  But by having Bard just be a horn you only pay the sound staff to blow a horn and edit it, that way you get to cut out having to pay those pesky actors. \n\nAnd no. I don't understand French and I fail to see how that's relevant. Last time I checked Get Lucky, One More Time, \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\", Da Funk, Lose Yourself to Dance, Robot Rock, and Around the World (to name some of Daft Punks' more popular songs) all have *understandable* lyrics that go with their song, it doesn't matter if it's Thomas Bangalter or Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, there's stil la  voice in their song that *you can understand and it not gibberish*.  I would have been fine with almost anything for DJ Sona's voice over, provided it was *an actual voice over* and not just a bunch of noise.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"OneMoreDaySK","date":"2015-02-25T06:47:41.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I'm waiting for a skin that features him playing a Tsungi Horn.
