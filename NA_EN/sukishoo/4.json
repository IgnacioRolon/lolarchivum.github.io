But meh, maybe they have nice effects.\n\nZombie Nunu is nice, but I actually think that other champions deserve Halloween skins much more, for example... Bard and Kha'Zix.\n\nThe other two skins don't even look like Halloween skins. Not to mention, Jinx already got a skin not a long time ago, a Chinese New Year skin. Why does she needs to have another skin in less than one year?","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-10-13T20:21:08.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah she did get one at the start of the year, so having another one so fast is a bit of a surprise... though Ahri got one at the start of the year and then a little bit ago as well as the same with Karma getting one last year and now just recently.

Ahri already has seven skins as of now.\n\nI just hope that Jinx does not become another Ahri/Annie/Ezreal.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-10-13T20:28:04.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god...
