Recently my PBE account for some reason was disabled, yet I had only re-made it 3 months ago, and yes, I had rarely used it since then but I don't see why it'd be shut off (again). First time was after we'd been sent emails about all of them being shut down and having to link our accounts and what not.  This time it just seems random.\n\nI've never had to go through this kind of nonsense with other games from people like Blizzard. When an account was hacked for instance, they just re-enabled it easily after I had changed the passwords and explained that I'd never even used that part of the account before.\n\nBut here in league I have to give a life story of my accounts which include:\n\nAccount Username (what you log-in with):\nAccount Summoner name (your in game name):\nPlatform you play on (NA, EU West, EU Nordic &amp; East, OCE):\nOriginal email address used to register the account:\nCreation date of the account:\nLocation where the account was registered (City, Country):\nList of locations that you have played on this account (City and Country):\nYour current IP address (Use http://whatsmyip.net/ to find your IP address):\nFirst five champions ever purchased on this account:\nName any refunded champions or skins:\nDate of Birth:\nAny other people (including family members/friends) that have ever had access to the account:\nUsername and Server of all League of Legends accounts (s):\nHas your email account ever been compromised? If so, which email and when (MM/YY):\nWho made this account?\nWhen was the last time that you had access to the account (Month/Day/Year):\n\nHow is anyone supposed to remember 95% of this?  I started playing in season 2 and it's now season 7... So I have no idea about things like \"Creation date of the account\", \"List of locations that you have played on this account (City and Country):\" or \"First five champions ever purchased on this account\" since it was ages ago. People move around, since then I own every single champion currently in the game, ect -_-\n\nSo this seems like a very ridiculous hassle to have to go through.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-14T17:51:57.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our account recovery team will not grant access to an account unless they are absolutely sure it's going to the original owner.  The questions asked are there to help you as a supplement, and you can answer as much or as little you want.  If you don't make it through the first round, you can always try again.  Account security is important, and while it may be a hassle it's also in the best interest of the player.  Continue working with our account team, and they'll help as best they can!","replies":[{"poster":"YouStoleMyAcc","date":"2017-01-14T19:15:21.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do have a question thought Mr Porocles, Why does the players getting hacked need to validate the information while the players that hacked the account do not have to validate any infomation when changing the password/email? This is somehow a way to say that, hackers wont get caught, because they do not need anything to validate, they only need the password to access right..? Just making sure you get what im saying as I recently had the same exact issue.","replies":[]}]}]}
