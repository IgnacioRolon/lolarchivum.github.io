Seems like a get out of jail free card for those champs.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-14T23:00:01.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When Blitzcrank hooks and Ezreal performs Arcane Shift, a move block occurs, which means that Arcane Shift cancels out Blitzcrank's hook.   \n\nThis is something that's completely based off of timing, and isn't the easiest thing to execute, which is why it's not considered a get out of jail free card. \n\nThis also works when Morgana Black Shields the hook, or Sivir's Spell Shield. The hook is blocked by those abilities. This can be less based on timing, since the shields are up for a decent amount of time.\n\nTL;DR it's counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"RamBamThankUMaam","date":"2015-08-15T01:28:22.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"And yet Trist can be knocked out of Rocket Jump by a rammus powerballing 15 feet underneath her.","replies":[{"poster":"The Blue Rajah","date":"2015-08-15T09:46:13.127+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And she can be Rocket Grabbed by Blitz mid jump.

Either make it impossible to grab trist while she is rocket jumping or make it based on the actual animation. It shouldnt be based on some arbitrary timing, if the hook land it should pull... (also for those of you who dont know you still can hook a trist while she is rocket jumping as long as she doesn't pass the un-auto cast blue line, but blitz arm stretches a tad bit farther than the line suggest and if you hit her in that range it wont pull)  Its not \"counter play\" its stupid luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"joebobby1412","date":"2015-08-14T21:42:47.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are some abilities that allow people to escape Blitz grab, however your example is a great introduction to the clusterfuck that is Tristana jump. The interactions between her jump and all manner of CC is pretty much random and you can never rely on anything hitting, or not hitting her. As far as I can tell from my experience playing against her, with her, as her, if she jumps immediately after being hit, she can escape it, but if she jumps immediately before being hit it will often cancel her jump. This doesn't hold for everything, but things like Warwick ult, Morgana snare, Blitz grab, etc. Seems like that's how it goes for the most part.","replies":[]}]}
