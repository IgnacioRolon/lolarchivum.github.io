With these adjustments, I warn that I may be biased in my Judgement as it has little to no evidence supporting these claims other than personal experience.\r\n\r\nHonoring\r\nWith more recent changes to the honor system, honoring has been exponentially difficult to obtain and the quantity of honoring is increasing difficult to make a convincing case as to why an individual deserves to review the commendment of others. With this, honoring has benefits and some drawbacks that I would appreciate feedback on. I&rsquo;ve created a basic matrix that differentiates my viewpoints.\r\n\r\nHonoring Benefits\r\n- the personalized experience grants players a statistic that is more tangabile than before. I&rsquo;ve been especially appreciative of this mechanic where I feel I&rsquo;ve helped.\r\n- honor is difficult to achieve, making it a feature that distinguished other players. It&rsquo;s a nice feeling to have felt that someone I never knew commended me for achievement or consideration.\r\n- honoring is a way that promotes players to be considerate and kind to others in a way that provides rewards. \r\n- the rewards are a relatively decent bonus to the leveling system in place. More opportunities for (legitimately) &ldquo;extra&rdquo; goodies is always appreciated.\r\n\r\nHonoring Drawbacks\r\n- a distinguished player is typically someone who does exceedingly well.\r\n- players who are less equipped to provide &ldquo;satisfactory&rdquo; KDA can still be kind, but receive nothing for it.\r\n- players will not usually be matched with similar amity attributed to their honor. No one is immune to the toxicity of certain players.\r\n- a person that does not regularly mute is less inclined to mute. This example of attitude attributes someone who attempts to remedy situations, but we as players rarelys see each other beyond the first game. Often this is seen as conflict and can be a detriment to the &ldquo;worthiness&rdquo; of honor.\r\n- one person can affect the &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; to a team who honors everyone. Whether a person decides to lay waste on others or perhaps the client glitches and doesn&rsquo;t allow them, the bonus is, regardless, lost.\r\n- the rewards are meager at best. The chance of a skin shard is not stated, making me feel as though that aspect was removed (or never existed for intermittent levels of honor?). Guaranteeing key fragments and a skin shard is helpful but not exclusive, which is an aspect of what I love about borders (I&rsquo;m a collector)\r\n\r\nReporting Benefits\r\n- instant feedback provides the feeling I most attribute to the idea of &ldquo;Katharsis&rdquo; which.. in a way is subtle revenge.\r\n- it allows the opportunity for players to provide quantifying feedback that reforms players in the masses\r\n- players recieving reports are mandated to a form of cool-down, which I theory dispels the oddities of the &ldquo;salt&rdquo; cliche that perhaps a normal person might feel. We all have bad games and I understand\r\n- players can no longer be on probation for being &ldquo;bad.&rdquo; The ranks speak for itself\r\n\r\nReporting drawbacks\r\n- the system can easily be abused from coordinated teams and individuals, tainting conversation. For example, Person A might say &ldquo;Dammit I suck&rdquo; and person B might perceive that as &ldquo;negative attitude/giving up the game&rdquo; and says &ldquo;reported.&rdquo; The mentality, seeing those words is arguably more painful than the rant that may come after.\r\n- the person who takes the time to represent qualifying data as an individual in underrepesented. The ideology of &ldquo;Kartharsis&rdquo; as mentioned above, does not exist for a player providing quality, and general improvement. I personally do not feel good coming out of a game I tried to improve. For this, I truly believe this aspect is underrepresented.\r\n- players who actively, intentionally chooses to neglect an asset but tries in all other aspects cannot be reported. There&rsquo;s no qualifying method to this dynamic currently built in the game to handle this. \r\n- successfully handled reports to not affect the outcome. If it is clear that this was a determinant and a detriment to the game, there&rsquo;s no method to repairing the damage done. No matter how many times people rage and leave, I have lost just as much in the asset of time and LP had I lost a fair game. I feel this is a huge determinant of why I&rsquo;ve been losing lately, as others will try and tear you down for their own &ldquo;Katharsis&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;d like to commend Superleague for their strife to keep a positive community. In now a solid 3 years I have never met such a positive league community. The schools I attend are somewhat lacking in a gaming community in general and I applaud them for creating an experience unlike any before. I have met so many people in every game who are the exceptions to the majority of my experience in league, and I would admire hearing contructive feedback from the more open community, as lately I&rsquo;ve lost some faith in such.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-23T02:56:14.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a support, i am here to say i will never get an honor level no matter how well i do.\n\nAs for reports, there really should be more feedback to show people what is being done, and what matters.

Probably would have been better off a 4v5.\n\n>- players will not usually be matched with similar amity attributed to their honor.
