I presumed it was due to a Windows 10 update that I had recently installed but after uninstalling it, the problem still persists. The menu won't even recognize me pressing the buttons when I try to change the binding. I've also tried reinstalling League, Logitech drivers, and the W10 updates. Also ran Logitech software and League Client as admin and neither worked.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-13T04:17:51.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Most of the time these issues with not being able to keybind mouse buttons can be traced back to using the Windows Creator Update, so if you're still running that let's try reverting back to the normal Windows and see if that works. \n\nWith that being said, we are still working on making sure those keybinds work for all of our players. I don't have a timeline on it, but in the meantime make sure that you're trying to bind those mouse buttons through the in-game settings as opposed to the client settings. Go into a practice game, try changing those bindings, and let me know if that works!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Milutin","date":"2017-05-13T10:28:54.134+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You want me to revert back to the previous version of Windows only so I can bind 2 buttons?\nNo thank you.
