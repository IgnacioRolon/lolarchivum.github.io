When the skill hits it should check how much damage it does, and if the shield still has health, then set the cc to fail, else having the cc overpower the shield and apply the cc fully.\n\nthis would balance her so she either has to input points in it so that the shield cannot be broken and cc can get through, making the only champ with a lasting spell shield have some counterplay other than long cooldowns on the skill.\n\nNo?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nick Valentine","date":"2015-04-30T04:08:52.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana's E has been bugged lately and I found her not being able to avoid silences either","replies":[]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-04-30T03:33:37.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe Thresh had high AP?\nDo you have a match history?","replies":[]}]}
