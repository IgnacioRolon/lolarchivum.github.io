TLDR I installed a scripting software (dont remember name i deleted history and downloaded file) i opened it and then immediately uninstalled, like 5 seconds later. Never got into a game, never actually opened the script like loaded something, but I am still extremely worried since my brothers were shouting at me how they're going to get banned as well if I get banned for \"scripting\" Please only people of knowledge of this topic respond I'm actually more worried about my brothers' accounts we play on the same pc :( Lol is a big deal for them","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-24T04:54:22.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as they are completely removed and you aren't playing with any third-party programs installed, you should be alright.","replies":[]},{"poster":"homohoved","date":"2018-01-23T15:18:31.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the way, I'm never going to ever attempt or even think about doing something like that.","replies":[]}]}
