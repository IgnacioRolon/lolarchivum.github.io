I mean, this would create unbalanced games as well ; if not more unbalanced.

Just think about it. The majority are bronze and low silver players. WHile gold are only 30% therefore I can only imagine plat has to be far less","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ratcat","date":"2015-08-16T13:24:22.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2015-08-16T11:37:51.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only play norms.
