Screenshot here: https://imgur.com/a/StL4k\r\n\r\nI can see in chat that other players join the lobby, and then left the lobby, while my screen stays stuck on the timer going to 0, and no buttons showing up.\r\n\r\nI've been experiencing this bug persistently, even after repatching, re-installing etc. Help?\r\n\r\nThe only mode I've been able to play is ARAM because it doesn't require pressing a button to ban or select a champion. The rest of the game works flawlessly with no lag, so seems to only be a bug with champion select screen.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-18T03:18:59.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't seem like this is an issue with your version of the client since those ARAM matches are able to go through just fine.
