What is the point of playing Mundo over Garen now? \r\n\r\nMundo get's counter by Grevious wound when he ults which makes his ult worthless now in top lane and all his ability cost health. Why does Garen of all champion regain more HP and faster then Mundo when {{champion:36}} has a pure crap version of Garen Ability to regain health over time and especially when his ability cost health? \r\n\r\n?? Is your balance team going to do what they are best at which is throw champion they gutted or forget about in favor of other champion who get the lime light?","replies":[{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2019-10-13T06:43:11.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen has always had that passive, and Mundo's passive has always been a much less noticeable or impactful Garen passive.

This poke is difficult to dodge and also applies a slow that guarantees subsequent hits.\n\nMundo's ult regenerates an _offensive_ amount of health, and it is balanced around the enemy team applying Grievous Wounds to him at all times, ever since that absurd buff in 8.9. If his enemies fail to do that, he is basically not killable, by design.","replies":[]}]}
