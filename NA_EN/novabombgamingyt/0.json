Then one of the players on the other team waited until literally 0 seconds to ban. I was first to ban on my team, and when the screen popped up, I had about 3 seconds to ban. I had to click a random champion and spam the ban button and hope for the best. But, sadly I was banned from the queue for 6 minutes. So my ultimate question is, will this count towards me being permanently banned?","replies":[{"poster":"RocketRelm","date":"2017-01-13T16:38:14.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He could just be using the New Client. The new client (at least when I played it) had such connectivity issues that I literally could not choose champion, or pick runes/masteries. I thankfully tested out on an ARAM so I still got into the game, but these problems only arose when I wasn't on the Legacy Client (which I switched back to and have stayed on since).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-13T05:39:56.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, that's just a *queue dodge* sort of low-priority queue.
