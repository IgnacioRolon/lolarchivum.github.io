Mostly though: watch how excellent players position, when &amp; where they ward, and how they encourage their teammates.\n\nIf you mean how do you boost your MMR to above your actual skill level---you really don't want to do this.  What that would do is constantly put your team a a significant skill disadvantage to your opponents until your MMR came back down to your skill.  So you would just lose a lot of games in a row.\n\nIf you mean how do you improve you ELO (your ranked ranking), find one champion you don't mind playing a lot who is almost never banned, and play that champ exclusively, switching to one or two other champs as needed.  Any champ you put in an extra 100 games with will be significantly higher skill than your other champs, and using that one exclusively you can slowly gain ranks.  Effectively that divorces your skill with that champ from your general play skill, and you get to keep the resulting ELO.  \n\nBut my real advice: play to have fun.  Don't worry about your ELO or MMR.  There are trolls and ragers in every division--as well as great teammates.  Just have fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Nochebr","date":"2017-01-09T07:56:35.089+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"good god dude. you dont know what mmr is. very annoying and useless comment","replies":[{"poster":"EMeta","date":"2017-01-10T05:10:32.534+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"MMR is what Riot's system thinks your skill level is.  No more, no less.  If you've played several dozen games in a particular mode, it's probably fairly close.  Asking how to increase that without instead of just asking how to improve your skill is a strange request, which is why I gave several possible answers.  \n\nIt's not a terrible idea to play with a friend who is better than you.  That's a great way to learn, &amp; avoids the frustrations (and low learning potential) of being the best player on a team, which would of course otherwise happen ~20% of the time.  The primary thing this changes is your skill, which then leads to a change in your MMR.  Trying to go the other way around is either nonsensical or self-defeating.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2017-01-09T01:12:21.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Winning and playing well.\n\nThat's about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2017-01-09T01:05:43.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"win games","replies":[]},{"poster":"Octavia","date":"2017-01-09T00:46:27.126+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"play better","replies":[]}]}
