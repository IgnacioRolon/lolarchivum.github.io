I can kinda feel the aa blocking as ok... but does it really make sense that some wind will block a giant tidal wave, and like every skill shot in the game???\n\nIf we could change wind wall to just block aa, then ok maybe yasuo is then a balanced champion.\n\nI could even live with malphite and zac just giving him faceroll ultimates on all 5 of ur team if u were foolish enough to clump up, as long as ashe could hit him with an arrow, or he couldn't block the entire reason miss fortune is a viable adc in solo q with a basic ability... he could at knock her up to end the channel anyway, that would be fair. Her ultimate is difficult enough to setup against a non-brain dead team comp, ya know? \n\nSo like let yasuo build tanky with lifesteal, let him have 100% crit with 2 items, let him block basic range aa with windwall, but change windwall so it doesn't block ultimate abilities like nami's wave and then he is close to a balanced champ imo.","replies":[{"poster":"CrimsonDawn77","date":"2017-01-06T18:08:34.999+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.

If you're playing Vayne, Zyra's immensely oppressive poke, zoning and damage seems totally unfair. \nThe problem with Yasuo is he's immensely overloaded and does double crit broken damage. That makes him so dominant at lower elo. Look at what Apdo said about Yasuo. He said that Yasuo doesn't seem as good at higher elo because higher elo players are very good at punishing small mistakes which hurts as Yasuo is squishy, and also high elo Yas players still don't have enough self-control and judgement so they end up going too ham and getting shut down. But some pro players and one tricks can actually fully utilize his op damage and overloaded abilities to make him truly overpowered. \nHe was an intrinsically broken champ; idk if he still is that bad or not, as Apdo said that in S6.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CrimsonDawn77","date":"2017-01-06T18:50:28.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep. and I'm not saying that Janna needs a rework, that was just an example.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"khorney","date":"2017-01-06T17:51:38.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"somehow it doesnt block lux ult","replies":[{"poster":"Nochebr","date":"2017-01-06T17:57:07.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yes, it definitely makes sense that wind can't block something as potent as a laser :)","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-01-06T18:20:58.629+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like Blumpkin mentioneed, Lux's ult isn't a projectile.

On the back-end, split Nami's ult into several separate segments (5-7?), so instead of one really wide segment, you have several narrow ones running in parallel. This way, the wind wall (or Braum's wall) could block part of her ult, while the rest of it continues past. \n\n2. Shorten the duration of wind wall. 3.75 seconds is a long time to have to hold your ult simply because wind wall exists in the general area you want to cast the ult. What's worse is that wind wall feels like it lasts slightly longer, because it still blocks stuff while it fades away. If any little bit of it still exists, it'll stop her entire ult. If wind wall only lasted 2 seconds, or even less, it'd feel more like the Yasuo has to choose what specific incoming spell he wants to prioritize blocking, rather than being able to just put it up during the fight and having a safe space to stand where he can't get hit by much. Like, Fiora's Riposte is a much better implementation of a blocking sort of spell in this regard.","replies":[{"poster":"Nochebr","date":"2017-01-06T18:11:15.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i definitely agree with #2. That could be a smart and fair nerf. \n\nAs for #1, I think it would be cool to see nami's wave actually behave like water and split apart over terrain and a wind wall or braums shield, but maybe that would be kinda broken and I don't think Riot would do it just for the sake of nami, especially since shes already a pretty good champ anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2017-01-06T18:18:34.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've felt like they should hit his wind wall's duration for a long time now. Also reduces the time he can stand inside of it and be basically invulnerable to most spell and ranged autos during laning. I'm fine with the wind wall blocking ults in general, just would rather it be more of a point of skill and timing to select what to block than simply sticking a wall up and being safe for nearly 4 seconds.\n\nBut #1 doesn't actually feel too far-fetched to me, even if Nami is already in a decent spot. I wouldn't go so far as having it interact with the terrain, though that'd be awesome. But all you have to do is experience the very edge of Nami's ult clipping wind wall and suddenly disappearing to see that there's an inherent problem with this interaction as it is. It may not be a huge problem now, but I'd almost say it's a must-change if they decide to put a similar blocking ability on even just one more new champion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"sit kid","date":"2017-01-06T17:59:57.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"or just wait till its gone?\n\nIts litterally the only defence he has to not get blown up","replies":[{"poster":"Nochebr","date":"2017-01-06T18:04:45.463+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"well he does have a shield, a viable tanky build, dashes to easily dodge projectiles, tons of damage to one-two shot carries... you know Riot is planning on nerfing him in some way anyways(they have said posted this publicly they want to focus on him and other unbalanced champs in 7.2), so I say change his windwall to not block ultimate projectiles(it can still block other skill shots like lux q) and see if that balances him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2017-01-06T19:10:05.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey call me a yasuomain, but is it not dumb that ppl shoot like 30+ ultimate abilities against a thing that they know it will block them all?","replies":[{"poster":"CrimsonDawn77","date":"2017-01-06T19:19:14.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because some people do that doesn't mean its not a broken ability on Yas.

Also part of the problem is how reactive you can be with the windwall as it happens so quickly. That means you can pannic press it and it will save you. It also makes outplaying people with it very easy as you only have to predict incoming skillshots a tiny time before they happen. It doesn't require tons of prior thought.\nPlus there's the whole factor of a basic ability totally stopping an ultimate being kind of broken.
