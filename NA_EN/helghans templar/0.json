I'm not sure if riot can fix selective exp gain like this but if they can,  should they? Honestly its not the biggest wrench in the bucket for exp gain but every bit helps right?\r\n {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Overlord Forneus","date":"2019-10-09T20:34:10.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How about no, TFT (Team Fight Tactics) is not League proper (Summoners Rift, All Random All Mid, Rotating Game Mode). And in my honest opinion I would like the full removal and segregation of TFT from the League of Legends launcher. I'm fine with TFT existing, but I'm not fine with it being a part of the same launcher.","replies":[{"poster":"Aatrox Eichmann","date":"2019-10-10T01:15:58.187+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TFT will never be separate unless something big happens like a mobile port.\n\nTFT alone has brought in a 35% increase in asian LoL participation. This makes it a perfect window for riot to introduce their core game, 5v5 Summoners Rift to the autochess audience.\n\nAnd addressing the post, yes, i think post 30 exp is a good thing but it needs to be heavily limited to the point where its ~1/3 to ~1/2 of a norms game, since exp in league is calculated from how long the game went, and did you win or not.  TFT gained level experience should not affect those pre summoner lvl30 because it would allow them to jump straight into regular 5v5 ranked","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tailypo","date":"2019-10-10T01:51:01.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe they've already said that they aren't going to have TFT awarding the usual xp.
