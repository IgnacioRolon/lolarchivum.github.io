If so, I recommend changing it to English to see if this is resolved by that change. We've been seeing this happen to some players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-01T00:48:08.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen a few reports on this, and it looks to be isolated to the updated client.  Report this over to the client devs at the[ client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards.  In the meantime, see if your crafting materials are showing up in the legacy client:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
