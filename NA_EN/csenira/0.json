And that&#039;s not everything: \nafter 10 minutes i disconnected.\nAfter I reconnected, everything was still fine: I went into my jungle and farmed to close the gap in levels.\n\nBut I realized, that my ping went crazy, when there were more than one enemy champ in my screen + I had FPS-drops.\nI decided to do my best for my team, even in that situation.\n\nFor the rest of the game i depushed every pushing lane and planted my shrooms around important objectives (baron + drake for example)\nI could even stop solo splitpushes of the enemy team.\n\nBecause I coudn&#039;t join teamfight because of the lags and fps-drops, my team started to flame me and called me a troll.\n(even though the enemy team had a Bard, who fought several times alone against baron)\nI can understand their frustration but the reason for the frustration was the throw of our team.\n(one reason was me, another reason was the yasuo, who got cocky and soraka got lags)\n\nAfter the game I got disconnected from chat and I got the message &#039;you have been banned for intentional feeding (14-days)&#039;\nAnd here is the problem: The reason for the ban was the Teemo game.
