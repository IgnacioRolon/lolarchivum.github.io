Then the client says there is a problem with my installation and runs a full repair which takes around 5-10 minutes.  It is very frustrating to play with as it has happened so many times and I have lost LP in ranked games due to this.  Not only this but now I have been punished by riot with Low Priority queue due to too many games left.  I understand the reason I would be put in low priority since having to remake a game takes time out of others day.  But I hardly find League of Legends worth the time to play because this new client has way too many bugs to be live.  I have tried to repair my client multiple times with no progress.  The bugsplat does not happen every game.  It is very hard to reproduce.  Can anyone help me solve this issue so I can just go back to playing the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-09T04:01:42.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whenever you see those bugsplats, it's Leagues way of letting you know something when wrong between your hardware/software and the game really doesn't know what caused it. It's essentially a generic error message to let you know something on your pc is definitely not interacting correctly with League. \n\nThere's a number of different things that can cause those bugsplats, so let's make sure to go over each step in this [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974).
