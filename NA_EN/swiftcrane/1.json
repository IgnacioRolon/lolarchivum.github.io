(and a few other midlaners)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No matter what champion I play, whenever I&#039;m faced with Ahri, Zed or Fizz, I just lose lane. Simple as that, I can&#039;t recall a single game where I&#039;ve won a lane against a zed or a fizz where they didn&#039;t go afk. Ahri is a bit less of a problem but I still rarely win lane vs her. (Keep in mind I don&#039;t want to win lane I want to at least go even which I can&#039;t ever do)\r\n\r\nI have tried playing xerath, azir, diana, karthus, kayle, zilean, Leblanc and chogath mid and the same thing happens every time. They just have too much burst potential which I cannot seem to counter. \r\n\r\nAhri - I can be dodging her stun the entire laning phase and then make one mistake and get hit by a guaranteed kill combo that can kill me 100 to 0 under tower. Meanwhile no matter what I do to her she always has her ult to disengage whenever needed. I can kind of try to farm under tower against her, but I can never seem to properly win lane against her. If I sit under tower she roams and I spam MIA pings but its silver so my team ignores it and pushes their lane and dies. Either way she gets fed and becomes a really powerful lategame champion. I try to build MR against her like abyssal scepter but she always just seems to overpower it with damage. It seems better to just build damage and stay out of her range since I die guaranteed either way if I get stunned.\r\n\r\nZed - His clone and blade combo do too much damage to me, no matter how much I try to dodge I eventually get hit and lose up to 75% of my HP from just that combo. With his ult invulnerability + damage and TP to clone ability he can dive me under tower even if I&#039;m somehow ahead and get out without taking any damage. I build zhonyas and tabi against him and try to play as safe as possible, but because of his mobility and instakill potential he&#039;s so hard to punish. I stay under tower - he CSs for free while denying my cs with his insane bursty poke and eventually dives me under tower. I try to fight him he just dashes away or just straight up 100-0s me with a couple AA and basic abilities.\r\n\r\nFizz - Possibly the worst offender. He has bleed, high aoe damage nuke + mobility + over walls jump + invulnerability/dodge anything ability, ANOTHER dash ability and on top of it a lock on high damage slowing AOE NUKE ult. I&#039;m not really sure what I can do here. I try to play safe, but he uses his stupid dash pole combo to jump on me and it usually just kills me with just that. I can usually dodge his ult, but of course my teammates can&#039;t. Anytime I;m under tower he can do pretty much the same thing except use the jump to get out. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately I can&#039;t ban all of these champions. So what should I do against them? Building MR or armor items seems worthless as unless I build frozen heart + thornmail, or GA + spirit visage they don&#039;t do anything against the champion and by the time I can afford those I&#039;m usually already dead. \r\n\r\nAny advice is appreciated as currently I feel like alt F4ing every game I&#039;m facing one of these champions.","replies":[{"poster":"OctoberIV","date":"2017-04-22T00:00:03.678+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SwiftCrane,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=j5LF81Hz,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-04-21T23:30:19.568+0000)\n>\n> Zed - His clone and blade combo do too much damage to me, no matter how much I try to dodge I eventually get hit and lose up to 75% of my HP from just that combo.

If you're playing someone who is ranged, levels 1-2 if he ever goes to melee the minions punish the fucking shit out of him for it.\n\n1. At 3 Zed's extremely predictable you know he's gonna try and WEQ so just try to play around and dodge it and once its down he's extremely vulnerable because 1-5 he completely revolves around his shadow which is 22 secs. Once this is down Zed is your bitch you have to punish him for this if you play like a complete bitch he is just gonna shove you in and roam or do it again under your tower then dive you.\n\n1. Armor Seals {{item:3191}} {{summoner:3}} {{item:3047}} Since you struggle with him so much these are essential. When using Zhonyas use when he's either untargetable because the Death Mark won't get applied on you or save it for the pop. Don't do the first one if he's fed though or else he's just gonna throw his W triple Q and you'll die anyways.\n\n1. Always make sure you have wards out to know where he roams and spam the shit out of your pings because chances are since you're silver 5 your teammates are never gonna look at the map.\n\n1. Don't flash while Zed is in the middle of his untargetability or he's gonna follow you and your flash will be wasted and you'll still die most likely.\n\n1. When Zed ults you he will **_ALWAYS_** appear behind you this where you need to learn how to time your CC to hit him out of it. This is the main reason why high elo's don't really give a shit about Zed and why he's decent up there. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBKH-2ihOXM\n\nHere you can see Faker times his charm perfectly and hits Zed the second he comes out of his ult. This is what you need to do everytime he dives you.\n\nLow elo's always panic when Zed gets near them and they throw their CC immediately Zed then proceeds to ult to dodge the CC and then they get deleted and then go for morello's anyways.\n\nAnd a side note don't play Xerath, Azir, or Karthus ever into Zed unless you're a complete god at them because Zed absolutely steam rolls them if you're not good enough. You said you play Diana and she does extremely well vs him due to her tankiness and burst.\n\nWith all of this being said if you still get raped by him then just go \n{{champion:127}} \n{{item:3191}} \n{{item:3047}}\n{{summoner:3}}  \n9x Armor Yellows \n9x Armor Blues\nAsk your top to pick Shen and your support to pick Lulu\n\nIf you still lose then you my friend are handicapped","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftCrane","date":"2017-04-22T01:58:25.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OctoberIV,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=j5LF81Hz,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-22T00:00:03.678+0000)\n>\n> 1.
