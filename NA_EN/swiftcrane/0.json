The framerate overall has dropped to unplayable, especially in teamfights. It's still fine on startup and during some laning but it eventually becomes very detrimental to gameplay.\r\n\r\nIt has also become clear that this isn't solved by any of the classic fixes like going through the fps troubleshooting or the hextech repair tool, or updating drivers, or reinstalling, turning off snowdown stuff... none of it works, the problem is somewhere in the preseason update.\r\n\r\nSo why was this thread unstickied? The problem is not solved as far as I'm aware and a lot of players are experiencing it.\r\n\r\nAre there ANY updates at all on the progress?\r\n\r\n I've been forced to not play my main Xerath because his skillshot oriented kit is difficult to pull off, and even more difficult to have fun with at low framerates for over a month now.\r\n\r\nAny updates would be greatly appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-21T02:08:42.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed myself that FPS thread was updated with 7.22 and 7.23, but it seemed like the issues persisted into 7.24 as well. Since that thread was specific to those patches, I think that's why it was taken down. \n\nSince it sounds like you've already tried most of the basic troubleshooting, go ahead and gather those game logs you can generate using the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and send them over to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They can sift through those logs to see exactly what's going wrong to cause those fps drops.","replies":[]}]}
