I've been working with Griftrix to determine what the heck's been going on with this guy! We've been [looking through this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvyNwzJ-SkU) as a reference point! \n\nGriftrix is way better at explaining this than I am, so I've kindly asked him to give a breakdown as to what's going on and what we've done to solve the issues we've found:\n\nHi!\n\nGriftrix here, lead animation programmer for LoL and tech lead of the Champion team, and guy who worked on Yasuo to help get his sword sheathing and other animations working well (from an technical non artistic standpoint). Katey pinged me this morning and I looked at that video over and over, as well as loading up both skins in our tools and in game with a frame by frame look, as well as looking at the actual animation files that they use. I'll break down some of the things I saw and let you know what's up.\n\nFirst thing, the snappyness of the Q animation. The base and skin are using the exact same animations here. I looked at the blend times, and they are using the exact same blend times. HOWEVER, the blend time from Idle1 and Idle2 didn't match for a few animations (including the Q). The blend time from Idle2 was .2 seconds into the Q, and .1 seconds from Idle1. The beginning of these idle animations will look REALLY similar, so I think the video just got unlucky and captured a blend out of Idle2 for PROJECT, and a blend out of Idle1 for base. In any case, I've gone and made the blend times match for both idle animations. This should fix up that problem and make it always super snappy.\n\nFor the auto attack timing. I dug into this one deep. They are using different animations for the auto attacks, but the hit frames look very very accurate on my machine. I tested with low and high attack speed, at normal play rate and slow motion. It is however true that the cadence of some of the animations are different in the PROJECT version. It was noted that the pre hit time has different timing for the sword, and this is just how the animations are created. The discrepancy in the hit frame in the video (when the damage happens) can be best explained by me as a latency issue. A change in latency would make the 2 skins appear to behave differently. The local player plays the animation on their computer, but the damage doesn't happen until the server sends the damage message, which is latency variable (ping). I also want to let everyone know that our animations DO NOT drive gameplay. The hit times of spells is totally in the spell properties, and have nothing to do with the animations. The animations just describe the gameplay. I also dug into the code and stepped through with the debugger to make sure that the spell has the right properties set for the auto attacks, and everything looks fine to me. I have not found a bug here yet, just different animations and likely latency changes when capturing.\n\nThe E dash animations. This part of the video is an incredibly unfortunate capture timing. The two skins do NOT have different dash animations. They are literally using the same animation files. In the video, the base skin happens to be sheathing the sword when the dash happens, so you are seeing that upper body animation instead of the dash animation. This is a bug, and I've talked to the designer about fixing it. It should be fixed in the next patch, so thank you for the call out.\n\nTo be extra clear about about the damage being applied. I am sure the damage is being applied in the same way for the base and skins. The animations have nothing to do with the actual timing of things, but it is true that different animations can make things feel different without actually being different.\n\nThanks so much for the video. It was really useful.\n\n-Griftrix","replies":[{"poster":"No cute name","date":"2016-08-13T21:44:04.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I clearly understand that skins do not affect the background calculation at all. But I have to say that visual differences indeed have impact on players' operation. Take a punch as an example (with a little exaggeration) :\n\nGriftrix's Q spell \"give a punch\" needs 1 seconds to do dmg.\nWith no skin, Griftrix needs 0.7 s to raise your hand and 0.3 s to reach your enemy.\nYou played Griftrix a lot with no skin. Then you bought a Project skin.\nWith Project skin, Griftrix needs 0.3 s to raise your hand and 0.7 s to reach your enemy.\n\nyou are trying out the new project skin in normal. you are fighting a no-skin Grftrix. you press Q, 0.3 s past and Griftrix's fist is in the air. \nyour brain thinks the auto attack will hit the enemy after 0.3 s coz you were a no-skin player. So your brain sent a signal to your finger after 0.15 s, making it right click, since the singal needs 0.15 s to reach your finger from your brain.\nSo your Griftrix canceled the AA and moved a step because it actually needs another 0.4s for the AA to apply. \nIn the meantime, the enemy Griftrix noticed that your Griftrix has already raised his hand, since the preject fist will fly in the sky for 0.4 more seconds than the no-skin fist.\n\nYou lost the fight against no-skin Griftrix coz you cancled 1 of your AA and the enemy Griftrix flashed into the bush dodging 1 of your AA.\nI gave an example coz I no speak americano.\n\n_______________\np.s.\n1.  Cancel yasuo's Q auto smart cast plz. Or just make smart cast with indicator works with yasuo's Q and many other spells.\n\n2. Every indicator is inaccurate. Just add an option \"draw indicator with vector graphing\" plz.\n\n3. Make the client remember settings for each champion seperatly plz. Or just put smart cast wih indicator in the main hotkey page instead of in the secondary menus.\nThe problem is:\nI have to set smart cast with indicator for Zed's Q,  and regular smart cast for his WER. And make a mess in the secondary menus every time switching to another champions. The most complex one is Vladimir, smart cast on Q W, normal cast on E and smart cast with indicator on R!!!\n\n4. Some designers are taking the seriousness of this game to a new level. But as a very casual player I must tell you: my favorite mode 1v1 showdown disappered for 2 years.

I don't have an answer in regard to Blood Moon, but could poke around and ask. with them being different skins, it's entirely possible that one skin may have been given odds and ends in terms of particles that another one didn't. I believe the other argument there was that the particles may have been too noisy originally.
