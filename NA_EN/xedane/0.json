I was actually able to log back in and play some but still got penalized for \"afk behavior\" so I type this sitting in a low priority queue. I can't control god and the weather why am I being punished for shit that I have no control over? There has to be a better system to determine people who ACTUALLY rage-quit or leave the game just because versus someone who loses power without expecting it to happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-24T22:54:14.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just as you said, there's not a lot that can be done about \"acts of god\". Just as you couldn't prevent your system from crashing due to the storm, there's no way for us to know exactly why someone disconnected. Rage quitters are disconnected in the exact same way that power outages disconnect you. Essentially, the punishment was placed not because you left, but because your teammates were left to try and 4v5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"erotic thigh gap","date":"2017-07-24T21:04:31.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't have played during a massive storm.","replies":[]}]}
