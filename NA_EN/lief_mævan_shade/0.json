Who else wants this to happen? \r\n\r\nThe reason I want this to become reality is simple: I like sets. I like to go into games, with the same skin, and the same (or similarly themed) wards, and Summoner Icon.\r\n\r\nReally, it's all about looking professional WHILE SMASHING YOUR ENEMIES TO THE GROUND. \r\n\r\nOne more thing, and I'm sure people are tired of seeing it: PLEASE LET US ORGANIZE THE NEW RUNE PAGES. I WANT TO MOVE THEM AROUND, INSTEAD OF deleting all of them and then making new ones, just to get them in order.\r\n\r\nOkay, for sure the Rune Pages thingy will be fixed in upcoming patches. But I'm not sure about the Summoner's Icon. Please, I would like to change them because I don't really know who I want to play each time. I do like burst champions, and most of them have sets in Icons, Skins, and Wards.\r\n\r\nOkay, I don't really know how to end this, so here goes:\r\n\r\nThank you, and have a great day.\r\n\r\nLief Shade (It feels weird not putting my real name here, oh well. I don't want to end up dead in my bed yet, sooooo... BYE~)\r\n{{champion:131}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:56}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-15T05:18:14.308+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y'know, I'm honestly not sure that I've ever heard something like this suggested!
