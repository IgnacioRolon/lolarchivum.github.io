I've repeatedly been kicked out of the queue because someone didn't accept a match even though I did. There have also been several instances where I accept the match that popped up only to receive an error message, \"No active game found\" or \"unknown error.\" This morning, I've already spent an hour trying to get into game, been told I've declined the last several matches in a row (even though I accepted all of them), and asked to make sure that I'm available to play before entering the queue (I was; the queue is broken). I even made it into one game, but I kept receiving the \"No active game found\" error message in such rapid succession that I couldn't select my champion, masteries, or anything else so I ended up dodging . (this was the first time that had happened. Normally, if I can make it past the queue everything work fine from champion select on.)\r\n\r\nI don't have a clue what's causing this which makes me think it's an issue with the client or the server itself, but anyone has any ideas on setting I could change, either in league or on my computer, that might help, I'm all hears.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-23T16:24:18.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you join matchmaking and accept queue, the server needs to group everyone together and transfer you over to champion select.  It sounds like your network could be having an issue maintaining a connection for that to happen, and ending up with that error.  I suggest going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to strengthen your connection and get this resolved.  Hopefully, that will get you into the game!","replies":[]}]}
