In an interview with GameSpot, designer Ryan \"Morello\" Scott acknowledged the jungle's persistent problems and pointed to character tweaks as a possible solution.","url":"http://trib.al/yACRi8e","image":"http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--e03qEnT9--/mrpf4iopjl6wbsem25xu.jpg"},"up_votes":37,"down_votes":6,"body":"Now they are admitting their mistake, this is the first step in solving their messed up problem...now the second part is that they should  fucking fix it immediately .\r\nA quick reminder: “Jungler” is a unique position on a League of Legends team, one that puts the player in-between the map’s three main lanes that the four other players are assigned at the start of a match. Jungling therefore involves managing two different responsibilities simultaneously: killing a series of computer-controlled monsters in relative isolation (i.e., without the help of your teammates) and dropping in on any of the three lanes to assassinate opponents or help your teammates do so by “ganking” (think “gang kill”) enemies.\r\n\r\nGiven its specific requirements and its importance for the rest of the team, jungler is a tough position to play in League of Legends. The changes that Riot made in its recent 5.4 patch were unwelcome to many League fans because players felt they were making an already hard position even harder. The added difficulty in turn meant that only a small slice of the game’s wide array of colorful characters could even hope to perform adequately in the jungle.\r\n\r\nMany players didn’t appreciate the changes to League’s jungle, then, because they felt the adjustments limited the diversity in character selection—a big part of what makes the game so darn fun, seeing how it has more than 120 champions to choose from and play with. In his GameSpot interview (which followed a related talk he gave last week at the Game Developer’s Conference), Scott explained that the 5.4 changes were in fact designed to resolve a problem with the jungle—just not the one that many League fans might have been thinking of (emphasis mine):","replies":[{"poster":"Learn 2 Swim","date":"2015-03-10T21:38:39.092+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":5,"body":"**Riot admits they failed at the jungle changes because Lee Sin isn't #1 right now.**","replies":[{"poster":"DomainSpecific","date":"2015-03-10T23:11:17.618+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, Riot always cares too much about Lee Sin.\n\nHe seldom is #1.

Ive played her everywhere except for adc because thats just unreasonable. But I mean, you said it yourself. Champions who weren't designed for the jungle have a hard time jungling. That... kind of makes sense no? Playing a champ outside of their role they were designed for is going to have some SERIOUS drawbacks. It's the nature of having champs that specialize in things. Im in the mindset that having everyone able to jungle was kind of dumb. Sona should NOT be able to jungle, nor anivia, nor jayce and so on and so forth.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2015-03-12T06:16:27.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A) The reason most people don't clear well jungleing off meta champs is either because they try to do the same route the top junglers do or they are playing a champion that probably shouldn't be jungling in the first place.\n\nB) If anything the smite on a charge system has buffed the clear times of off meta junglers. Especially {{item:3713}} , this item basically lets any one jungle as long as you can survive the first clear which isn't terrible hard to do. Unless of course you try to start gromp or krugs when you really shouldn't.\n\nC) This is a problem with individual champions however riot made it so that even weak gankers can do well with {{item:3706}} .\n\nD) With Stalkers blade even champs with rough ganks can gank now. Champs with utility loaded kits are still going to gank better but now basically every champ can gank.\n\nSpending 10k on runes is not new. You have to do that for every role to play it optimally. However this is mitigated by the overlap of runes. However you do not by any means need any runes to jungle. It just makes it a lot easier.\n\nI personally haven't ever seen jungle malzahar but I imagine he clears quite well with his voidlings. You just probably can't start gromps or krugs. Yorick I know for a fact can still jungle and since he has pretty decent aoe and early damage I imagine he clears about the same as most. \n\nYou do know that the jungle grants massive exp for killing a jungle mob well under leveled. I have literally gained a level and a half off of red buff before. This makes it so jungle is literally the hardest lane to shut down. So yes you are correct that right now the jungle promotes early ganking but not because of bad exp in the jungle but because it is much easier to regain the levels lost spent ganking by clearing the jungle later.\n\nWhy are you playing a champion that require post 6 to gank well but has terrible clear speed? I mean lets be honest every season's jungle changes allow certain champions to clear faster or more efficiently then others however, just like every role, certain champions can perform better then others in that role. Malzahar is a better mid laner because of his amazing wave clear and how hard he scales on levels. You literally can do everything jungle malzahar can do but better from mid lane. So I honestly do not see the problem here. I mean having roles that specific types of champions are best at is good. it means that when the average player picks up x champion they know roughly what to do with them. Their is still room to experiment and right now basically every champion can jungle which lets people like you experiment if you so choose which is also important.\n\n20 champions is a lot and more diverse then most lanes. If we had 20 champions who work well in every role then we have 100 of the champions able to be played.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Daharahj","date":"2015-03-11T12:52:07.260+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Junglers shouldn't be able to gank lanes prior to five minutes at least, PERIOD.\n\nLee sin should get nerfed to unplayability until they can rework him, his kit has just too much of everything.","replies":[{"poster":"blubabby","date":"2015-03-11T15:58:30.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that Lee Sin is super versatile, but I'm not gonna comment on whether it's too much because I don't know enough to. \n\nAbout the former statement though, this point is... why?

Early pressure is all junglers are good for mostly (some outliers), what's inherently wrong with them applying this pressure this early? Because not every jungler has access to it? So what?

I'm still glad we went this direction in the jungle, but it just shows we have a lot more room to fix things. Our goal was to limit jungle early-game impact deciding lanes, which is not a popular view. But that's a good decision and I still believe in that. The problem is, we didn't return anything to the jungler. Like, a jungler scale. How do they perform well? If we say don't just dump on lanes and decide lines, what else are you giving us in return? And I think that's very valid. If you're going to remove our options, where's our new stuff?\n\n>And for several seasons, that continual reduction of jungler impact intentionally is geared towards trying to make the game something where lanes can have more of their own agency, and junglers have some impact but not the level of what we saw in season 2.\"\n\n>So, for one, I think that goal is correct. Two, I think we have not done a good job in providing new options and new depth and new ways to succeed in the jungle that are either exciting or understandable at all, or even available. Three, we missed one major thing that we planned on doing, and procedurally, I'm not actually sure why this happened, but it's something we'll have to talk about.\n\n>Lee Sin and Jarvan are still a problem. We can do anything we want to the jungle, and until we fix those champions, they're going to be a problem, which then limits additional diversity. Then we have a system that moves and does some different stuff -- how does that affect diversity? Well, some things we know and some things we don't. But the champions stay stable. So we can do anything we want to the jungle and you're going to pick Lee Sin almost every time unless we make it so that he can't jungle.\n\n>We have work to do on the champion side, so it's multifaceted. I think the complaints are very valid. I don't think the complaints are focused on the root cause of the problem, but that’s not the players' job so that's okay. What can we learn from that feedback is really the takeaway and what I’ve learned is that junglers are dissatisfied. Junglers aren't having a good time in the jungle and even if our original goal is good, it is not sufficient to just take that away. And there are additional champion problems that intersect with this and make it worse. That would be my takeaway from this.\n\nWell, that shuts me up.  I thought Lee Sin had been decidedly dethroned as king of the jungle.  Apparently Riot thinks he needs to be brought down another peg.  The question is, once they've done their testing on test servers, what is the next hit to be taken?","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Lasher","date":"2015-03-11T13:29:36.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why do you guys always have to pick on Lee Sin?

Blind dude, running around, shitting on people.  That's a problem man!  It's not like you can be pissed for him shitting on you.  He's blind, and what if you decide to try to fight back?  You're either the asshole who got beat up by a Blind Guy who just shit on you, or you're the asshole who beat up some poor blind guy with a Feces Problem...  It's lose lose for you man.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"killd0zer","date":"2015-03-10T21:42:24.251+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":">Kotaku\n\nignored","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-03-11T20:16:36.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr of my post: What are RIOT's values?
