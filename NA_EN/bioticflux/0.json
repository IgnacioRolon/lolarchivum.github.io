Firstly one of the main reasons I still play League is because of its lore, I love discovering more stuff about the universe of League, Runeterra and my favourite champions. That said, I&rsquo;m concerned/disappointed due to the following reasons:\r\n\r\n&bull;\tWhy not use different art styles? I enjoy experiencing stories in different art styles as well as mediums. It keeps things interesting and can change in accordance with the feel/message u want to deliver to the audience.\r\n\r\n&bull;\tI&rsquo;m glad u found a partner, but please do not aspire to be like them. U have your own style and universe that u have built from the ground up, and u have done a great job so far. I would like to see u keep evolving your own style instead of just copying the way Marvel has done things. I feel Riot&rsquo;s art, lore and music departments/teams are amazing and do not always get the credit they deserve. So please, do your own thing.\r\n\r\n&bull;\tMy main disappointment: Available for free only after **6 months after release???** One of the best feelings is getting home and knowing there is a new story about League waiting to be read. It&rsquo;s something I look forward to and enjoy up until the moment I finish the new story. Why not shorten the period to two months? Why not make it a week or two? I&rsquo;m sure u would still make a lot of money irrespective of whether the waiting period is 6 months, one or two months, or one or two weeks. The idea of being left out of the loop for 6 months because I can&rsquo;t afford to buy new pieces of League lore (I live in a 3rd world country with a weak exchange rate) just because I have to buy something that previously was for free&hellip; it really saddens me. So please do not take away or delay one of the best things about League of Legends for people like me; it won&rsquo;t be nice to be left out of the loop for that amount of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is just my opinion as someone who loves League and its universe.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-12-01T17:55:35.934+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"To ur last point.

I've also mentioned I think  Riot's lore teams don't always get the credit they deserve. My main problem is mostly the length of time it will take the comics to be released for free, but here's hoping they will be successful enough for the time it takes to decrease.\n\nHowever, do not confuse 'fan commitment' to the possibility or pursuit of profit. I think Riot saw an opportunity to make money, and they went for it. As they said they, and by extension Marvel, have to make a profit. I just hope the lore teams' creativity and quality don't suffer because of Marvel's standard practices and the terms of their agreement with Riot (e.g. being pressed to create more stories in shorter time frames). But I have high hopes this will be successful and that all us lore fans will be satisfied with the quality we have come to expect. :D\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2018-12-01T18:26:05.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Odin do you guys plan on giving Ashe an updated bio to reflect what happens in the comics, and would the comic take the place of a traditional color story since iirc an Ashe Color Story was accidentally mounted on the universe early","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-12-01T19:59:04.899+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.

As you mentioned, this has failed more times than anyone could ever count. Even Leagues lore team has been gutted once. In the history of gaming, outside in-game story content, I can't think of a single instance where this has succeeded. Make sure you keep your portfolio up to date and don't neglect any individual projects you may have going on, or that you have wanted to do.\n\nBest wishes, that's a really tough position to be in!","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-12-01T20:00:59.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again we have high confidence in this.\n\nWhen you read them you’ll see what we mean.\n\nWe believe, these aren’t just great video game comics.

(that I can enjoy until the comics' free release :D) \n\nThat said, here's hoping that u will be successful enough so that the release times/prices can go down; especially since I've always advocated for and tried to convince people (my friends who like league and even those who only like reading in the fantasy/sci-fi genre as a whole but who don't play video games) to read League's content.\n\nI just hope (and what I'm afraid of) your deal with Marvel doesn't influence or change your storytelling and the quality thereof to suit their \"preferences\", \"conditions\" or \"standard practices\" regarding the manner in which stories are created and told. I would still like to see u guys follow your own creativity and do your own thing :)\n\nI'll also be glad if u are rewarded for your good work (monetarily or through other means) since I've mentioned I think the lore teams don't always get the recognition they deserve.\n\nAnyway, keep up the good work!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[]}]}]}
