If ornn is the only champion I own, do I get a skin for him from the premium chest?","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-09-09T15:39:18.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You won't be able to get the Dark Star Orianna skin, but you'll likely get 1 of those other 3 from her assuming she's your only owned champion.","replies":[{"poster":"SevenFacedCat","date":"2017-09-09T15:45:04.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not the oriana though, I meant the new champion ornn.

You'd get a random one.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-09T16:15:12.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new player chest should offer content to forge Ashe and Garen.
