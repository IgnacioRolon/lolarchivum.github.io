Patch 7.24 gave Bard a slight buff to health regeneration, and base damage increase to his meeps! The buff is actually decent, because it increased meep base damage by 10!  This buff has only done more for his poke damage, which bard is incredibly great at IF PLAYED PROPERLY.  I am a notorious Bard main, and I have continued to master this champion.  This pre season, I hold a 60% win rate, whereas Bard has a 48% win rate globally! \r\n\r\nHow have I taken such a poor performing champion, that riot thinks needs buffs, and performed so incredibly well in comparison to others? \r\nI&#039;ve taken time to create this video for YOU, to show you exactly how I have maintained such a high win rate on Bard this pre season.  This is a runes reforged path to victory, which I have named &quot;Bad Guy Bard&quot;, in response to riot&#039;s &quot;Good guy bard path&quot;.  Do not miss this opportunity to learn how strong Bard can be, and how strong the rune&#039;s I take can be!\r\n\r\nIf you aren&#039;t learning, you are falling behind! Be the Legend you were born to be, by watching this video you will gain knowledge! After all, I made the video for YOU TO WATCH. Hope you enjoy it! If you did, be sure to like, subscribe &amp; share! I&#039;ll be making more content (videos) for our community! Without further or do, I present, Bad Guy Bard!   P.S PLEASE TAKE THE POLL ON THIS POST! THANK YOU.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FzsV7ZRgn8","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Calad","date":"2017-12-09T02:54:02.382+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool video!

HOWEVER, the cooldown on it is lengthy. Supports level slowly, and so the CD remains heavy all game long on it. Also, it only deals more damage then dark harvest early game. After -15 minutes harvest already should have more damage.","replies":[]}]}]}
