So just go in your league folder and launch the game from inside the folder. Or when you find the launcher in your league folder right click the launcher, Create shortcut then move the shortcut on your desktop. And Bam. Hope this helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-17T23:53:55.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue can be caused for a few reasons, the most common being a corrupted update.  It's not always the case though, as it could actually be a permissions problem with your PC that's blocking access to a game file.  Start out with our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to troubleshoot.
