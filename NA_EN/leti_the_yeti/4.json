He's just so tanky. Quinn has been a popular top lane champion because she can punish other top laners for farming. And,a s has been said, GP is another great top (Many top laners have CC, so his sweet, delicious oranges are amazing) due to his amazing farming potential.

She's VERY popular as a counterpick right now. The biggest thing to remember is that top is more about comfort and counterpicking than meta. A top laner needs to fit into the team comp while being able to survive the 1v1 they are stuck with for the first half of the game. By trying to pick \"meta\" you are just asking the enemy top laner to pick the \"meta counter\". Anything popular has a known and powerful counterplay for the most part with Quinn being at the top of that list.\n\nLearn to play a variety of champs that can fill many team comps because there is no one top laner that can simply wreck the game unless they get fed early. If you must choose your champion before the enemy then pick based on your team comp, otherwise pick based on the enemy top.

Like Quinn, people tend to lean very heavily toward champs that have a very good way to counter the enemy top lane. As first pick however... it's just all over the damn place. everything from Akali to Mundo to Quinn. The amount of viable top laners is ridiculous, just focus on learning your counter picks and team comps.\n\nAssassin tops aren't useful if you don't have a tank\nTanks aren't as important if your jungler is a tank main\nQuinn is easily countered if you pick her before the enemy top laner gets to pick.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Minrog","date":"2014-12-08T09:25:44.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mundo has been a meta pick in EU for years, not so much in NA though.\n\nMaokai, Shyvana, Trundle (counterpick), Irelia, Jax, Fiora.  Those are the ones I can think of that are top lane bruiser types from most to least tanky.

The end.\nBut, with respect to your question, I would suggest watching some pro streams or games to see what they play.\nI know Rumble is a consistent top pick, as well as Gragas and Nidalee. I have also seen quite a bit of Singed picks and Darius as well. There are just so many different play styles that it is hard to say what is a good meta pick. What you should try to do is really focus on your team's comp and see what they need. Does your team have a lot of squishies and need someone to soak up the damage? Better pick up a good tank that eats abilities for a snack. Or maybe you have a tanky support and jungle? Then you should probably pick someone that deals more damage, like a Teemo or Quinn. \nSo I would just suggest you try to base your pick off of your team comp, not off of the current meta picks. But that's just my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tehemai","date":"2014-12-07T09:12:10.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gnar if he gets past bans.","replies":[{"poster":"Krell356","date":"2014-12-07T09:27:05.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do I keep hearing this? I never EVER see gnar banned or picked. He is powerful when he goes in at the right time, but that just means the enemy backs off during that window of opportunity and punishes him when he goes in anyways. In fact Gnar was pretty much the reason quinn top became a thing. She was built to counter him perfectly when everyone first started playing him. in blind picks everyone started locking top quinn because everyone had picked up Gnar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2014-12-07T09:12:25.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, I've definitely never seen gnar or seen him banned in my ranked games either ;l","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tehemai","date":"2014-12-07T09:23:38.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strange, gnar is really ridiculously strong now.

Gangplank is also a fairly strong top lane with his insane early farming potential. Lastly if you don't mind a rough early game I've always been fond of Nasus and his late game carry when stacked up.","replies":[]}]}
